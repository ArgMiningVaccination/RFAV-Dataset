and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 1The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services has as its mission the improvement of access to health care andservices for underserved and vulnerable populations. HRSA accomplishes this mission bypartnering with community-based organizations in the delivery of health and social services,with academic health centers in the education of health professionals, and with State and localhealth departments in the areas of prevention, public health promotion and health care deliv-ery. Improved quality of care and quality of life are the goals of the programs and initiatives ofHRSA. To that end HRSA 's HIV/AIDS Bureau has embarked on the publication of A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS . Through the work of visionaries in the fields of HIV/AIDS and palliative care, we conclude thatexcellent HIV care can be provided by integrating the principles and framework of palliativecare into the delivery of care and services to people living with HIV/AIDS, throughout the con-tinuum of illness. This integration of services holds the promise of patient and family-centeredcare that is proactive in addressing the multitude of issues with which patients are challenged.With this volume we seek to expand the definition of palliative care and to realize palliativecare's full potential to improve the quality of care and the quality of life of those living with HIV/AIDS.The HIV/AIDS Bureau, through its Working Group on Palliative Care in HIV, has set forth thefollowing working definition: Palliative care is patient- and family-centered care. It optimizesquality of life by active anticipation, prevention, and treatment ofsuffering. It emphasizes use of an interdisciplinary team approachthroughout the continuum of illness, placing critical importanceon the building of respectful and trusting relationships. Palliativecare addresses physical, intellectual, emotional, social, and spiri-tual needs. It facilitates patient autonomy, access to information,and choice. 1 Palliative care is complementary care, not alternative care, and therefore should not be pro- vided only when disease-directed therapy fails or is unavailable. It is a mistake to adopt a pallia-tive perspective and approach only at the last stages of illness. One need only reflect on the painassociated with receiving a first HIV diagnosis or upon the psychological and spiritual sufferingJoseph F O'Neill, MD, MPH, and Magda Barini-Garc\u00eda, MD, to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 1: HIV and Palliativ e Care U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 2that are the substrates of substance abuse and other behaviors exposing individuals to HIV, to realize the importance of using palliative care principles at all points along the course of this illness. Providers should focus their attention on comfort, relief of suffering, and quality of life throughout the course of HIV disease. Palliative care in HIV must be able to adapt to the fluctuating yet ultimately downward course of HIV disease. The central role of medication adherence is not to be underestimated in stabilizingthe course of disease, but other factors can be equally important in optimizing clinical out-comes. These factors include a wide range of hard-to-control socioeconomic as well as personalcharacteristics: an understanding of the disease process; empowerment in relation to personalhealth; a safe place to live; freedom from pain and distressing symptoms; adequate nutrition; treatment for substance abuse, depression and other mental illness; hope; adequate help of friends, family and other caregivers, especially when functional status is diminished and diseaseprogression is ongoing. These challenges can be met successfully by using a palliative care frame-work to approach the patient, providers, caregivers, family, loved ones, and the health caresystem. This manual is organized to address the many aspects of palliative care that are key in caring for the person living with HIV and AIDS. A wealth of expertise and experience in the areas of HIVand palliative care has provided a unique document that expands the realms of both disciplines. Part I: Introduction Provides our vision for the use of the guide and presents an overview of the key issues in HIV/AIDS and palliative care today. Part II: Management of Advanced HIV Disease Addresses constitutional symptoms that cause much of the burden to patients in more advanced states of HIV disease. Special issues in thecare of children and adolescents are covered in a chapter in this section. Psychiatric and sub-stance use concerns are covered in this section as well. Part III: Psychosocial, Cultural and Ethical Issues Focuses on the many other dimensions included in the palliative care approach, incorporating spirituality, care for the caregiver, spe- cial populations, and ethical and legal considerations. A special section highlights palliativecare in resource-poor settings. Part IV: Care at the End of Life Emphasizes the explicit aspects of care that are paramount when it has become clear that the patient is nearing the end of life. This section includes chap-ters on communication, the transition to home and hospice care, and a special section on skinbreakdown. Part V: References for the Clinician Provides a resource appendix highlighting web sites and sources for further reading and reference tools, and a comprehensive chapter about the phar-macologic considerations in using both HIV-related and palliative medications. It is our sincere hope that you and your colleagues will find this guide useful as you integrate the principles and framework of palliative care into the practice of high quality HIV care.

However, even in the era of'highly active antiretroviral therapy' (HAART), AIDS remains an important cause of morbidityand mortality in many young adult populations, and attention to palliative and end of life issuesis an essential aspect of clinical care. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, clinicians had tolearn about palliative care by necessity, in the absence of any hope of curative therapy. With theadvent of antiretroviral therapy and the ability to control HIV disease progression, it remainsimportant to incorporate relevant aspects of palliative care in the comprehensive managementof patients with AIDS. Rather than being ' either-or ,' curative and palliative approaches to HIV care need to be ' both-and ,' and one paradigm need never fully substitute for the other. This chapter will outline some of the important clinical issues in HIV palliative care, many of whichwill be addressed in greater detail in subsequent chapters. EPIDEMIOLOGY Starting in the early 1980's, AIDS rapidly became the leading cause of death for young adults in the United States.1 With advances in AIDS care and HIV-specific therapy in the mid-1990's, mortality rates began to decline, and with the introduction of the protease inhibitors in 1996,the rates declined even more dramatically. 2-7 However, the decline in death rates has since plateaued, and there remain approximately 15,000 deaths per year from HIV/AIDS.4 While the number of deaths from AIDS dropped by 25% and 42% from the preceding years in 1996 and1997, respectively, these figures dropped to 17% and 8% for 1998 and 1999. 4,6 Moreover, the de- clines in death rates have not been uniform across all populations affected by HIV/AIDS, anddecreasing mortality has not been as pronounced among African-Americans and Latinos as ithas been among whites. 4,8 In addition, the incidence of new HIV infections is not believed to have decreased, and has remained stable at approximately 40,000 new cases per year.8 As a result of these trends, AIDS-related mortality continues to be an important phenomenon, andthe number of patients living with HIV (i.e., the prevalence of AIDS) has actually increased. 4,8 (Figure 2-1.)Peter A Selwyn, MD, MPH, and Mimi Rivard, ANP , MSNOverview of Clinical IssuesChapter 2.

Theimpact of disease-specific treatment on the natural history of HIV infection has now resulted ina much more variable trajectory of illness for many patients. For some, HAART has meant thepossibility of full return of function and health, with AIDS experienced as a chronic conditionthat has little impact on daily quality of life. For others, treatment has meant the 'conversion ofdeath to disability,' with the emergence of a chronic disease phase characterized by exacerba-tions, remissions, and eventual decline and death from the illness, 9 as the survival time from AIDS diagnosis to death has lengthened.10 Thus, over a remarkably short period of time, the historical evolution of HIV disease\u2014for which the rapid disease course from diagnosis to death once resembled that of untreatable fatal cancers\u2014has shifted to a trajectory more typical ofchronic, progressive illnesses such as congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease, or hepatic cirrhosis, with much more variability in outcomes. 11 (Figure 2-2.) Clinical assessment of prognosis and outcomes is thus much more complex than was previously the case. As AIDS-specific mortality has declined, surveillance data and clinical studies have indicated that mortality among patients with HIV has proportionally increased as a result of co-morbidi-ties such as hepatitis B and C, co-occurring malignancies (both AIDS-defining and non-AIDS- defining cancers), and substance abuse-related deaths. 9,12-16 In addition, for certain patients, even the benefit of HAART is not always attainable, due to lack of access to care, inability toadhere to effective treatment regimens, active substance use or other psychiatric illness, pro-gressive viral resistance despite therapy, serious other co-morbidities, or unmanageable drugtoxicities. For all these reasons, comprehensive AIDS care must continue to encompass end-of-life issues even as treatment continues to advance. Just as we must advocate for timely access toHAART for all patients, so too must we be ready to provide needed and appropriate palliativecare even after HAART is no longer a life-extending option. The need to incorporate both pallia-tive and curative approaches in HIV care is even more important than it was in the pre-HAARTera: the availability of treatment does not give clinicians the luxury of ignoring the importantissues posed by a chronic progressive illness and its management over time. 17 CENTRALITY OF PALLIATIVE CARE IN HIV CARE In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, a cohort of physicians and other care providers found themselves confronted with a disease that they could not understand, let alone cure. It was atime in which the narrow medical model of care\u2014isolating specific elements of disease andthen focusing on treating the pathology\u2014was totally inadequate in the face of the enormity ofthis disease and its effects on patients and their families. Paradoxically, it was a time in whichclinicians learned the importance of being present, of accompanying patients through illness and being with patients and families as they grappled with the critical issues of death and dying. Clinicians learned how to focus on the goals of care, helping to empower patients even in thecontext of a life-threatening illness and discussing treatment decisions in terms of quality of lifeand care preferences of patient and family, rather than making decisions for their patients (asoccurs with the more one-sided and hierarchical model that often predominates in the medicalencounter). When disease could not be prevented or even treated, it was important to providerelief by treating pain, other symptoms, and the overall suffering caused by progressive illness.Patients' needs were understood to be multi-dimensional\u2014medical, psychosocial, and spiri-tual\u2014and they needed to be addressed in a multi-disciplinary model of care that did justice tothe complexity of these needs, especially at the end of life. Families and significant others were Chpt 2 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 726 picasA Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 2: Overview of Clinical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 8 Figure 2-2: Trajectories of Illness over Time in Chronic, Fatal Diseases Functional Disability or Severity of Illness Cancer (or \"Pre-HAART\" AIDS) DeathCongestive Heart Failure(or AIDS inHAART era) Time Typical of untreatable cancers (e.g. pancreas) or AIDS before the advent of highly active antiretrovial therapy (HAART).

What is striking from this summary of salient clinical issues is that care for patients with AIDS in the pre-HAART era constituted comprehensive palliative care and that many of the elements of palliative care remain central to the routine care of patients with HIV even in the therapeutic era. Indeed, the widely used World Health Organization definition for palliative care serves as anappropriate and timely description of comprehensive care for patients with advanced HIV dis-ease: \"Palliative medicine is the study and management of patients with active, pro- gressive, far advanced disease for whom the prognosis is limited and the focus of care is the quality of life. [It is] the active total care of patients whose disease is not responsive to curative treatment. Control of pain, of other symptoms, and of psy- chological, social, and spiritual problems, is paramount. The goal of palliative care is achievement of the best quality of life for patients and their families.\" 18 What is also striking is the emergence of a new cohort of HIV care providers who did not live through that earlier era and who have learned about HIV care more within the therapeuticparadigm of HAART. Not surprisingly, this paradigm tends to be more strictly biomedical and less likely to incorporate end-of-life and palliative care issues since, thankfully, end-of-life issues are less inescapable than they previously had been. However, it is important to recognize thatthe curative vs. palliative dichotomy is a false one. HIV care has evolved over a short period oftime with the rapid development of disease-specific therapy, although the tension between pal-liative and curative approaches has always been present. Since the early 1980's there have beenseveral mini-'paradigm shifts' in which the hope of cure for AIDS or the reality of the limitationsof HIV therapy have led prematurely to extreme optimism or pessimism, respectively, as shownschematically in Figure 2-3. The overall direction has been toward more curative or disease-modifying therapy, but the curve has oscillated back and forth, and even after the heady opti-mism of the late 1990's following the introduction of the protease inhibitors, few if any research-ers are currently speculating about the likelihood of viral eradication or 'cure' for HIV infection. In fact, perhaps a more sober assessment would lead one to conclude that AIDS is a chronic, progressive disease that may be effectively managed in some patients but may still cause consid-erable morbidity and mortality in others. As such, while we eagerly embrace and seek to extendany benefits of HAART and other disease-specific therapies, we must also be prepared to antici-pate and address the important aspects of palliative and end-of-life care that many (if not all) ofour patients will be facing at some point during the course of their illness. Otherwise, we run therisk of isolating or unconsciously abandoning our patients when our therapies are no longereffective or of being ill-prepared to help and accompany them through the later stages of their disease. The more we focus on the therapy, the less we tend to focus on the patient. Indeed, some providers experience growing frustration with patients who do not adhere to HAART, andthe conflict over adherence may becomes the main platform for interaction - or avoidance -between provider and patient. This conflict can eventually become dysfunctional, especially forpatients who refuse therapy outright, which may threaten the basis of the relationship unless Chpt 2 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 926 picasA Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 2: Overview of Clinical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 10 Figure 2-3: Evolution of HIV Treatment Paradigms 1981 - 2001 Therapeutic ParadigmToxicity ResistanceCo-morbidities ?Berlin AIDSConferenceConcorde Trial Introduction of ProteaseInhibitors,AdditionalNRTI's/NNRTI's of AZT ACTG 076First AIDS Cases Reportedby CDCCurative Palliative 1981 1987 1993 1996 1997 1998 2000 2001 1999 1994 patient and provider can interact in ways that emphasize the totality of care and not merely adherence to recommended antiretroviral regimens. Rather than the false dichotomy of either curative or palliative care, this guide is suggesting that both approaches need to be considered throughout the course of HIV disease. This inte- grated approach is represented graphically in Figures 2-4a and 2-4b.

Thus, it is important to adopt anintegrated model, which allows both curative and palliative elements to be incorporated in thecomprehensive care of the patient. As will also be emphasized throughout this guide, this integrated model of care is most fully realized when it encompasses all the contributions of an interdisciplinary team. The key role ofthe clinical team becomes even more important as patients approach the end of life. Once pa-tients' physical comfort needs have been addressed, important emotional and spiritual workcan often be done. The team\u2014including members from medicine, nursing, social work, andpastoral care\u2014can become an integral part of the patient and family's support system through-out the death and dying process. Patients and families experience the totality of illness (withmedical, psychological, social, and spiritual dimensions), and the interdisciplinary team canbest implement a biopsychosocial approach to care, regardless of which needs are expressed atany given time. The complexity of AIDS in all these dimensions requires this type of comprehen- sive, collaborative, and multi-leveled response. For many clinicians involved in the first phase of the AIDS epidemic, it took a disease we could not cure to teach us the true meaning of healing. It is our hope that these lessons will not be lostas we strive to provide our patients with all the best that HIV therapy has to offer at the sametime as we seek to help them and their loved ones navigate the complex trajectory of this diseaseand its changing impact on their lives. PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT Since early in the epidemic, clinical studies have documented a high prevalence of pain and other symptoms in patients with AIDS.19-22 Pain in AIDS has been attributed variously to: 1. The effects of specific opportunistic infections (e.g., headache with cryptococcal meningi- tis, visceral abdominal pain with disseminated Mycobacterium Avium complex [MAC] infection) 2. The effects of HIV itself or the body's immune response to it (e.g., distal sensory polyneur- opathy, HIV-related myopathy) 3. The effects of medications used to treat HIV disease (e.g., dideoxynucleoside-related pe- ripheral neuropathy, zidovudine-related headache, protease inhibitor-related gastrointesti-nal distress) 4. The non-specific effects of chronic debilitating illness, along with other miscellaneous causes Chpt 2 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 1226 picas and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 2: Overview of Clinical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 13Some of these findings on pain are from the pre-HAART era, and certainly the contribution of specific opportunistic infections to pain syndromes and other symptoms in AIDS has diminishedover time as the incidence of such infections declined. However, it should be noted that in someinstances the incidence and/or prevalence of pain may have actually increased over time. As isoften the case with AIDS, the irony of decreased mortality rates is that by surviving longer somepatients may thus be vulnerable to new complications and pain, as in the observed increasingprevalence of peripheral neuropathy which occurred with longer survival according to the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study. 23 Further, in a recent example of the potential overlap of palliative and disease-specific therapies in AIDS, analysis of data from an ongoing observational cohort study found that the severity of HIV-related neuropathy was associated with plasma viral load levels - suggesting that antiretroviral therapy itself might in fact be useful for treating or pre-venting this painful syndrome. 24 In addition, while pain due to opportunistic infections may have diminished with the advent of HAART and more effective prophylactic regimens, the medica-tions themselves may cause pain and other symptoms, e.g. the antiretroviral side effects alludedto above, which may compromise effective treatment unless the symptoms are also effectivelypalliated. Despite the high prevalence of pain in AIDS, several studies have also demonstrated that pain in patients with AIDS is likely to be under-diagnosed and under-treated. 21,25 This failure to diag- nose and treat may reflect both the general under-recognition of pain by most physicians and/orthe additional reluctance to consider seriously any self-report of pain in patients with a historyof substance use problems. Moreover, recent reports have documented that non-white race/ethnicity may be a risk factor for inadequate analgesia in general in medical settings, and thateven the physical availability of narcotic pain medication may be limited in pharmacies servingpoor urban neighborhoods where HIV infection may also be concentrated. 26, 27 Regardless of the possible explanations for under-treatment of pain, the result is that patients with AIDS are at risk for significant pain and the resulting diminished quality of life\u2014an out- come which in most cases could be prevented with adequate pain assessment and management.As described in Chapters 4 (Pain) and 11 (Substance Use Problems), the science of pain man-agement has advanced considerably in recent years. It is now fully possible to assess and treatpain effectively in patients with AIDS, including substance users, using standard measurementtechniques, rational decisionmaking, evidence-based practice, and common sense. 28, 29 These pain management tools should be as much a part of the pharmaceutical inventory of HIV careproviders as antiretrovirals and prophylactic agents. In addition to pain, patients with AIDS have been found to have a high prevalence of other symptoms, particularly but not exclusively in the advanced stages of the disease. 30-38 Moreover, one recent study suggested that physicians frequently fail to identify and under-treat commonsymptoms reported by patients with AIDS. 35 Symptoms have included a mixture of physical and psychological conditions, such as fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, depression, agitation and anxiety,nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, cough, dyspnea, fever, sweats, pruritus, etc. Table 2-1 lists commonsymptoms in AIDS by organ system. Table 2-2 summarizes the findings of several key studiesthat have examined the symptom burden in patients with AIDS in different populations. It isstriking that these studies, conducted in the United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Italy, showeda remarkable consistency of symptoms across populations even with different selection criteria,different time periods, and varying methods for determining the prevalence of symptoms.

As with studies of the prevalence of pain, much of the observational knowledge re-garding symptom prevalence in AIDS was generated in the pre- or early HAART era, and thespecific effects of certain opportunistic infections may have diminished as these entities havebecome less common. 3, 7, 41 Nevertheless, the challenges of symptom management have also grown with several factors: 1. The prolongation of the chronic disease phase in some patients, with the resulting more protracted late-stage course described above, requiring more sustained attention to com-plex symptom management in chronically ill patients; 2. The recognition of the wide cumulative range of drug toxicities and symptomatic sequelae which occur in patients on long-term antiretroviral therapy; 3. The assessment of the contribution of drug toxicities vs. the underlying effects of disease progression, raising important clinical issues regarding the competing effectiveness andtoxicity of different therapeutic options (e.g., balancing short-term quality of life vs. long-term prolongation of life in a patient contemplating a potentially toxic antiretroviral regi-men, deciding whether disease-specific therapy may also in fact have a palliative impact onsymptoms in a given situation, etc.); 4. The emergence of co-existing co-morbid conditions that have complicated the management of patients with AIDS, including chronic viral hepatitis (especially but not limited to hepa-titis C), and chronic co-morbid psychiatric illness and substance abuse in patients withAIDS. 42-44 As with the management of pain, clinicians caring for patients with AIDS need to be familiarwith the science and practice of palliative medicine, which has emerged as a fast-growing spe-cialty receiving increased attention in the United States and elsewhere. Indeed, the UnitedStates is a relative newcomer to the field, with much of the scientific and professional contribu-tion to palliative medicine having emanated first from the United Kingdom and Canada. 29 The literature of palliative medicine has documented impressive advances in recent years in theelucidation of pathophysiology and treatment of many of the common symptom syndromes listedabove, such as nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, fatigue, and weight loss. 29, 45 Some of this work has included palliative care in the context of AIDS.46 Much recent work has also been done in the psychopharmacologic treatment of depression and anxiety and other psychiatric illness, includ-ing the treatment of such conditions at the end of life, 47 and many treatment options exist for these conditions as well. These options will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 5, Constitu- tional Symptoms, and Chapter 10, Psychiatric Problems, respectively. Although some complicated syndromes in symptom management, as in pain management, would benefit from the input of a palliative care specialist, in many cases primary HIV care providerscan identify and treat a wide range of AIDS-related symptoms using standard palliative medi-cine strategies that will both enhance patients' quality of life and also maximize the likelihoodof adherence to disease-specific therapy in cases in which this is still an option. Basic familiaritywith both realms of care should be part of the clinical repertoire of all AIDS care providers. As is Chpt 2 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 1626 picas and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 2: Overview of Clinical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 17now true for other areas of pharmacologic management in AIDS,48 clinicians also need to be aware of and anticipate possible drug-drug interactions between antiretrovirals and other AIDS-related medications and the medications commonly used in palliative care, including opioids,benzodiazepines, anti-convulsants, and sedative-hypnotics (see Chapter 27 for more informa-tion on drug interactions). As was noted in an editorial in the journal Pain in 1986: \"Up to the 19 th century, most medical care related to the amelioration of symptoms while the natural history of the disease took its course toward recovery or death. By 1900, doctors and patients alike had turned to a search for root cause and ultimate cure. In the course of this new direction, symptoms were placed on one side as sign posts along a highway, which was being driven toward the intended destination. Therapy directed at the signposts was denigrated and dismissed as merely symptomatic...[Yet] the immediate origins of misery and suffering need immediate attention while the long-term search for basic cure proceeds. The old methods of care and caring had to be rediscovered and the best of modern medi- cine has to be turned to the task of new study and therapy specifically directed at pain.\" 49 The same combined strategy is no less relevant to HIV care than to medical care in general. STRATEGIES AND GOALS OF CARE As defined above, palliative medicine seeks to provide the best quality of life for patients and families using a model in which the goals of care are collaboratively developed with care provid- ers according to the wishes of patients and families. This model emphasizes communication,collaboration, and the willingness to accept patient-focused outcomes as paramount and to re-spect patients' wishes regarding such important issues as quality of life or cessation of therapy.Table 2-3 summarizes some of the key aspects of the philosophy of palliative medicine. 50 This palliative philosophy comes from a model of care that is distinctly different from the familiar,hierarchical, and physician-dominated model that characterizes much of contemporary medi-cal care, especially for diseases that have potentially effective therapies. The more collaborative palliative approach\u2014one in which uncertainty is shared, in which pa- tients and their care providers work through difficult decisions with an ultimate inability tocontrol the outcome, and in which there are many ambiguities and nuances and no clear 'rightanswer'\u2014was one that defined much of AIDS care in the pre-HAART era. In this environment,clinicians learned to work together with patients and families to clarify goals of care, to deter-mine the important issues related to quality of life and the end of life, and to be comfortablehelping patients and families negotiate the complexities of progressive, incurable illness. With the arrival of more effective disease-specific therapy, much of the focus has shifted to more curative or quasi-curative therapies for which the goals of treatment are more clear-cut, uni- form, and physician-generated. This guide seeks to provide the rationale and the logic for incor-porating the more collaborative palliative approach into the 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 1726 Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 2: Overview of Clinical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 18and interactions of clinicians and their patients. The intent is not to eschew therapy or to downplay the importance of achieving certain objectively measurable outcomes such as directing therapyto achieve an undetectable HIV viral load or a sustained rise in CD4+ cells, but rather to encour-age care providers to recognize that above all it is the patient who must live with the illness, and that the goals of care are for the patient and not the physician. For instance, an overly narrow focus on antiretroviral treatment protocols and the technical details of HIV care will neither dojustice to the patient's condition nor ultimately promote a meaningful patient-physician rela-tionship. Focusing on the patient- and family-centered goals of care ensures that decisions will be made which do not violate important concerns of the patient and family. Curative, palliative, or bothtypes of interventions can be offered, not unilaterally and driven by diagnostic or treatmentalgorithms but rather collaboratively and driven by the priorities and values of the patient andfamily. Some of this work takes time and may be more open-ended than the narrow focus on testresults and medication adherence that has come to dominate much of our attention in routineoffice visits with patients on HAART. This collaborative approach will also pose a particularchallenge to busy primary care providers who already experience significant time pressure andpossibly increased numbers of longer-surviving HIV-infected patients in their practices. Never- theless, if we are to be effective as care providers for patients and families affected by HIV/AIDS, it is fundamentally important to work within this collaborative, comprehensive framework.Table 2-3: Core Elements of Palliative Care \u007f Emphasizes comprehensive care of the whole patient, inclusive of medical, psychoso- cial, and spiritual concerns. \u007f Depends on effective communication and relationship building, within a model of di- verse expertise and interdisciplinary teamwork, not an authoritative hierarchy. \u007f Goals of care include relief of suffering, control of symptoms, and restoration of func- tional capacity. \u007f Supports neither goal of cure nor the hastening or prolonging of death. \u007f Considers patients' subjective experience (e.g., pain, other symptoms) to be as impor- tant as objective clinical data. \u007f Diagnosis not predetermined goal: only pursued if conforms to patient-determined goals of care. \u007f Death not equated with defeat but rather is seen as natural conclusion of life; re- sponse of the clinician should be to comfort, not withdraw. \u007f Management plan tailored specifically to each patient, according to patient's values and preferences, not decided unilaterally by physician.

JAMA and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 2: Overview of Clinical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 19Specific examples of some common clinical scenarios involving decisions about palliative and/ or disease-specific care\u2014and the context for decision-making based on goals of care rather than on simple diagnosis-treatment algorithms\u2014include the following: 1. The use of transfusion and/or psycho-stimulants (e.g., methylphenidate) and/or corticoster- oids to treat fatigue in late-stage patients, with or without HAART; 2. Aggressive anti-emetic therapy for protease inhibitor-induced nausea and vomiting, or al- ternatively, revision or even discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy if such side effects areunable to be managed successfully; 3. Continued suppressive therapy even discontinua- tion of antiretroviral therapy and other prophylactic regimens in a dying patient; 4. Palliative treatment of disseminated MAC (e.g., with anti-pyretics, narcotic analgesics, and corticosteroids) in patients with advanced disease unwilling or unable to take anti-infectives; 5. Withdrawal of MAC or PCP prophylaxis in patients expected to die soon; 6. Withdrawal of HAART after evident treatment 'failure,' with assessment of risk-benefit as well as symbolic and emotional value; 7. Decisions to withdraw or forego artificial nutrition or hydration in a patient unable to main- tain oral intake, involving assessment of patients' wishes, functional and mental status, quality-of-life concerns, and social and cultural values; 8. Realistic vs. false hopes regarding decisions to initiate HAART or \"salvage\" regimens in late- stage patients (e.g., the possibility for a potentially disease-reversing course of antiretroviraltherapy, vs. the possibility that the patient may not respond, with all the resulting therapeu-tic ambiguities and challenges for counseling patient/family about prognosis). All of the scenarios above involve decisions that need to be informed both by medical evidence and risk-benefit analysis as well as by the priorities, values, and preferences of patients andfamilies. In all these scenarios it should be clear that decisions must be based on the specificgoals of care, including such factors as: \u007f The relative values of quality of life or prolongation of life \u007f The use of aggressive palliative care interventions to help mitigate side effects of other HIV-specific medications \u007f The use of certain disease-specific therapies primarily for palliative or quality-of-life intent \u007f The decision not to prolong life 'no matter what,' once a certain important threshold had been reached (e.g., progressive dementia or the inability to manage oral feedingsor medications) Clearly, this type of decisionmaking takes place in much more ambiguous and nuanced territory than the simple assessment of antiretroviral efficacy by measuring surrogate laboratory mark-ers, but it is no less important and in many ways more challenging. Table 2-4 lists common symptoms in AIDS along with their varied possible etiologies and ex- amples of both disease-specific therapies and palliative interventions. One or the other or bothtypes of approach might be appropriate in a given situation, depending on the patient's diseasestage, functional status, symptom burden, risk and potential benefit of therapy, and expressedcare preferences and goals.

Medical aspects may include: \u007f Decisionmaking about the risks and benefits of specific therapies (e.g., antiretroviral therapy, chemotherapeutic regimens, etc.) \u007f The importance of quality-of-life elements in these decisions (e.g., the choice of a potentially toxic, time-intensive intervention that might prolong life vs. more pallia-tive measures that would improve short-term quality of life but not extend it) \u007f Decisions about particular medical interventions (e.g., cardiopulmonary resuscitation, artificial nutrition or hydration, re-hospitalization of a patient being cared for at home) Psychosocial issues that need to be addressed may include: \u007f Family ambivalence or conflict about care plan decisions \u007f Guilt or other emotional 'unfinished business' that may affect decisions regarding care planning \u007f Concerns that any limitation on curative treatment interventions may represent aban- donment of the patient or lack of commitment or concern on the part of the care provider (Psychosocial issues will be discussed in more detail later.) Discussions about advance care planning should be ongoing, anticipatory, and re-visited on multiple occasions as needed over time. These issues should be 'normalized' as much as possibleand incorporated into routine care, rather than waiting until a crisis such as an acute life-threatening illness or the loss of decisional capacity to begin to address them. It may, in fact, be an indication of the discomfort that providers feel within the either-or framework of curative vs. palliative care that they may unconsciously defer these discussions until the patient is precipi-tously dying, implying that discussing goals of care and end-of-life decisionmaking is somehowinappropriate within the current therapeutic model. However, the approach to these issues needsto be positive, respectful, and focused on the values, concerns, cultural beliefs, and care prefer-ences of the patient and family. The family and/or other involved individuals need to be includedearlier rather than later in these discussions, and decisions about health care proxies and othersurrogate decisionmakers need to be made clearly and communicated to the designated indi-viduals. Despite the complexity of these psychosocial issues in the setting of HIV/AIDS\u2014that patients are often young adults who are faced with a life-threatening illness early in their lives, who mayhave young families, and who suffer from the stigma and social vulnerability still experienced bypeople with AIDS\u2014patients have been found to be unlikely to have discussed these issues with their care providers. 51, 52 This finding was even more pronounced among African-Americans and Latinos than whites.51, 52 The lack of discussions about advance care planning underscores the importance of clinicians pro-actively bringing up these issues\u2014and sensitively addressing bar-riers to discussions 53\u2014before they emerge in the setting of an acute crisis requiring an immedi- ate life-and-death decision. Rather than being a sign of withholding treatment or imposing val-ues on patients, anticipatory advance care planning is a way to empower patients and families to make decisions that are true to their basic beliefs, values, and concerns. The most effective way to achieve this kind of decisionmaking is in the context of an interdisciplinary team (physi- cian, nurse, social worker, chaplain, and other disciplines as appropriate) which can help the Chpt 2 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 2426 picas and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 2: Overview of Clinical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 25patient and family process and act on information on many levels at once. It is not an accident that the philosophy and practice of hospice care explicitly incorporate an interdisciplinary teamapproach in the routine care of dying patients, and this framework should be no less essentialfor the comprehensive care of patients with HIV. PROGNOSTIC UNCERTAINTY AND PALLIATIVE CARE Even as we have been emphasizing the importance of focusing on the goals of care in inform- ing treatment decisions, it must be recognized that prognostication and the expectation of likelyoutcomes in the course of HIV disease are much less certain and uniform than they were in thepre-HAART era. Ironically, it is precisely as we are reminded of the importance of clarifying thegoals of care\u2014now that there are choices, we need to ensure that decisionmaking incorporates these choices\u2014that we are also reminded that prognosis and the 'natural history' of HIV infec-tion are much less clear-cut than they were previously. While CD4+ counts and viral load assaysare excellent measures of response to therapy and indeed of prognosis in general, the possibilityof effective antiretroviral therapy\u2014or alternatively the lack of this possibility when there are noviable treatment options\u2014can completely alter prognosis for people with AIDS. The National Hospice Organization's 1996 Guidelines for determining prognosis in certain non- cancer diagnoses attempted to generate criteria indicative of likely less-than-six months' prog-nosis for patients with AIDS (see Table 2-5). 54 While some of these clinical conditions may be useful prognostic markers, none of them would likely override the potential positive impact ofeffective antiretroviral therapy if this were still an option. Indeed, some patients have beenreferred to hospice, received palliative care, and expected to die, only to surprise themselvesand their care providers with their miraculous recoveries (the 'Lazarus Syndrome') from effec-tive HAART. In these cases, forcing patients to choose an ' either-or ' approach would clearly be unconscionable. We must both be able to prognosticate as best we can based on evidence and the patient's specific treatment history and options, and be prepared to accept that our best estimates may be made irrelevant by the potential impact of therapy. This reality only makes theintegration of palliative and curative approaches both more challenging and more necessary than ever before. One issue that frequently arises related to the complexities of prognostication and clinical decisionmaking in the HAART era involves the discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy in apatient who is either not responding or felt to be unlikely to respond to treatment. Even though there is controversy about whether to stop therapy even in the face of apparent treatment fail- ure (i.e., the concept of viral ' fitness ' and possible benefit of antiretroviral selective pressure on viral replication dynamics even in the setting of high viral loads and low CD4+ counts), 55, 56 we must recognize that the benefits of antiretroviral therapy, even when effective, are not immedi-ate, and that they must be evaluated in light of potential favorable impact to prevent future decline. Thus, it is reasonable to question whether it makes therapeutic sense to continueantiretroviral therapy in a patient dying of lung cancer or end-stage liver failure\u2014whether ornot the medications could even be tolerated in this setting\u2014or in the obvious end stages ofprogressive symptomatic HIV disease. In these instances, antiretroviral therapy will not be likelyto have any meaningful benefit and will probably only add to the therapeutic confusion in apatient who is clearly dying yet for whom aggressive therapy is being continued. However, insome cases, the patient may have such a strong emotional investment in continuing therapy that it is completely reasonable to continue it, although it should be clear that this is as much a Chpt 2 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 2526 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 2: Overview of Clinical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 26psychosocial as a medical decision, if not more so. These examples underscore the importance of clarifying the goals of therapy, assessing the potential impact and likely risks and benefits oftherapy, and working collaboratively with patients to determine priorities and treatment plans\u2014all aspects of a good patient-provider relationship that become obscured if too much of the focusis on the treatment instead of on the patient . PSYCHOSOCIAL AND FAMILY ISSUES AIDS has always presented unique psychosocial problems for patients, families, and care providers: a life-threatening illness affecting young adults, often with multiple infected familymembers, raising difficult issues of premature death, unfinished business, legacy, and survivor-ship. Guilt, shame, anger, and despair may compound the emotional challenges of coming toterms with this progressive, incurable infectious disease. Some of the behaviors linked to HIVinfection remain socially unacceptable in certain contexts, and the association between AIDS,Table 2-5: Conditions Suggestive of Less Than Six Months Prognosis in Patients with AIDS Note: All of these factors may potentially be over-ridden in the setting of effective antiretroviral therapy.

Despite some advances in public educationand awareness about AIDS, there remains a significant degree of stigma, fear, and prejudiceregarding AIDS within the society as a whole. In addition to all of the challenges that AIDS has always posed, there are new issues that have arisen in the HAART era that are particularly relevant to palliative and end-of-life care. With the long awaited impact of HAART\u2014beginning most notably in 1996\u2014and the subsequent rapiddecline in death rates from AIDS, the inevitability of short-term mortality has receded. Thisphenomenon has even resulted in the identification of new potential stressors due to a \" 'secondlife' agenda\" in patients who must now prepare to go on living instead of preparing to die. 57 While the decreased risk of death has clearly been a welcome relief for patients and theircaregivers, it also has had the tendency in some cases to isolate those who are still dying withAIDS in the HAART era, at a time when people's expectations have been so dramatically liftedby the promise of effective antiretroviral therapy. 17 As noted above, while death rates have de- creased and the rate of decline has slowed, there are still over 15,000 people per year dying fromAIDS in the United States, with the prospect that this number might continue to increase whenthe compounding co-morbidities of hepatitis B and C, substance abuse and its sequelae, co- occurring cancers, and other potentially fatal conditions are taken into account. In the HAART era, the formerly grim scenario of AIDS as a uniformly and rapidly fatal disease is no longer the usual outcome\u2014dying from AIDS has now passed from ' fate' to 'tragedy .' Although in the pre-HAART era death came swiftly to AIDS patients, the new drug therapies are nowcapable of extending life for many years\u2014at least in some patients. Unfortunately, the patientswho do not benefit from the new drugs may be blamed for their ' failure ' to respond to treatment or to adhere to the treatment regimen. These dying patients are sometimes ostracized and seenas the 'anomalies' who are not able to benefit from the purported lifesaving effects of effective antiretroviral therapy. A new form of guilt may be seen in both patients and care providers, faulting poor therapy choices or poor adherence as the ' cause ' of a patient's death. With the advent of HAART, there are both greater possibilities for therapeutic success and greater opportunities for therapeutic failure, regret, and guilt over perceived bad decisions or missedopportunities. Given the importance of adherence to HAART as a major factor in determining the likely suc- cess of a treatment regimen, it is not surprising that so much of the routine patient-providerclinical interaction has become focused on adherence to therapy and the close monitoring of laboratory tests such as CD4+ counts and HIV viral load assays. However, this focus on adher- ence has tended to reframe the patient-provider relationship in a new and more limited way,outside of the context of the experience of life-threatening illness and preparation for possibledeath. As with much of medicine in general, the more narrowly one operates within a biomedi-cal model, the less comfortable one tends to be with end-of-life issues, since death in effectrepresents a ' failure to cure .' Consciously or not, HIV care providers in the current era may feel inadequate to help patients deal with impending death, since their role is understood as one ofcuring or fighting back the disease. Tragically, providers may feel so out of place that they maywithdraw emotionally from patients and become less involved in their care as they approachdeath, so that patients experience both the losses imposed by the illness and the potential loss of a trusted long-term relationship with their care provider.

Providers may actually feel anger at patients over fail-ure to adhere to antiretroviral therapy or for active substance abuse and other self-destructivebehaviors. Re-examining the goals of care, involving the interdisciplinary team, and continuingto engage and provide follow-up for patients\u2014without judging their choices or inability to ad-here with recommended therapy\u2014will help to maintain and enhance the clinical relationship. The fact that the new generation of HIV caregivers has not had the experience of their earlier colleagues\u2014in which there was no avoidance of death and no immediate prospect of forestallingit with disease-specific therapy\u2014may also be a contributing factor in the difficulty that providersexperience in addressing end-of-life issues. While we would hope that the experience of theearly years of the AIDS epidemic will never have to be repeated, we can also hope to retain thelessons that it brought regarding the importance of accompanying patients through illness untildeath, of not seeing death as an automatic failure of the clinician, of appreciating the profoundimportance of ' being there ,' and of understanding the role of the caregiver as ' caring ' and not necessarily ' curing .' 58 As outlined above regarding palliative and disease-specific therapy, the strategy should not be ' either-or ,' but rather ' both-and ,' and providers need to be as skilled and competent in anticipating and addressing the end-of-life issues as they are in interpreting surrogate marker test results and recommending effective combination anti-retroviral treatment regimens. Another area in which caregivers can have an invaluable impact is in the support and education of families as patients move through the last stages of their illness, especially for patients whoremain at home. Ongoing visits by nursing and other staff, either at home or in an institutionalsetting, can be extremely helpful in addressing concrete concerns and questions about prognosis;the expected changes that occur toward the end of life; and some of the physical, emotional, andspiritual issues that families can expect. It may be helpful to describe these events in terms of the estimated prognostic timeframe covering the last months, weeks, and days of life, along with the responses that families may consider to help their loved ones through this process. Table 2-6 describes the guidance that the clinician can provide caregivers as the patient moves throughthe last stages of illness. As with other aspects of palliative care, a team approach and sustained,consistent interaction over time are key elements in a successful therapeutic relationship. In addition to the myriad psychosocial issues outlined above, and the more clinical psychiatric issues dealt with in more detail in Chapter 10 (Psychiatric Problems), two other importantpsychosocial themes are (1) multiple loss and (2) grief and bereavement. While the phenom- enon of multiple loss 59 in the AIDS epidemic has long been identified for patients, providers, and communities, this is compounded in the current era because of the long-term relationships thathave been built up over years of patient-provider interaction. Even though the absolute numberof deaths may be declining, the impact of each loss may be as great or greater. This can result ina cumulative burden of grief that can begin to have deleterious effects on providers over time. Itis important to recognize, anticipate, and respond to these effects, and to appreciate that 'emo-tional health-maintenance' and self-care are not signs of wasteful self-indulgence but ratherimportant aspects of maintaining our perspective and effectiveness as HIV care providers. Grief both anticipates the loss and follows the loss, with reverberations into the future for all those who have been affected.

This uncertainty can alsogive rise to heightened anxiety, ambivalence within the family (wishing that it would just ' be over with ' and then feeling guilt over this), and equally conflicted feelings of relief when the death finally does occur. These complex emotions require sensitive and skilled attention by bothmedical and mental health care providers, and are best addressed by the interdisciplinary team. Bereavement is an important phase of the process of loss and recovery and is another area that unfortunately is rarely addressed by most care providers and by medicine as a profession. Theloss of the patient that occurs upon death is also often accompanied by the family's loss of therelationship with the care provider, which again may have developed over years of close interac-tion with both patient and family. The care provider's involvement in follow-up and contact withthe family during bereavement (ranging from writing a condolence letter to attending a funeralservice to providing counseling or other clinical follow-up to family members) can be extremelyhelpful and healing for both the family and the clinician. 60 Some or all of these practices should be incorporated into routine follow-up care for families and additional significant others afterthe patient has died, whether or not the HIV care provider is also the primary care provider forother members of the family (see Figure 2-4b). Many clinical AIDS programs perform periodic memorial services for patients who have died, attended by both professional care providers and families/loved ones, which is both a powerful expression of remembrance and a part of theprocess of working through grief for the survivors. Chapter 16: Grief and Bereavement and Chap-ter 20: Care for the Caregiver address these issues in more detail. CONCLUSION As we enter an era in which the therapeutic possibilities for AIDS continue to expand, it remains important not to lose sight of the critical issues in end-of-life and palliative care that remain central to the comprehensive care of patients and families affected by this disease. Thisbook attempts to provide useful information regarding these issues in the hope that providerscan move beyond the artificial distinctions between curative and palliative care and be able toprovide optimal care to all patients throughout the course of the illness. In the current system of medical care, primary care providers are best able to deliver integrated, comprehensive care over the continuum of illness in ways that combine biomedical and psycho-social approaches within an interdisciplinary model of care. The group of providers able to pro- vide integrated care may include clinicians in primary care disciplines such as general internal medicine, family medicine, and pediatrics, or as has been evidenced in HIV care to date, sub-specialists such as infectious disease physicians or oncologists who have been able to take onthe full range of care required by the patient. Regardless of the training, what is required is the willingness for us to go beyond the false dichotomies of curative vs. palliative care and recognize that the true role and responsibility ofthe physician and care provider are in accompanying the patient through the experience ofillness, doing whatever can and should be done at each step along the way. Part of this task involves being familiar and current with the science of palliative medicine, just as with the science of HIV medicine. Part of it also involves acceptance of the physician's inability to alwaysdefeat death and acknowledgement of our own limitations and vulnerabilities as well as our Chpt 2 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 3126 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 2: Overview of Clinical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 32patients' needs. As was written by Sheila Cassidy, a British hospice physician, in her memoir Sharing the Darkness : \"Slowly, I learn about the importance of powerlessness. I experience it in my own life and I live with it in my work. The secret is not to be afraid of it - not to run away. The dying know we are not God. All they ask is that we do not desert them.\"61 Or, as expressed in the often-cited phrase attributed to Edward Trudeau (the Canadian physi- cian in the early 20th century credited with developing the sanitarium system for tuberculosis care long before the advent of disease-specific chemotherapy), the goal of the clinician for thepatient with an incurable, progressive and terminal illness is: \"To cure never, to treat some-times, and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 2: Overview of Clinical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 331.

INTRODUCTION Health professionals caring for people living with HIV will encounter myriad symptoms rang- ing from minor and bothersome problems to problems that are associated with great distress. Incaring for a patient who presents with a symptom, the health professional has two main roles.The first involves defining the etiology of the symptom and implementing an appropriate treat-ment strategy directed towards eliminating or modulating the pathophysiologic process re- sponsible for triggering the symptom. The second role involves ensuring that a strategy is devel-oped and implemented that provides timely and effective relief of the distress associated with the symptom. Usually, these two goals involve two closely interrelated, but different, treatmentstrategies and there may be times, especially towards the end of life, when the first goal isunattainable. At the core of the process required to achieve these goals is symptom assessment,the focus of this chapter.To understand symptom assessment in HIV infection, health care providers must understandsymptoms within the contexts of quality of life and of HIV infection itself. This chapter ad-dresses the symptoms common in patients with advanced HIV disease, the principles of symp-tom assessment, and an approach to symptom assessment in advanced HIV including some clini-cally useful assessment instruments. Although this chapter frequently uses fatigue, pain, andthe symptoms associated with fever as examples to illustrate the process of assessment, thesame general process of assessment applies for all symptoms. Symptoms and Quality of Life in HIV The overarching goal of palliative care is to relieve or reduce suffering and promote quality of life. A crucial component of quality of life is the component that relates to symptoms includingfatigue and pain, among many others. Such symptoms can be present throughout the course ofillness from diagnosis through the progression of disease and toward the end of life. Of note,these symptoms may be present even at times when disease markers are improving. The some-times unpredictable and episodic course of HIV-related illness\u2014especially in the early years ofthis illness when treatment strategies were less clearly outlined\u2014made it difficult to estimatethe likely course of HIV-related disease for an individual. This factor, along with patient advo-cacy and developments in the field of palliative medicine, prompted an increasing awareness ofthe importance of palliative medicine for those living with HIV infection. These and other fac-tors have served to promote quality of life itself as an important outcome of all treatments fordisease, regardless of the stage of illness.Health-related quality of life is a multidimensional concept affected by a variety of positive andnegative experiences from a variety of domains. A patient's health-related quality of life shouldnot be thought of only as a research outcome; rather, in clinical practice it is a vitally importantconcept that reflects the global impact of disease and the impact of related medical interventions.

Within the physical domain, the patient's symptoms and physical functioning must be assessed. However, problems that affect a patient's quality of life extend well beyond his or her physical symptoms into the other domains. Although the focus of this chapter is on the clinical assess-ment of physical symptoms of people with HIV-related illness, the interplay between the physi-cal, psychological and social domains of quality of life must always be considered within theclinical assessment process. This especially includes the psychological and social problems andexperiences that may occur in individual cases. COMMON SYMPTOMS IN ADVANCED HIV INFECTION To set the stage for the process of symptom assessment, it is most helpful for health profes- sionals to have an understanding of the common symptoms experienced by patients with ad-vanced HIV infection and an understanding of quality of life in HIV-related disease. This sectionof the chapter will summarize some of the studies that have increased our understanding of thecommon symptoms that occur with HIV infection. Clearly, myriad symptoms can occur in thesetting of HIV-related disease. In the palliative care setting, in patients with advanced HIV in-fection, a wide range of symptoms occurs, with fatigue, anorexia/weight loss, pain, insomnia anddepression being the most commonly reported. Although the presence of a symptom may berelated to the HIV infection directly, commonly a symptom will reflect an underlying pathologicprocess that is related to the HIV infection. Most of the surveys that have sought to characterize symptoms associated with HIV infection and AIDS have focused on specific symptoms. 1-3 However, two broad symptom studies of outpa- tients with AIDS highlight the spectrum of symptoms experienced by this population.4, 5 Fantoni, et al. investigated the prevalence and intensity of symptoms and the use of medications forsymptom control among 1128 HIV-infected patients reporting to the outpatient clinics or wardsof 15 clinical centers in central Italy, recording clinical and epidemiological data on three con-secutive days. 4 The most prevalent of 10 symptoms were asthenia (65%), anorexia (34%), cough (32%), pain Opioid analgesics used 3% of these patients and non-opioid analgesics in 13%. Pain was present in less than one third of patients but the report nonetheless suggested that pain was undertreated. Another survey, undertaken by Vogl, et al., explored the symptoms of 504 ambulatory patients with AIDS to assess symptom prevalence, characteristics, and distress. 5 In this group, of the 32 symptoms assessed using a validated symptom assessment instrument (the Memorial SymptomAssessment Short-Form), 6, 7 the mean number of symptoms reported was 16.7 per patient. Twelve of the 32 symptoms had prevalence figures of greater that 60% and these included worrying(86%), fatigue (85%), sadness (82%), pain (76%), feeling irritable (75%), difficulty sleeping(73.8%), nervous (68%), dry mouth (67%), (64.5%), of breath (62.4%), feeling drowsy (61.9%), and cough (60.3%). More symptoms were reported in those patients with lower performance scores and in those for whom a history of intravenousdrug use was reported as the mode of HIV transmission. Neither of these studies clearly delineates the strategies used to treat the symptoms. In patients with HIV infection, as is the case in patients with cancer, pain and other symptoms are oftenundertreated and therefore prevalence figures should not be read as reflecting state of the art palliation for the symptoms associated with this condition. For example, in one study, 226 ambu-latory AIDS patients were assessed regarding the type and frequency of analgesic medications Chpt 3 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 3826 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms III U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 39prescribed for pain.8 Results indicated that nearly 85% of patients with pain were classified as receiving inadequate analgesic therapy and fewer than 8% of the 110 patients who reported\"severe\" pain were prescribed a \"strong\" opioid (e.g., morphine), as would usually be suggestedin published guidelines for treatment of severe pain. 8 Thus it is clear that many symptoms are prevalent in persons with HIV-related illness, especiallyin persons with advanced HIV-related disease. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that thehigher the number of symptoms, the greater the experience of distress. It is common for manysymptoms to be present concurrently. Finally, the distress from symptoms related to HIV infec-tion is often undertreated. It is within this context that symptom assessment must be under-taken and each of these factors must be taken into consideration within the symptom assess-ment process. Symptoms and Quality of Li fe in Ad vanced HIV Infection Several studies have specifically considered quality of life in people with HIV disease.9-14 The impact of symptoms on quality of life was explored in the large prospective cross-sectional sur-vey done by Vogl, et al. discussed above. 5 In this survey, symptoms were assessed and character- ized using a validated symptom scale and it was demonstrated in this population that both thenumber of symptoms and the symptom distress were highly associated with psychological dis-tress and poorer quality of life. Older age, female sex, nonwhite race, poor social support, andthe presence of intravenous drug use, each have been associated with greater distress and poorerquality of life. In many studies the presence of symptoms is the strongest indicator of poor quality of life. 5, 10, 12, 15 The results of these studies highlight the impact of a broad range of physi- cal and psychological symptoms on quality of life. THE PRINCIPLES OF SYMPTOM ASSESSMENT As discussed above, symptom assessment is a most important aspect of patient care and a significant component of quality of life assessment.16,17 When care is being provided for people with HIV-related illness, nearly all clinician interactions with patients require symptom assess-ment skills. The following section outlines key points to consider when assessing symptoms. Definition of the Word SymptomSymptoms are Subjective Experiences A symptom has been defined as \"a physical or mental phenomena [sic], circumstance or change of condition arising from and accompanying a disorder and constituting evidence for it.... spe-cifically a subjective indicator perceptible to the patient and as opposed to an objective one (cf. sign).\" 18 In other words, symptoms are experienced by the patient and signs are observed by the clinician. This is a vital concept; symptoms cannot be seen, although sometimes the physical manifestations of a symptom can be detected. Oftentimes a clinician can also observe the dis-tress associated with a symptom. Symptoms are Different from Pathological Processes or Diagnoses Just as signs are not symptoms, symptoms and signs are not, of themselves, diagnoses . Symp- toms and signs can however assist in the diagnostic process. For example, fatigue is a subjectivesensation--a symptom--that may occur with the diagnosis of anemia or infection, but fatigue Chpt 3 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 3926 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 40itself is not a diagnosis. A fatigued patient may present with no signs or with cachexia and/or other clinical findings. A diagnosis in a patient with fatigue would be related to the cause of the fatigue. For example, the diagnosis may be an underlying infection such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (see Table 3-1). Table 3-1: Differential Diagnosis and Management of Fatigue in HIV-Related Illness Interventions that may have a Causes role as treatment strategies \u007f Anemia \u007f and other neurologic disorders \u007f Autoimmune disorders\u007f Medications (including chemotherapy, sedatives, steroids and many others) \u007f Ongoing distress from uncontrolled symptoms (including pain and dyspnea, among others) \u007f Intense physical activity \u007f Physical treatments, including radiation therapy \u007f Unknown/otherTreatment of underlying cause Physical therapy and exercise Emotional support (counseling, self-help, support groups) Pharmacological treatment including stimulants or corticosteroids (can also aggravate fatigue in some patients) Chpt 3 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 4026 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms III U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 41As an another example, a patient may report a \"flushing,\" \"sweats,\" a \"feeling of being hot,\" or a \"feeling of being chilled.\" In this context, each of these is a symptom. A sign (which may or may not be present) might in this instance be a fever, and the diagnosis may be an infection or another problem (see Table 3-2). Table 3-2: Differential Diagnosis and Management of Fever in HIV-Related Illness Interventions that may have a Causes role as treatment strategies \u007f Infections \u007f NSAIDs Physical treatments including cooling, sponging, etc. It is important to be aware that the clinical signs cannot give an indicator of the degree to which a patient is distressed or bothered by a symptom - that must be defined by the patient's self-report. Pain is another subjective sensation (symptom) that may, or may not, be associated withsigns . Although sometimes distress can be seen - as, for example, an anguished appearance, crying, writhing, tachycardia, or other physical manifestations - none of these signs can truly give the clinician a full indicator of the degree to which a patient is distressed or bothered by the pain. That must be defined by the patient's self-report. In the case of chronic pain, it is not uncommon for a patient to demonstrate little in the way of physical manifestations of distress even when he or she reports that the pain is severe. A pa- tient may have no visible signs of distress but may report that the pain is 10/10 (on a scale of zeroto 10). Even in the absence of signs of distress , the pain must be assessed, the etiology of the pain considered, and the associated distress concurrently treated. (See Chapter 4: Pain.) By keeping these distinctions in mind, health professionals can more easily keep a focus on the two broad goals of symptom assessment: the goal that is related to the treatment of pathophysi-ology, and the goal that is related to the treatment of distress. Chpt 3 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 4126 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 42Definitions of the Words Used to Define Each Symptom If distress is to be assessed and treated effectively, health care professionals must understand the words that patients use to describe symptoms and, optimally, must use a common language fordescribing symptoms to others in the health care team. In a particular clinical setting, patientsand the health care team usually speak the same \"native tongue.\" Nonetheless, even in such asetting, clear language is not always used when communicating the detail of symptoms. The problems with this failure of language in the field of symptom assessment are twofold. One, words that people use to describe symptoms may mean different things to different patients.Two, the words used to describe a symptom may have various medical implications. Words May Have Many Meanings Some of the words used to describe each symptom have a plethora of meanings for patients. This problem of itself can only be approached by careful historytaking and questioning by the clini-cian to elucidate the nuances of the language the patient uses to communicate distress. Pa-tients should not be described as poor historians. Clinicians must endeavor to be good histori-ans, or good historytakers. The words patients use to describe their symptoms can often have more than one meaning, which highlights the crucial need for detailed and thorough historytaking. For example: \u007fFatigue may mean to some sleepiness, to others exhaustion, to others muscle weakness, and to still others the word may have other implications. \u007fShivering implies to most a tremulous shaking that occurs with fever or sepsis. However, patients have also used this word when attempting to describe the dysesthetic sensation that may occur with neuropathic pain. \u007fConfusion may be used to imply disorganized thinking, forgetfulness, hallucinations, concentration deficits and numerous other changes in mentalstatus. Words Have Various Medical Implications Within the medical arena, the words used to describe a given symptom may have a wide range ofimplications. Definitions and taxonomies for many symptoms are lacking. Clinicians are ofteninexact in describing the experiences of patients to other clinicians. This problem has clinicalimplications that relate to continuity of care and team communication. In addition, it has re-search implications related to the processes of developing, undertaking and interpreting symp-tom-related research studies. Key words that clinicians may encounter in assessing symptoms of patients with HIV are pain, fatigue, breathlessness, and confusion. Consistency is lacking in the application of these andmany other words that are used to describe symptoms. Clinicians need to be more aware of thissemantic problem and to develop consistent tools for medical communication. The variability ofthe meanings of words also highlights the need for clinicians to use validated instruments forsymptom assessment and research. In summary, these observations point to the need for healthprofessionals to explore the meaning of the symptom in detail during the process of symptom assessment. Chpt 3 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 4226 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms III U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 43Pain Pain has a generally accepted definition and a taxonomy has been developed for its study.19 Therefore, clinicians generally can use a language that other clinicians can understand when describing pain (see Chapter 4: Pain). Words such as \"lancinating neuropathic pain\" can beused to describe a pain syndrome very effectively, in a manner that is widely accepted. Thedevelopment of this taxonomy has also allowed clinicians to undertake and interpret studies ofpain. For example, the results of studies of lancinating neuropathic pain caused by post-her-petic neuralgia can be compared and applied in the clinical setting because the pain aboutwhich investigators and clinicians are communicating is clearly defined and understood. Breathlessness Breathlessness is a word that is generally used to refer to subjective reports of difficulty breath- ing. However, it also has been used in the clinical and research settings to describe the visible use of the accessory muscles of respiration (which may not always be associated with distress).Some palliative care studies have reported dyspnea as a prevalent symptom toward the very endof life, but have not defined clearly whether the reports are referring to subjective breathless-ness experienced by the patient, or observed heavy breathing witnessed by another person. Breathlessness lacks widely accepted scientific definitions and taxonomy; consequently, stud- ies of dyspnea can sometimes be difficult to compare. It can thus be difficult to apply the find-ings of such studies. Fatigue Fatigue , as noted earlier, is a word that is used to identify a variety of sensations that may include generalized weakness, sleepiness, and others. Unless clinicians clearly define the sen- sation to which they are referring in clinical discussions, this can be confusing for others on thehealth care team. Confusion Confusion is a word that is commonly used as a diagnosis by clinicians. It is not. Confusion may be a symptom when described by patients, and when used by clinicians it could also legiti- mately be described as a sign, usually of an underlying diagnosis/disorder such as delirium, dementia or other condition. Even in the latter context, confusion is a global term. It is most useful when qualified with more detailed descriptors such as concentration deficits, memorydeficits, etc., as would be elucidated by an assessment of the confusion with a comprehensivemental state examination. Importance of Subjective Assessment Symptoms are by definition subjective, and where possible, patient self-report must be the primary source of information. Some observations to consider in relation to this are as follows. \u007f Observer and patient assessments are not highly correlated, and the accuracy of a clinician's assessment cannot be assumed unless it involves direct inputfrom the patient. 20-24 It has been demonstrated that clinician accuracy can be very poor, even when assessing patients with severe pain.20 Chpt 3 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 4326 Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 44\u007f Studies of caregivers have found that caregivers are commonly inaccurate when reporting on subjective aspects of the patient experience.21,22 This includes, for example, symptoms such as pain and depression. A tendency has been demonstrated for caregivers to be more accuratewhen reporting on objective measures, such as the patient's ability todress independently. Of note, this is not to imply that caregiver reportsshould be neglected as they can provide vital insights into the patientexperience, especially over time. \u007f Objective signs can be usefully monitored to complement subjective data, but this information cannot substitute for self-report. For example, nausea assessment should involve a subjective rating by the patient and may be supplemented by assessment of the frequency of emesis. \u007f In some groups of patients, such as cognitively impaired adults or preverbal children, it may be impossible to obtain or interpret patient self-reports. These populations need special care and attention. When such patients are encountered, reports from family members and staff may be the only useful proxies and the information obtained from these sources should be combinedwith a physical assessment of the patient so that the clinician can fully assessthe situation. Although proxy data should be interpreted with caution, theobservations of a caregiver who knows the patient well or is a highly skilled nurse should certainly be considered as important insights into, or indicators of, patient distress. Symptoms Are Multidimensional Experiences Symptoms are multidimensional experiences that may be evaluated in terms of their specific characteristics and impact.6, 25-28 Symptom multidimensionality is portrayed in Table 3-3.16, 17 It is not uncommon for researchers or clinicians to describe a symptom simply by stating that it ispresent . Although prevalence data alone may be useful information, a more detailed assessment of the characteristics of specific symptoms is usually more helpful, especially in the clinicalsetting. Significant variability has been demonstrated in relation to symptom characteristics. 6, 25-28 Three crucial variable dimensions are frequency, severity and distress. Although symptom character-istics are often variable, the proportion of patients who describe a symptom as relatively intenseor frequent usually exceeds the proportion describing it as highly distressing. 28, 29 The frequency dimension does not apply to some symptoms, for example, constipation. Chpt 3 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 4426 Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms III U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 45Portenoy, et al. have developed a validated instrument for the assessment of three key dimensions of symptoms: frequency, severity and distress.6 (See Figure 3-1 at the end of this chapter.) This instrument mirrors in part what usually should be explored clinically in relation to each symptom. The three questions asked of the patient on that instrument address how frequent, severe andbothersome a symptom may be to the patient. A shorter version of this instrument has been usedin studies of patients with advanced HIV infection and has provided useful data. 5, 7 Symptom distress relates to the degree of subjective discomfort and the \"bothersomeness\" of each specific symptom. Global symptom distress has also been considered as a subjective con-cept that relates to the impact of all symptoms. Symptom distress can be described and mea-sured. As alluded to above, the overall impact of symptom distress is most important. A large prospective cross-sectional survey, discussed above, of 504 ambulatory AIDS patients found that patients experienced many distressing physical and psychological symptoms and a high level ofdistress. 5 Symptom distress significantly correlated with lower performance status, worse scores on measures of psychological distress, and a poorer global quality of life. The impact of symptoms may be described and measured in relation to specific issues or global constructs. Many of the specific issues form the components of the global concept of quality oflife. The impact of a symptom can be assessed in relation to the following: \u007f Spheres of functioning \u007f Family, social, financial, spiritual and existential issues\u007f Various global constructs such as overall symptom distress or quality of life Factors that may modulate symptom distress may in turn be modulated by other components of the overall quality of life. Distress can be compounded when it is coming from multiple sources.By the same token, positive aspects of life frequently can mitigate some degree of distress. The multidimensional construct of quality of life reflects the broad influence of many positive andnegative factors on a patient's perceived well-being. 30, 31 A diverse array of physical, emotional, social, ethical and spiritual phenomena can increase or temper distress or enhance well-being. Factors from each of these areas have the potential to independently influence quality of life, and to exacerbate or lessen the distress associated with specific symptoms. Each must thereforebe considered in symptom assessment. PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF SYMPTOM ASSESSMENT This section focuses on the practical aspects of symptom assessment, discusses some popula- tions in which symptom assessment can be especially challenging, and reviews available instru- ments for symptom assessment. The key to symptom assessment is a comprehensive approach as shown in Table 3-3. The health care provider should undertake the following tasks: \u007f Develop an understanding of the patient's current and past illness \u007f Elicit the details of the distress caused by each symptom Chpt 3 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 4526 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 46Diagnosis Chronology Therapeutic interventions Patient's knowledge of current extent of disease Past history of other medical, surgical, psychiatric problems Review of systems For each symptom:Table 3-3: Clinical Symptom Assessment HISTORY \u007f Medical history \u007f AssessmentIncluding of other HIV-related illnesses Including antiretroviral therapies Including the oft-neglected psychiatric review Chronology, frequency, severityAggravating and alleviating factors Degree of distress Impact on functionOther clinical characteristics Impact of each symptom on other symptoms Patient perception of etiology Prior treatment modalities and their efficacy Other factors that modulate distress associated with specific symptoms, e.g., coping strategies and supports \u007f Psychosocial issues Family history Social resourcesImpact of disease and symptoms on patient and family Substance abuse history and aberrant drug-related behaviors Goals of care Chpt 3 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, AM 4626 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms III U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 47\u007f Global symptom impactGlobal symptom distress Impact of symptoms on quality of lifeImpact of overall symptom distress on quality of life Physical condition Psychological status Social interactionsTable 3-3: Clinical Symptom Assessment (continued) Factors that modulate global symptom distress, e.g., coping strategies and family supports Current and prior use of prescription medications Current and prior use of antiretrovial therapies Current and prior use of nonprescription drugs including alternative or complementarymedical therapies Inferred pathophysiology Relationship to other symptomsDiffering pathophysiologies Same pathophysiologyCausal pathology induced by another symptom Causal factor is treatment directed at another symptom Sources: Adapted from Ingham JM, Portenoy RK.

The latter should always include a method for ongoing evaluation of the impact of the treatment plan - a clearly defined plan for ongoing symptom assessment. A discussion of the detail of the many specific treatment plans that exist for each symptom is beyond the scope of this chapter, butthese issues are addressed in symptom-specific chapters. (See, e.g., Chapter 4: Pain, Chapter 6:Pulmonary Symptoms, and Chapter 8: Oral Problems.) Evaluation of Medical History The initial step in the assessment of the symptomatic patient involves the clinician eliciting a complete medical history. This process lies at the core of clinical diagnostic medicine. Symp- toms must always be considered in context of the overall medical condition. The order and timing that are chosen by the clinician for eliciting a patient's medical history will be influenced by a number of factors, including the following: \u007f The degree of acute patient distress that is present \u007f Convenience and efficiency\u007f The previous relationship of the patient and clinician Clearly if a patient is in a great deal of distress an expedited history may be required while the clinician concurrently treats the patient's acute distress (for example in the case of a patient insevere acute pain). Although distress that is so severe as to be in need of treatment withinminutes requires an expedited approach, this does not obviate the need for eliciting a detailedhistory from the patient or another source at a slightly later time. If the clinician is familiar with the patient, the clinician may already be aware of much of the history and the historytaking can be expedited. A clinician seeing a patient for the first time inan emergency setting will likely need to either spend more time with the patient or review available records to ascertain key components of the history. Approaches to Historytaking With complicated HIV-related illness and in cases where multiple symptoms are present, it can helpful to deviate slightly from the traditional approach to historytaking by specifically elicitingthe symptom history, separate from the history of HIV infection and the known intercurrentillnesses. This approach can focus the history and help the clinician define both the detail of the medical problems and the detail of the distress. This approach also serves to emphasize the key components of a palliative symptom assessment and, although it does depart slightly from thetraditional approach to historytaking, it does include all of the components of a traditional history. Chpt 3 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 4826 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms III U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 49The traditional approach to historytaking includes the following activities: \u007f History of the present illness \u007f Systems review\u007f Past history\u007f Family history \u007f Social history \u007f Medication history Another approach ensures emphasis on all aspects of the detail needed to care for patients with advanced illness and multiple symptoms (but still involves all of the same components as thetraditional approach). This approach includes the following topics (underlined topics are thosenot always covered in a traditional history): \u007f History of the underlying illness (HIV infection) including the presence and chronology of known related illnesses (other HIV-related diagnoses) and/or medical events \u007f Symptom assessment, which allows for a specific focus on new and current symptoms \u007f Systems review\u007f Past history of other medical, surgical or psychiatric problems\u007f Medication history\u007f Family history\u007f Social history\u007f A review of current goals of care History of the Underlying Illness A history of the underlying illness (HIV infection) and its consequences is essential. This will provide insight into the patient's experience, the likely diagnoses that might be the etiology ofeach symptom, and the therapeutic options that could be considered to relieve the symptoms.Therefore, in the assessment of patients with HIV infection the components of the history shouldinclude: \u007f Stage of the HIV infection \u007f Presence and chronology of HIV infection and known HIV-related, illnesses and/or medical events (mode of transmission of HIV infection ascertained if possible) \u007f History of therapies directed towards HIV infection\u007f History of therapies directed towards significant HIV-related illnesses and/or medical events Chpt 3 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 4926 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 50Symptom Evaluation A symptom evaluation that allows for a specific focus on, and assessment of, new and current symptoms is vital. Often many symptoms are present; each symptom may have several dimen-sions and each may affect the patient's distress and quality of life to a different degree. In acomprehensive symptom assessment, an attempt should be made to single out each symptomand to explore its dimensions and impact separately. When a patient presents with multiplesymptoms it can also be helpful to ascertain his or her biggest issues: the most bothersome day-to-day problems. \u007f Chronology of the Symptom(s) Establish the chronology of each symptom. (e.g., When did it begin? Were there any triggering factors? Was it initially severe, did it escalate over time or did itbecome severe suddenly? Does it vary over time?) \u007f Exacerbating and Relieving Factors Establish factors associated with the symptom. (e.g., Do activity, movement, heat, cold, or other factors affect the symptom?) \u007f Symptom Characteristics Ask the patient to describe symptom characteristics, including site (for pain and some other symptoms); frequency; severity; and associated distress or how bothersome the symptom may be for the patient. 6 It is important to ensure that, where possible, reports of symptoms, especially of associated distress, are basedon the subjective experience of the patient. Occasionally a patient may have adegree of cognitive impairment and may not be able to provide such detail. Inthese instances rely upon clinical signs of observed distress, as discussed underthe section Challenging Clinical Situations and Special Populations. \u007f Quantification of the Symptom(s) If possible, ask the patient to quantify the symptom in some way to provide an \"anchor\" for ongoing evaluation. Pain and fatigue, for example, can be describedon a severity scale of 0 to 10, and similar scales can be used for other symptoms.Words can also be helpful, such as \"mild,\" \"moderate,\" or \"severe.\" See Figure 3-2, the Memorial Pain Assessment Card, at the end of this chapter; 32 see section Symptom Measurement in Clinical Practice. \u007f Impact on Functional Capabilities Elicit the impact of each symptom on functional capabilities. (e.g., How does the fatigue limit you in daily activities?) Question 23 in the Brief Pain Inventory,Figure 3-3, provides a useful template for such questions. 33 \u007f Impact on Other Symptoms Explore the degree to which each symptom, or its treatment, induces or exacerbates other physical or psychological symptoms (e.g., Does the fatiguebecome more severe on the days that you also have high fevers? Do themedicines seem to cause sleepiness or confusion? Do you find thepain 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms III U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 51\u007f Impact of Specific Therapies on Each Symptom Clarify the impact of therapies on each symptom. Especially with palliative interventions, it is crucial in the process of symptom assessment to investigate the impact of specific therapies on each symptom to ascertain the efficacy ofthese therapies. Detailed questioning may be needed to clarify whichmedications or treatments a patient has tried and how well they relieved thesymptom. (For example, with the symptom of pain, did pain medicationsprovide you with any relief, and if yes, how much relief? For this question, a pain scale can help the patient to report on a scale of 0 to 10 his or her painlevel before the medication and pain level after the medication.) It is also important to ascertain why therapies may have been abandoned. Were they ineffective, too expensive, unavailable, associated with side effects,or were there other reasons? \u007f Impact of the Symptom(s) on the Patient's Quality of Life A symptom can produce many adverse effects on quality of life (see Table 3-3). The direct and indirect consequences of symptoms can exacerbate physical,psychosocial, spiritual, and financial burdens produced by the disease itself.Pain, for example, can restrict physical functioning or worsen depression andanxiety and interfere with a patient's ability to interact socially. Attentionmust extend beyond symptom control to the impact of symptoms on the overallquality of the patient's life. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a measurement tool that uses standardized questions to explore the impact of a symptom (see Figure 3-3). 33 See Figure 4-5 in Chapter 4 for the BPI Short Form. Question 23 on the BPI provides agood example of the kind of questions that providers should ask whenexploring the impact of almost any symptom. Also, questioning should address side effects and costs of therapy. The latter must be included in assessment so that a feasible treatment plan can be developed. Systems Review A systems review is an important aspect of assessment. Especially when a patient is experienc-ing multiple symptoms, it is not uncommon for him or her to overlook reporting a bothersomeproblem. For this reason, and because unexpected minor symptoms may provide important di-agnostic clues, it is prudent for clinicians to conduct a through systems review. History The patient's history of other medical, surgical or psychiatric problems is important to elicit.These problems can, of themselves, contribute to distress, impact potential treatment strate-gies, and cause symptoms. This aspect of the historytaking should include a review of all rel-evant past medical, surgical and psychiatric problems.

Clinicians may question the relevance of the causes of death of parents and siblings tothe situation of a patient with established advanced disease. Family history, however, is veryrelevant because it is a crucial part of the life experience of an individual. It is additionallyrelevant in the setting of AIDS, since multiple family members may be HIV-infected and patientsmay have already lost other family members to the same disease. The experience of family mem-bers' illnesses or deaths colors the life view and the fears of patients who themselves may befacing progressive disease and fearing the worst. Including questions about family members canhelp to elicit and\u2014ultimately, if possible\u2014allay fears. Questions can include ones along the lines of \"Did you provide the direct care for your mother/ father/sister/brother/child/friend during that illness?\" and/or \"Were there things that your rela-tive/friend experienced that have led you to worry about what you might encounter if your ownillness were to progress?\" Although this is a slight departure from the traditional family historyand does lead into the social history, it is an approach that begins to address psychologicalsymptoms such as anxiety, which in turn may be aggravating the distress of a \"physical\" symp-tom. For example, if a patient witnessed uncontrolled pain in a relative or friend, his or herassumption that this is the norm may influence his or her response to pain. As reflected by the inclusion of \"friend\" in the above questioning, with HIV-related illness it can be important to include the experience of others beyond family members in this line of questioning, either atthis point or in the social history. A question to ask might be, \"Have you known or cared forothers with the same or a similar illness to the illness that you have?\" Social History The social history provides an opportunity to elicit detail of the psychosocial assessment and can contribute to the clinician's understanding of the individual's distress and approaches that may assist in the modulation of that distress. Traditionally, in this part of an assessment, theclinician asks the patient about the following: \u007f Occupation \u007f Marital status\u007f Children\u007f History of smoking, alcohol use, and illicit drug use Chpt 3 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 5226 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms III U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 53These core aspects of the history are crucial. Of note, given that injection drug use is a risk factor for HIV infection and a factor that may interface with many aspects of symptom assess- ment and management, it is the most important factor to recognize. (Note: \"aberrant\" drug- related behaviors may be uncovered in the process of eliciting a social history that may suggestproblems with substance abuse or addiction. An approach to these is detailed in the sectionChallenging Clinical Situations and Special Populations.) In patients with advanced disease, for many reasons, the social assessment should usually be broad. In addition to eliciting the core of the social history, initial historytaking should addressthe following: \u007f Psychosocial assessment should reflect an understanding of the many factors that modulate distress, such as personality, coping, and both past and presentpsychiatric disorders. Questions that address the concept of coping andresources can be helpful (e.g., Are there things or people in your life that giveyou strength and help you to cope as you face this illness?). These questionscan also be symptom-specific (e.g., Are there things/people in your life thathave been helping you to cope with fatigue?). \u007f Cultural and spiritual assessment should reflect an understanding of, and respect for, family cultural and spiritual dynamics and the patient and family expectations and preferences for medical care and interactions. This aspect of assessment is crucial, especially in relation to sensitive issues related totreatment decisions towards the end of life. Practical issues that arise in thisaspect of the assessment can inform the development of treatment plans. Forexample, the clinician may come to understand the cultural or spiritualinterpretation that a patient or family has in relation to interventions such asparenteral feeding or ventilator support near the end of life. In addition, formany patients, cultural and spiritual practices and support can help toalleviate distress. \u007f The clinician should become aware of the patient's family and social resources, financial situation, and physical living environment. This point inthe history also provides an important opportunity to ascertain who is likely to assist with the patient's care in the home. Often, with advanced illness, family members are asked to function as health care providers in the home. A familymember who serves as the \"front-line\" caregiver plays a key role in symptommanagement, administration of medications, and reporting problems;therefore, he or she can be a crucial help in ongoing symptom assessment andmanagement. \u007f Knowledge of the patient's and family's previous experience with HIV infection or other progressive medical disease may provide useful insights into theresponse to physical illness or the genesis of psychological symptoms. The social history provides the clinician with information that can assist in optimizing the care of the patient with advanced illness. It can also identify aspects of the patient's illness experienceand distress that may be best addressed by others on the health care team or in the community.

This is often not included in historytaking but, like social history, is a highly relevantpart of symptom assessment and can assist the clinician greatly in defining appropriate treat-ment strategies. It also, somewhat obviously, should assist the clinician in ensuring that thepatient's priorities and goals are respected. Clinicians should include current goals of care inthe routine historytaking in a manner that reflects patient and family cultural preferences forcommunication. The patient's understanding of his or her current disease status usually should be assessed first. Although the exact approach to the patient may vary in certain cultures and family may play a large part in this discussion, goals should be explored as they relate to hopes for cure, life-sustaining treatments and comfort therapies. Once these goals have been elicited, a basis isdeveloped on which a clinician and the patient\u2014and, where appropriate, family\u2014can begin todiscuss treatment options and the realities of what can and cannot be achieved in the context ofany newly defined problems. Especially in the later stages of illness, where resistant symptomsmay be present, this very important aspect of the symptom assessment may influencedecisionmaking significantly. This is often a time in the historytaking when a question may also be appropriate about whether the patient or family has thought about or begun any advanced care planning. This sensitivearea is addressed in detail in Chapter 21: Patient-Clinician Communication. The nature of thequestioning will be influenced by the relationship of the patient and clinician and the culturalcontext in which the discussion occurs (e.g., \"Perhaps we could talk over what you understandabout your illness and how it has been going?\"). It may be appropriate in some circumstances toask about the patient's hopes and goals for particular treatments and fears for the future. Ap-proaches could include, \"What concerns you most about your illness?\" and \"What are your hopes(your expectations, your fears) for the future?\" 34 The approach to such questioning will obviously be different in some cultures. Also, differentapproaches are called for in situations in which a clinician has been the primary clinician car-ing for a patient over weeks, months or years as opposed to situations in which the patient is newto the clinician. Nonetheless, the clinician needs an understanding of what a patient under-stands about his or her stage of illness in order to begin dialogue about a symptom-relatedtreatment plan. (Note: Patients' understanding of their stage of illness can be a factor influenc-ing their distress; for example, patients may assume that because pain is much worse, the un-derlying disease has significantly progressed). Physical Examination, Investigations and Further Evaluation Having elicited the medical history, the clinician should proceed with a physical examination and further assessment if needed to address symptoms. This aspect of assessment is importantfor establishing the etiology of (the pathophysiologic process responsible for) each symptom. Inaddition to a thorough physical examination, symptom assessment must include review of theavailable laboratory and imaging data, and if needed, further specialized evaluations. \u007f An examination should, at a minimum, include all body systems relevant to the particular symptoms. With advanced HIV disease, given that multiple symptoms may be present and that unexpected clinical findings are notuncommon, a full clinical examination is usually appropriate.

Problem List and Treatment Plan At the conclusion of the history and examination, the clinician should seek to define a prob- lem list and establish a treatment plan that includes symptom assessment and measurementover time. \u007fDefinition of symptom etiology First the etiology of the symptom(s) should be defined, using knowledge of painsyndromes, other symptoms and common symptom complexes. Further, cliniciansshould recognize that a symptom may be isolated and caused by a new pathologicprocess or, alternatively, with multiple symptoms the situation may be morecomplicated. Symptoms may be concurrent but unrelated in etiology; concurrentand related to the same pathological process; concurrent with the one symptomdirectly or indirectly a consequence of a pathological process initiated by the othersymptom (e.g. vomiting may induce hypokalemia that results in an ileus withnausea, bloating and constipation); or concurrent with one symptom occurring as aconsequence or side effect of therapy directed towards treating the other. \u007fProblem list The clinician should create a problem list that reflects the clinical priorities,including, importantly, the patient's priorities. The treatment of symptoms that aredefined by the patient as particularly bothersome should be given high priority. \u007fTreatment plan If possible, the clinician should make a treatment plan for the etiology of the symptom(s). Some treatments can palliate a symptom by tackling the primarycause of the symptom. For example, in the case of sweats and chills associated witha fever, which in turn is caused by infection, a plan could be established fortreatment of the infection with appropriate antibiotics; in the case of exhaustionand fatigue caused by anemia and exacerbated by depression, a plan could be madeto treat the anemia and the depression. Sometimes, with advanced disease, a patient may elect not to seek treatment directed toward the cause of the problem. Such treatments themselves may beviewed as burdensome and possibly futile given the stage of the disease, particu-larly if the patient's goals direct the clinician to focus solely on quality of life. Insuch cases, it is important for the clinician to guide the patient regarding thepalliative outcomes likely with and without the treatment that would addressetiology. For example, although a patient may have elected to avoid life-prolongingtreatments there may be instances when antibiotics may be the most effectivemeans of palliating a symptom. Chpt 3 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 5526 Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 56A treatment plan for the distress associated with the symptom should be established. Some treatments may palliate the symptom by direct impact on the distress caused by the symptom. The treatment of pain with analgesics is an obvious example. Another example is the treatment of sweats and chillsassociated with fever (see Table 3-2) with antipyretics such as acetaminophenor a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication and physical methods ofcooling (including fanning, bathing, etc). Similarly, in a case of exhaustion andfatigue caused by anemia and exacerbated by depression it may be appropriateto consider a plan for counseling, support, assistance with daily activities, andother interventions to minimize the impact of fatigue (see Table 3-1). \u007fMonitoring plan A plan for monitoring the impact of symptom management over time is a crucial aspect of symptom assessment. Reassessment should betimely and practical. If a symptom is very severe or distressing, monitoringmay need to be undertaken within the hour; if a symptom is less severe, a different schedule should be set up. A monitoring plan should be appropriate for the patient's abilities. For example, if a patient cannot attend the hospitalfor a follow-up visit, a telephone call or home visit by a clinician may be a goodmethod for monitoring. At times it can be most helpful to use a tool orinstrument to facilitate effective monitoring and improve team communicationin the health care setting; see following section, Symptom AssessmentMethodology and Instruments. CHALLENGING CLINICAL SITUATIONS AND SPECIAL POPULATIONS Cognitive Impairment in Advanced Disease Cognitive impairment may occur in advanced disease and in the imminently dying. In such situations, detailed symptom assessment may be difficult. Nonetheless, while giving attentive care at the bedside a provider can generally ascertain whether a patient is distressed and canthen consider interventions that may be helpful in alleviating distress. Monitoring behaviors,including, for example, facial or physical movement, can be crucial in this process. A recent small study of 14 patients with cancer pain and severe cognitive failure found that during episodes of agitated cognitive failure, pain intensity as assessed by a nurse was signifi-cantly higher than the patient's assessment had been before and after the episode. 35 After com- plete recovery, none of the patients studied recalled having had any discomfort during the epi-sode. These data are difficult to interpret, but do highlight some important issues relevant toassessment. The authors of the study suggest that patients who recover from a severe episode ofdelirium may have no memory of the experience, including the pain, and that medical and nurs- ing staff are likely to overestimate the discomfort of patients with this condition. Although this may be true, another interpretation might be that patients with delirium may be acutely sensi-tive to many irritations including pain, noise and other factors, and therefore are at risk forcompounded distress in the presence of both delirium and one of these irritants. It is apparentthat if symptoms are to be controlled, clinicians must assess patients thoroughly to define eachproblem. When more than one problem is present (in this instance delirium and pain), eachproblem may warrant treatment in order to minimize distress; in this example, specific treat-ments may be needed for both pain and delirium.

Pediatric AIDS is a specialized area and discussed elsewhere .36 (See Chapter 12: The Care of Children and Adolescents.) Briefly, the age of the child and his or her ability to provide a report will influence the symptom assess-ment. Older children who can provide answers to questions can be assessed with greater easethan younger children. Careful attention to verbal cues and parental input is crucial in the pediatric population. Validated measures for many symptoms in this population are lacking, but a variety of measures have beendeveloped for the assessment of pain including visual analogue scales, \"faces\" scales, 37-42 and observational scales such as the Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress43 and the Procedure Behavior Checklist.39 The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) has been adapted for use in children aged 10to 18 years of age (see Figure 3-1). The MSAS can provide multidimensional information aboutsymptoms experienced by children. Its pediatric use to date, however, has been in the popula-tion with cancer and in the research setting rather than in clinical care. 44 Additional tools specifically for measuring pain in pediatric patients are presented at the end ofthis chapter in Figures 3-4 (a-d). Cultural and Language Barriers Symptom assessment and measurement can also present challenges in patients who differ in culture and language from the professionals providing their care. In cases where language barriersexist, meticulous attention should, where possible, be given to skilled translation. When measuring symptoms, only a few instruments have been shown to be reliable and valid across cultures and languages. 45, 46 Translation and appropriate symptom measures must be used. In the clinical setting, health care professionals can use simple, face-valid symptom measures to overcome language barriers. At the initial assessment the clinician can spend time with thepatient and an interpreter to develop a simple, two-language verbal rating scale for symptoms,which can be kept by the patient's bedside. To monitor the level of distress and impact of inter-ventions, such scales should address both symptom intensity and relief. This approach will helpto ensure that symptom distress is minimized even when interpreters are not available. In addi-tion, historytaking should explore cultural barriers to symptom assessment and management. Substance Abuse History or Problems Clinicians frequently report that symptom assessment is especially challenging when the patient has a previous or current problem with substance abuse or addiction. In addition, diffi-culty with symptom assessment also is common in situations in which the clinician is concernedthat a substance abuse problem may be present. In these situations, the assessment and man- agement of pain presents many difficult clinical issues. 47 However, as highlighted by Passik, et al., \"virtually any drug that acts on the central nervous system and any route of drug administra-tion, can be abused.\" 48, 49 The implication is that assessment of substance abuse is important when assessing a wide variety of symptoms including pain, anxiety, depression, insomnia and many others. In cases where substance abuse is defined as a problem, experience and skill incaring for such patients can be invaluable as the issues involved in care can be very complex. 47 Chpt 3 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 5726 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 58A full discussion of the assessment of the patient with a past history of, or active involvement in, substance abuse is beyond the scope of this chapter. (For a more in-depth discussion, see Chap-ter 11: Substance Use Problems.) The complex issues involved in the medical care of this popu- lation have been extensively reviewed in other texts. 47-50 Such care must include attention to both the HIV-related illness(es) and the substance abuse, along with the social and medical issues that each involves. In addition, it is important that clinicians who care for people withsubstance use problems be committed to providing optimal medical care. Such care must in-volve symptom management. An ongoing relationship between the clinician and patient thatcan foster both trust and continuity of care is optimal in all cases of advanced illness and is alsodesirable in this setting. A detailed history, as described in this chapter, should be undertaken in those with, or sus- pected to have, a history of substance use problems. As in all cases of patients reporting dis- tress, it is crucial for clinicians to focus on the detail of symptoms and on the distress associatedwith them, in order to define the underlying pathology and diagnosis and develop a treatmentplan. Careful assessment, combined with knowledge on the part of the clinician of pain syn-dromes, other symptoms, and common symptom complexes should facilitate the developmentof a diagnosis and treatment plan. Careful attention should be given specifically to assessmentfor concurrent psychiatric conditions, many of which have an increased prevalence in peoplewho have problems with substance use. Initially, it is important for the clinician to learn aboutthe patient's current status with regard to drug use and the situations and triggers that, in thepast, may have prompted the patient to turn to substance abuse. Clearly not all patients will beforthcoming with information relating to their substance use activities. Any inconsistenciesthat are uncovered during historytaking or from other clinicians or family must also be noted and their implications considered. In cases where substance abuse is being considered, eliciting the patient's social history is vital, as is speaking with others involved in the patient's medical care, where this is possible and withrespect for privacy issues. In this context it is important to consider the concept of aberrant drug-related behaviors . 48, 49 These include a broad range of behaviors that have been consid- ered problematic by clinicians prescribing opioids for pain. Table 3-4 presents the spectrum ofaberrant drug-related behaviors clinicians may encounter during treatment of the medically illwith prescription drugs. 48, 49 Table 3-4: Aberrant Drug-Related Behaviors* Behaviors more suggestive of addiction Selling prescription drugs Prescription forgery Stealing drugs from others Injecting oral formulations Obtaining prescription drugs from nonmedical sources Concurrent abuse of alcohol or illicit drugs Chpt 3 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 5826 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms III U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 59Behaviors more suggestive of addiction continued Repeated dose escalations or similar noncompliance despite multiple warnings Repeated visits to other clinicians oremergency rooms without informing prescriber Drug-related deterioration in function at work, in family or sociallyRepeated resistance to changes in therapy despite adverse drug effects Behaviors less suggestive of addiction Aggressive complaints about the need for more drugs Drug-hoarding during periods of reduced symptoms Requesting specific drugs Openly acquiring similar drugs from other medical sourcesOccasional unsanctioned dose escalation or other noncomplianceUnapproved use of the drug to treat another symptomReporting psychic effects not intended by the clinicianResistance to a change in therapy associated with tolerable adverse effectsIntense expressions of anxiety about recurrent symptoms * Based on clinical experience, these behaviors can be divided into those that are relatively more or less likely to be related to addiction.

Reproduced with permission. Copyright 1998. If aberrant behaviors are identified in a patient, the differential diagnosis of these behaviors should be explored (see Table 3-5). Aberrant behavior may occur in the setting of addiction. Italso seems likely that some behaviors are more suggestive of addiction than others. The differ-ential diagnosis of all of these behaviors is broad and includes many diagnoses and problemsother than addiction. 48, 49 Psychiatric disorders, confusional states, pseudo-addiction and crimi- nal intent are among the problems that should be considered. Pseudo-addiction refers to the presence of behaviors that are suggestive of addiction in a patient whose problem is not Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 60tion, but rather, unrelieved pain. In addition, social problems may be behind such behaviors, and occasionally a behavior listed as aberrant may occur in a patient who simply does not ad- here to the norms of social conventions. For example, a patient may borrow medications from another without obtaining a physician's prescription and although this is listed as an aberrant behavior it may be an isolated event occurring in the absence of serious problems.

It must be recognized that undertreatment of pain is currently a more common problem in most clinical settings (including the HIV clinical setting) than addiction and substance abuse.Nonetheless, consideration and monitoring of aberrant behaviors can provide clinicians withimportant information that can assist in assessing and treating symptoms and defining problems.The management of patients who have problems with substance abuse, and/or engage in aberrant drug-related behaviors for other reasons \"necessitates a comprehensive approach that recognizes the biological, chemical, social, and psychiatric aspects of substance abuse and addiction andprovides practical means to manage risk, treat pain effectively and ensure patient safety.\" 48, 49 SYMPTOM MEASUREMENT IN CLINICAL PRACTICE Recently it has been recognized that the use of symptom measurement raises the possibility of improving outcomes through careful and ongoing monitoring of distress. For example, the regular monitoring of pain in hospital settings is recommended to assess pain severity and relief in all patients at risk for pain.51, 52 Further, recommendations also suggest that clinicians should teach patients and families to use assessment tools in the home to promote continuity of painmanagement in all settings. The principles involved in routine pain assessment may be usefully applied for other symptoms. It is likely that the measurement of symptoms: \u007f Can improve patient outcomes by increasing staff awareness of symptoms, distress and the response of symptoms to treatment interventions \u007f Has the potential to increase patient attention to reporting distress Chpt 3 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 6026 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms III U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 61Symptom Assessment Methodology and Instruments A wide array of instruments is available for the assessment of symptoms. Numerous methods and instruments have been validated for the assessment of symptoms, including instruments forthe assessment of pain and depression. However, few instruments have been validated for many of the other symptoms that are prevalent in advanced HIV-related disease, such as anorexia or change in appearance. Although it is beyond the scope of this chapter to review all of the instru-ments available for the assessment of symptoms, broadly these instruments fall into two catego-ries, as follows: \u007f Symptom-specific instruments \u007f Instruments for the assessment of multiple symptoms Some instruments are more applicable in the research setting than in the clinical setting. When considering the use of instruments in the clinical setting, many factors must be considered, aspresented in Table 3-6. It is not always crucial for patients to complete a written instrument. Inmany cases, a verbal interaction between the patient and clinician that elicits a \"measure\" of a symptom can provide a useful report. For example, the clinician may ask, \"Can you tell me on a scale of 0 to 10 what level your pain is at right now? Zero refers to no pain and 10 the worstpossible pain.\" Table 3-6: Considerations for Symptom Measurement in Clinical Settings Patient-related factors Can the patient comprehend the method of measurement, and what is the impact of the patient's cognitive state on his or her report? How willing and able is the patient to provide reports and/ or complete an instrument?Are there cultural and language barriers that have impact on the symptom report?Is it possible that the patient may be reluctant to report a specific symptom?Is it important, in this particular patient, to assess one symptom or multiple symptoms?Do the patient's descriptions for the symptom accurately match those used in the method or instrument selected for reporting? (This is related to instrument validity.) Symptom-specific factors Which symptoms and dimensions of symptoms need to be assessed, from the patient's perspective? Usually \"distress\" or \"bothersomeness\" is important to consider. What symptoms or signs are crucial factors to monitor? E.g., in certain cases fever may be a \"vital sign\" and warrant some priority in assessment. Is the symptom important to detect and likely to go unnoticed? E.g., pain and confusion.

E.g., if factors continued a symptom only occurs when the patient moves, then assessment at rest would not provide useful information. Clinician resources What symptoms are amenable to intervention? E.g., hair loss may not be as amenable to intervention as pain;therefore pain may warrant a higher priority for routine measurement. What resources are available for monitoring symptoms and collecting data from symptom reports? If patients are asked to provide information, it is important that clinicans have the ability to review and respond to theinformation provided; unnecessary burden should not be imposed on patients. What are the factors related to the method selected for measurement?Has the method selected for measurement been demonstrated to be valid and reliable for the assessment of the symptom? Is it valid and reliable both in general and the patient's particular population? Does the method selected for measurement assess the clinically relevant symptoms, including dimensions and impact of the symptom? I.e., the dimensions or impact that the patient prioritizes. Does the method selected for measurement assess the symptoms in a timely manner? E.g., if asymptom is present at night or on movement, measurement must reflect this. How complex is the method selected for measurement, and what burden does this method of reporting impose on the patient? The following discussion presents the range of options available and the practical issues that may be important in selecting a method or instrument for monitoring a particular symptom in aparticular clinical setting. Specific instruments are discussed in detail, and some are illustratedby figures or tables. A more comprehensive review of this subject can be found in the Oxford Textbook of Palliative Medicine . 17 Chpt 3 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms III U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 63Unidimensional Scales for Assessing Symptom Intensity or Relief Instruments for the assessment of symptom intensity or relief are usually unidimensional scales and include visual analogue, numerical and categorical scales. Scales using numbers (e.g., zeroto 10), words (e.g., \"no pain,\" \"mild,\" \"moderate\"), faces, and other observational scales, havebeen the traditional focus of pain measurement (see Figures 3-2 and 3-4). 32, 37-43 While similar scales have not been validated for all symptoms, an approach in which symptoms are \"anchored\"with numbers or words can be useful in the routine assessment of symptoms. Increasingly clini-cians are using pain scores routinely in the inpatient setting along with the recording of vitalsigns. Instruments for Assessing Multiple Dimensions of a Symptom A more comprehensive evaluation of symptoms and their impact can be elicited by using instru-ments that define the multiple dimensions of a specific symptom. These instruments are usu- ally longer and often, therefore, less useful for routine use. An example of such an instrument isthe Brief Pain Inventory, shown in Figure 3-3. 33 This instrument serves to elicit a pain history, intensity, location and quality. Numeric scales (range one to 10) also indicate the intensity ofpain: pain at its worst, at its least, and pain \"right now.\" A percentage scale quantifies relief from current therapies. A body figure allows localization of the pain. Seven questions evaluate the degree to which pain interferes with function, mood and enjoyment of life. This instrumenthas now been translated into several languages. The Memorial Pain Assessment Card (MP AC) is a brief, validated measure that uses visual ana- logue scales to characterize pain intensity, pain relief and mood, and an eight-point verbal rat-ing scale to further characterize pain intensity (see Figure 3-2). The MP AC includes a moodscale that correlates with measures of overall psychological distress, depression and anxiety,and is considered to be a valid measure of global psychological distress. This instrument pro- vides limited information but it is simple to use and reliable and therefore a feasible instrument to use on a regular basis for monitoring difficult pain. 32 Fatigue is a symptom that is among the most prevalent in patients with advanced HIV-relatedillness. Its measurement provides an example of the complexity of measurement. Assessingfatigue is most important in the HIV-infected population as fatigue has been associated withsignificantly poorer physical functioning as well as a greater degree of overall psychologicaldistress and lower quality of life. 3 Unlike pain, fatigue has no generally accepted definition. In addition, fatigue itself may impose limitations on routine assessment. Fatigue is most usually characterized by a spectrum of disturbances that includes, among oth- ers, the following: \u007f Muscular weakness \u007f Lethargy \u007f Sleepiness \u007f Mood disturbance (particularly depression)\u007f Cognitive (such concentrating) Chpt 3 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 6326 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 64As a consequence of this complexity, the measurement of fatigue must attempt to capture this spectrum of disturbances. Although unidimensional scales can and have been used to assess fatigue, clearly a more meaningful assessment will evaluate its temporal dimensions, physical and psychological components, and associated distress. Unidimensional fatigue scales include single items in symptom checklists and the fatigue subscale of the Profile of Mood States.53, 54, 55 Another approach involves the assessment of specific symp- toms associated with fatigue\u2014for example, a visual analogue scale is used to assess \"drowsi-ness\" and other scales are used to evaluate the patient's cognitive status. Several multidimen-sional scales exist, including the 41-item Piper Fatigue Self Report Scale (PFS), which addressesthe severity, distress, and impact of fatigue 56 and the Visual Analogue Scale-Fatigue measure, an 18-item, multidimensional patient-rated instrument.57 While these scales are more applicable in the research setting than in the general clinical setting, the issues involved in the assessmentof fatigue highlight the need for accurate historytaking so the dimensions of the symptom that isdistressing the patient can be clearly defined. Instruments for Assessing Symptoms That May Otherwise Be Unnoticed Instruments to detect the presence of symptoms that may otherwise go unnoticed include thoseinstruments that routinely ask patients about the presence or absence of a symptom (or mul- tiple symptoms) and those that assess for the presence of impaired cognition. Some symptoms may not be reported but may nonetheless be important. Consequently, clinicians may elect toinclude routine measuring of such symptoms in clinical care. For this purpose, clinicians mayuse instruments for the assessment of a single symptom (e.g., pain) or multiple symptoms. Cognitive impairment and its associated symptoms, problems common in hospitalized patients and those with far advanced illness, are amenable to such routine monitoring. There are manyinstruments available for cognitive assessment. 58 In the clinical setting, some clinicians include brief cognitive screens in routine assessment to improve their ability to detect such problems. Screening tests for cognitive impairment include the Mini Mental Status Exam59 and the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test,60 Figures 3-5 and 3-6, respectively. Although these tools have been shown to be sensitive indicators of impairment,61, 62, 63 clinicians must be cautioned that the instruments are not specific for the diagnosis of delirium or dementia, both of whichmay occur in advanced HIV-related illness. Further assessment would be needed to make thesediagnoses. (See Chapter 10: Psychiatric Problems.) Instruments for Assessing Multiple Symptoms Instruments may be needed to assess and monitor multiple symptoms. To date, only a smallamount of research has focused on the role in routine clinical use of instruments that assessmultiple symptoms. Even less information is available that applies directly to patients with HIVinfection. In clinical settings, the main problem with instruments that assess multiple symptoms has been their length (which may limit their clinical utility for routine use). Nonetheless, some instrumentsare available that could be considered for use in monitoring multiple symptoms. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) is a nine-item, patient-rated symptom visual 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, AM 6426 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms III U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 65developed for use in assessing the symptoms of patients receiving palliative care.64 The ESAS, Figure 3-7, has been shown to be a valid instrument in cancer populations.65 In addition to assessing specific symptoms, it contains a \"distress\" score that tends to reflect physical well- being. Additional studies are needed to confirm its value in patients with HIV-related illness. The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS)6 is a validated, patient-rated measure that provides multidimensional information about a diverse group of common symptoms (see Figure3-1). This instrument assesses 32 physical and psychological symptoms in terms of intensity,frequency and distress. The MSAS has been used in research studies of patients with advancedHIV-related illness and has been modified for the pediatric setting. 3, 5, 44 Although this is a most helpful measure in research settings, its utility in the routine clinical setting may be limited. Recent research has, however, explored the role of an MSAS short version (Figure 3-8) that may be more useful in the clinical setting.7 Holzemer, et al., recently published research to validate a sign and symptom assessment tool forassessing the intensity of HIV-related symptoms. 66 The current version is a 26-item scale. This instrument is also likely to be used in the research setting; however, clinicians may wish toconsider its clinical applications. Using Signs to Monitor Symptoms Some clinical signs may be useful indicators of symptoms and therefore it may be helpful tomonitor these routinely in certain clinical settings. For example, the monitoring of patient tem-perature or the frequency of bowel movements and/or emesis may be useful routine methods ofdetecting\u2014or even anticipating and preventing\u2014symptoms that relate to these signs (e.g.,sweats, chills, abdominal pain, and nausea). In summary, measurement has a key role in the assessment of symptoms. Although measures frequently have limitations, if clinicians remain aware of these limitations the measurement ofsymptoms is likely to enhance their ability to effectively monitor and treat patient distress. CONCLUSION Systematic symptom assessment is a foundation of clinical practice and is crucial in treating HIV-related disease. Careful and meticulous clinical assessment should elicit the patient's perception of distressing symptoms and the pathophysiology responsible for each symptom. Acomprehensive assessment will facilitate the development of a treatment plan that can focus ontreating reversible pathologic processes, alleviating distress, and promoting quality of life.

Therefore, using more than one method of assessment may be helpful. The provider shouldascertain whether assessment tools are appropriate for the age and cognitive development ofeach individual child. For children over the ages of six or seven, the Pain Intensity Scales orPain Interview usually can be used. When children are unable to describe their pain in words,as occurs with infants and pre-verbal children, they must be watched carefully for behavioral signs of pain. Some examples of assessment tools appear below.

It is a sensitive indicator of cognitive impairment but is notspecific for the diagnosis of delirium or dementia. Cognitive impairment is a component ofdelirium and dementia, and in HIV infection both delirium and dementia can occur. De-lirium is especially common in the palliative care setting. This tool has been used as an initial screen to alert clinicians to the possibility of cognitive impairment and to monitor this condition. The MMSE is provider-administered and usuallytakes five to 10 minutes to complete. A score of 23 or less generally has been considered the cut- off for cognitive impairment; however, it is important to note that a child's educational level and language ability can affect the usefulness of MMSE scores and cut-off scores.Figure 3-5: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) MMSE Sample Items Orientation to Time \"What is the date?\" Registration \"Listen carefully, I am going to say three words.

The patient is asked to circle the most appropriate number on the numerical scale toindicate where the symptom lies between the two extremes. The circled number can then betranscribed onto a Symptom Assessment Graph. Ideally , patients fill out their own ESAS. Although caregiver-provided data have significant limitations, if a patient cannot independently complete the ESAS, then consideration can begiven to having a caregiver assist the patient in completing this instrument. That caregiverassistance was needed should always be documented in the space provided at the bottom of the ESAS Numerical Scale and the Graph, and the validity of this report will need to be consid- ered carefully . This instrument can be used for monitoring symptoms in the hospital or in a home care setting (through telephone or personal contact). It has been used in some settings on a weeklybasis.

OVERVIEW The advent of highly active antiretroviral treatment has not diminished the need for palliative care for people living with HIV/AIDS. In fact, because of new treatments, fewer patients are dyingfrom HIV/AIDS in the U.S. and the total number of people living with HIV/AIDS is increasing. Newtreatments, particularly HAART, are also responsible for additional symptoms and complications,including pain that must be understood and managed. Additionally, as the epidemiology of the AIDSepidemic changes in the United States, the challenge of managing pain in AIDS patients who havea history of substance abuse is a growing issue.Several studies have documented that pain in individuals with HIV infection or AIDS is: 1-12 \u007f Highly prevalent, diverse, and varied in syndromal presentation\u007f Associated with significant psychological and functional morbidity\u007f Alarmingly undertreated Moreover, pain has a profound negative impact both on physical and psychological functioning andoverall quality of life. 7, 11 It is important, therefore, that pain management be more integrated into the total care of patients with HIV disease.13 This chapter describes the types and prevalence of pain syndromes encountered in patients with HIV disease and reviews the psychological and functionalimpact of pain as well as the barriers to adequate pain treatment in this population. Finally, thechapter outlines the principles of pain management.Pain is classified in two major categories, nociceptive and neuropathic pain (see Table 4-1). 14 Noci- ceptive pain derives from the stimulation of intact 'nociceptors' or pain receptors in afferent nervesand is further subdivided into somatic pain (involving skin, soft tissue, muscle and bone) and visceral pain (involving internal organs and hollow viscera). Nociceptive pain may be well-localized (com- mon in somatic pain) or more diffuse (common in visceral pain), and may be sharp, dull, aching,gnawing, throbbing, constant, or spasmodic, with varying intensity. Neuropathic pain involves stimu-lation of damaged or compromised nerve tissue, and may be burning, tingling, stabbing, shooting,with a sensation of electric shock, or allodynia (the sensation of pain or discomfort produced by aminimal stimulus such as light touch to the skin). The differentiation of pain into one of these sub-types (particularly nociceptive vs. neuropathic) can help in determining appropriate Chpt 04 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 8526 Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 4: Pain U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 86Table 4-1: Classification of Pain Nociceptive Pain \u007f Results from stimulation of intact 'nociceptors' (pain receptors) \u007f Includes: somatic pain (involving skin, soft tissue, muscle, bone); visceral pain (involving internal organs, hollow viscera) opioid and non-opioid analgesics Neuropathic Pain \u007f Results from stimulation of damaged or compromised nerve tissue \u007f Responds to opioid and non-opioid analgesics AND adjuvant medications Summary of Pain Syndromes in HIV/AIDS Pain syndromes encountered in AIDS are diverse in nature and etiology (see Table 4-2). The most common pain syndromes reported in studies to date include painful sensory peripheral neuropathy, pain due to extensive Kaposi's sarcoma, headache, oral and pharyngeal pain, abdominal pain, chestpain, arthralgias and myalgias, and painful dermatologic conditions. 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18 Table 4-2: Pain Syndromes and Most Common Pain Diagnoses Pain Type N % Patients (n=151) Somatic pain 107 71 Neuropathic pain 69 46 Visceral pain 44 29 Headache 69 46 Pain Diagnosis Joint pains 47 31 Polyneuropathy 42 28 Muscle 40 27 Skin 23 15Bone 31 20 Abdominal 25 17 Chest 19 13 Radiculopathy 18 12 Source: Reprinted with permission from Hewitt D, McDonald M, Portenoy R, et al.

Table 4-3: Pain Syndromes in HIV/AIDS Patients biopsies) Pain Unrelated to AIDS \u007f Disc disease \u007f Diabetic neuropathy In studies to date, approximately 45% of pain syndromes encountered are directly related to HIV infection or consequences of immunosuppression; 15% to 30% are due to therapies for HIV- or AIDS-related conditions and to diagnostic procedures; and the remaining 25% to 40% are unrelated to HIV or its therapies. 2, 6 Chpt 04 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 8726 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 4: Pain U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 88Pain in Women with HIV/AIDS One study has suggested that women with HIV disease experience pain more frequently than men with HIV disease and report somewhat higher levels of pain intensity.6, 19 This may in part reflect the fact that women with AIDS-related pain are twice as likely as men to be undertreated for their pain.3 Women with HIV disease have unique pain syndromes of a gynecologic nature specifically related toopportunistic infectious processes and cancers of the pelvis and genitourinary tract, and in onesurvey women with AIDS were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with radiculopathy andheadache. 6, 20 Pain in Children with HIV/AIDS Children with HIV infection also experience pain.21 HIV-related conditions in children that are observed to cause and \u007f Spasticity associated with encephalopathy that causes painful muscle spasms For more information on HIV palliative care in children, see Chapter 12: The Care of Children and Adolescents. SPECIFIC PAIN SYNDROMES IN PATIENTS WITH HIV DISEASE The following section reviews, in detail, the various painful manifestations of HIV disease. The author acknowledges the important review by O'Neill and Sherrard that formed the basis of thissection on specific pain syndromes in HIV disease. 10 Gastrointestinal Pain Syndromes Many of the opportunistic infections and HIV-associated neoplasms as well as side effects of some commonly used antiretroviral medications may present as pain referable to the gastrointestinal tract. Generally the pain will be alleviated by specific treatment of the causative diseases or by chang-ing treatments. Adequate analgesia should be provided during diagnostic assessment. 10 For more information, see Chapter 7: Gastrointestinal Symptoms. Chpt 04 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 4: Pain IV U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 89Oropharyngeal Pain Oral cavity and throat pain is very common, accounting for approximately 20% of the pain syndromes encountered in one study.8 Common sources of oral cavity pain are candidiasis; necrotizing gingivi- tis; and dental or histoplasmosis. Frequently no infectious agent can be identified and these painful recurrentaphthous ulcers (RAU) are a clinically challenging problem. 10 RAU can be controlled with topical steroids (mixed with Orabase), systemic steroids, and/or thalidomide. Up to 75% of patients withcutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) also have intraoral lesions, most commonly on the palate, althoughthese seldom cause pain. 10 Finally, zalcitabine (ddC) can cause a painful stomatitis. For more infor- mation, see Chapter 8: Oral Problems. Esophageal Pain Many HIV/AIDS patients experience dysphagia or odynophagia, most commonly caused by esoph-ageal candidiasis. Ulcerative esophagitis, which can be quite painful, is usually a result of CMV infec-tion but can be idiopathic. Thalidomide has been used successfully in this case. Infectious causes of esophagitis include: been reported to invade the esophagus resulting in dysphagia, pain and ulceration. 10 Zidovudine and zalcitibine (ddC) have been implicated in esophagitis as have been non-steroidal medications. Abdominal Pain The abdomen is the primary site of pain in 12-25% of patients with HIV disease.6, 8, 22 Infectious causes of abdominal pain (MAI). Perforation of the small and large intestine secondary to CMV infection has been described. 22 Re- peated intussusception of the small intestine has been seen in association with Campylobacter infection.23 Lymphoma in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can present with abdominal pain and intes- tinal obstruction.10, 24 Other causes of abdominal pain in HIV positive patients10 include ileus, organomegaly, gonococcal or chlamydia infection). Many antiretroviral agents are responsible for GI symptoms but lactic acidosis, a rare but serious complication of some HAART regimens, can present with abdominal pain. Didanosine (ddI),zalcitabine (ddC) and stavudine (d4T) can cause pancreatitis (see below) and patients taking indinivirare at increased risk for nephrolithiasis. Biliary Tract and Pancreatic Pain Cholecystitis is a painful condition that may occur in HIV-infected patients as a result of opportunis-tic infection, with CMV and cryptosporidiosis being the most common infectious agents. Pain fromextrahepatic biliary tract obstruction secondary to KS or MAI infection has been reported. 10 Scleros- ing cholangitis (CMV, cryptosporidiosis) can cause right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, andopportunistic liver infections (CMV, MAI, fungal infections) hepatic toxici- ties (ddI, pentamidine, ritonavir and nevarapine) are sources of hepatitis and abdominal right Chpt 04 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 8926 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 4: Pain U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 90upper quadrant pain.25 Viral hepatitis (especially hepatitis B or C) is an increasingly common co- infection and cause of hepatic pain. Pancreatitis, an extremely painful condition, is often related to adverse effects of HIV-related thera- pies, in Intravenous CMV and KS. abscesses, CMV proctitis, fissure-in-ano,and HPV and HSV infection. Chest Pain Syndromes Chest pain is a common complaint in patients with HIV disease, comprising approximately 13% of the pain syndromes encountered in a sample of ambulatory AIDS patients.6 Sources of chest pain in patients with HIV disease are similar to those encountered in the general population, i.e., cardiac,esophageal, lung and pleura, and chest wall. However, the etiologies may be somewhat unique, i.e.,opportunistic infections and cancers. The index of suspicion for coronary artery disease, even inyoung patients with no other risk factors, must be high if the patient is being treated with HAART. In immunosuppressed patients, infectious causes of chest pain should be considered, particularly in the presence of fever and some localizing sign such as dysphagia, dyspnea, or cough. Infectiouscauses of chest pain include the following: \u007fPneumocystis pneumonia pericardium, chest wall, lung and pleura may also be sources of chest pain. Rarely, pulmonary embolus or bacterial endocarditis may bethe cause of chest pain. For more information, see Chapter 6: Pulmonary Symptoms. Neurological Pain Syndromes Pain syndromes originating in the nervous system include headache, painful peripheral neuro- pathies, radiculopathies, and myelopathies. The HIV virus is highly neurotropic, invading central and peripheral nervous system structures early in the course of HIV disease. Consequently, many complications of HIV/AIDS and opportunisticinfections result in neurological pain, and many commonly used HIV/AIDS medications can also beimplicated in neurological pain. Rarely, cerebrovascular events (e.g., thalamic stroke) occurring in hypercoagulable states can result in central syndromes.

Other opportunistic infections of the central nervous system that can present as headache in the AIDSpatient One of the most common causes of headache without focal findings is sinusitis. Opportunistic cancers of the central nervous system include central nervous system lymphoma, metastaticsystemic lymphoma, and metastatic intracranial KS. These can present, particularly in theimmunocompromised patient with HIV disease, with signs of increased intracranial pressure withor without focal neurological signs, as well as fever and meningismus. More benign causes of headache in the patient with HIV disease include AZT-induced headache; tension headache; migraine with or without aura; and unclassifiable or idiopathic headache. Evers and colleagues in 1999 concluded that the progressing immunological deficiency of HIV-infected patients seems to influence the pain processing of headache in different ways. 27 During that natural course of infection, the migraine frequency significantly decreased, while the frequency of tensiontype headaches increased. 27 Neuropathies Neuropathic pain occurs in about 40% of AIDS patients.6 While several types of peripheral neuropa- thy have been described in patients with HIV/AIDS (see Table 4-4), the most common painful neu- ropathy encountered is the predominantly sensory neuropathy (PSN) of AIDS.

This is typically a late manifestation, occurring most often in patients with anAIDS-defining illness. 30 The prevalence of this neuropathy in hospice populations ranges from 19% to 26%.17, 31, 32 The predominant symptom in about 60% of patients is pain in the soles of the feet. Paraesthesia isfrequent and usually involves the dorsum of the feet and soles. Most patients have signs of peripheralneuropathy (most commonly, absent or reduced ankle jerks and elevated thresholds to pain andvibration sense); and, while the signs progress, the symptoms often remain confined to the feet. 30, 33, 34 Although the patients' complaints are predominantly sensory, electrophysiological studies demon- strate both sensory and motor involvement. \u007f Immune-mediated Neuropathies Acute Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome has been described in association with seroconversion (group-Iinfection) but may occur at any time. Both acute and chronic inflammatory demyelinatingpolyneuropathies are predominantly motor-related, and sensory abnormalities are rare. 35 Mononeuritis multiplex presents with sensory or motor deficits in the distribution of multiple spinal,cranial or peripheral nerves and may progress into a chronic inflammatory demyelinatingpolyneuropathy. 35, 36 \u007f Infectious Neuropathies Polyradiculopathies (associated with CMV infection) often present with radicular pain and followa distinct course. 37 The onset is usually subacute and the deficit initially confined to sacral and lumbar nerve roots. Both sensory and motor functions are involved, and there is usually early involve-ment of sphincters. Progression is relentless. 35 Harrison and colleagues identified three variables related to herpes zoster pain: extent of lesionhealing; extension of lesion crusting; and the number of new vesicles. 38 According to their study, the significance of baseline pain due to herpes zoster was a predictor of return to daily life functioning. Furthermore, the significance of pain at presentation and at one month was a significant predictorof chronic pain. 38 \u007f Toxic/nutritional Neuropathies Toxic and nutritional neuropathies in patients with HIV disease have been reported with the follow-ing: 29, 33 \u007f Alcohol \u007f Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 4: Pain U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 94\u007f Painful Neuropathies According to Stage of HIV Infection In general, the type of neuropathy varies with the stage of infection,29 as follows: \u007f The acute or seroconversion phase of HIV disease is associated with mononeuritides, brachial plexopathy and acute demyelinating phase (CD4+ T is characterized by acute chronic demyelinating polyneuropathies \u007f The transition phase (200-500 CD4+ herpes zoster (shingles) and mononeuritis multiplex \u007f The late phase of HIV disease (<200 CD4+ cells) is characterized by neuropathies Rheumatological Pain Syndromes In studies conducted by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering group, over 50% of pain syndromes were classified as rheumatologic in nature including various forms of arthritis, arthropathy, arthralgia,myopathy, myositis and myalgias. 6 Arthritis and Arthropathies HIV disease has been associated with several types of painful arthritis and arthropathies includ-ing: The most frequently reported arthritis is a reactive arthritis or Reiter's syndrome. 40, 41, 43 Acute HIV infection may present with a polyarthralgia in association with a mononucleosis-like illness. Thereis also a syndrome of acute severe and intermittent articular pain, often referred to as HIV-associatedpainful articular syndrome, which commonly affects the large joints of the lower limbs and shoul-ders. Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis have been reported in patients with HIV infection. 40, 44 The arthritis is typically seen in conjunction with the skin changes of psoriasis, and authors O'Neill andSherrard suggest it may follow a disease course that proves refractory to conventional therapy. 10 An HIV-associated arthritis also was described by Rynes, et al., which typically presents as an oligoarthritisaffecting the joints of the lower limbs. 44 Septic arthritis has been reported in patients with HIV disease, including arthritis due to bacterial infections and infections with Cryptococcus neoformans and Sporothrix schenckii .40, 41 Myopathy and Myositis Muscle pain is very common in patients with HIV disease. Several types of myopathy and myositis have been described, including: 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51 Chpt 04 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 9426 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 4: Pain IV U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration Microsporidiosis myositis Polymyositis may occur at any stage of HIV infection; it is thought to be the result of direct viral infection of muscle cells 40 and may present with a sub-acute onset of proximal muscle weakness and myalgia.45 Electromyographic myopathy, serum creatinine kinase, and biopsy evidence of polymyositis are common in symptomatic patients. Drugs used in the treatment of HIV disease may also be associated with the development of myalgia26 and myositis.46, 52 Zidovudine has been particularly implicated; symptoms frequently improve following discontinuation of zidovudinetherapy. 10 OVERVIEW OF PAIN MANAGEMENT IN HIV/AIDS Optimal management of pain requires a multidisciplinary approach. The initial assessment should shed light on etiology and contributing factors as well as establish a baseline from which to monitor the impact of therapy. Pain assessment tools for noting the intensity of pain, time, dose, and impact of medications are discussed below. Clear communication between provider and patient/family isimportant to monitor the impact of any intervention (see Chapter 21: Patient-Clinician Communi-cation). WHO Pain Ladder Choice of analgesic agents should follow the World Health Organization's pain ladder (see Figure 4-1): \u007f Non-narcotic analgesics are the first step, for mild pain \u007f Weak opioids are the second step, for moderate pain\u007f Strong opioids are the third step, for severe pain It is important that providers be comfortable with the use of one or two medications in each analgesic step (see Tables 4-6, 4-7 and 4-8), including management of side effects; conversion from one step, or level, to another; drug interactions (see Chapter 27: Pharmacologic Interactions of Clinical Sig- nificance); and dosing schedules. Adjuvant treatments are important components of the pain ladder and have key roles in AIDS, par- ticularly in management of neuropathic pain. Assessment Issues Dame Cicely Saunders introduced the concept of total pain in the early years of the hospice movement in the United Kingdom.53 This approach emphasizes the need to keep in mind psychologi- cal, social, and spiritual aspects as well as physical aspects when approaching a patient in pain.Therefore, a close collaboration of the entire health care team is optimal when attempting to ad-equately manage pain in the AIDS patient. The initial step in pain management is a comprehensive assessment of pain symptoms. A health professional in the AIDS setting must have a working knowledge of the etiology and treatment of painin AIDS, including an understanding of the different types of AIDS pain syndromes discussed as well as a familiarity with the parameters of appropriate pharmacologic treatment.

Pain descriptors (e.g., burning, shooting, dull or sharp) will help determine the mechanism of pain(somatic, nociceptive, visceral nociceptive, or neuropathic) and may suggest the likelihood of patientresponse to various classes of traditional and adjuvant analgesics (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs, opioids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, oral local anesthetics, corticosteroids, etc.). 58, 59, 60 Additionally, detailed medical, neurological and psychosocial assessments (including a history ofsubstance use or abuse) must be conducted. Where possible, family members or partners should beinterviewed and included in the pain management treatment plan. During the assessment phase,pain should be aggressively treated while pain complaints and psychosocial issues are subject to anongoing process of re-evaluation. 56 Pain Measurement/Assessment Tools Pain assessment is continuous and needs to be repeated over the course of pain treatment. Readily available, simple and clinically validated pain self-report measures or tools can make pain assess-ment easier and more reliable. There are essentially four aspects of pain experience in AIDS thatrequire\u2014and can be aided by\u2014ongoing assessment and evaluation: \u007f Pain intensity (see Figures 4-2, and 4-4) \u007f Pain relief (see Figure 4-1)\u007f Pain-related functional interference (e.g., mood state, general and specific activities) \u00b7\u007f Monitoring of intervention effects. Many pain assessment tools rely on visual analog testing. Three commonly used self-report pain intensity assessment tools, illustrated in Figure 4-2, are a simple descriptive pain intensity scale, a 0-10 numeric pain intensity scale, and a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain intensity. The Pain Facesscale, shown in Figure 4-3, can be used with children, patients who do not share a common languagewith the provider, or illiterate patients. The Memorial Pain Assessment Card (MPAC) may also beused, since it is a helpful clinical tool that allows patients to report their pain experience. 61 The MPAC consists of visual analog scales that measure pain intensity, pain relief and mood (see Figure 4-4). The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is another pain assessment tool (Figure 4-5) that has been widely used in cancer and AIDS pain research and clinical settings.62 The BPI has a useful Pain Interfer- ence Subscale that assesses pain's interference in seven domains of quality of life and function.

Multimodal Approach Federal guidelines developed by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) for the management of cancer pain also address the issue of pain management in AIDS. The guidelinesstate, the principles of pain assessment and treatment in the patient with HIV/AIDS are not funda- mentally different from those in the patient with cancer and should be followed for patients withHIV/AIDS. 58 In contrast to pain in cancer, pain in HIV disease more commonly may have an under- lying Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 4: Pain U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 104Optimal management of pain in AIDS requires pharmacologic, psychotherapeu- approaches. A multidimen- sional model of AIDS pain that recognizes the interaction of cognitive, emotional, socioenvironmental and nociceptive aspects of pain suggests a model for multimodal intervention. PHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS FOR PAIN The World Health Organization has devised guidelines for analgesic management of cancer pain which the AHCPR has endorsed for the management of pain related to cancer or AIDS.58, 59 These guidelines, also known widely as the WHO Analgesic Ladder (Figure 4-1), have been well validated.65 This approach advocates selection of analgesics based on the severity of pain as well as the type of pain (i.e., neuropathic vs. non-neuropathic pain). For pain that is mild to moderate in severity, non-opioid analgesics such as NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and acetaminophenare recommended. For pain that is persistent and moderate to severe in intensity, opioid analgesicsof increasing potency (such as morphine) should be utilized. Adjuvant agents, such as laxatives and psychostimulants, are useful in preventing as well as treating opioid side effects such as constipation or sedation respectively. Adjuvant analgesic drugs, such asthe antidepressant analgesics, are suggested for considered use, along with opioids and NSAIDs, inall stages of the analgesic ladder (mild, moderate or severe pain), but have their most important clinical application in the management of neuropathic pain. The WHO approach, while not yet validated in AIDS, has been recommended by the AHCPR and clinical authorities in the fields of pain management and AIDS. 8, 10, 12, 17, 29, 58, 66 In addition, clinical reports have appeared in recent literature describing successful application of the WHO AnalgesicLadder principles to pain management in AIDS, with particular emphasis on the use of opioids. 9, 17, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 Non-Opioid Analgesics The non-opioid analgesics are prescribed principally for mild-to-moderate pain or to augment the analgesic effects of opioid analgesics in the treatment of severe pain (see Table 4-6). The use of NSAIDsin patients with AIDS must be accompanied by heightened awareness of toxicity and adverse effects.NSAIDs are highly protein-bound, and the free fraction of available drug is increased in AIDS patientswho are cachectic, wasted and hypoalbuminic, often resulting in toxicities and adverse effects. Pa-tients with AIDS are frequently hypovolemic, on concurrent nephrotoxic drugs, and experiencing HIVnephropathy, and so are at increased risk for renal toxicity related to NSAIDs. The antipyretic effects of the NSAIDs may also interfere with early detection of infection in patients with AIDS. Major adverse effects associated with NSAIDs include the following: \u007f Gastric as salsalate, sodium salicylate, and choline magnesium salicy- late, theoretically have fewer gastrointestinal (GI) side effects and might be considered in caseswhere GI distress is an issue.

NSAIDs affect kidney function and should be used with caution. NSAIDs can cause decrease in glomerular filtration, acute and chronic renal failure, interstitial nephritis, papillary necrosis, andhyperkalemia. 72 Especially in patients with renal impairment, NSAIDs should be used with caution, since many (e.g. , ketoprofen, feroprofen, naproxen and carpofen) are highly dependent on renal function for clearance. The risk of renal dysfunction is greatest in patients with advanced age,preexisting renal impairment, hypovolemia, concomitant therapy with nephrotoxic drugs and heartfailure. Prostaglandins modulate vascular tone and their inhibition by the NSAIDs can cause hyper-tension as well as interference with the pharmacologic control of hypertension. 73 Caution should also be used with patients receiving B-adrenergic antagonists, diuretics, or angio-tensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Several studies have suggested that there is substantial biliaryexcretion of several NSAIDs, including indomethacin and sulindac. In patients with hepatic dys-function, these drugs should be used with caution. NSAIDs, with the exception of the nonacetylatedsalicylates (e.g., sodium salicylate, cholinemagnesium trisalicylate), produce inhibition of plateletaggregation (usually reversible, but irreversible with aspirin). NSAIDs should be used with extremecaution, or avoided, in patients who are thrombocytopenic or who have clotting impairment. Opioid Analgesics Opioid analgesics are the mainstay of pharmacotherapy for moderate-to-severe intensity pain in the patient with HIV disease (see Table 4-7). Principles of Opioid Pharmacotherapy It is important that the provider have a systematic approach to the use of opiates to provide around-the-clock pain coverage. (Other than as backup for breakthrough pain, PRN dosing should never beused for treatment of chronic pain.) If a patient has no prior experience with opiates, adequate reliefmay be achieved with weaker opiates such as codeine or hydrocodone. More severe pain or pain ina non-naive patient may require starting with morphine, hydromorphone, or other potent agents. Ifa patient needs more than two or three pills every four hours to control pain, the provider shouldswitch to a stronger agent. In order to switch from one opiate to another, use a simple calculation to estimate the relative po- tency of regimes: convert both the current medication and the new medication to oral morphineequivalents (see Table 4-7) . Then, estimate the number of oral morphine equivalents needed to control pain for a 24-hour period based on the current regimen. A dosing schedule and dose that will provide the same number of morphine equivalents can then be determined based on the pharmaco- logical properties of the new drug choice. The optimal regimen is one that will keep the patient comfortable and maintain his or her quality of life. The regimen should prevent breakthrough pain from occurring, and should minimize iatro-genic complications and cost. Provision for breakthrough pain or incident (usually movement-re- lated) pain should be provided, usually 50% to 100% of the around-the-clock dose. Careful records ofthe breakthrough doses should be maintained so that appropriate increases in the around-the-clockregimen can be calculated. Increases in the around-the-clock dose should, in general, never be less than 25% of the base dose.

Opioid with mixed agonist-antagonist properties include penta-zocine, butorphanol, and nalbuphine. These drugs can reverse opioid effects and precipitate an opioidwithdrawal syndrome in a patient who is opioid-tolerant or dependent. They are of limited use inmanaging chronic pain in AIDS. Oxycodone (in combination with either aspirin or acetaminophen),hydrocodone, and codeine are the so-called weaker opioid analgesics and are indicated for use in step two of the WHO ladder for mild-to-moderate intensity pain. More severe pain is best managed withmorphine or another of the stronger opioid analgesics, such as hydromorphone, methadone,levorphanol, or fentanyl. Oxycodone, single agent without aspirin or acetaminophen, is availablein immediate and sustained-release forms and is considered a stronger opioid in these forms. Routes of Administration The oral route has often been described as the preferred route of administration of opioid analgesics from the perspectives of convenience and cost. However, the transdermal route of administrationhas gained rapid acceptance by clinicians and patients since patients are often taking many oralmedications. Patients with HIV infection are burdened with taking anywhere from 20 to 40 tablets of medication per day and often need to follow complicated regimens where medication has to be taken on anempty stomach, etc. In a study on patient-related barriers to pain management in AIDS patients, thevast majority of AIDS patients endorsed a preference to utilize a pain intervention that required a minimal number of additional pills (e.g., sustained-release preparations of oral opioids) or interven- tions that did not require taking pills at all (e.g., transdermal opioid system). 74 Immediate-release oral morphine or hydromorphone drug preparations must be taken every threeto four hours. Longer-acting, sustained-release oral morphine preparations and oxycodone prepa-rations are available that provide up to 8 to 12 hours or more of analgesia, minimizing the number ofdaily doses required to control persistent pain. Rescue doses of immediate-release, short-actingopioid are often necessary to supplement the use of sustained-release morphine or oxycodone, par-ticularly during periods of titration or pain escalation. The transdermal fentanyl patch system (Duragesic) has useful applications in the management of severe pain in AIDS. 67, 69 Each transdermal fentanyl patch contains a 48- to 72-hour supply of fenta- nyl, which is absorbed from a depot in the skin. Levels in the plasma rise slowly over 12 to 18 hoursafter patch placement so dosage forms are available. As with sustained-release morphine prepara-tions, all patients should be provided with oral or parenteral rapidly acting short duration opioids tomanage breakthrough pain. The transdermal system is convenient and can minimize the remindersof pain associated with repeated oral dosing of analgesics. In AIDS patients, it should be noted thatthe absorption of transdermal fentanyl could be increased with fever, resulting in increased plasma levels and shorter duration of analgesia from the patch. It is important to note that opioids can be administered through a variety of routes: oral, rectal, transdermal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intraspinal and even intraventricular. 69 There are advantages and disad- vantages, as well as indications for use of these various routes.

Their side effects are common but when anticipated can be minimized. Sedation is a common CNS side effect, especially during the initiation of treat-ment. Sedation usually resolves after the patient has been maintained on a steady dosage. Persistentsedation can be alleviated with a psychostimulant, such as dextroamphetamine, pemoline or meth-ylphenidate, which are all prescribed in divided doses in early morning and at noon. Additionally,psychostimulants can improve depressed mood and enhance analgesia. 75, 76 Delirium, either agitated or somnolent, can also occur while a patient is on opioid analgesics. De-lirium is usually accompanied by attentional deficits, disorientation, and perceptual disturbances(visual hallucinations and more commonly illusions). Myoclonus and asterixis are often early signsof neurotoxicity that accompany the course of opioid-induced delirium. Meperidine (Demerol), when administered chronically in patients with renal impairment can lead to a delirium due to accumu- lation of the neuro may alleviate opioid-induced delirium: \u007f Lowering the dose of the opioid drug presently in use \u007f Changing to a different opioid \u007f Treating the delirium with low doses of high potency neuroleptics, such as haloperidol The strategy of using high potency neuroleptics is especially useful for agitation, and clears the sensorium.78 For agitated states, intravenous haloperidol in doses starting at between 1 mg and 2 mg is useful, with rapid escalation of dose if no effect is noted. Gastrointestinal side effects of opioid analgesics are common. The most prevalent are nausea, vom- iting, and constipation.60 Concomitant therapy with prochlorperazine for nausea is sometimes effec- tive. Since not all opioid analgesics are tolerated in the same manner, switching to another narcoticcan be helpful if an anti-emetic regimen fails to control nausea. Constipation caused by narcoticeffects on gut receptors is a frequently encountered problem that tends to be responsive to the regularuse of senna derivatives. A careful review of medications is imperative, since anticholinergic drugssuch as the tricyclic antidepressants can worsen opioid-induced constipation and cause bowel ob-struction. Respiratory depression is a worrisome but rare side effect of the opioid analgesics. Respiratory diffi- culties can almost always be avoided by adhering to two general principles: \u007f Start opioid analgesics in low doses in opioid-naive Be cognizant of relative potencies when switching opioid analgesics, routes of administration, or both Adjuvant Analgesics Adjuvant analgesics are the third class of medications frequently prescribed for the treatment of chronic pain and have important applications in the management of pain in AIDS (see Table 4-8).Adjuvant analgesic drugs are used to enhance the analgesic efficacy of opioids, treat concurrentsymptoms that exacerbate pain, and provide independent analgesia. They may be used in all stagesof the WHO analgesic ladder. Commonly used adjuvant drugs include antidepressants, neuroleptics,psychostimulants, anticonvulsants, corticosteroids and oral anesthetics. 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 10926 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 4: Pain U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 110Table 4-8: Psychotropic Adjuvant Analgesic Drugs for HIV/AIDS Pain Approximate Daily Dosage Generic Name Range (MG) Route TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS Amitriptyline 10-150 q4h -q6h 400 tid PO Phenytoin 300-400 PO Valproate 500 tid - 1000 tid PO Gabapentin 300 tid - 1000 tid PO ORAL LOCAL ANESTHETICS Mexiletine 600-900 PO CORTICOSTEROIDS IV=intravenous; q6h=every 6 hours bid = twice a day, tid = three times a day, qid = four times a day Chpt 04 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 11026 picasA Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 4: Pain IV U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 111Antidepressants The current literature supports the use of antidepressants as adjuvant analgesic agents in the man- agement of a wide variety of chronic pain syndromes, including cancer pain, postherpetic neuralgia,diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, headache and low back pain. 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84 The antidepressants are analgesic through a number of mechanisms that include antidepressant activity,80 potentiation or enhancement of opioid analgesia, 85, 86, 87 and direct analgesic effects.88 The leading hypothesis suggests that both serotonergic and noradrenergic properties of the antide- pressants are important, and that variations among individuals in pain (as to the status of their ownneurotransmitter systems) are an important variable. 54 Other possible mechanisms of antidepres- sant analgesic activity that have been proposed include adrenergic and serotonin receptor effects,adenosinergic effects, anti-histaminic effects, and direct neuronal effects, such as inhibition of paroxysmal neuronal discharge and decreasing sensitivity of adrenergic receptors on injured nerve sprouts. 86, 89, 90, 91 There is substantial evidence that the tricyclic antidepressants in particular are analgesic anduseful in the management of chronic neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain syndromes. Amitrip-tyline is the tricyclic antidepressant most studied and has been proven effective as an analgesic ina large number of clinical trials addressing a wide variety of chronic pain syndromes, includingneuropathy, cancer pain, fibromyalgia and others. 54, 80, 81, 92, 93, 94 Other tricyclics that have been shown to have efficacy as analgesics include imipramine, desipramine, nortriptyline, clomipramine,100 and doxepin.55, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 101 The heterocyclic and non-cyclic antidepressant drugs may be useful as adjuvant analgesics for chronic pain syndromes.54, 81, 88, 96, 97, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107 These drugs include trazodone, mianserin, maprotiline and with specific serotonin reuptake inhibition activity, has been shown to have analgesic properties in experimental animal pain models but failed to show analgesiceffects in a clinical trial for neuropathy. 97, 106, 107 Several case reports suggest fluoxetine may be a useful adjuvant analgesic in the management of headache and fibrositis.108, 109 Paroxetine, a newer SSRI, is the first antidepressant of this class shown to be a highly effectiveanalgesic in a controlled trial for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. 96 Newer antidepressants such as sertraline, venlafaxine, and nefazodone may also eventually prove to be clinically useful asadjuvant analgesics. For instance, nefazodone has been demonstrated to potentiate opioid analge- sics in an animal model. 110 Given the diversity of clinical syndromes in which the antidepressants have been demonstrated to be analgesic, trials of these drugs can be justified in the treatment of virtually every type of chronicpain. 111 The established benefit of several of the antidepressants in patients with neuropathic pains, however, suggests these drugs may be particularly useful with cancer and AIDS patients, where anunderlying neuropathic component to the pain(s) often exists. 96, 97, 111 While studies of the analgesic efficacy of these drugs in HIV-related painful neuropathies have not yet been conducted, the drugsare widely applied clinically using the model of diabetic and neuropathies. Chpt 04 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 4: Pain U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 112While antidepressant drugs are analgesic in both neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain models, they are most commonly used clinically in combination with opioid drugs, particularly for moderate- to-severe pain. Antidepressant adjuvant analgesics have their most broad application as co-analgesics , potentiating the analgesic effects of opioid drugs.58 The opioid sparing effects of antidepressant analgesics have been demonstrated in a number of trials, especially in cancer populations withneuropathic as well as non-neuropathic pain syndromes. 84, 87 The dose and time course of onset of analgesia for antidepressants when used as analgesics appears to be similar to their use as antide-pressants. There is compelling evidence that the therapeutic analgesic effects of amitriptyline are correlated with serum levels, as are the antidepressant effects, and that analgesic treatment failure is due to low serum levels. 93, 97 A high dose regimen of up to 150 mg of amitriptyline or higher is suggested.93 The proper analgesic dose for paroxetine is likely in the 40 to 60 mg range, with the major analgesic trialutilizing a fixed dose of 40 mg. 96 Anecdotal evidence suggests that in cases of depression or pain, the debilitated medically ill (cancerand AIDS patients) often respond to lower doses of antidepressant than are usually required in thephysically healthy, probably because of impaired metabolism of these drugs 103 As to the time course of onset of analgesia, a biphasic process appears to occur. Immediate or early analgesic effects occurwithin hours or days, and probably mediated through inhibition of synaptic reuptake of catechola- mines. In addition, there are later, longer analgesic effects that peak over a two to four week period that are probably due to receptor effects of the antidepressants. 92, 93, 97 Neuroleptics and Benzodiazepines Neuroleptic drugs, methotrimeprazine, pimozide, may play arole as adjuvant analgesics 101, 112, 113, 114 in AIDS patients with pain; however, their use must be weighed against what appears to be an increased sensitivity to the extrapyramidal side effects of these drugs in AIDS patients with neurological complications.115 Anxiolytics, such as alprazolam and clonazepam, may also be useful as adjuvant analgesics, particularly in the management of neuropathic pains.116, 117, Psychostimulants such and modafinil may be useful antidepressants in patients with HIV infection or AIDS who are cognitively impaired.116, 119 Psychostimulants also enhance the analgesic effects of the opioid drugs,75 are useful in diminishing sedation secondary to narcotic analgesics, and are potent adjuvant analgesics. Bruera, et al., demon-strated that a regimen of 10 mg methylphenidate with breakfast and 5 mg with lunch significantly decreased sedation and potentiated the effect of narcotics in patients with cancer pain. 119 Meth- ylphenidate has also been demonstrated to improve patient functioning on a number of neuropsy-chological tests, including tests of memory, speed and concentration, in patients receiving continu-ous infusions of opioids for cancer pain. 119 Dextroamphetamine has been reported to have additive analgesic effects when used with morphine in postoperative pain.120 In relatively low doses, psychostimulants stimulate appetite, promote a sense of well being, and decrease feelings of weak-ness and fatigue in cancer patients.

There are no stud-ies of pemoline's capacity to potentiate the analgesic properties of opioids. Pemoline should be usedwith caution in patients with liver impairment, and liver function tests should be monitored periodi-cally with longer-term treatment. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggests that whenpemoline is prescribed, patients sign an informed consent document that outlines the potential livertoxicities of pemoline. Modafinil, a novel psychostimulant that has shown efficacy in treating excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, has recently demonstrated potential for the treatment of depression andfatigue. 121 Although modafinil needs further study, it appears to be a promising alternative to other psychostimulants in patients who cannot tolerate or have contraindications to the use of otherstimulants. Modafinil has minimal cardiovascular effects, does not cause tolerance or dependence,has a low abuse potential, and does not require a special triplicate prescription. Anticonvulsant Drugs Selected anticonvulsant drugs appear to be analgesic for the lancinating dysesthesias that charac-terize diverse types of neuropathic pain. 111 Clinical experience also supports the use of these agents in patients with paroxysmal neuropathic pains that may not be lancinating and, to a far lesser extent,in those with neuropathic pains characterized solely by continuous dysesthesias. Although mostpractitioners prefer to begin with carbamazepine because of the extraordinarily good response rateobserved in trigeminal neuralgia, this drug must be used cautiously in AIDS patients with thrombocy-topenia, those at risk for marrow failure, and those whose blood counts must be monitored to deter- mine disease status. If carbamazepine is used, a complete blood count should be obtained prior to the start of therapy, after two and four weeks, and then every three to four months thereafter. A leukocytecount below 4000 is usually considered to be a contraindication to treatment, and a decline to lessthan 3000 or an absolute neutrophil count of less than 1500 during therapy should prompt discon-tinuation of the drug. Other anticonvulsant drugs may be useful for managing neuropathic pain inAIDS patients, including phenytoin, clonazepam, valproate and gabapentin. 111 Several newer anticonvulsants have been used in the treatment of neuropathic pain, particularlywith patients who have reflex sympathetic dystrophy. These drugs include gabapentin, lamotrigine,tiagabine, and felbamate. Of these newer anticonvulsants, experience has been most favorable withgabapentin, now being widely used by pain specialists to treat neuropathic pain of various types.Gabapentin has a relatively high degree of safety, with no known drug-drug interactions and a lack of hepatic metabolism. 111 Treatment with gabapentin is usually initiated at a dose of 300 mg/day and then gradually increased to a dose range of 900-3200 mg/day in three divided doses.

In patients with advanceddisease, these drugs may also improve appetite, decrease nausea and malaise, and improve the over-all quality of life. Adverse effects include immunosuppression. Baclofen Baclofen is a proven efficacy in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia.122 On this basis, a trial of this drug is commonly employed in the management of paroxysmal neuropathic pains of any type. Dosing is generally undertaken in a manner similar to the use of the drug for its primary indication, spasticity. A starting dose of 5 mg two to three times per day is gradually escalatedto 30-90 mg per day, and sometimes higher if side effects do not occur. The most common adverseeffects are sedation and confusion. Oral Local Anesthetics Local anesthetic drugs may be useful in the management of neuropathic pains characterized byeither continuous or lancinating dysesthesias. Controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy oftocainide and mexiletine and clinical evidence suggests similar effects from flecainide and subcu-taneous lidocaine. 123, 124, 125, 126 It is reasonable to undertake a trial with oral local anesthetic in patients with continuous dysesthesias who fail to respond adequately to, or who cannot tolerate, the tricyclic antidepressants, and with patients with lancinating pains refractory to trials of anticonvul-sant drugs and baclofen. Mexiletine is preferred in the U.S. 111 Paice and colleagues in 2000 studied twenty-six subjects in order to test the efficacy of topical capsaicin in the management of HIV-associated pain.127 Results suggest that capsaicin was ineffective in relieving with HIV-associated distal symmetrical pe-ripheral neuropathy (DSPN). However capsaicin has been shown to be effective in relieving painassociated with other neuropathic pain syndromes. 127 Drug Interactions: Analgesics and Anti-HIV Drug Therapies Many of the available anti-HIV drugs have the potential to interact with other medications pre- scribed for pain, depression, anxiety or other medical conditions. These drug interactions can bedangerous, resulting in drug toxicities due to elevated levels of medication, or drug ineffectivenessdue to lower drug levels in the serum. Opioid analgesics can interact with certain anti-HIV drugtherapies and these interactions should be kept in mind when prescribing opioids. The protease inhibitor ritonavir (Norvir) can codeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, and fentanyl. ritonavir should not be prescribed meperidine or propoxyphene because of increased risk of serious toxicity.

Other non-pharmacologic interventions include whirlpool baths,massage, the application of ultrasound and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Increasing numbers of AIDS patients have resorted to acupuncture to relieve their pain, with anec- dotal reports of efficacy. Several psychological interventions have demonstrated potential efficacy in alleviating HIV-related pain, including hypnosis, relaxation and distraction techniques such as biofeedback and imagery,and cognitive behavioral techniques. See Tables 4-10 and 4-11 for sample relaxation and distraction exercises. Where non-pharmacologic and standard pharmacologic treatments fail, anesthetic and even neurosurgical procedures (such as nerve block, cordotomy, and epidural delivery of analgesics) areadditional options available to the patient who appreciates the risks and limitations of theseprocedures.

Think about these questions. 1.Can you remember any situation, even when you were a child, when you felt calm, peaceful, secure, hopeful or comfortable? 2.Have you ever daydreamed about something peaceful? What were you thinking of? 3.Do you get a dreamy feeling when you listen to music? Do you have any favorite music? 4.Do you have any favorite poetry that you find uplifting or reassuring? 5.Have you ever been religiously active? Do you have favorite readings, hymns, or prayers? Even if you haven't heard or thought of them for many years, childhood religious experi-ences may still be very soothing. Additional points: Very likely some of the things you think of in answer to these questions can be recorded for you, such as your favorite music or a prayer. Then, you can listen to the tape whenever you wish. Or, if your memory is strong, you may simply close your eyes and recall the events or words. Source: Adapted from McCaffery M, Beebe A.

BARRIERS TO PAIN MANAGEMENT IN HIV/AIDS A number of different factors have been identified as potential influences on the widespread undertreatment of pain in AIDS, including patient-, clinician-, and health care system-relatedbarriers. 3, 74, 128, 129 Sociodemographic factors that have been reported to be associated with undertreatment of pain in AIDS patients include gender, education level, and substance abuse history.4 Women, less educated patients, minorities, and patients who reported injection drug use as their HIVrisk transmission factor are significantly more likely to receive inadequate analgesic therapy forHIV-related pain. In a 1999 survey of approximately 500 AIDS care providers, clinicians (primarily physicians and nurses) rated the barriers to AIDS pain management they perceived to be the most important in thecare of AIDS patients (see Table 4-12). 129 Chpt 04 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 11626 Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 4: Pain IV U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 117Table 4-12: AIDS Clinicians' Ratings of Barriers to Pain Management # Barrier Percent 1.

Managing pain in AIDS patients with a history of substance use is a particularly challenging problem that HIV providers will face with increasing frequency. Table 4-13 identifies basic interven-tions for pain management in substance users. For more information, see Chapter 11: Substance UseProblems Table 4-13: An Approach to Pain Management in Substance Users with HIV Disease 1.Substance users with HIV disease deserve pain control; we have an obligation to treat pain and suffering in all of our patients. 2.Accept and respect the report of pain. 3.Be careful about the label substance abuse ; distinguish between tolerance, physical dependence and addiction (psychological dependence or drug abuse). 4.Not all substance users are the same; distinguish between active users, individuals in methadone maintenance, and those in recovery. 5.Individualize pain treatment. 6.Utilize the principles of pain management outlined for all patients with HIV disease and pain (WHO Ladder). 7.Set clear goals and conditions for opioid therapy: set limits, recognize drug abuse behav- iors, make consequences clear, use written contracts and establish a single prescriber. 8.Use a multidimensional approach: pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions, attention to psychosocial issues, team approach. CONCLUSION Pain in AIDS, even in this era of protease inhibitors and decreased AIDS death rates, is a clinically significant problem contributing greatly to psychological and functional morbidity. Pain can be adequately treated and so must be a focus of palliative care of the person living with HIV/AIDS.

INTRODUCTION Constitutional symptoms, reported by more than 50% of people with advanced HIV disease, often significantly compromise both physical functioning and quality of life.1-3 The most com- mon constitutional symptoms include weight loss, fatigue, fever and sweats. These symptomscan be related to myriad potential etiologies including opportunistic infections, malignancy,metabolic dysregulation, medication-related toxicities and advanced AIDS itself.Attempts should be made to determine and, when possible, treat the underlying causes of con-stitutional symptoms. Yet some underlying causes are refractory to treatment, and in many set-tings the necessary resources remain unavailable. Even where highly active antiretroviral therapy(HAART) is available and the chronic phase of HIV disease is prolonged for many patients,constitutional symptoms may arise from or be exacerbated by cumulative co-existing morbidi-ties or by toxicities of the antiretroviral medications themselves.Nevertheless, particularly in the late stages of HIV disease, aggressive symptom managementoften can improve a patient's quality of life regardless of the effects of more disease-specifictherapies. Thus, it is important that clinicians in all settings be skillful both in controlling un-comfortable constitutional symptoms and in combining HIV-specific and palliative interven-tions for optimal patient care. The following sections and Table 5-1 address the management ofHIV wasting, fatigue, fever and sweats. HIV WASTING HIV wasting syndrome is a common AIDS-defining diagnosis in the United States, with an estimated lifetime frequency of 70% to 90% among AIDS patients who receive no antiretroviraltherapy. 4 It is defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as an involuntary loss of more than 10% of baseline body weight in conjunction with fever, weakness or diarrhea for morethan 30 days. However, less stringent definitions, such as loss of 5% to 10% of ideal body weight,are widely employed in clinical practice. 5 Mechanisms of HIV wasting are complex and include the following: \u007f Diminished or inadequate nutrient intake\u007f Excessive nutrient loss\u007f Metabolic dysregulation 6, 7 Causes of inadequate nutritional intake often include one or more of the following: dysphagia orodynophagia aphthous ulceration;anorexia, nausea, or vomiting due to infection, malignancy, medication side effects, or othersymptoms such as pain; and psychological factors such as depression, anxiety, grief and loneliness.

Potentiallyreversible causes of inadequate nutrient intake and nutrient loss, such as gastrointestinal infec-tions or medication side effects, should be identified and addressed if possible. Additional mea-sures to manage HIV wasting include appetite stimulants and anabolic agents such as andro-gens and growth hormone. Appetite Stimulants Two agents used to combat HIV wasting by stimulating the appetite are megestrol acetate and dronabinol. Corticosteroids may also be effective. Megestrol Acetate Megestrol acetate, a synthetic progestational agent, can reduce anorexia and lead to weight gain primarily by increasing fat mass. Randomized controlled trials have shown a statistically significant increase over placebo in food intake, weight gain, and overall sense of well-beingover an 8-12 week period. 17, 18 The recommended dose in HIV-associated wasting is 400-800 mg/ day in a single oral dose. It may be used in conjunction with anabolic agents, resistance exerciseor both. There is probably no benefit (and may be additional risk) in adding megestrol acetate tothe regimen of a patient already taking a corticosteroid at moderate or high doses, but studieshave not been done. While side effects of megestrol acetate generally have been considered rare or mild, recent evidence suggests that they may be more frequent and severe than previously recognized. 19,20 Reported side effects related to its corticosteroid activity include induction or exacerbation of diabetes mellitus and, in the long term, Cushing's syndrome and\u2014with abrupt discontinuation of therapy\u2014adrenal insufficiency. With prolonged administration, megestrol acetate also di-minishes gonadotropin secretion and thus can cause or exacerbate hypogonadism, and an asso-ciation with hypercoagulability and osteonecrosis also has been suggested. 7, 21-27 As with any intervention, clinicians should weigh the potential benefits and burdens of megestrol acetate inthe context of an individual patient's goals, values and life expectancy. Corticosteroids Corticosteroids have been shown to improve appetite and food intake in cancer patients. In thesame population, they can also reduce pain, nausea and vomiting, and fatigue while improvingmood, strength, performance status, and overall quality of life. 19 It is likely that AIDS patients with similar symptoms may benefit from corticosteroids, but this has not been well studied. There is some evidence that any decreases in anorexia, weakness, and fatigue from corticoster- oids may be temporary.28 In addition, the risk of serious side effects from corticosteroids in- Chapter 05 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 12626 and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 5: Constitutional Symptoms V U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 127creases with time; adrenal insufficiency, myopathy, additive immunocompromise and opportunistic infections. It is prudent to reserve prolonged use for patients with a short life expectancy and severely distressing symptoms that may be eased by corticosteroids. In this situation, prednisone may be started at 20-80 mg orallyonce daily, while dexamethasone can be initiated in a dose of 2-8 mg orally or intravenouslytwice per day. Once beneficial effects are noted, the dosage can be reduced to the lowest dosethat maintains the beneficial effect. Short-term side effects may include hyperglycemia, fluidretention and psychosis. Dronabinol Dronabinol has been shown to increase appetite and decrease nausea, yet little or no weightgain has been reported. 29, 30 The usual starting dose is 2.5 mg orally twice daily before lunch and dinner; this may be increased to 5 mg orally thrice daily. Central nervous system side effectssuch as confusion, anxiety, emotional lability, euphoria or hallucinations have been reported inas many as 10% of patients, yet in most patients these side effects resolve after one to three daysof continued use. 30 If symptoms persist or are severe, reducing dosage to as little as 2.5 mg once a day before dinner or at bedtime may be helpful. Testosterone Hypogonadism has been reported in as many as 50% of men and women with HIV wasting. Several studies have shown that testosterone deficiency may contribute to HIV wasting in both sexes.31 In this setting, hypogonadism most often is due to impaired gonadotropin secretion resulting from malnutrition, chronic disease, or medications such as phenothiazines or megestrolacetate. 32 Less frequently, hypogonadism may be primary and result from HIV or opportunistic infection of the gonads, medication side effects, or malignant infiltration.7 Androgen deficiency leads to loss of lean body mass and also may cause or exacerbate chronicanemia and depression. Replacement therapy may thus have a significant impact on a patient'soverall well-being. 33 Randomized controlled trials of testosterone replacement in men with HIV disease have shown significant weight gain, increases in lean body mass, and improvements inquality of life scores, libido, mood and energy. 31, 34 Once a diagnosis of testosterone deficiency is established in men, appropriate replacement maybe undertaken via transdermal patch, androgen gel or intramuscular injection (oral prepara-tions are associated with liver toxicity). Daily scrotal and non-scrotal transdermal patches areavailable, and a dose of 5 mg/day has been shown to increase lean body mass. Skin irritation atthe application site may be relieved by applying a small amount of 0.1% triamcinolone cream tothe skin under the reservoir. One percent transdermal testosterone gel is given in a dosage of2.5-7.5 g/day and should not be applied to the genital area. Finally, the intramuscular prepara-tions, testosterone cypionate and enanthanate, are given in doses of 200 mg every two weeks. 31 The administration of androgens to women with HIV wasting and low serum-free testosterone iscurrently under investigation. A pilot study showed that physiological doses of testosterone (150\u00b5g transdermally daily) can increase weight and improve quality of life. 35 Further studies are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of androgen replacement for these women.

It should be used with greatcaution in women and patients with liver disease. Growth Hormone Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) has been shown to increase weight, lean body mass, and strength in patients with HIV wasting in a daily dose of 0.1 mg/kg given subcutane-ously for up to 12 weeks. 39-41 Side effects may include edema, arthralgia and hyperglycemia. Because long-term side effects are unknown, rhGH is not considered first-line treatment. Thecurrent cost of rhGH therapy is about $1750 per week. Other Therapies Exercise in the form of supervised, progressive resistance and fitness training may be useful in HIV wasting, but few data are available. Cytokine modulators, such as thalidomide andpentoxifylline, are experimental and not recommended. FATIGUE Fatigue is a common symptom and may affect as many as 85% of AIDS patients.2 It can severely compromise quality of life by diminishing physical functioning and causing psychological distress.As is the case with fatigue associated with other life-threatening illnesses, HIV/AIDS-related fa-tigue is usually multifactorial. Frequent etiologies include infections, HIV disease pro- gression, hormonal insufficiencies, metabolic derangements, medication side effects, malnutri- tion, wasting, depression, insomnia, malignancy, and end-stage organ disease. 6 (See Chapter 3: Assessment of Physical Symptoms, Table 3-1.) If possible and appropriate for the clinical situation, interventions should address the underly- ing cause(s) of fatigue. For example, erythropoietin can be used to treat AIDS patients whosefatigue appears to be due primarily to anemia and whose anemia is not caused by bleeding,hemolysis, or deficiency of iron, B12 or folate. The dose is 40,000 units subcutaneously weeklyalong with iron supplementation. 42 Testosterone replacement can be used for hypogonadal men with fatigue as described in the section on HIV wasting above. Treatments for fatigue of multiple etiologies include psychostimulants and corticosteroids. Psychostimulants Methylphenidate is frequently used to treat fatigue or depression in the palliative care of patients with advanced life-threatening illnesses of almost any etiology.43,44 Its rapid onset of action makes it especially useful for depression in patients with a life expectancy of days orweeks, when the usefulness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is limited. It also is usefulfor treating sedation due to opioid analgesics. In very frail patients, it can be started in a dosageas low as 2.5-5 mg orally at 8 a.m. or twice per day at 8 a.m. and noon. It should not be given in the Chapter 05 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 12826 picasA and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 5: Constitutional Symptoms V U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 129afternoon or evening. The dosage can be increased daily as tolerated to effect or to a maximum daily dose of 60 mg. While generally well-tolerated, methylphenidate should be used with caution in patients with anxiety, delirium, agitation, or tachyarrhythmias. Any jitteriness, mild anxiety, or hyperactivitythat develop during treatment often can be managed with a dose reduction. Dextroamphetamine has indications and properties very similar to those of methylphenidate. 43 The recommended dosage is the same. Pemoline, which is chemically unrelated to amphetamine and has milder sympathomimetic effects, also may be effective against fatigue and depression in advanced medical illness includ-ing HIV disease. 45 In the only randomized controlled trial of psychostimulants for fatigue in HIV- positive people, methylphenidate (7.5 mg twice daily) and pemoline (18.75 mg/day) were sig-nificantly better than placebo at improving not only fatigue but also depression, psychologicaldistress, and overall quality of life. 46 The starting dosage of pemoline is 18.75 mg orally at 8 a.m. or twice per day at 8 a.m. and noon. The dosage can be increased as tolerated to effect or to amaximum daily dose of 112.5 mg. However, due to its potential for severe hepatotoxicity, pemo-line should be used with caution and should not be used in patients with liver disease. Corticosteroids Corticosteroids have been shown to temporarily improve fatigue in cancer patients.28 It is possible that many HIV/AIDS patients may experience similar benefits in the palliative caresetting. Information on the use of corticosteroids for fatigue and other indications in generalpalliative care can be found in this chapter, in the section on HIV wasting above. There is direct evidence that corticosteroids improve fatigue in one sub-population of HIV/AIDS patients: those with disseminated mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) with ease despite combination antimycobacterial therapy. Low-dose dexamethasone (4-6 mg/day)led to a rapid decrease in fatigue, fever and night sweats within one week of initiating treatmentin a series of 12 patients. In similar studies of (low-dose) corticosteroids in small numbers ofpatients, weight gain, fever reduction, and improved sense of well-being were documented. 47, 48 While randomized controlled trials have not been done, corticosteroids appear to be useful inthe palliative care of patients with end-stage AIDS and to antimycobacterialtherapy. 49 FEVERS AND SWEATS Fevers, sweats, or both are frequent causes of suffering and poor quality of life in AIDS pa- tients. Fever increases metabolic rate, and persistent fever is associated with anorexia, weightloss and wasting. 6 Etiologies of fever include infections, HIV-associated malignancies, side ef- fects of drugs sulfa drugs, abacavir and otherantiretrovirals, amphotericin B), hormonal dysfunction, and auto-immune disorders. While any source of fever can cause sweats, sweats without fever may occur in the setting of some infections, malignancies, endocrinopathies and medications. For example, both opioidsand withdrawal from opioids may cause sweats in the absence of fever. If possible and appropri-ate, efforts should be made to identify and treat the underlying etiology of fevers or sweats.Medications used to treat fever and sweats of and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 5: Constitutional Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 130In the palliative management of fever in patients with HIV/AIDS, it is important to maintain body temperature within a comfortable range. Usually patients are most comfortable at normal or near-normal body temperature, but not all fevers cause discomfort. The most common anti- pyretic used is acetaminophen, given in a dosage of 650 to 1000 mg orally or rectally every 6hours as needed or around the clock. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are par-ticularly helpful in patients with fevers related to neoplasms and/or when an additional anti-inflammatory effect is desired. The gastrointestinal toxicity of NSAIDs can be reduced by usingcholine magnesium trisalicylate (500 to 1000 mg orally twice-thrice daily), using a selectivecyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor such as rofecoxib (12.5 to 50 mg orally every day), and/or adding acytoprotective agent such as an H2 antagonist, proton pump inhibitor, or misoprostol (100 to 200\u00b5g orally twice to four times per day). For severe, unremitting fever, acetaminophen and an NSAID both can be given every 6 hours in a staggered fashion with the patient receiving one or the other every 3 hours. Corticosteroidsprovide an alternative that can cut down on the number and frequency of medications, and maybe equally effective in some situations. As described above in the section on fatigue, low-dosedexamethasone (4 to 6 mg/day) led to a rapid decrease in fever, night sweats and fatigue withinone week of initiating treatment in a series of 12 patients with disseminated MAC refractory toantimycobacterial therapy. 47-49 Keeping the patient warm and dry will help to prevent chills and shivering.6 If fluid and electro- lyte loss from fever and sweats is considerable, the clinician must weigh the benefits and bur-dens of aggressive hydration to restore and maintain fluid balance in light of the patient's goals,values, and prognosis. Sweats associated with fever are treated as above. If sweats are unrelated to fever, NSAIDs as described above still may prove helpful. Anticholinergics also may be tried, such as scopolamine(0.2-0.6 mg subcutaneously or intravenously every 1-4 hours, or by 1.5 mg transdermal patch, 3-5 patches every 72 hours) or hyoscyamine (0.125-0.25 mg orally every 1-4 hours). An anticholin- ergic with minimal central nervous system effects is glycopyrrolate (1-2 mg orally once daily at bedtime or up to thrice daily or 0.1-0.2 mg subcutaneously or intravenously once daily at bed-time or up to every 6 hours). In addition, the use of the H2 antagonist cimetidine (400-800 mgorally twice daily) may provide symptomatic relief. 28, 50 CONCLUSIONS In people with HIV/AIDS, constitutional symptoms such as wasting, fatigue, fever and sweats often severely compromise quality of life and overall sense of well-being. Careful management of these symptoms throughout the course of the illness is an important component in overall HIV/AIDS care. As with any intervention, clinicians should weigh the potential benefits and burdensof treatments for constitutional symptoms for each individual patient in each clinical situation.When a patient's life expectancy is short and maximizing his or her quality of life is an importantgoal, possible long-term side effects of a treatment become less relevant if the treatment islikely to improve short-term quality of life.

INTRODUCTION This chapter will focus on basic methods of treating the suffering and distress caused by common pulmonary symptoms in AIDS patients. The approaches offered below are useful inrelieving discomfort, even when the underlying disease is not treatable. The first part of thischapter will explore issues related to end-of-life decisions in the care of patients who have pul-monary diseases. The second part will address treatment for specific pulmonary symptoms.HIV-positive individuals are at risk for a variety of disease processes that compromise lung func-tion or cause respiratory symptoms (see Table 6-1). In fact, pulmonary manifestations of AIDSare among the most frequent causes of death in HIV disease. Symptoms associated with lunginvolvement can be very disturbing to patients. When symptoms include severe air hunger oreven a sensation of suffocation, these can lead to escalating feelings of fear, anxiety, and panic.Relief of symptoms can make a great deal of difference in the quality of life for people with HIV,even when the underlying disease is progressing.

Since that time PCP has become the most common AIDS-defining condition. Even in the era of HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy), PCP remains a frequent opportunistic infection affecting people who are not yet incare or who are unable to adhere to prophylaxis or treatment regimens. 1 Although the overall incidence of PCP has decreased, people still die of Pneumoncystis , par- ticularly when the organism becomes resistant to available therapies. Current PCP treatmentconsists of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, pentamidine, atovaquone or methotrexate, depend-ing on the degree of resistance, although toxicities may limit the usefulness of these drugs.Corticosteroid therapy (40 mg of prednisone daily) is recommended to control symptoms for patients with moderate to severe disease or compromised gas exchange evidenced by hypox- emia (pulse oximetry <88%). If antibiotics are used, prednisone may be tapered over the courseof treatment. While the frequency of PCP infections has decreased in recent years, other forms of pulmonary disease, such as bacterial pneumonias and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, have become more preva-lent in AIDS patients. 2 Recurrent bacterial pneumonia with bacteremia is frequent, especially in patients with a history of injection drug use. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the responsible organism in 20 to 70% of cases; Pseudomonas aeruginosa is also common and associated with increased rates of bacteremia and death.3 Even when treated vigorously these infections may exacerbate the progression of HIV disease.4 PALLIATIVE PULMONOLOGY AND END OF LIFE ISSUES Use of Oxygen in Terminal Care Adequate oxygenation is essential to maintain normal cellular function, but information about the specific effects of mild to moderate hypoxemia in terminally ill patients is limited. As pa- tients approach the final stages of life, supplemental oxygen may be beneficial in some settings. For example, oxygen may be useful in reducing cognitive deficits associated with hypoxemia. Itis often assumed that oxygen may reduce the sensation of dyspnea, but the evidence does notconsistently support this. 5 Oxygen would be expected to be therapeutic if hypoxemia is stimulating increased respiratoryeffort and contributing to fatigue. However, the frequency with which this occurs is not clearsince some studies have shown that even moderate hypoxemia does not significantly increaseventilation. 6 In addition, there is a great deal of individual variation in the response of the respi- ratory drive to hypoxemia and, under most circumstances, carbon dioxide tension in the bloodplays a greater role than oxygen in regulating respiratory rate and volume. Thus, in some pa-tients, hypoxemia probably does not produce noticeable symptoms, particularly if mental func- tion is already declining from progressive disease. Even in healthy individuals, hypoxemia is not necessarily uncomfortable and may produce symp- toms similar to inebriation. In exercises with Air Force flight crews in altitude chambers, mostof the participants initially were unable to determine when they were significantly hypoxemic.In fact, though they perceived no changes, they were often surprised to discover that they haddecreased color vision, impaired mental acuity, and slower reflexes by the time they respondedto instructions to put on oxygen masks. It was only after restoring normal oxygen levels that they Chapter 06 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 13626 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 6: Pulmonary Symptoms VI U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 137recognized the contrasts in vision, hearing, and perception. When these individuals were subse- quently re-exposed to the altitude chamber, many found that their previous experiences did not improve their ability to recognize signs of hypoxemia in themselves. (Griffin R, retired flight surgeon and Colonel, USAFR. Telephone communication with author, April, 2002.) During the final days or hours of life, AIDS patients, especially those with pulmonary disorders, are likely to become increasingly hypoxemic. They may be unaware of any associated symptomsand may resist efforts to improve oxygenation by removing a mask or nasal cannula. Simple ornon-rebreathing masks may create feelings of claustrophobia and anxiety. In these settings,administration of oxygen may not be a comfort measure, although in some situations it may belife-prolonging. If prolonging life is no longer a goal of the patient, family, or friends, or if life- prolonging measures are now compromising comfort, it may be appropriate to consider discon- tinuing supplemental oxygen. This can be done by not replacing oxygen delivery devices whenremoved by the patient or by titrating oxygen flows downward and then discontinuing supple-mental oxygen over a matter of minutes or hours. Oxygen can always be restarted if the patientappears to have increased symptoms or discomfort associated with stopping oxygen. In mostcases this is not necessary. Use of Antibiotics in Terminal Care While we have made remarkable progress in increasing life expectancy by combating infec- tious diseases over the last one hundred years, there still may be wisdom in the old saying \"pneu-monia is the old man's friend.\" Death from infection, particularly if the patient is dehydrated,debilitated, and immunocompromised, can be rapid and peaceful. Dyspnea is likely to be mini-mal when dehydration limits fluid accumulation in the infected lung and/or the inflammatoryresponse is impaired. Pain and cough usually can be managed successfully with opioids. Likewise, with effective palliation of symptoms, central nervous system infections such as toxo- plasmosis, bacteremia, or intra-abdominal sepsis may help to prevent a prolonged or difficultdying process in end-stage patients. In these situations it may not be in a patient's best interestto pursue aggressive treatment of infections, even though it may be relatively easy to do so. Infections that are not life-threatening but do contribute to discomfort can always be treated with the appropriate antibiotics. For example, bronchitis or urinary tract infections can causedistressing symptoms that respond well to antibiotic treatment. But in the terminal phases ofillness, symptomatic relief of life-threatening infections may be all that is needed. Prednisonemay be adequate to combat the symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and low doses of opioids may be enough to control the distressing symptoms of bacterial pneumonia. The Role of Fluids and Dehydration in Terminal Care Decreased fluid intake is a normal part of the dying process and can lead to profound dehy- dration. There is some evidence that complaints of dry mouth are no greater in dehydratedpatients than in patients receiving hydration during the final stages of life, perhaps because ofincreased mouth-breathing in both groups. If symptoms of oral dryness are well controlled, dehydration can actually provide several ben- efits to people in the final days of life. First, dehydration decreases symptoms from pulmonaryinfections. With a decrease in total body water there is less interstitial or alveolar fluid associ-ated with the inflammatory response to an infection. This leads to a reduction in symptoms Chapter 06 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 13726 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 6: Pulmonary Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 138including hypoxemia, coughing, shortness of breath, and secretion production. Second, decreased intravascular fluid may reduce pulmonary symptoms from heart failure by lowering preload and the hydrostatic pressure driving fluid into the lungs. Third, dehydration may lead to a reduction in secretion volume, which can reduce coughing and associated fatigue in a severely debilitatedpatient and may help control the terminal sounds (\"death rattle\") from accumulated airwaysecretions in a dying patient. On the other hand, in some situations fluids may be beneficial. For example, thick, dry secre- tions may be deleterious for a patient who has an effective cough and is not imminently dying. Inthis situation, careful systemic hydration may promote comfort by allowing easier clearance ofairway secretions. Nebulized saline has been used to humidify airways, but is less effective than systemic fluids for thinning secretions and can irritate the airways. For some terminal patients, partial rehydration may reduce agitation or restlessness. Parenteral fluids also may be appropriate for the dehydrated patient who seeks to prolong life or enhance asense of well-being in order to achieve specific short term goals. However, when a patient hascompleted the work of preparing for death, intravenous fluid administration may be less desir-able, because it can prolong the dying process and/or increase the discomfort associated with it. Use of Opioids and Risks of Respiratory Depression Concerns about respiratory depression have sometimes limited the use of opioids in the past, even in the presence of significant symptoms. Current evidence indicates that as long as opioidsare very carefully titrated against symptoms of real pain or dyspnea, respiratory depression doesnot present a serious danger. 7 It appears that pain itself opposes the respiratory depressant effect of the narcotics, although themechanism for this is not known. This idea is supported by the observation that patients who undergo procedures such as nerve blocks to relieve pain may experience respiratory depression afterward on the same doses of medication that had no negative impact on respiration prior to theprocedure. 7 It has also been found that arterial carbon dioxide tension, a sensitive measure of ventilation, remained in the normal range over a wide variety of plasma opioid concentrations inseriously ill patients with COPD or bronchogenic cancer. 8 It is likely that the risk of respiratory depression increases if opioid doses are raised rapidly or are given in excess of the dose needed tocontrol symptoms. When opioids are used for treatment of dyspnea, rather than pain, there is probably more risk of respiratory depression, although opioids can easily be used safely in this setting. To avoid ad- verse effects, it is again helpful to titrate doses carefully against the patient's reported symp-toms. In this case, the symptom is the patient's perception of dyspnea\u2014not an increased respi-ratory rate or effort. If tachypnea is felt to reflect a component of anxiety, fear, or stress, thosesymptoms can be treated with lorazepam. In many situations, an elevated respiratory rate may not be especially uncomfortable for the patient, and in some settings can represent a physiologic adaptation to maintain adequate ven-tilation. If this is the case, a reduced respiratory rate is not a good indicator of effective pallia- tion. Life-threatening respiratory depression and breathing patterns that closely resemble ago- nal respiration can develop if excessive doses of opioids are used to reduce respiratory effort.Since dying patients can have respiratory rates as low as 6 to 10 breaths/min, 9 it is important to monitor changes in respiratory rate, as well as the actual rate. Chapter 06 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 13826 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 6: Pulmonary Symptoms VI U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 139The ethical principle of double effect is frequently invoked when symptom management requires such large doses of medication that there is a significant risk of hastening death. It is generally accepted that as long as the primary intention is to treat symptoms and provide comfort, the medication is justified, regardless of unintended consequences such as shortening life. The prin-ciple of double effect would seem to apply as long as careful attention is given to titrating medica-tions against specific patient-identified symptoms to determine the smallest dose needed to pre-vent distress. Titration against symptoms, rather than the use of standard dosing formulas, helpsto adjust for individual variation in opioid needs, metabolism, and tolerance. The focus of treat-ment should be on the patient's perception of discomfort, not just on signs that may be disturbingto the health care providers. Use of Ventilators and Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure in Terminal Care Mechanical support of respiration may be very helpful for patients who have respiratory fail- ure from a disease process that is likely to be reversible. In these patients, weaning from theventilator is usually accomplished uneventfully, once the underlying cause of respiratory com-promise has been treated. The decision to use mechanical ventilation is much more difficult inpatients with end-stage disease such as visceral Kaposi's sarcoma or resistant PCP where thepotential for weaning is in serious doubt. The complexity of these decisions is illustrated by the following information about outcomes in ventilated AIDS patients. A summary of seven studies done on AIDS patients between 1987 and 1994 revealed survival rates (discharge from the hospital) of 11% to 31% in patients who re- quired mechanical ventilation for PCP . In other studies, mortality was strongly associated witha CD4 count < 50/mm3 (94%), the development of pneumothorax (100%), failure to respond toPCP treatment before intubation (80 to 90%), and ventilation for longer than two weeks. 10 To identify appropriate interventions, health care practitioners must understand carefully thepatient's specific goals, which may change over time as the disease progresses. If lung failure islikely to be irreversible, mechanical ventilation should be undertaken only if prolonging life meetsspecific needs or desires of the patient. In most cases of irreversible lung failure, mechanical ventilation is inappropriate, even if patients initially express a desire for life-prolonging measures. Usually, education and thoughtful discussions about patient and family goals are effective in guid-ing decisions toward appropriate care in these settings. If possible, discussion about the risks andbenefits of ventilation, along with issues about CPR, should be undertaken before a crisis occursthat precipitates the need for a decision. Patients seriously considering prolonged mechanicalventilation need to understand clearly, in advance, the severe limitations, effects on quality of life,and frequent complications associated with permanent ventilator dependency. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) provides positive pressure to facilitate inspiration and maintains low levels of pressure in the circuit during expiration to reduce airway collapse. This may be a helpful option for patients with lung disease who need extra ventilatory support atnight or during part of the day to avoid fatigue or maintain adequate blood gases. The differencebetween BiP AP and a ventilator needs to be discussed carefully to help patients decide which, ifeither, will help them achieve their goals. Careful thought needs to go into the process of select-ing BiP AP as an option to support a terminal patient dying with pulmonary complications. BiP APmay help to postpone, but usually cannot prevent, ultimate respiratory failure. Patient goals andexpectations should be carefully explored before deciding to use this treatment modality. Chapter 06 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 13926 Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 6: Pulmonary Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 140Discontinuation of Ventilators Ventilator-dependent patients, or their designated decisionmakers, sometimes choose to stop ventilator support once it has been initiated. They may decide that the quality of life associatedwith ventilator dependency is not acceptable or they may no longer desire life-prolonging inter-ventions. These are reasonable choices and are ethically acceptable to most people based on thepremise that discontinuation of an intervention that artificially prolongs life is not differentfrom choosing to forego the treatment in the first place. It is essential to be certain that the decisionmakers and others who care about the patient understand clearly that the expected outcome of discontinuing ventilation is death. The pos-sible processes leading to death, such as immediate cessation of breathing or a more prolongedperiod of gradual respiratory failure, should be explained, when appropriate. Once decisions have been finalized, a specific time can be set for discontinuing ventilation. There are advantages to allowing all participants to have time to review the decision and \"sleepon it\" by scheduling the procedure for the next day or later. Support for family and friends bychaplains, social workers, or others can be planned in advance. The patient should be placed inan area that offers privacy and space for all family and friends who need to be present. It isimportant to allow, even encourage, rituals that have meaning for the patient and family, such asprayers, readings or singing. The specific details of such plans depend on the beliefs and cultureof those who will be present. Plans for the use of supplemental oxygen should be considered before terminating ventilator support. If oxygen supplementation will be stopped, it is often helpful to titrate concentrationsdown to room air before discontinuing the ventilator. If it will be continued, then the concentra-tion should be reduced to levels easily supported by a simple mask (35% to 50%) or a nasalcannula (30% to 35%). The process of discontinuation of mechanical ventilation is simple and usually uneventful. Pa- tients can be prepared with intravenous access and sedated, if necessary, with intravenousmidazolam or lorazepam. It is difficult to imagine any circumstances where paralytic agentswould be appropriate during discontinuation of the ventilator. Once sedated, intravenous mor-phine (starting with 2 to 4 mg if opioid-na\u00efve) can be titrated to suppress the sensation of dysp-nea, and tracheal suctioning may be done one final time. The ventilator can then be disconnected at the endotracheal tube, replaced by a blow-by circuit, or switched to a ventilator mode with no positive pressure ventilation. Alarms should be si- lenced and unnecessary monitoring devices removed. If an endotracheal (ET) tube is in place, there is often a desire to extubate the patient at the time of discontinuing the ventilator. Again, this decision should be carefully considered in ad-vance. Extubation provides a more normal appearance for the patient, removes the resistanceassociated with breathing through a tube, and may allow the patient to talk. However, suctioningand airway protection will be more difficult without the tube in place. Some patients occasionally have a reflex laryngospasm from the irritation of the ET tube when it is removed and are unable to breathe. While this symptom can be treated with rapidadministration of additional intravenous midazolam or morphine, it may be alarming to friendsand family. The development of agonal respiration and \"death rattle\" may also be distressing toobservers and is more easily managed with suction available through the ET tube. The decisions Chapter 06 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 14026 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 6: Pulmonary Symptoms VI U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 141are easier with a tracheostomy since the tracheostomy tube can be left in place without the drawbacks of an oral or nasal endotracheal tube. Many patients continue to breathe on their own for hours to days after discontinuation of me- chanical ventilation. The discussion, in advance, of the likely outcomes of ventilator discontinu-ation will prepare the family and friends for this possibility. A patient coming off the ventilatorcan be managed just like a person with respiratory failure who chooses not to be placed on aventilator in the first place. Dyspnea can be treated with opioids and anxiety can be treated withlorazepam, as described in the section below, Symptom Management. Whether patients live for minutes or days after removal of mechanical ventilation, their symp- toms usually can be controlled effectively and their suffering prevented. When this is done care-fully, the goals and desires of patients and their loved ones are honored through the process ofventilator discontinuation. The Option of Continuous Sedation for Respiratory Distress Sometimes, standard palliative measures fail to give effective relief from respiratory symptoms. This can occur when a patient's anxiety level is very high, when symptoms are frightening or asso-ciated with the sensation of being unable to breathe, or when the patient is fearful of death. Inthese situations, if all other measures have failed, symptomatic relief may be possible only withcontinuous sedation. This is obviously a serious decision and must have the full support of thepatient (if possible), family, friends, and the entire care team. All involved must recognize that thepatient will be unable to eat and is likely to die without awakening. In some settings a formalinformed consent may be desirable. Once the decision for continuous sedation has been made, several options are possible (Table 6- 2). Patient symptoms can sometimes be treated with increasing doses of benzodiazepines (lorazepam 1 to 3 mg every 4 to 6 hours orally or intravenously) and opioids (morphine 2 to 5 mg parenterally or 5 to 15 mg orally, if opioid-na\u00efve). Doses can be titrated upward if needed tocontrol symptoms or as the disease progresses. If lorazepam is not sufficient to sedate a frightened, anxious patient who is struggling to breathe, midazolam can be used. A loading dose of midazolam can be administered intravenously, or ifnecessary, subcutaneously, at a rate not greater than 1 to 2 mg per minute until the desired levelof sedation is achieved. Doses in the range of 3 to 15 mg are often needed; the actual dose shouldbe titrated against symptoms to achieve peaceful sedation. Sedation can be maintained with a continuous infusion of midazolam given intravenously or subcutaneously (starting with between 1 and 3 mg an hour and titrating upward to 5 to 10 mg/hour, if needed).

Morphine can be added to help sup- press the sensation of dyspnea, if needed. Barbiturates can also be used to maintain sedation. Pentobarbital (100 to 200 mg IM, intravenously or rectally every 4 to 6 hours) and phenobarbital (60 to 120 mg rectally or IM every 6 to 12 hours)are both very effective in maintaining sedation and may help to reduce benzodiazepine doses. Medication doses may need to be adjusted frequently and these patients often require high levelsto maintain comfort. However, with careful attention to the details of dosing, continuous sedationand a peaceful death are possible. Options for Patient Control over the End-of-Life Events Before recommending life-prolonging interventions for a terminally ill patient, it is essential to have a clear idea of how a suggested treatment will enhance the person's quality of life or helphim or her to meet specific goals. Just because we can intervene to prolong life, doesn't neces-sarily mean that we always should. More often than we may recognize, \"letting nature take itscourse\" results in the least suffering and the easiest process of dying possible under the circum-stances. Patients need to know this. It is obviously important for patients to understand their treatment options all through the course of their disease. As they approach the end of life, this is no less important. Patients need to know that they have more control over the final events of their lives than they sometimes realize. It is the role of patients, armed with accurate information about the status of theirdisease and prognosis, to decide when it is time to stop \"fighting\" the disease. This importanttransition allows patients to begin focusing their remaining energy toward completing the busi-ness of living and giving attention to the work of preparing to die. During this process, they canbe offered the further options of choosing or refusing antibiotics or other life-prolonging medi-cations, fluids, artificial nutrition, or blood transfusions. Patients also need to understand howexercising these options can affect the timing and manner of death. Sharing this informationwith people can be difficult and the timing is critical. However, for most patients, this informa-tion is ultimately reassuring and comforting. Promises to Keep Although respiratory symptoms have the potential to be frightening and distressing, applying the principles of palliative medicine allows most people to die comfortably and peacefully. It isoften very reassuring to patients and those who love them to know in advance that suffering canbe prevented and symptoms controlled with the use of appropriate medications. An old Frenchadage suggested that the role of medicine was \"to cure sometimes, to relieve often, to comfortalways.\" With the knowledge and drugs available now, we can almost always relieve, as well ascomfort. We can make promises to patients that weren't possible a few decades ago, promises of comfort and relief from suffering. Patients need to know this\u2014in advance. And then, when the time comes, they need to experience the reality of that reassurance.

For patients who are still able to cough effectively, interventions shouldbe directed at reducing the exertion required to bring up secretions. (See Table 6-3.) Thisinvolves the use of expectorants like guaifenesin which may increase sputum volume and de-crease viscosity. To avoid patient fatigue, it may be appropriate to use preparations that com-bine dextromethorphan with an expectorant in order to raise the threshold for coughing whileattempting to thin secretions. The mucolytic drug, N-acetylcysteine, internal disulfide of tena- cious secretions and may allow easier expectoration. This drug has been widely used in Europe as an oral medication without significant side effects, when administered in doses of 600 to 1200mg twice a day. Although N-acetylcysteine is not approved by the FDA for oral use in the UnitedStates, it is often available at American health food and vitamin stores. The only preparation ofN-acetylcysteine approved in the U.S. is a solution (Mucomyst or Mucosil) which can be aero-solized for inhalation (3 to 5 ml of 20% solution) up to four times a day or instilled directlythrough a tracheostomy (1 to 2 ml of 20% solution) every 1 to 4 hours. This preparation may beirritating to the airways and is not used frequently because of the risk of inducing broncho-spasm. Dehydration can increase sputum viscosity and exacerbate difficulties with expectoration. Sys- temic hydration, orally or intravenously, is the most effective solution to this problem. Humidifi-cation of inhaled oxygen is a helpful comfort measure to reduce symptoms of upper airway dry-ing when oxygen is being administered. However, little effective hydration and thinning of pul-monary secretions occurs with airway humidification or use of saline aerosols. Antihistamines can be useful in controlling a number of uncomfortable pulmonary symptoms associated with allergen-induced bronchospasm or rhinnitis. These drugs are used frequently in palliative medicine to treat nausea, vestibular disorders, anxiety and, occasionally, pulmonary secretions at the end of life. However, antihistamines have a marked drying effect on pulmonarysecretions and can produce secretions that are thick, tenacious and difficult to expectorate.This can lead to mucus plugging of airways and result in worsening of ventilation-perfusionmismatching in the lungs. Some of the negative effects of antihistamines may be partially offsetwith diligent efforts to maintain good hydration, but the risks of the use of these drugs mustalways be weighed against the benefits, especially in patients with increased production of pul-monary secretions. During the terminal stages of life, patients may be more comfortable if bothersome secretions in the trachea, larynx and pharynx are reduced. Even if patients are not alert enough to sufferdistress caused by airway secretions, the airway sounds associated with dying (\"death rattle\")may be profoundly disturbing to family, friends, and caregivers. Since salivary and bronchialmucus glands are stimulated by cholinergic input, anticholinergic drugs may reduce upper air-way secretions 06 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 14326 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 6: Pulmonary Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Hyoscyamine sulfate Atropine Diphenhydramine100 - 400 mg 600 - 1200 mg 300 - 1200 mg 3-5 ml of 20% solution 1-2 ml 20% solution As tolerated 1-3 patches (1.5 mg) 0.125 - 0.5 mg 0.4 - 0.8 mg 25 - 50 mg4 to 6 hrs 12 hrs 12 hrs 6 to 12 hrs 1-4 hrs 72 hrs 4 to 6 hrs PRN 4 to 6 hrs PRN 4 to 6 hrsPO PO PO Inhaled aerosol Intratracheal PO, IV Transdermal PO, mucus productionTable 6-3: Treatment of Respiratory Chapter 06 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 14426 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 6: Pulmonary Symptoms VI U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 145Scopolamine transdermal patches (1.5 mg, with 1 to 3 applied at a time, replaced every 3 days), hyoscyamine sulfate (0.125 to 0.25 mg oral or subcutaneous every 4 hours), or atropine (0.4 to 0.8 mg oral or subcutaneous) can be effective in reducing secretion production if given early enough. Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (25 to 50 mg every 4 to 6 hours) are effectivedrying agents occasionally used in the final hours of life to control secretions. The \"death rattle\"may partially respond to frequent repositioning of the patient, with a special effort to avoid flator supine positions that allow pooling of secretions in the pharynx or larynx. Treatment of Dyspnea Dyspnea is a general term that describes a subjective sensation, an \"uncomfortable aware- ness of breathing.\"11 Patients may use a variety of words or phrases to explain these distressing symptoms, such as chest tightness, breathlessness, air hunger, unable to take a deep breath,feeling of suffocation or smothering, or unable to get enough air. 12 The symptoms usually worsen with exertion and often limit the patient's activity. Extensive research has not yet provided asimple, clear explanation of the physiological basis for the symptom of dyspnea. One reasonableexplanation is that the sensation of shortness of breath occurs when the air movement or \"stretch\"in the lungs is disproportional to the respiratory effort involved in breathing. This may be exac-erbated when a patient's respiratory muscles are fatigued or have inadequate energy stores. Surveys of outpatients with HIV/AIDS indicate that shortness of breath or dyspnea was identi- fied as a problem by between 11% and 48% of the patients. 13 The differential diagnosis of dyspnea in AIDS patients includes pulmonary infections, pulmonary malignancies, pleural effusions, con- gestive heart failure, marked anemia, and metabolic abnormalities. Malnutrition and weaknesscan lead to chronic respiratory muscle fatigue that also contributes to dyspnea. Anxiety and fearcan precipitate or worsen this symptom in combination with other etiologies. The sensation of dyspnea is not necessarily associated with low oxygen tension in the blood. In fact, the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin and oxygen partial pressure in blood are often normalin spite of very distressing symptoms. On the other hand, some patients with significant hypox-emia have little or no feeling of dyspnea associated with their abnormal blood gases. In addition, the severity of dyspnea does not necessarily correlate with the severity of pulmonary disease or pulmonary function test values. While dyspnea is usually associated with pulmonary or cardiacdisease, it can occur with no detectable evidence of abnormalities in these organs. Even interminally ill cancer patients, 24% had no evidence of pulmonary or cardiac disease to explainsymptoms of dyspnea. 14 For patients with some exercise tolerance, the etiology of dyspnea can be evaluated with a pulmonary exercise test that measures expired and arterial gases duringstrenuous exercise. However, this approach is seldom practical or useful in patients with termi-nal illnesses. Treatment of Reversible Causes of Dyspnea Palliative care aims to relieve the discomfort associated with feeling short of breath, regardlessof the origin of the symptom. The first step in treatment is to identify any reversible causes ofdyspnea and treat these with appropriate medications such as diuretics, bronchodilators, orsteroids (Table 6-4). Corticosteroids, in particular, are used generously in palliative medicine,not only for relief of bronchospasm but also to reduce symptoms associated with swelling around Chapter 06 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 14526 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 6: Pulmonary Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 146 Bronchospasm Congestive Heart Failure carinii Tuberculosis Pleural Effusions Extrinsic Edema Elevated JVP Orthopnea Productive cough with changing sputum Localized rales or consolidation Fever, chills Nonproductive cough Hypoxemia, pain, dyspnea Fever, cough Dullness and decreased air movement in lower lung field with radiographic or ultrasound confirmation Stridor - especially inspiratory Severe shortness of breathRisk factors, such adrenergic anticholinergic Opioids Barbiturates or sedation (see text)Inhaled Inhaled, IV, PO, SC, PR PO, IV, IM PO, IV PO, SC, IV, PR Inhaled PO, IV, IM PO PO, IV, SC PO, IV, SC, PR Inhaled PO, IV PO, IV, SC, PR PO, IV PO, IV, SC, PR PO, IV, SC, PR PO, IV, SC, PR PO, IV, IM, PRCause of Dyspnea Physical Signs Treatment Options RouteTable 6-4: Treatment of Potentially Reversible Causes 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 14626 Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 6: Pulmonary Symptoms VI U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 147Intrinsic airway obstruction Copious airway secretions Pulmonary embolismCause of Dyspnea Physical Signs Treatment Options RouteTable 6-4: Treatment of Potentially Reversible Causes of Dyspnea (continued) Worsening dyspnea Distal absent breath sounds or localized wheezing Risk factors, like scarring, bronchogenic cancer Diffuse rhonchi, especially over upper airways Ineffective or absent cough Sudden onset of dyspnea Risk factors SC, IV 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 6: Pulmonary Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 148tumor masses or inflammatory response to infections such as PCP . With pulmonary infection, particularly PCP , antibiotics may be beneficial in treating the underlying process, but discom- fort usually can be well controlled with opioids and/or corticosteroids, even if the patient has decided to forego the use of further life-prolonging antibiotics. Symptomatic Treatment of Dyspnea Oxygen may be therapeutic if hypoxemia is stimulating increased respiratory effort andcontributing to fatigue. As discussed earlier (see section, \"Use of Oxygen in Terminal Care\"), itis not clear how often this occurs. For normoxic patients, low flow oxygen (1 to 3 liters/minute)may provide a beneficial sensation of air flowing through the upper respiratory tract and mayhelp reduce anxiety or fear associated with the feeling of being unable to get enough air. (SeeTable 6-5.) For some dyspneic patients, cool temperatures and/or a fan blowing air in the face can also be helpful. Positioning is often critical for comfort and is usually determined by patient prefer-ences. In some settings, people may find it helpful to lie on the side with the \"good\" lung down toreduce ventilation-perfusion mismatch. However, when fluid or secretions are present, keepingthe good lung up may facilitate drainage away from the healthier gas exchange surfaces. In anycase, frequent repositioning can help limit dependent lung consolidation. Other nonpharmacologic measures that have been used to palliate symptoms of dyspnea in- clude relaxation techniques, massage, acupuncture and guided imagery. Further studies of the effectiveness of each of these approaches would be helpful. Although large pleural effusions are not common with PCP or other AIDS-related processes, thoracentesis may provide relief when patients have symptomatic effusions. Malignant effu-sions tend to re-accumulate rapidly, often within a few days, making repeated thoracentesesminimally beneficial. Thoracentesis also may contribute to protein depletion (two liters of ma-lignant effusion may contain 80 grams of protein) and may increase loculation of fluid which makes future pleurodesis less likely to be successful. Pleurodesis, and even pleuroperitoneal shunts, can reduce dyspnea caused by large recurrent pleural effusions when the patient has anadequate life expectancy to justify the stress and discomfort associated with the procedure. For dyspnea that persists in spite of specific therapy, opioids have been found to significantly reduce this distressing sensation in end-stage disease. 15 In opioid-na\u00efve patients, 3 to 5 mg of oral morphine solution can be given every 3 to 4 hours and the dose titrated upward to 10 to 20 mg ifneeded. If symptoms persist, anxiolytic medications such as lorazepam should be added or in-creased before titrating opioids much higher. Sublingual administration of an oral morphine solu- tion (usually 20 mg/ml) is often successful in patients who need very low doses, have limited swal- lowing capacity, or are not alert. For patients who do not tolerate oral administration of the drug,morphine tablets can be used rectally at oral doses, or injectible morphine can be given subcutane-ously or intravenously using approximately one third of the oral dose (starting with 1 to 2 mg). In recent years, there have been reports of the use of aerosolized morphine to treat dyspnea. At this point, there is no compelling evidence that this route of administration is superior to theuse of oral or subcutaneous morphine. Although the mechanism by which opioids palliate dysp-nea is not completely understood, it is likely (though not proven) that opioids work primarily atcentral receptors which mediate a decrease in the sensation of discomfort. Thus, there probablyis not a strong basis for selecting nebulized opioids over oral or subcutaneous routes of adminis-tration unless the patient indicates a definite preference. If nebulized opioids will be used, the Chapter 06 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, AM 14826 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 6: Pulmonary Symptoms VI U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau na\u00efve , 3-5 mg, titrate up to 20 mg as needed If on opioids for pain, one sixth to one tenth of daily dose Parenteral dose is 1/3 of oral or rectal dose.

There may be an advantage to using fentanyl rather than morphine because fentanyl is thought to be less likely to stimulate histamine release, although bronchospasm with fentanyl has been reported.16 It is usually helpful to initiate treatment with benzodiazepines along with the morphine when treating dyspnea. Severe dyspnea almost always is associated with an understandable sense ofanxiety, and at times, panic. These symptoms can be addressed with small doses of lorazepam(usually beginning with 0.5 mg) every 6 to 8 hours, given orally or sublingually. The dosing inter-val can be reduced to every 4 hours if needed and some patients require increasing the dose to1 or 2 mg or sometimes more. The oral lorazepam tablets can be easily dissolved in a smallamount of water, or even the morphine solution, if the patient has difficulty swallowing pills. A concentrated lorazepam solution (2 mg/ml) is also useful for these patients. If symptoms occur less than once or twice a day, these medications can be offered as needed. If symptoms persist or occur regularly, discomfort is controlled best if the medications are given atregular intervals around the clock. For some patients, frequent, regular doses appear to be moreeffective than long-acting opioids, perhaps because of the recurrent reminder that the symp-toms are being carefully treated. However, it is reasonable to attempt a trial of long-acting mor-phine (beginning with 15 mg every 12 hours) when the total daily dose of oral short actingmorphine approaches 30 mg in 24 hours. Treatment of Cough Cough is a common symptom in AIDS, reported by 19% to 34 % of patients in surveys of symp- tom prevalence in HIV disease.13 Coughing may result from pulmonary infection with secretion production, chronic bronchitis, bronchospasm, tumors in the airways, restrictive lung diseases,aspiration, post-nasal drip, drugs such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, unrec-ognized esophogeal reflux with aspiration, or inhaled irritants. When cough is nonproductive, bronchospasm and reflux should be included in the differential diagnoses. A history of COPD, smoking, or asthma is helpful in making the diagnosis of broncho-spasm, but it can occur with no relevant history. Physical signs include a prolonged expiratoryphase of respiration, use of accessory muscles, decreased air movement, and wheezing whichmay be elicited only on forced expiration. Cough from bronchspasm often responds to bronchodilators including albuterol (or salbutamol), salmeterol, ipratropium bromide, and either inhaled or systemic corticosteroids. In patients who are moving little air with each breath, systemic corticosteroids and frequent nebulization of bronchodilators may be needed. If symptoms improve and tidal volumes increase, hand-heldmetered dose inhalers may be effective. If esophogeal reflux is suspected, a trial of H2 receptorantagonists or proton pump inhibitors may be appropriate. When cough suppression is needed to prevent exhaustion or control an irritating, nonproductive cough, several drug choices are available (Table 6-6). Dextromethorphan may raise the coughthreshold, but in many cases opioids are needed to suppress the cough reflex. Antitussive dosesof codeine start at 10 to 20 mg every 4 hours; upward titration is frequently needed and doses as high as 120 mg have been described, though not recommended. For routine use, hydrocodone is preferred over codeine because it has fewer side effects and generally is tolerated better. Hydrocodone doses start at 5 mg every 4 to 6 hours and may beincreased as needed. Morphine or other opioids can also be used for cough begin- Chapter 06 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 15026 Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 6: Pulmonary Symptoms VI U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 151ning with low doses (2 to 5 mg of oral morphine every 4 hours). If parenteral doses are necessary, approximately one third of the oral morphine dose can be given intravenously or subcutaneously at the same dose frequency. Doses can be increased, as necessary, by carefully titrating effec- tiveness in cough suppression against side effects. For an irritating, nonproductive cough, nebulized lidocaine can sometimes provide rapid re- lief.17, 18 Three ml of a 2% lidocaine solution (without epinephrine) can be nebulized three to four times a day as needed. Because of the risk of decreasing the sensitivity of the gag reflex withthis anesthetic agent, patients should be advised to avoid eating or drinking after treatments forat least an hour, although sips of water are usually tolerated within minutes. There is some risk of inducing bronchospasm and so lidocaine should be used cautiously in patients with asthma. Table 6-6: Cough Suppression Medication Initial Dose Frequency Route Codeine 10 - 30 mg 4 - 6 hrs PO Hydrocodone 5 mg 4 - 6 hrs PO Morphine (enteral) 2 - 5 mg 4 hrs PO, PR Morphine (parenteral) 1 - 2 mg 4 hrs SC, IV Lidocaine (1-2% soln) 3 cc 4 to 6 hrs Inhaled aerosol Treatment of Noncardiac Chest Pain Lung tissue is generally not well innervated with sensory nerves and therefore many invasive diseases that involve the alveoli and lower airways cause little pain. The pleural surfaces, on theother hand, are supplied with an extensive network of sensory nerves and often are exquisitelysensitive to inflammatory or invasive disorders. Pleural pain usually is sharp and aggravated bydeep breathing or coughing. Airway inflammation can cause discomfort in the anteriorretrosternal chest, and it is thought that pulmonary hypertension also can cause a nonspecificdiscomfort anteriorly over the hilar regions. Sharp or aching chest wall pain can be caused bybone metastases, rib fractures, or muscle injuries (occasionally from coughing). Most pain in the lungs and chest wall responds well to usual pain medications. Anti-inflamma- tory drugs alone, such as aspirin, trilisate, acetaminophen, ibuprofen or naproxen, may be effec-tive. If stronger drugs are needed, combination opioid/acetaminophen preparations such ashydrocodone (2.5 to 10 mg hydrocodone/500 mg acetaminophen) every 4 hours or oxycodone(5 mg oxycodone/325 to 500 mg acetaminophen) may be effective, but total daily doses of ac-etaminophen should be monitored to avoid exceeding 4 g/day. If higher doses of opioids areneeded, routine doses of morphine or oxycodone can be started and titrated upward as neededwhile continuing standard doses of anti-inflammatory drugs around the clock. Treatment of Hiccup Persistent hiccup is not unusual in terminally ill AIDS patients and can be a distracting and distressing symptom.19 Because of the interruption of normal activity, patients with intractable hiccup can have depression, sleep deprivation, decreased oral intake, and weight loss. Suspectedcauses of hiccups include phrenic nerve or diaphragmatic 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, AM 15126 Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 6: Pulmonary Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 152sion, gastroesphogeal reflux, and such as corticosteroids and barbiturates have been reported to precipitate hiccup.19 If simple mechanical measures such as drinking from the \"wrong side\" of the glass and swallow-ing \"up hill\" against gravity, 13 hypoventilation or carbon dioxide accumulation by breath-holding or breathing into an enclosed space, cold oral fluids or other vagal stimulations do not reducethe symptoms, medications can be used (Table 6-7). Chlorpromazine (12.5 to 50 mg) is some-times helpful and can be given routinely for prophylaxis if necessary. If gastric distension islikely, metochlopramide (5 to 20 mg orally, rectally or intravenously three to four times a day)may help, and as a last resort, a nasogastric tube, inserted transiently to decompress the stom-ach, may provide relief. Table 6-7: Treatment of Hiccup Medication Dose Frequency Route Chlorpromazine 12.5 to 50 mg 6 to 8 hrs PRN PO, IM, PR Metoclopramide 5 to 20 mg 6 to 8 hrs PO, IV, PR Baclofen 5 to 20 mg 8 hrs PO Haloperidol 2 mg 6 to 8 hrs PRN PO, SC, IV, PR Valproic acid 250 mg Daily PO, PR Midazolam 3 to 10 mg PRN SC, IV Midazolam 1 to 5 mg/hr Continuous SC, IV Other treatments with reported benefits include baclofen (10 to 20 mg tid), valproic acid, and haloperidol.19 For intractable hiccup, intravenous or subcutaneous midazolam has been reported to be effective as a bolus (5 to 10 mg), followed, if necessary, by a maintenance continuousinfusion (1 to 5 mg/hr). 20 Management of Hemoptysis Coughing up blood or bloody sputum can be a frightening experience, but usually is not life- threatening. It may at times be difficult to determine whether or not the source of bleeding is inthe lungs. Nasal, pharyngeal, and upper esophogeal blood may also ooze into the upper airways andbe coughed up. The most common pulmonary causes of hemoptysis are infections, such as bronchitis or tuber- culosis, and neoplasms. In the majority of cases, blood in the sputum can be managed by treat- ing the underlying infection or suppressing cough to reduce the irritation and shear forces within the airways caused by vigorous coughing. An expectorant, and control of bronchspasm if present,may also be helpful. Coughing can usually be suppressed with opioids as described above, start-ing with hydrocodone-containing cough preparations and moving to 3 to 5 mg of oral morphineevery 3 to 4 hours, if needed. The dose can be titrated upward when appropriate. If parenteraldoses are necessary, approximately one third of the oral dose of morphine can be given intrave-nously Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 6: Pulmonary Symptoms VI U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 153If bleeding is associated with low platelets or a coagulopathy, it may be possible to reduce bleed- ing in the lungs by treating the hematological abnormalities. On the other hand, there may be times at the end of life when the underlying disorders are not reversed easily or when treatment would only serve to prolong the dying process. In these situations, the most important therapymay be to suppress cough and prepare the patient and family for the results of persistent bleed-ing. Bronchial artery embolization or bronchoscopic interventions are possible for severe he-moptysis, but these approaches probably have limited value in terminally ill patients. Malignancies and severe infections rarely erode from air spaces into large vessels, but the result can be devastating when this occurs. Massive bleeding can impair respiratory function, obstructairways, and exsanguinate the patient. In most terminally ill patients, a focus on the relief of suffering is the most appropriate response. Symptoms of air hunger and choking may require rapid and complete sedation with benzodiazepines and/or opioids. Midazolam can be given intravenouslyor subcutaneously beginning with 2 to 4 mg and titrating quickly upward to 10 to 15 mg if thepatient is still awake and struggling. Larger doses of midazolam may be needed if there appears tobe airway obstruction by blood clots and impending asphyxiation. In these settings, it may behelpful to add parenteral morphine (5 to 10 mg) intravenously or subcutaneously. In situations where injectible drugs are not available, large doses of morphine solution (20 to 40 mg) and lorazepam (2 to 4 mg given sublingually) or diazepam (10 mg orally or rectally) may be appropriate. In patients where significant hemorrhage is a strong possibility, it is helpful to keep dark towels at the bedside to help lessen the visual trauma to patient and family membersassociated with large amounts of bright red blood. Treatment of Airway Obstruction Patients who have airway obstruction from endobronchial masses or extrinsic compression often experience worsening dyspnea and increasing anxiety. These symptoms may be accompa- nied by signs of stridor, decreased intrathoracic air movement, wheezing, or cyanosis. Corticosteroids may be helpful in reducing swelling and inflammation at any time in the pro- gression of the disease. If the disease is identified early enough, interventions including exter-nal radiation therapy, bronchoscopic laser treatment, airway stent placement, or internal radio-isotope application may provide at least temporary symptomatic relief. When airway compromise is advanced, there may be no effective therapeutic options available. The focus of treatment then needs to be directed toward control of symptoms of fear, anxiety and dyspnea. These symptoms can be addressed with increasing doses of benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (beginning with 1 to 3 mg every 4 to 6 hours) and opioids (morphine, 2 to 5 mgparenterally or 5 to 15 mg orally every 2 to 4 hours). Doses can be titrated upward as needed. As airway obstruction progresses, symptoms of severe respiratory distress and/or panic can be anticipated. At this point it may be necessary to use continuous sedation to prevent suffering. Itis essential to discuss this option carefully in advance with the patient and family, since thepatient is likely to die without awakening. If lorazepam is not sufficient to sedate a frightened,anxious patient who is struggling to breathe, midazolam can be carefully titrated to sedation with a loading dose of 3 to 15 mg intravenously or subcutaneously, usually given at a rate not greater than 1 to 2 mg per minute. Sedation can be maintained with a continuous infusion ofmidazolam given intravenously or subcutaneously, or routine doses of longer-acting benzodiaz-epines. Morphine can be added, intermittently or continuously via PCA, to help suppress the Chapter 06 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 15326 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 6: Pulmonary Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 154sensation of severe dyspnea. Addition of barbiturates often helps to maintain sedation and re- duce required doses of benzodiazepines. Pentobarbital, 100 to 200 mg, can be administered orally, rectally or parenterally every 3 to 4 hours as needed. Phenobarbital doses of 60 to 120 mg can be given by similar routes every 6 to 12 hours. Doses of drugs need to be adjusted frequentlyand the patient may require extraordinarily high doses of medications (5 to 15 mg/hour ofmidazolam) to maintain comfort as the airway obstruction progresses. However, with carefulattention to the details of dosing, continuous sedation and a peaceful death are possible. Palliative Treatment of Respiratory Depression When serious respiratory depression occurs from excess opiods, patients respond well to careful titration of naloxone. One ampule of 0.4 mg of naloxone can be diluted in 9 ml of saline and then one ml (0.04 mg) of this solution can be injected every five minutes until specific symptoms suchas respiratory depression or hypotension are reversed. The goal is to treat the symptoms and notto totally reverse the opioid effect. The doses required to treat life-threatening symptoms usu-ally are not disturbing to the recipient and often do not even awaken the patient. CONCLUSION Caring for people who are terminally ill is a unique, but rewarding, challenge for health care providers. As patients face progressive, incurable diseases, we are now able to reassure themthat even their most distressing physical symptoms can be relieved. The less obvious sources of distress, such as loss of independence, anxiety about being a burden to family, unfulfilled dreams, the impending separation from loved ones, unresolved conflicts or guilt, and the need to redefinethe goals and purpose of life, also require attention. In addition to effective symptom management,out patients need a safe environment, willing listeners, and a sense of being valued. They alsoneed accurate information about their disease, an understanding of treatment options, ideas ofwhat to expect in the future, and as much control of their lives as possible. When these needs aremet, the majority of terminally ill people experience a peaceful and comfortable death.

J Pain Symptom Manage U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatobiliary symptoms are ubiquitous in HIV disease. It is esti- mated that up to 93% of patients will have significant GI symptoms at some point during thecourse of their HIV illness. 1 Further, as HIV progresses and the patient becomes more profoundly immunocompromised, the occurrence of GI symptoms increases.2 GI manifestations in advanced HIV disease result from a wide range of pathogenic etiologies.Those etiologies include protozoan, bacterial, or Kaposi's sarcoma; idiopathic processes such as \"AIDS enter-opathy\" or apthous ulcerations. At least one study has demonstrated that the presence of intes-tinal enteropathogens predicts shorter survival in patients with HIV infection. 3 This chapter offers information for assessing and treating HIV-positive patients who presentwith GI symptoms, including the Constipation\u007f Nausea and vomiting\u007f Dysphagia and odynophagia DIARRHEA Diarrhea is the most common GI symptom in HIV disease. Studies have documented a preva- lence of 504 to 905 percent in persons with advanced HIV infection. Prevalence may vary accord- ing to the route of HIV transmission. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) studieshave shown a higher prevalence of diarrhea in gay men compared to those who acquired HIVthrough parenteral drug use. 6 Some studies have shown a decline in chronic diarrhea since the advent of HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy), due to a fall in the number of patientsinfected with opportunistic enteric pathogens. 7 Nonetheless, the majority of patients infected with HIV continue to report diarrhea during the course of their illness. Assessment In evaluating a patient with diarrhea, an attempt should first be made to determine the etiology of the diarrhea. A careful history should be taken to determine the following: \u007f Whether the diarrhea is acute (defined as lasting less than seven to 14 days) or chronic (lasting more than two to three weeks) \u007f Whether the patient has traveled recently\u007f The characteristics of the diarrhea (e.g., large or small volume, frequency, presence of blood) Chpt 07 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 15726 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 7: Gastrointestinal Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 158\u007f The existence of associated symptoms, such as abdominal pain or fever \u007f Dietary practices When the diarrhea is chronic, an attempt should be made to classify it by pathogenic mecha- nism: inflammatory (e.g., Crohn's disease, diarrheas such ascarcinoid altered intestinal motility (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome) or factitious(laxative abuse). Medications should be carefully reviewed as a possible cause of the diarrhea, and suspect medi- cations discontinued. A number of HAART medications (especially the protease inhibitors) arecommonly associated with diarrhea. Medical records should be reviewed carefully to see if the patient has been diagnosed previously with any enteric opportunistic infections, since symp- toms often will be secondary to reactivation of that pathologic process. In addition, medicalrecords can give the palliative care team important insight into the success of previously triedtherapies. Depending on the duration and severity of the diarrhea, it may be appropriate to undertake a limited, noninvasive diagnostic work-up. Stools should be sent for routine culture and sensitiv-ity, acid-fast bacilli culture, ova and parasites and Clostridium dificile toxin. CMV colitis shouldbe considered in patients with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 <50/mm 3) and symptoms consistent with that disease (i.e., diarrhea accompanied by low-grade fever and abdominal pain, with or without rebound tenderness). For these patients, an ophthalmologic examination maybe advisable, since retinitis often coexists with other end-organ CMV disease. In some cases itmay be consistent with palliative principles to perform either colonoscopy or flexible sigmoido-scopy to confirm a suspected diagnosis of CMV colitis, especially now that there exists a well-tolerated (though expensive) oral medication (valganciclovir) that can effectively treat CMVend-organ disease without the need for IV access. Treatment Initiation of therapy with limited or no work-up, however, will be appropriate for the majority of patients in advanced AIDS who have diarrhea. If the specific cause of the diarrhea is clearlyidentifiable, every effort should be made to correct that underlying cause. In many patients, aspecific treatable cause will not be found and therapy will need to be empiric and symptom-targeted. In some patients, a brief trial of an antiinfective agent such as control, antimotility agents such as loperamide (Imodium) or diphenoxylate (Lomotil) or bulk supplements like psyllium should be tried initially. Two recent abstracts found that diarrhea improved in patients given dietary supplementation with the amino acid L-glutamine or probiotics (acidophilus/bifidobacteria). 8, 9 Psyllium and other hydrophilic agents absorb water and can be used to enhance stool consistency. Pancreatic hormone replacement may benefit patients with malabsorption resulting from dysfunction of the exocrine pancreas. Severe, chronic diarrhea may respond only to opioids such as oral tincture of opium. The usual starting dose is 6 drops (0.6 cc) in two ounces of water every four hours. The dose should then betitrated until symptom control is achieved. There is no maximum ceiling for tincture of opium. Chpt 07 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 15826 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 7: Gastrointestinal Symptoms VII U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 159With all of these agents, the patient must always be monitored for the development of constipa- tion or fecal impaction, especially when fluid intake is inadequate. Octreotide (Sandostatin) is a synthetic somatostatin analog that is approved for treatment of profuse water diarrhea sec- ondary to vasoactive intestinal peptide tumors and carcinoid tumors. It has shown variable ef-fectiveness in treating diarrhea in AIDS patients. Its major disadvantages are its high cost andthe fact that it needs to be administered subcutaneously on a regular basis. Intravenous fluids may be appropriate in a patient with dehydration secondary to severe acute or chronic diarrhea. Decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis. If the dehydration is nottoo severe, oral fluid replacement may be adequate. In patients known to have a diagnosis of CMV colitis, it may be appropriate to initiate therapy with one of the approved anti-CMV therapies (ganciclovir/Cytovene, foscarnet/Foscavir, cidofovir/Vistide or valganciclovir/Valcyte). Standard shouldbe followed. Whereas with CMV retinitis maintenance therapy must continue indefinitely, stud-ies have shown that when treating extraocular CMV disease, maintenance therapy often can bediscontinued after a relatively short period of time (usually about four weeks) and the patientsimply monitored for signs and symptoms of recurrence. Dosage information for some drugs used to treat diarrhea is presented in Table 7-1. Table 7-1: Antidiarrheal Agents Drug Class Drug and Dosage Antimotility Agents Loperamide : 4 mg after first loose bowel movement, followed by 2 mg after each subsequent loose bowel movement, not to exceed 16 mg in a 24-hour period Diphenoxylate/atropine : 2.5 to 5 mg (1 to 2 tabs) up to 4 times a day Pancreatic Hormones Pancrelipase : 1 to 3 capsules before meals and snacks Opioids Tincture of opium (paregoric) : 0.6 cc in water q 4 hours (titrate to symptom control) Somatostatin Analogues Octreotide : 50 mcg SC 2 to 3 times a day; can be titrated up to as high as 1500 mg daily CONSTIPATION Assessment Though diarrhea is a more frequent problem among end-stage AIDS patients, constipation is also seen. Constipation can sometimes be difficult to determine since there is a wide range ofnormal bowel habits. Constipation is usually defined as a frequency of bowel movements lessthan three times a week, but subjective symptoms such as excessive straining, lower abdominalfullness and hard stools must also be considered when making the diagnosis. 10 In the palliative care setting, constipation is usually the result of drugs such as opiates that reduce colonic motil-ity and/or of reduced 07 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 15926 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 7: Gastrointestinal Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 160Treatment Management of constipation is determined by its severity. Mild constipation can often be treated by increasing the patient's dietary fiber intake to a minimum of 20 to 35 grams daily.Some patients will be able to achieve this minimum by making dietary changes but many willneed to take psyllium or another fiber supplement. If constipation is more severe, treatment with laxatives may be required. A variety of different laxatives can be effectively used, belonging to the following categories: \u007fStimulant laxatives cause intestinal motility to increase. Commonly used stimulant laxatives include bisacodyl and cansanthranol. \u007fEmollient laxatives such as mineral oil are given orally or by enema. They act by penetrating and softening the stool. \u007fHyperosmolar agents contain polyethylene glycol and nonabsorbable sugars such as lactulose and sorbitol that act as osmotic agents. \u007fSaline laxatives exert an osmotic effect that increases intraluminal water content. For prevention of constipation, docusate salts are preferred. They areanionic surfactants that lower the surface tension of the stool to allow mixingof aqueous and fatty substances, thereby softening the stool. 10 Table 7-2 presents dosage information for a variety of agents discussed above that are used torelieve constipation. Table 7-2: Agents to Relieve Constipation Drug Class Drug and Dosage Stimulant Laxatives Bisacodyl : 5 to 10 mg orally Casanthranol: 1 to 2 capsules or tablespoons (syrup) 1 to 2 times daily Senna : 17.2 mg at bedtime Osmotic Laxatives Lactulose : 15 to 30 ml twice daily (may be administered orally or rectally) Sorbitol: 70% solution 15 to 30 ml twice daily (may be administered orally or rectally) Emollient Laxatives (stool softeners) Docusate : 200 to 800 mg/day in 2 doses Combination Agents Docusate (50mg) plus senna (8.6mg) tablets: 2 to 4 tablets once or twice daily NAUSEA AND VOMITING Vomiting is under the control of two functionally distinct brain centers. The chemoreceptor trigger zone is found in the fourth ventricle and when stimulated sends impulses to the vomitingcenter (in the lateral reticular formation) which controls the actual act of vomiting. Manage-ment of nausea and vomiting is based on two principal approaches: correcting the underlyingcauses of the nausea and vomiting, and utilizing appropriate pharmacologic agents to alleviate the symptoms. Chpt 07 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:17 AM 16026 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 7: Gastrointestinal Symptoms VII U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 161Assessment With regard to the first approach, the patient's current medications should be evaluated as a possible cause of the nausea and vomiting and any nonessential medications should be elimi-nated or changed. Special care should be taken to identify those medications known to have ahigh likelihood of causing nausea and vomiting. A number of medications have been identifiedas activators of the chemoreceptor trigger zone, including several medications that are fre-quently used in a palliative care setting such as morphine and other opiates. In addition, severalmedications used to treat opportunistic infections and other complications of AIDS are knownto cause nausea and vomiting in a significant percentage of patients. Those medications includeazithromycin (used for treatment and/or prophylaxis of mycobacterium avium complex cryptosporidiosis), sulfadiazine of toxoplasmosis), zidovudine (sometimesused in a palliative care setting to treat AIDS dementia complex) and a number of other medica-tions. A thorough physical exam should always be performed to make sure that the patient does not have an acute abdomen. Conditions such as pancreatitis, gastritis and peptic ulcer disease arefrequent causes of nausea and vomiting and should be considered in the differential diagnosis.Pharmacologic therapy should be directed both at specific suspected diseases (e.g., H 2-antago- nists or proton pump inhibitors for gastritis, metoclopramide/Reglan for and atsymptom control with antiemetics. The choice of antiemetic should be based on an understand-ing of the different classes of medications available and their respective mechanisms of actionand therapeutic indices. Treatment Serotonin receptor antagonists are considered highly effective antiemetics with few side effects. They work by selectively binding to 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptors in the chemorecep- tor trigger zone. The American Society of Clinical Oncology has classified these medications ashaving the highest antiemetic therapeutic index. 11 The serotonin antagonists are known to be particularly effective in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting though theyhave been used effectively in other settings. This class includes ondansetron (Zofran) andgranisetron (Kytril). Substituted benzamides are selective dopamine antagonists that can be useful in all types of vomiting except motion sickness and inner ear dysfunction. Metoclopramide is considered theprototypical medication within this class. In addition to antiemetic effects, metoclopramidealso has substantial peripheral cholinergic effects that enhance gastric emptying. 10 As such, it can be particularly useful in treating nausea and vomiting secondary to gastroparesis.Gastroparesis is frequently present in patients with AIDS and should especially be consideredas a possible etiology in patients who report early satiety or who vomit undigested food morethan two hours after a meal. The effectiveness of metoclopramide is limited by its side effectswhich include acute dystonic reactions, akathisia and are less selective antidopaminergic agents with antiemetic activity. Theyinhibit cerebral dopamine receptors and act primarily at the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Effi-cacy of these medications is generally lower than that of metoclopramide, and side effects in-clude dystonic Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 7: Gastrointestinal Symptoms U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 162Cannabinoids such as dronabinol (Marinol) exert their effects via the central nervous system and have been found to have antiemetic activity both when used alone and in combination with other medications. Marinol is FDA-approved only for use as an appetite stimulant in AIDS pa- tients (it is approved as an antiemetic for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy) though ithas frequently been used \"off-label\" for management of nausea and vomiting in patients withHIV/AIDS. The use of adjunctive Antihistamines and anticholinergics are primarily useful in controllingnausea and vomiting resulting from motion sickness or other inner ear disturbances. They do not act on the chemoreceptor trigger zone and are of little value in other causes of vomiting. 10 Antihistamines may be a particularly useful adjunct for patients on phenothiazines or other antidopaminergic medications since they will usually prevent dystonic reactions. H2-receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors can be used to control gastritis and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which can also be a cause of nausea or vomiting. Other interventions that can be tried include changing the patient's diet or giving the patient smaller, more frequent meals until symptoms are under adequate control. If the vomiting is sosevere that the patient is unable to take oral medications, the antiemetics should be adminis- tered parenterally or by suppository. For patients with chronic nausea, around-the-clock admin- istration of antiemetics should be considered. Finally, appropriate precautions must always betaken to minimize the patient's risk of aspiration. Table 7-3 presents dosage information for many of the antiemetic agents. DYSPHAGIA AND ODYNOPHAGIA Prior to the advent of HAART, approximately one-third of AIDS patients at some point devel- oped opportunistic infections involving the esophagus.12 In fact, esophageal symptoms rank sec- ond only to diarrhea in frequency of gastrointestinal complaints among patients with AIDS.13 Additionally, since opportunistic disorders of the esophagus usually present only after the CD4count has dropped to below 100/mm 3, 14 they are problems that will frequently be seen in pa- tients who have advanced AIDS. Assessment The most common symptoms of esophageal disorders in persons with AIDS are dysphagia and odynophagia. Less common symptoms are retrosternal chest pain, coughing, and hiccups, whichmay occur secondary to acid reflux or esophagitis. Those processes may, in turn, lead to aspirationand/or the development of esophageal ulcers that can then heal and leave esophageal scarring. 15 Infections are the most common cause of esophageal disorders. The most common infectiousetiologies are candida and the herpes viruses herpes simplex (relatively lovirus (more common). Mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium avium complex are infectious causes of esophageal disease that are seen less frequently.

If inadequately managed, these symptoms will likely cause a significantdiminution in the patient's quality of life and lead to other complications such as anorexia,weight loss, malnutrition and the inability to take oral medications. Almost all esophageal infec-tions in patients with AIDS are treatable and in many instances palliation of symptoms will bebest achieved by treating the underlying disorder; attempts at symptom amelioration that fail toaddress the underlying pathology will often be unsuccessful.

In evaluating a patient for possible Candida esophagitis, it should be remembered that while the presence of oral thrush supports its pre- sumptive diagnosis, its absence does not exclude it. While definitive diagnosis can be made onlywith endoscopy, the frequency of Candida infection in advanced AIDS patients makes an em- piric trial of antifungal therapy appropriate in these cases. Treatment Treatment requires a systemic antifungal since topical therapies such as nystatin oral sus- pension or clotrimazole troches only act locally and thus will be effective only in treating oral candidiasis. The medication most frequently chosen to treat Candida esophagitis is fluconazole (Diflucan). The typical treatment course with fluconazole would be to start with a 200 mg load-ing dose and then to place the patient on 100 mg daily. In many patients a two-week course oftherapy will be sufficient to effectively treat Candida esophagitis. Treatment may then be dis- continued and the patient observed for recurrence of symptoms. Some patients will requirepersistent fluconazole therapy and/or doses higher than 100 mg daily. Other medications thatcan be used to treat Candida are itraconazole (Nizoral). If a has candidiasis that is resistant to the azoles, it may be necessary to use intravenous medi-cations such as amphotericin-B or the new antifungal caspfungin (Cancidas). Odynophagia or dysphagia that is caused by CMV infection should be treated with an appropri- ate course of anti-CMV therapy (see guidelines for treating CMV colitis above). Idiopathic or apthous ulcers can often be effectively treated with either a course of corticosteroids 16 or thali- domide.17 Treating odynophagia without regard to the underlying pathology can be attempted by administering standard analgesics or viscous lidocaine but those approaches will often be un-satisfactory. There is no good symptomatic treatment for dysphagia that does not address thecausative 1/28/2003, Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 7: Gastrointestinal Symptoms VII U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 165REFERENCES 1.

INTRODUCTION People who are HIV positive face many challenges, including oral health problems. While most oral health problems are no different from the problems faced by people who are HIV-negative, there are some distinct differences. Further, while some problems may be similar, thelack of a competent immune system can have an effect on the course of an oral disease andrequire a more aggressive approach to treatment, particularly so that what starts out as a minorproblem does not escalate into a major problem with serious health consequences.Palliative treatment of oral problems generally means antibiotics or antiviral medication, alongwith pain medication and a referral to a dentist\u2014usually within a day or two. For oral symptomsof HIV disease, as for other syndromes and organ systems discussed in this guide, the distinctionbetween palliative and disease-altering interventions is often blurred. Palliative care interven-tions are often disease-specific, as in the use of antifungal medication for the symptoms of oralcandidiasis or antiviral medication for herpes simplex stomatitis. Other symptoms such as painor xerostomia may be treated effectively with palliative medications. Many of the oral problemsthat develop can be treated effectively by medical providers.The important concern for medical providers caring for HIV-positive patients is to conduct athorough oral exam so that if any of the common conditions are present in the patient's oralcavity, palliative care can be provided and referral to a dentist made expeditiously. Further,while immune-competent individuals can be somewhat lax regarding a six-month oral exam, allpeople living with HIV/AIDS should have routine examinations by a dentist every six months.Although the information provided here is designed for providing palliative care, the most effec-tive treatment is in fact prevention. Prevention is best achieved by regular visits with a dentist,and by having the medical provider conduct thorough examinations of the oral cavity at eachcheck-up visit. The oral exam should inspect and document tongue, cheeks, palate and condi-tions of the teeth, looking for growths, abnormal mucosa, lesions and tumors\u2014all signs of one ormore oral manifestations of HIV.Since early in the course of the AIDS epidemic, more than 30 different oral manifestations ofthis disease have been reported. This section will address the seven most common oral healthissues facing people who are HIV positive and the immediate treatment that can be provided.Patients with advanced disease are more likely to have the conditions described than are as-ymptomatic patients.Treatments for oral problems in HIV-positive patients are specified in Table 8-1: Medications forOral Conditions.

Medical providers do not need to be concerned with a few carious lesions (cavities). However, rampant decay in an HIV-positivepatient's teeth frequently lead to pulpal infection, followed rapidly by abscess formation, which is important to either prevent or treat promptly. Some antiretroviral medications (e.g., indinavir) can cause decreased salivary flow, which is known to result in rampant caries; it is not uncommon for patients with decreased salivary flow to have multiple carious lesions. These lesions frequently are at the cervical area, the part of the tooth where the crown meets the roots. The tooth surface at this area is cementum, not enamel,and more likely to decay at a faster rate. Further, this can lead to an abscess formation which can be debilitating. A photo showing rampant decay in the cervical area can be seen in Color Plate 8-1 at the end of this chapter. In cases of rampant decay, treatment should be expedited, which may mean that the dentist uses the technique called scoop and fill . As quickly as possible, and usually without anesthesia, the bulk of the decay is scooped out, using hand instruments, and then filled with a temporary filling or medium that contains fluoride, so that further decay is inhibited. The filling material ofchoice is glass ionomer. Once the teeth are temporized by the scoop and fill , the dentist can then go back and restore each tooth in a traditional manner. Until the patient can be treated by a dentist, several steps can be taken by medical providers. The first, and clearly most important, is to determine if there are any cavities that have extended intothe pulp, causing an infection. This is recognizable by swelling, and would be noticed by medical providers during a routine examination of the oral cavity. Infections should be treated with antibi- otics, preferably penicillin. Treatment should be immediately implemented, and a referral to adentist should occur within days. The treatment for an abscess is the same for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. If there are no obvious infections, but decay is present, particularly if the decay is extensive, pallia- tive care consists of fluoride mouth rinses, which can be prescribed by the medical provider priorto referring the patient to a dentist. Referral should occur as soon as possible, but this is not an urgent problem. There are artificial saliva products that can be used with patients who have active decay, result- ing in part from xerostomia (dry mouth) that can be caused by medications or even HIV infec- tion itself. However, the frequency with which these artificial saliva products have to be used may be unrealistic, and patients may prefer to use sugar-free lemon drops, which stimulatesaliva, another palliative treatment that is effective. Medical providers can suggest the use of either sugar-free lemon drops or over-the-counter saliva substitutes. ORAL CANDIDIASIS Oral candidiasis is a relatively frequent problem for people who are HIV-positive. This condition has several different forms, the most common being pseudomembranous candidiasis. Candidiasis, which presents with small white patches any place in the mouth, can be mistaken for materia alba, or food particles. A photo showing pseudomembranous candidiasis is seen in Color Plate 8-2. Pseudomembranous candidiasis is generally white, and can easily be wiped off. There may be an erythematous area or bleeding under the white patch. The patient usually notices a change in taste, with food becoming undesirable. Further, there may be pain or a burning sensation asso-ciated with this lesion. Chapter 08 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:18 AM 16926 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 8: Oral Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 170Palliative treatment includes the use of antifungal medications. The medications most commonly used are systemic, including clotrimazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole. Treatment should be pro- vided by whomever diagnoses this condition, the medical provider or a dentist. However, if a den-tist is the first provider to diagnose candidiasis in a patient, it is important that the medical pro- vider be informed. The presence of a candida infection is not a normal condition, and is a sign of immune dysfunction, which should be brought to the attention of the medical provider. There are several other forms of candidiasis, all less common than pseudomembranous. When pseudomembranous candidiasis occurs at the corner of the mouth it is called angular cheilitis. (Color Plate 8-3) Palliative care requires topical antifungal medication, i.e. clotrimazole. Erythematous candidiasis usually appears on the tongue or hard palate, and has a red appear-ance that cannot be wiped off. The fungal infection is usually intracellular. Atrophic candidiasis usually appears on the tongue. Both of these lesions can cause altered taste sensation and/or pain and burning sensation. Palliative treatment of these conditions is the same as that forpseudomembranous candidiasis. All forms of candidiasis should be treated promptly. Candidiasis can cause pain and can alter taste sensation, make eating even more difficult. For patients with advanced disease, particu-larly with wasting syndrome, untreated candidiasis can create serious problems. As is true for most conditions, as a patient's viral load decreases, and/or the CD4 counts im- prove, the appearance of candidiasis decreases. ORAL HAIRY LEUKOPLAKIA Oral hairy leukoplakia was a common condition prior to the use of antiretroviral therapy and still exists, although it is less common now. The lesion is shown in Color Plate 8-4. The etiological agent for oral hairy leukoplakia appears to be the Epstein-Barr virus, in combination with the HIVvirus, and the occurrence of this condition appears to be associated with a reduced CD4 count. The lesion appears as a white patch, almost always on the lateral border of the tongue, with a very characteristic striated appearance. The lesion is benign and usually is not treated. Pallia- tive treatment would be the use of an antiviral medication such as acyclovir or famciclovir;treatment may be considered for cosmetic reasons or if the lesions become large and bother- some to the patient. However, inasmuch as there usually are no symptoms, there is rarely need for any treatment. Patients need to be advised that this is a condition that generally causes no problems and can disappear, particularly as the CD4 count improves. The condition does not cause any discomfort and does not cause a change in taste perception. Lesions usually last until the CD4 counts improve or the patient is receiving antiviral medication. This condition can resemble pseudomembranous oral candidiasis; the difference is that while oral candidiasis can be wiped off, hairy leukoplakia cannot be wiped off. RECURRENT APHTHOUS STOMATITIS (CANKER SORES) Apthous stomatitis is a common condition for all patients, irrespective of their HIV status. (Color Plate 8-5) However, in patients who are HIV positive the duration of the ulcer can be extended and aphthous ulcers minor become aphthous ulcers major more frequently. The dif- ference between minor and major ulcers is the size (major ulcers are more than one centimeterin diameter) and the seriousness of the condition. Chapter 08 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:18 AM 17026 picasA Clinical Guide Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 8: Oral Problems VIII U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 171Recurrent aphthous lesions are generally shallow, cratered lesions with a raised, erythematous border and a gray, central pseudomembrane. HIV-positive patients can have these lesions on keratinized tissue, whereas HIV-negative patients generally do not. These lesions are left to heal on their own in a patient with a competent immune system. How- ever, the lesions do cause pain and can become quite large, particularly if a patient has a com- promised immune system. If the lesions become secondarily infected, treatment should beimplemented immediately. Accordingly, HIV-positive patients require palliative care for any le-sion, irrespective of its size, to prevent it from expanding, creating potentially serious problems. Palliative care consists of a steroid medication, most frequently topical, to prevent the possibil- ity of an extended problem or progression to recurrent aphthous stomatitis major. Options fortreating aphthous ulcers include dexamethasone solution and spit\"), local steroid oint- ment (such as Kenalog, sometimes compounded together with an adherent paste such as Orabase), or even systemic steroids such as prednisone for patients with large lesions or sus-pected involvement of the esophagus or lower gastrointestinal tract. Treatment with thalido- mide has recently been approved for aphthous ulcers in patients with AIDS. Patients with advanced disease, particularly if they have wasting syndrome or are generally debilitated, have great difficulty when this lesion causes pain and decreases their ability toconsume food comfortably. Early treatment is key, and palliative care should be implemented right away. These lesions can be mistaken for recurrent herpes. Patients with either lesion have had a history of this condition and usually do not suffer from both, so a reliable history is a goodmethod to determine the condition; viral cultures for herpes simplex can also be helpful. RECURRENT HERPES SIMPLEX Herpes simplex lesions, like aphthous ulcers, occur frequently irrespective of a patient's HIV status. (Color Plate 8-6) Just as aphthous ulcers can be more problematic for HIV-positive pa- tients, the same is true for herpetic lesions. Herpes simplex lesions can be more painful, larger, and more prone to secondary infections in HIV-positive patients. Again, like aphthous ulcers,these can accelerate problems for patients with wasting syndrome by causing pain and decreas- ing the ability to eat comfortably. Herpes simplex lesions start with a prodromal feeling of malaise, fever and general debilitation. This can be masked in patients who are already debilitated. There may be an itching or tinglingsensation. Vesicles form, usually within 24 hours, with rupture shortly after, forming a scab. The lesion usually is not treated in an immune-competent patient, and ordinarily resolves within two weeks. However, in immune-compromised patients treatment should be provided, and usually involves the use of a systemic antiviral medication for herpes. Topical medications do not usually work as well as systemic medications in this situation. However, if the condition is at an early stage, priorto the rupture of the vesicles, topical antiviral medication may be effective. Once the vesicles rupture or are well established, systemic treatment with antivirals is warranted, most com- monly acyclovir 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 8: Oral Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 172PERIODONTAL DISEASE Periodontal disease, the chronic inflammatory process that affects the ligaments and bone that support the teeth, is a condition that can occur in all patients irrespective of HIV status.However, there are several conditions that appear to be unique to individuals with a compromised immune system. Periodontal disease\u2014like gingivitis, which is not associated with HIV status but can be present in individuals who are HIV-positive\u2014is treated by the same methods as with HIV-negative pa- tients. The success rate does not appear to depend upon HIV status. The gingival condition originally known as HIV-gingivitis and now called linear gingival erythema consists of a red lesion on the attached gingiva, which can be very painful and can lead toperiodontal disease. (Color Plate 8-7) Ordinary gingivitis is not painful and does not lead to periodontal disease. Palliative care until the patient can get to a dentist consists of antimicro- bial mouth rinses, such as chlorhexidine, and in severe cases, systemic antibiotics. Treatmentshould be limited to a short duration, days, or at most, one week, until the patient can be seen by a dentist. Necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis, which previously was called HIV-periodontitis, is a painful condition that causes rapid bone loss, including the exposure of the bone, and rapid loss ofattachment. This condition can result in the premature loss of teeth. (Color Plate 8-8) Treat- ment includes antimicrobial mouth rinses, systemic antibiotics Metronidazole or Augmentin, and when necessary, pain medication. Again, the patient should be referred to a dentist as soonas is feasible. Palliative care does not definitively treat the underlying periodontal disease. However, frequent dental examinations and care can either prevent periodontal disease from occurring or limit theextent of the disease. OPPORTUNISTIC TUMORS There are several opportunistic tumors that can occur in the mouth which are associated with a patient being HIV-positive. The two most frequently occurring neoplasms are Kaposi'ssarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common neoplasm in HIV-positive patients. It is a malignancy of the endothelial lining of blood vessels and appears clinically as a flat or raised, asymptomatic,purplish lesion that does not blanch with pressure. (Color Plate 8-9) Lesions often enlarge rapidly and can become exophytic. Treatment may be necessary, especially if the lesion inter- feres with function. Various chemotherapeutic regimens (e.g., vincristine, doxorubicin) as wellas alpha-interferon may be somewhat effective, as well as radiation therapy. In many cases HAART itself can be associated with regression of KS lesions. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma when seen in the oral cavity is most often an exophytic soft, tumorlike mass that can enlarge rapidly. (Color Plate 8-10) Biopsy is required for diagnosis and treatmentconsists of radiation and/or chemotherapy. Until treatment can be implemented, palliative care is usually not required. Neither of these conditions is seen until immune suppression is severe and patients have end- stage HIV disease.

INTRODUCTION The prevalence of skin disorders in AIDS patients treated in the palliative care setting is exceptionally high. Unfortunately, accurate diagnosis and proper treatment of skin diseases inboth HIV and AIDS can be an especially challenging and often frustrating task, because thepresentation of common dermatoses is often exaggerated into florid cutaneous eruptions. Thepractitioner also has to be cognizant of more unusual cutaneous disorders that would otherwisebe virtually nonexistent in his or her daily practice. Furthermore, because of the severe immu-nosuppression seen in end-stage AIDS patients, treatment and eradication of these disorders isalmost always difficult, and often not possible. In these instances, appropriate palliative careneeds to be administered in a timely fashion to assure a better quality of life for these patients.The health care provider will need to be aware of the following in caring for AIDS patients in thepalliative care setting who develop skin disorders. \u007f Many common dermatoses may have unusual or unusually severe presentations in HIV disease, and especially in advanced and end-stage AIDS. \u007f The hospice environment predisposes patients with AIDS to certain skin conditions. This is attributable not only to severe immunosuppression, butalso to immobilization, bed confinement, and close quarters. \u007f It is important to recognize primary skin lesions, and to differentiate those from cutaneous changes associated with manipulation and trauma to the skin,such as scratching, picking, and rubbing. These are seen in most patientswith advanced HIV disease, as a consequence of severe, chronic, andintractable pruritus. \u007f A thorough skin examination must be done whenever possible and should be performed under good lighting, with the patient completely undressed.Examine the whole body including scalp, hair, oral mucosa, and nails. It is ofutmost importance to note the pattern of distribution of the lesions and areasof sparing and to determine the predominant type of lesion. \u007f Simple auxiliary tests done on scrapings of the skin can be diagnostic and are extremely helpful in narrowing down the differential diagnosis. They should beperformed as often as possible and whenever a microscope is available. Thesetests include KOH prep generalized the clinical morphology or epidemiology are suggestive of scabies.Cultures for bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, and viruses should always beobtained whenever clinical findings suggest an infection.

EPIDEMIOLOGY The incidence, prevalence, severity, and clinical appearance of cutaneous diseases vary sig- nificantly with the transition from asymptomatic HIV infection to the development of AIDS. Although successful treatment with antiretroviral regimens helps to control many of the cuta-neous disorders, certain skin conditions may actually flare when treatment is effective and a phase of immunologic recovery develops. Proper understanding of the epidemiology of AIDS- related cutaneous disorders can aid in anticipating conditions that may arise, and can hastenappropriate diagnosis and treatment measures to enhance the patient's quality of life. The types of disorders range from infectious processes to malignant conditions and inflammatory disor- ders to conditions directly related to immobility and the hospice environment. Several studies throughout the world have documented with many similarities the most preva- lent cutaneous findings that occur as a patient transitions from asymptomatic infection through AIDS and finally reaches the terminal phase of the disease. One study found that the prevalence of any skin disorders in the HIV-positive population was 91%, with an average of more than twosimultaneous conditions per patient. While xerosis (dry skin) was a common finding irrespec- tive of disease stage, the infectious processes including fungal, bacterial, and viral disease as well as inflammatory conditions such as eczema, pruritus, and psoriasis were increasingly morecommon when matched with the degree of immunosuppression. Additionally, infestations such as scabies and malignancy, specifically Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), were more prevalent with fulmi- nant AIDS and the associated dramatically decreased CD4 counts. 1 Although there has been some disagreement between various epidemiologic studies, there havebeen a few consistent results. Specifically, there seems to be a much higher incidence of infec- tious, inflammatory, and neoplastic conditions as one transitions from HIV to fulminant AIDS. There have been varied reports on the incidence of bacterial infection. 2 One very important factor that changes the incidence of certain types of cutaneous disorders is demographics. Geo- graphic location as well as patient population (i.e., intravenous drug users (IDU), impoverished inner city patients, or homosexual males) dictate the development of some very different condi-tions. For example, when comparing Uthayakumar's 1 cohort of 92% homosexual men to another study made of 74% IDU and only 9% homosexual men, there was a clear distinction in the inci- dence of KS between the two populations with a significantly lower incidence in the IDU popu-lation. 3 Another issue borne out from the various demographic studies is the lack of correlation between absolute CD4 counts and the development of certain cutaneous disorders. While there is some consistency between development of cutaneous conditions with the general health and immuno-logic state of the patient, the standard deviations seen in CD4 counts at the time of diagnosis of many conditions were so large that statistical significance was lost. 3 In addition, many inflamma- tory conditions, which would normally be associated with a healthy, overactive immune system,are seen more frequently in the profoundly immunocompromised. Although it may seem intuitive to think of end-stage AIDS as equivalent to a nearly complete lack of immunity, these patients suffer from a severe, \"cytokine haywire\" that causes a state of cutaneous hyperreactivity respon-sible for the many inflammatory conditions including pruritus and the many forms of 10:23 Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 179PRURITUS AND ITS CONSEQUENCES Pruritus, or the sensation of itching, is the most common dermatologic symptom and it can, at times, be so severe as to drive patients to developing suicidal thoughts. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, it is also the most common dermatologic problem in patients with both HIV and AIDS. With this in mind, accurately diagnosing a pruritic eruption becomes a daunting, yetnecessary task because the pruritus can cause significant morbidity. Pruritus can be localized or generalized and is often associated with a state of hypereosinophilia. It can be caused by skin lesions or rashes or it can indirectly induce the development of skin lesions due to trauma, such as from scratching and rubbing. To establish the etiology of thepruritus, the practitioner should first attempt to identify any primary skin lesions and then follow a rather simple diagnostic algorithm. Examples of types of primary lesions that one com- monly encounters with pruritic eruptions are papules or nodules (\"bumps\"), plaques (slightlyelevated, palpable with large diameter), and exanthems (diffuse or patchy \"redness\" of the skin). Very commonly one sees combinations of different types of lesions that may or may not be associated with surface changes, such as scaling, crusting, or ulceration. Clinical Presentation The clinical presentation of pruritus is widely variable because of its many potential etiolo- gies (Table 9-1). Localized pruritus is usually associated with primary skin lesions, i.e., papulesand burrows of scabies or scaling plaques of tinea corporis. However, generalized pruritus may or may not be associated with primary lesions. For example, pruritus associated with obstruc- tive biliary disease may only demonstrate excoriations, but generalized xerosis cutis shows wide-spread drying, cracking, and fissuring of the skin, which is responsible for intense itching. Un-fortunately, in the terminal stages of AIDS, patients often suffer from cutaneous disorders rep- resenting a combination of multiple pathologies. Often, in addition to xerosis, there may be adverse drug reactions, liver failure, and multiple infections, which all result in potentially un-bearable pruritus, making diagnosis and palliative treatment very difficult. Table 9-1: Most Common Skin Conditions Associated with Pruritus in Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 180Lichen simplex chronicus is a pruritic condition produced and aggravated by scratching or rub- bing. The underlying etiology is not well understood, and some have postulated a sensory neur-opathy whereas others maintain a psychological origin. Inciting factors may include any bites, trauma, or pruritic skin disorders. Prurigo nodularis (Color Plate 9-1), of lichen simplex chronicus is by rubbing and/or scratching. Either hyper- orhypopigmented nodules are often seen on a background of accentuated skin markings and pro-nounced skin thickening. A common consequence of prolonged pruritus and scratching is postinflammatory pigmentary changes. There is often a racial predilection for these changes in that African Americans veryfrequently develop hyperpigmented lesions after resolution of the active disease process. These changes may be so extensive and cosmetically disfiguring as to cause significant anxiety in the patient. Pruritus itself is both an anxiety-inducing disorder and a consequence of anxiety inthat anxiety and related mood disorders help to propagate the vicious cycle of itching, scratch- ing, and itching again. Anxiety and depression, both psychiatric conditions inextricably linked to terminal disease, lower the threshold for pruritus. Diagnosis Apart from the requisite thorough medical history, the physical examination will generally guide diagnosis. The following diagnostic algorithm (adapted from Majors and co-workers4) represents a simplified way of approaching the diagnosis of pruritic eruptions based primarilyon their morphology. The first question to be asked is: \"Are primary lesions present?\" That is, are there intact papules, vesicles, or plaques that have not yet been manipulated by the patient? Are there skin lesions other than those caused by scratching, picking, or rubbing? No Primary Lesions Present If all the cutaneous findings represent the result of scratching or rubbing of the skin, then two main diagnostic alternatives exist: the pruritus either isfrom systemic disease or is psychogenic in origin. At different stages of HIV infection, pruritus can be the direct result of viral infection. For example, the initial manifestation of very early infection, far before overt AIDS takes control, the patients often suffer from a transient, influenza-like illness that may be associated with a morbilliform eruption. This may be pruriticin nature. Additionally, as the patients succumb to the devastating immunologic attack of fulminant AIDS, they suffer from a severe immunologic imbalance. Despite the fact that CD4 counts have plummeted, cytokine production isdrastically dysregulated and often causes generalized pruritus. Other systemic causes of pruritus are renal failure, obstructive biliary disease, mellitus, multiple myeloma, carcinoid,polycythemia vera, lymphoma, or anemia. To rule out these diagnoses a basic workup is recommended as outlined in the section below, Objective Data, below. Otherwise, appropriate psychiatric evaluation and treatment areindicated. Primary Lesions Are Present Once established that a primary cutaneous disease process does exist, the next step would be to determine whether these lesions are associated with hair follicles. One simplified way of doing so is to try to identify the follicular Chpt 09 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:23 Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 181ostium (\"pore\") at the center of each individual lesion. Another way of assessing if they are follicular is to see if the lesions are roughly equally spacedon the affected areas, since hair follicles do have a homogeneous distribution on any given skin area. Yes, Lesions Are Follicular Once it is determined that the lesions are associated with hair follicles, a short differential diagnosis is available and includes folliculitis, acne, and rosacea. No, Lesions Are Found on Sites Other than Hair Follicles The remaining primary nonfollicular, pruritic lesions should then be grouped into two main groups: papular/nodular lesions and the scaly/papulosquamous eruptions. Diagnosis of papular nonfollicular primary lesions most papular urticaria, drug eruptions, miliaria,and Grover's disease (discussed in section on Skin Problems in the Chronic, Bedridden Patient on page 198). The most frequently encountered psoriasis, which are differentiated by the extent of disease, the quality of the scale, location, and degree of associated inflammation (discussed in section on Eczemas and Papulosquamous Disease on page 183). Objective Data In patients with HIV, a thorough skin examination will reveal, in most cases, at least one possible dermatologic cause for the pruritus. In these cases, the skin condition should be treated before an expensive workup for possible systemic causes of pruritus is done, because clearing the skin problem very often clears the pruritus as well. The laboratory investigation for internal causes of pruritus in the absence of primary skin pa- thology and neurologic disease is the same for AIDS patients as it is for the immunocompetent individual. A complete blood count with manual differential can exclude anemia, polycythemiavera, or lymphoproliferative disorders. Liver function tests can rule out obstructive biliary pro- cesses. An electrolyte screen that includes blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose levels excludes renal insufficiency, uremia, and diabetes. Thyroid-stimulating hormone and parathy-roid hormone are good primary screens for thyroid and parathyroid disorders. Treatment As previously mentioned, the first step is to treat any primary dermatologic process. In cases associated with a systemic disease, cure of the underlying systemic process is frequently impos-sible, therefore therapy is aimed at achieving and maintaining symptomatic relief only. Some gen- eral guidelines should be followed, keeping in mind that the main goal is to break the itching/ scratching cycle, because scratching induces more pruritus, thus perpetuating and intensifyingthe problem. Some measures that may help most patients with pruritus are discussed below. \u007f Modification of showering and bathing habits, advocating the importance of taking no more than one shower a day, avoiding hot showers, using soap very sparingly, preferably on the inter-triginous areas only, and not using any abrasive material such as washcloths, sponges, etc. \u007f Adequate moisturization of the skin with daily or twice-daily applications of emollient lotions or creams to prevent or correct xerosis cutis, one of the most common causes of pruritus inpatients with advanced HIV disease.

Usuallypatients are kept on maximum doses around-the-clock if significant relief is desired. \u007f Topical antipruritic agents compounded in moisturizing creams or lotions applied to the most affected areas as often as needed. Most commonly used agents are menthol (0.25%), phenol topical corticosteroid preparations should be used to treat individual lesions of prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus. These can also be compounded with any of the anti-pruritic agents as described above. (See Table 9-2) Harder to control cases can be successfully treated with phototherapy, using either ultraviolet B light or ultraviolet A plus psoralen, a photosensitizing agent, in a regimen known as PUV A. How- ever, this method requires a specialized dermatologic facility and significant commitment to a schedule of treatments administered three times a week for a minimum of 3 months, and istherefore not a practical option for most hospice patients. Intractable pruritus can be successfully controlled with thalidomide but because of its signifi- cant and potentially serious side effects, thalidomide should be used only in selected patients.Thalidomide should be started at 100 mg qd for one to two weeks followed by 200 mg qd. Regularblood tests including complete blood count and viral load should always be obtained while the patient is on this medication. Also one should monitor closely for development of side effects, including neuropathy.

These forms are characterized by varying degrees of erythema, vesiculation, crusting, scaling, hyperpigmenta- tion, and skin thickening. Examples of eczemas commonly seen in individuals with HIV areasteatotic, atopic, seborrheic, nummular, and contact dermatitis. The papulosquamous diseases of the skin are manifold, but have in common their primary morpho- logical characteristics, namely scaling papules and plaques. Common examples of these diseases are psoriasis, rosea, and both HIV-negative and HIV-positive individuals, but, as previously mentioned, their clini- cal presentation can be drastically altered with advancing immunosuppression. Asteatotic Eczema Also known as eczema craquele (Color Plate 9-2), asteatotic eczema is caused by, and therefore usually seen concomitantly with, xerosis cutis generalisata (severely dry skin). Both conditions arethe most common dermatoses seen in individuals with advanced HIV, particularly during the win- ter months, when the degree of humidity in the environment is significantly lower. Dryness of the skin (xerosis) is accompanied by the development of microscopic tears on the skin surface, caus-ing initially subclinical inflammation, intense pruritus, and subsequently evolving into overt ec- zema. This condition is usually one of the first papulosquamous/eczematous eruptions to develop, usually presenting early when the CD4 counts drop below 400 and, as the HIV disease progresses,it becomes more generalized, more symptomatic, and more difficult to treat. Clinical Presentation The usual presentation is with xerosis of the skin, characterized by scaling and varieddegrees of superficial fissuring, affecting especially the lower extremities. When signifi-cant disruption of the skin barrier is present, serous oozing and resultant crusting is seen. The combination of pruritus and disruption in the skin barrier leads to a significantly higher risk for secondary bacterial infection. When severe, pain rather than pruritus maybe a more common symptom. The signs of frank cellulitis, namely erythema, edema, pain,and purulent exudate, should be to skin infections such as dermatophytoses. Treatment Treatment depends on the extent of disease at presentation. First and foremost, it mustbe determined if an overlying bacterial infection is present. If secondary infection is no- ticed, crusts should be removed with wet compresses and appropriate oral antibiotics cov- ering common skin pathogens should be given. When infection is not an issue, then gener-ous use of emollients and keratolytic agents such as urea, salicylic acid, and lactic acidshould be given. Although often ineffective, H1 blockers should be tried to reduce itching and the inevitable associated excoriation. For clearly inflammatory lesions, midpotency topical corticosteroid preparations should be used. Saturated fatty acid soaps, such asEmulave and Basis, should also be used, again with copious lubrication after bathing. 5 Chpt 09 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:23 AM 18326 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 184Nummular (or Coin-Like) Eczema This common condition often presents a diagnostic dilemma because of its resemblance to tinea corporis, pityriasis rosea, and psoriasis, three conditions that are also commonly seen in the AIDS patient. The course of disease is usually a chronic one, with many cases unresponsive to therapy. Clinical Presentation Pruritic, well-demarcated, erythematous, round plaques, usually 1 to 5 cm in diameter, with scales and/or crusts over the entire surface of the lesion (Color Plate 9-3). Nummular eczema is the perfect example of how exacting attention to detail in description of the lesional morphology will help pinpoint accurate diagnosis. The scales are usually mixedwith crusts, as opposed to psoriasis, which has heavy, silvery scale. This is also different from tinea corporis, which shows scaling at the periphery and central clearing, giving it the appearance of a \"ring,\" and pityriasis rosea, which has a \"collarette\" scale just behindthe advancing border of the lesion. Differential Diagnosis A KOH prep must be performed to multifocal Mid- to high-potency topical corticosteroids used twice daily only on the lesions, in con-junction with H1-blocking antihistamines, are the mainstay of therapy. For diffuse dis- ease, caution must be taken when applying potent topical steroids over large body surface areas, because systemic absorption does occur, and with long-term use, the potential forsuppression of the pituitary axis exists. Atopic Dermatitis Atopic dermatitis can flare in individuals with an atopic background and HIV infection, even after decades of complete remission. As with any of the eczemas, it may present features of acute, subacute, or chronic skin inflammation but, in the terminally ill patients, chronic fea- tures of lichenification, hyperpigmentation, and/or hyperkeratosis prevail. Clinical Presentation The most common presentation of atopic dermatitis in HIV-negative adults is chronic, recurrent dermatitis localized to either the palms and soles, ankles and elbows, or popliteal and antecubital fossae. In HIV-positive individuals, immunologic dysregulation favors fre- quent outbreaks, which are initially localized or multifocal, but usually become widespreadand generalized in patients with advanced disease. The clinical features in subacute stages are mild to moderate erythema, crusting, hyperkeratosis, and scaling. Chronic lesions are characterized by secondary changes resulting from manipulation, namely rubbing andscratching. Skin then becomes thickened, darkened and rough with accentuation of the superficial skin markings. Atopic dermatitis is a particularly pruritic type of eczema and when it becomes chronic, excoriations, crusting, and scarring develop as a result of scratch- ing. Commonly affected areas include the face, neck, trunk, flexural surfaces of the ex- tremities, extensor surface of the forearms and lower legs, dorsal and plantar surfaces ofthe feet, and palms and dorsum of the hands (Color 10:23 Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau impetigo. Treatment recently introduced topical tacrolimus 0.1% oint-ment (Protopic) should be used to reduce inflammation. Potent corticosteroids (Class I-II) may be needed at first to gain control of this intensely pruritic condition and then tapered to more mild steroid agents. Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine or hydrox- yzine are very helpful, especially at night. Careful monitoring of the skin for signs of sec- ondary bacterial infection is very important. Skin dryness aggravates atopic dermatitis immensely; therefore, liberal use of emollients and soap avoidance are mandatory. Colloi-dal oatmeal baths followed by widespread application of petroleum jelly daily is also very helpful to control pruritus. Patient education to avoid scratching and rubbing is also needed. Seborrheic Dermatitis Seborrheic dermatitis very often becomes a more florid eruption in AIDS than that seen in the general population, with the extent of disease inversely proportional to the patient's grossCD4 level. Although the incidence of seborrheic dermatitis affecting nonscalp skin in the gen- eral public has been estimated at less than 5%, some studies have documented a prevalence of 40% to 80% in AIDS. The follicular yeast Pityrosporum ovale appears to play a role in the development and maintenance of skin lesions, but it represents only one of multiple factors that may be involved in the pathogenesis of this type of eczema. Clinical Presentation Although seborrheic dermatitis presents in healthy persons as an erythematous, greasy scaling/crusting eruption, usually localized to the nasolabial folds, ears, eyebrows, fore- head and scalp, the eruption in AIDS can be much more extensive. The erythema is sig- nificantly more pronounced and diffuse. Scales are thicker and more greasy, and can re- semble those seen in psoriasis. The skin surface involved is extended past the face and scalp to involve the presternal area, axillae, eruption, intertrigo, andinverse psoriasis. Treatment Inflammatory lesions on the face can be treated with low-potency (Class V) topical corti-costeroid creams and lotions or more potent preparations, depending on the location anddegree of inflammation. They should be applied twice daily. Facial skin is very thin and susceptible to the damaging effects of long-term use of superpotent topical steroids (te- langiectasias, atrophy, striae, discoloration); such steroids, therefore, should be used only as a temporizing measure. Ketoconazole 2% topical cream, lotion, or shampoo, or 200-400 mg of ketoconazole orally per day should be tried because it has been shown to be a treat-ment successful in 25% of cases. 6 Tar and salicylic acid-based shampoos are helpful in cases associated with thick scaling plaques on the scalp.

Its prevalence in HIV- infected individuals is not significantly greater than this, but its presentation is often atypical and more widespread. Not uncommonly, the abrupt development of widespread psoriasis as an adult without prior history of the disease is the first manifestation of HIV infection. Clinical Presentation Psoriasis can develop in one of two forms, namely localized lesions or generalized disease.The typical lesion is a well-circumscribed, erythematous plaque with thick, \"silvery\" scalesthat are easily detached, leaving a bright pinkish/red base (Color Plate 9-5). The most common location is on the areas of pressure and trauma such as the extensor surfaces of the extremities, sacral area, hands, feet, and scalp. In patients with AIDS, however, pso-riasis usually presents as a generalized eruption. Most commonly generalized plaques, but more atypical forms such as erythrodermic and pustular psoriasis, as well as psoriasis associated with severe arthropathy are frequently seen. Differential Diagnosis disease : atypical erythroderma including dermatomyosi- tis and lymphoproliferative disease. Treatment Treatment of generalized disease usually requires some form of systemic therapy, but itoften becomes a difficult issue because of the immunosuppression and/or liver or renal toxicity that can be associated with most of the systemic drugs available. Examples of these therapeutic modalities are the immunosuppressive agents methotrexate andcyclosporine as well as oral retinoids such as acitretin, and biologic response modifierssuch as specific monoclonal antibody therapy. Phototherapy using ultraviolet B alone or PUVA are both associated with very good response rates. Unfortunately, these are not practical options for patients in the hospice setting because these treatments requiretransportation to a facility that has the appropriate equipment, three times a week, for a prolonged length of time. Topical therapy therefore is the therapeutic modality of choice for most of these patients. Mid to high-potency (Classes I, II, or III) topical corticosteroid preparations, coal tar prod- ucts, vitamin D derivatives such as calcipotriol, and vitamin A derivatives such as tazarotene can all be tried. Again, regular emollient use is a very helpful adjuvant measure. Folliculitis Inflammation of the hair follicle usually indicates an infection of the pilosebaceous unit. In AIDS, infections with Staphylococcus aureus are very common but additionally organisms that are part of the normal flora in the hair follicle such as Pityrosporum yeasts ( very pruritic process characterized by eosinophilic inflam- mation. In many instances, an infectious agent cannot be identified and biopsy of the skin lesion reveals destruction of the hair follicle by a dense eosinophilic infiltrate, known as eosinophilicfolliculitis. It has been estimated that 25% of the pruritic conditions of advanced HIV 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:23 AM 18626 picas Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 187represent some type of folliculitis and these prevalence rates can increase during the summer months. In patients receiving chronic antibiotic prophylaxis, a gram-negative folliculitis mayalso develop. Another type of noninfectious folliculitis commonly seen is that associated with hormonal therapy, mainly testosterone and anabolic steroids as well as growth hormone re- placement therapy. Clinical Presentation S. aureus folliculitis is usually caused by cutaneous spread from nasal carriage, which is twice as common in HIV-positive people than in healthy control subjects. The presenta-tion can be varied, but typically consists of erythematous follicular papules and pustules somewhat equally spaced on the skin surface, but may be clustered in some areas. Lesions in different stages present at the same time, with pustules, crusts, and varying degrees ofinflammation and are very suggestive of a bacterial process. Monomorphic superficial pus- tules are more typically seen in folliculitis caused by yeasts, whereas significant edema of individual papules (\"juicy\" appearance) with signs of aggressive excoriation are more sug-gestive of either a parasitic or an eosinophilic process. In cases of bacterial folliculitis, depending on the degree of inflammation and the depth of penetration into the follicle, a painful, erythematous nodule may develop, called a furuncle or boil. Eosinophilic folliculitis usually presents when CD4 counts drop below 200. It presents with urticarial papules usually confined to the upper trunk, face, scalp, and neck, and it can uncommonly also be pustular. The course waxes and wanes and can be characterized by unpredictable flares. There is usually an associated peripheral eosinophilia and el-evated levels of IgE. Diagnosis Clinical diagnosis alone is difficult for the untrained care provider, therefore lesions shouldbe biopsied and sent for culture and histopathology, specifically requesting special stains for different infectious organisms. Treatment In the absence of available tissue for histopathologic examination, it is acceptable to em- pirically treat based on a \"shotgun\" type approach. If forced into such a circumstance by the inaccessibility of a biopsy, coverage for fungal elements, bacterial pathogens and Demodex, in addition to treating the inflammatory component, is required. In such a regimen, ketoconazole 2% lotion applied qd to bid, erythromycin 2% gel applied bid with or without 10% benzoyl peroxide and metronidazole 0.75% lotion applied bid cover fungal, bacterial and Demodex , respectively. Any non-fluorinated steroid of choice used bid is appropriate to control inflammation. In the presence of diagnostic biopsy demonstrating a predominance of either fungal or bacterial or Demodex responsible for the eosinophilic inflammation, treatment modalities should reflect the histopathologic diagnosis. However, in the absence of a biopsy, a \"shotgun\" approach is not always necessary. In many situations, the clinical history and appearance of the lesions can guide a more di- rected approach to therapy. Clinically obvious bacterial folliculitis should be treated with topical antibiotics and benzoyl peroxide combinations. Clindamycin/Benzoyl peroxide aswell as Erythromycin/Benzoyl peroxide combinations are very useful for limited areas. For larger treatments, a benzoyl peroxide wash is helpful. In addition, antibacterial soaps Chpt 09 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:23 AM 18726 Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 188help to reduce colonization by skin flora. If furunculosis is present, then oral antibiotics are required, directed against gram-positive bacteria. If a bacterial folliculitis developswhile already on oral antibiotics, then gram-negative folliculitis should be suspected and treated with Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Extensive, pustular and cystic bacterial fol- liculitis can be treated with the oral retinoid, isotretinoin. However, there is significantpotential morbidity due to the many possible side effects that are often tolerable only inthe immunocompetant host. The potential for liver toxicity, cytopenias and excessive dry- ness of the skin and mucous membranes, to name a few, make oral isotretinoin a far less attractive therapeutic option in AIDS hospice patients. If the clinical picture suggests a folliculitis of fungal etiology, ketoconazole cream or sham- poos are helpful. If extensive or recalcitrant to a two-three week course of aggressive topical therapy, then oral antifungals should be used. Demodex folliculits should first be treated with topical metronidazole, or permethrins. Often, if a clinical overlap exists, then a combination regimen using two or more of the above topical medications may hasten clinical remission. OTHER COMMON INFECTIONS Bacterial Infection Bacterial infection most commonly represents secondary penetration of skin flora as a result of barrier disruption due to severe xerosis, eczema, or by direct penetration. The gram-positiveorganisms, both Strep and Staph genera, are responsible for impetigo and ecthyma as well recurrent cellulitis. Clinical Presentation Erythematous, minimally elevated papules covered by honey-colored thin crusts. May be limited to one or a few lesions or may be multiple, coalescing into crusted plaques. Ecthyma is a more localized and clearly a deeper process, presenting with more induration, erythema, and edema with thedevelopment of a thick eschar that heals with scarring. Cellulitis More commonly encountered on the lower extremities, there is a poorly defined patch of erythema surrounding the site of initial penetration by bacteria. At that site, pus and crust are often present. Peripherally from this lesion, one may see erythematous streaking, suggesting lymphangitic spread ofbacteria. The involved region is also painful and warmer than on the opposite leg. As a general rule, bilateral lower extremity cellulitis does not exist. Cellulitis is differentiated from erysipelas as follows: Erysipelas shows a veryindurated, tense lesion with a well-demarcated, elevated border that more commonly occurs on the head and neck region. Diagnosis Culture is generally not necessary and typically yields the expected pathogenic skin flora. Sensitivities will be useful, however, in disease that is recalcitrant to treatment to investi-gate antibiotic resistance profiles.

The preferred treatment for nonbullous impetigo is either penicillin VK 250-500 mg PO q6-8h penicillin G-benzathine x 1, 250-500 PO or dicloxacillin mg PO q6h x 7d. In addition to theaforementioned antibiotic regimens, practitioners should soften the crusts with clean Vaseline or Bacitracin ointment several times per day, wash the individual lesions with antibacterial soap or antiseptic solution and water,trying to gently remove crusts twice a day, instruct the patient not to touch the lesions and to wash hands frequently, and clip fingernails short to decrease risks of excoriation, self-inoculation, and contagion. Cellulitis While penicillin is, in most cases, appropriate for the treatment of uncompli- cated streptococcal cellulitis, the problem of resistance is very real. Keeping this in mind, a penicillinase-resistant penicillin (e.g. dicloxacillin 250-500 mgPO qid) (e.g. cephalexin 250-500 mg PO qid) may be used. These also should be kept in mind for Staphylococcal genera. However, mild cases of non-resistant Streptococcal cellulitis may be treated with penicillin V 500mg PO q6h x 10d or penicillin G benzathine 1.2 mil U IM x1. If penicillin allergic, then Erythromycin 250-500mg 250mg q12h x 7-10d. For severe cases, penicillin G 2-4mil U IM or IV q4-6h (maximum 24mil U/day) is suggested. Other interventions besides antibiotics include immobilization and elevation of the affected area, moist heat compresses, and debridement and drainage when bullae, abscess or necrosis is present. Viral Infections Viral infections tend to run rampant in patients with advanced HIV disease. Not only are Herpes simplex infections the most commonly seen in this setting, but Varicella zoster virus reactivation as well as poxviruses and human papillomavirus infection are all especially common. Clinical Presentation Herpes simplex virus Herpes labialis Herpes labialis often begins with a prodrome of pain or burning on the lip prior to eruption of a tender, vesicular, erythematous lesion that crusts in a fewdays. In advanced HIV infection, the lesions may be chronic, difficult to eradicate, often resistant to standard antiviral therapy, and may become more Chpt 09 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:23 AM 18926 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 190extensive, often involving not only the lip but part of the cheek as well, making diagnosis more difficult. Genital herpes Seen in both the healthy and AIDS populations, genital herpes presents with either shallow, clean, superficial ulcers on an erythematous base or with a patch of erythema with a cluster of vesicles that later ulcerate. These lesions are alsopainful. In advanced AIDS, the chronic, extensive perianal lesions may provide adiagnostic challenge (Color Plate 9-6). As ulcers become confluent and the associated patches of erythema larger, they often resemble Candida intertrigo and irritant contact dermatitis from chronic diarrhea. Again, careful examina-tion is paramount to accurate diagnosis and treatment because antifungal agents will not help and topical steroids will make the infection much worse. Candidal intertrigo usually involves the entire perineum, not simply the perianalregion, characteristically has peripheral satellite lesions, and ulceration is not a feature. In addition, chronic diarrhea and incontinence should cause perianal irritation and maceration, but there should not be large regions of ulcerationunless there is also associated decubitus ulcer. In such cases, it is always best to swab the ulcer base for viral culture. Herpetic whitlow Painful, tender, erythematous patch on the distal phalynx of usually one finger. Whitlow is the result of direct inoculation of the finger from another site andbefore AIDS was more commonly seen in health care workers as a conse- quence of direct, ungloved the dorsal root ganglia nerves is a painful sequella to AIDS-related immunosuppression. Following a dermatomal distribution, a strikingly erythematous cluster of papules forming a plaque with overlying vesicles is often present in a patch- orband-like configuration. The presentation in normal hosts is one in which any significant portion of the rash rarely crosses the midline. However, in the AIDS group, zoster may be more inflamed and painful and may be dissemi-nated. Chronic and recurrent forms may also become an issue. Burning pain may either precede the cutaneous eruption or may continue after the acute episode as postherpetic neuralgia. The postherpetic neuralgia is a cause ofsignificant morbidity, as the intense burning pain can last for years after thecutaneous lesions have gone and is often very difficult to treat, especially in this population. Involvement of the tip of the nose signifies involvement of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve and heralds a potential ophthalmicemergency, termed zoster ophthalmicus. In AIDS patients receiving chronic acyclovir therapy, acyclovir-resistant VZV infection may present with a chronic, disseminated form of Zoster. The lesions are warty, hyperkeratotic papuleswith or without ulceration or eschar formation. Molluscum contagiosum A contagious viral infection previously seen predominantly in children, this previously benign condition can occasionally have devastating consequencesin AIDS. Chpt 09 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:23 Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 191Simple The usual presentation in both normal children and adults with AIDS is that of scattered skin-colored, dome-shaped papules, approximately 3 mm in diameter with a central dimple, or umbilication. The lesions can be a few in number orbe present in hundreds, covering large areas of the body, commonly the faceand neck, with devastating impact on the patient's quality of life. ComplicatedLess frequently, in the immunocompromised patient giant molluscum may ensue with larger papules that appear in a cluster and aggregate into largefungating plaques (Color Plate 9-7). Human papillomavirus Different serotypes of the human papillomavirus (HPV) dictate where a wart will arise on the body. Verruca vulgaris, or common warts, are frequently seen in boththe general population and in AIDS patients. They are difficult to eradicate in both groups. Condyloma accuminata, or genital warts, flourish in the immunosup- pressed host and may reach very large sizes, presenting as warty, cauliflower-likegrowths in the perineal region. Flat warts do occur in the normal host, but tend to flourish in the immunocompromised. They appear as groups of hypopigmented, flat-topped, regularly shaped 2 to 4 mm papules that, at times may be so flat as toappear macular. Condyloma accuminata are generally associated with HPVserotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18. There is a significantly increased risk for the development of squamous cell carcinoma when the lesions are associated with HPV types 16 and 18. Anogenital veruccae are often difficult to visualize withoutanoscopy and, unfortunately, may cause the most significant morbidity, as very large growths may partially obstruct the anal canal. Diagnosis Most of the aforementioned disorders are diagnosed strictly on clinical grounds; however, viral culture and serotyping can be an important tool for not only confirmation of theclinical suspicion but also for viral sensitivity profiles, because resistance is not uncom- mon. If the diagnosis is uncertain, then a simple punch biopsy of the lesion in question can also aid in diagnosis. A Tzanck smear for HSV can be performed in the office if vesiclesor fresh ulcers are present. Old, previously unroofed blisters or ulcers will not suffice. Using a sterile scalpel blade and a sterile swab, the intact blister roof is removed and the base of the blister is aggressively scraped. (Extraction of the blister fluid alone is insuffi-cient for the Tzanck smear.) Once the base is swabbed, the cells are rubbed onto a micro- scope slide and the specimen is rapidly fixed and stained in the office prior to microscopic examination looking for multinucleated giant cells. During the same procedure, a culturemay be taken from the same denuded blister. Treatment HSV The approach to treating herpes labialis, genital herpes, and herpetic whitlow are very similar. Previous initial therapy utilized acyclovir, a cumbersomeregimen that required five daily doses which, in combination with other AIDS Chpt 09 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:23 AM 19126 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 192regimens, raises compliance issues. Therefore, valacyclovir (Valtrex) is generally the preferred starting regimen for uncomplicated HSV. A dosingregimen of 1 g bid for 7 to 10 days should be tried first. For widespread or nonresponsive forms of HSV, intravenous acyclovir should be used and cultures should be obtained for sensitivity. Resistance is common and other drugregimens such as foscarnet should be used for resistant herpes. VZV For uncomplicated Zoster, the same generalized initial treatment guidelines as for HSV apply. However, Zoster ophthalmicus and the more complicated forms of generalized zoster require hospitalization and intravenous acyclovir. Zosterophthalmicus requires emergency consultation by ophthalmology. Molluscum Uncomplicated molluscum is more of a nuisance and cosmetic problem that is common in the AIDS population. Although there is no permanent cure, it canbe easily controlled with local destructive methods and immunomodulatory agents. The key is not allowing the infection to run rampant. Localized, minimal disease can be treated with cryotherapy, electrocautery, blister beetleextract (cantharidine), cidofovir, or the immunomodulator imiquimod cream, applied 3 nights per week. However, giant molluscum is very resistant to all known therapies. Cryotherapy, CO 2 laser, tretinoin and trichloroacetic acid have all been used, and are generally unsuccessful.7 HPV Common warts, flat warts, and genital warts are all caused by different strains of HPV and therefore share many similar therapies. Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen should be performed with three cycles of at least 10-second freezefollowed by complete thaw. A blister should form within 24 hours. This treatment should be repeated approximately three weeks later. Often, for extensive local disease, podophyllin can be also be used. Imiquimod has beenshown to be effective in clearing clinical disease as well. HIV-positive individuals usually are infected by more than one HPV-type simultaneously and frequently harbor one of the oncogenic types, which places them at higher riskfor anal dysplasia and anal carcinoma. If a patient has a history of perianal warts, receptive anal intercourse, or penile or vaginal warts or reports a partner with penile warts, a Pap smear should be obtained from the analcanal. If any degree of dysplasia is observed, an anoscopic examination withbiopsy of suspicious lesions is recommended. In the hospice setting, however, more relevant issues are keeping the lesions at a size that will allow adequate bowel movements without discomfort and also monitoring for secondarybacterial infection of the vegetating mass. Large and potentially obstructive anal lesions must be dealt with surgically. Adequate hygiene, including washing the perianal area after bowel movements instead of wiping it with drypaper, helps prevent secondary bacterial infections. Fungal Infection Fungal infection is no more common in AIDS patients than in the general population, but the character of the infection changes as patients become more immunocompromised. These most Chpt 09 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:23 Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 193common fungal infections are the \"tineas,\" caused by dermatophyte fungi, followed by Candida infections. As the disease progresses, patients are more susceptible to acquiring deep fungalinfections such as blastomycosis and sporotricosis and also to developing cutaneous lesions of generalized systemic fungal infections, such as cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis. There is also a poorer response to standard therapies and higher recurrence rates. Additionally, the resultingskin breakdown may also predispose these patients to bacterial superinfection and bacteremia,which they are ill equipped to handle. Clinical Presentation Dermatophytoses Superficial fungal infections in AIDS patients may be extensive, especially in the groin occur with a similar frequency in the general population, but tinea pedis is the most common dermatophytosis seenin AIDS. 8 With all three infections, the lesions may become more widespread, larger, and more resistant to traditional therapies. They may also present with atypical clinical features resembling other noninfectious dermatologicproblems (Color Plate 9-8). Thrush Oral candidiasis, or thrush, occurs in almost all HIV patients and is often difficult to cure. In addition to immunosuppression, complicating factors include a high rate of oral carriage in even healthy patients as well as frequentand long-term antibiotic use. Classically, there are white plaques on the palate, tongue, and gingival area, which can be scraped off to leave an erythematous, often slightly bleeding base. In the case of long-standinginfection, it may be difficult to scrape them off. Dysphagia and sore throat are all commonly associated complaints. Candida intertrigo occurs commonly in patients with warm, macerated, moist skin and very commonly in AIDSpatients (covered in Skin Problems in the Chronic, Bedridden Patient on page 198). Candida paronychia is a frequently misdiagnosed condition that is often seen in patients who wash their hands frequently, do dishes frequently, or havetheir hands in cleaning solutions. Periungual erythema, swelling, and theextrusion of pus is a common presentation, and is often misdiagnosed as bacterial infection. Here, the patient's history should guide diagnostic and treatment options. Deep Fungal Infections Presentation varies from fungating nodules and tumors to ulcers and diffuse papulonodular disease. Cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis, when affecting the skin, may present with multiple, widespread, translucent, dome-shapedpapules with a slight central dimple resembling molluscum contagiosum, but the morphologic variation can be broad. Diagnosis Dermatophytes Tinea can have atypical presentations in these patients, often resembling one of the eczemas or even psoriasis. As a rule of thumb, every lesion that Chpt 09 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 194has to be scraped for a KOH prep. When scraping suspected lesions, use a disposable scalpel blade, held perpendicularly to the skin, collecting theobtained scales on a microscope slide. Then add a drop of 10% KOH, cover with a coverslip, and warm the slide up by placing it under a flame for three to five seconds. The slide is then examined under the microscope looking for thepresence of septated, branching hyphae. The highest yield is obtained whenthe peripheral scales on the edge of the advancing lesional border are scraped. Thrush Although the differential diagnosis for white plaques in the mouth is extensive, thrush is largely a clinical diagnosis. A KOH prep may be helpful when clinicalpresentation is atypical. Most AIDS patients will have asymptomatic colonization, so the only use of cultures is for speciation and to determine sensitivity. Adherent white plaques on the sides of the tongue in AIDSpatients may represent oral hairy leukoplakia, caused by Epstein- Barr virus infection. Biopsy can definitively differentiate the former from squamous cell carcinoma. Deep Fungal Infection Culture is indicated for deep fungal infection. If cryptococcal infection is suspected, India ink stain or Wrights stain may be performed. Culture of histoplasmosis takes several weeks to grow. Treatment Dermatophytes For limited disease, topical antifungal preparations should be tried first. Treatment has to be performed for a period of two to three weeks, even aftersymptoms have completely subsided. Oral antifungal agents are needed whenfungal infection is widespread, when it affects a hairy area such as the scalp or beard, or when nails are affected. Currently available oral drugs are griseoful- vin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and terbinafine. Things to keep inmind when selecting an oral antifungal agent are the potential drug interac- tions with antiretroviral drugs and also with the drugs that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Many of the oral antifungal agents areassociated with a significant risk of hepatotoxicity when given for a prolonged period of time, such as that required for treatment of nail infections. Therefore, in patients with a history of hepatitis or other liver disease, theoptions are limited. Ketoconazole's absorption is reduced by achlorhydria that is often seen with AIDS, so it should be taken with a cola soft drink, which can increase absorption by 50%. Thrush In our experience, clotrimizole troches are superior to nystatin swish-and- swallow, likely because of greater contact time with the oral mucosa. For difficult to treat infections, studies have shown that PO fluconazole is equal in efficacy to itraconazole.9 The practitioner should keep in mind that even with Chpt 09 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:23 AM 19426 picas Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 195the best current therapies, Candida albicans relapse rate is high, and the failure rate is even higher. There is a high incidence of resistant Candida species among patients with HIV, and prolonged treatment failures necessitate culture for sensitivity profiling. Deep Fungal Infections Cryptococcal infection is the most common lethal mycosis in AIDS and should be treated with amphotericin B with fluconazole as secondary prophylaxis.10 Histoplasmosis should also be treated with amphotericin 0.5 mg/kg/d IV or itraconazole 200 mg PO bid. Scabies Infestation with the mite Sarcoptes scabeii var hominis results in an intensely pruritic erup- tion in both the normal host and in the AIDS patient. An investigation for scabetic infestationshould always be performed in any patient with a persistent or widespread, pruritic eruption. Keep in mind, however, that there may be significant differences in the clinical presentation of scabies in the immunocompromised host. Clinical Presentation Typical Scabies Multiple small, pinpoint to pinhead sized erythematous papules that can be intact, but usually are excoriated due to the intense pruritus. Areas commonlyaffected are the interdigital spaces of the hands, wrists, antecubital fossae, anterior axillary areas, inframammary folds, periumbilical area, waistline, buttocks, and inner thighs. The male genitalia is usually affected and nodulescan be seen on the scrotum. The diagnostic clinical finding is the presence ofburrows on the skin. They present as a pink papule at the end of a small linear tract only a few millimeters in length, often in the interdigital spaces of the hand or lateral aspects of the feet. In many cases, the papular lesions arecaused by an immune response to the mites and, even when they are small in numbers, the affected individuals may still present with widespread skin lesions. Atypical, Crusted, or \"Norwegian\" Scabies The incidence of this variant is very low in comparison with typical scabies, but higher in AIDS patients than in the healthy population. Varying degrees of hyperkeratotic plaques associated with skin thickening and crusting isobserved (Color Plate 9-9). Fissuring is common, as is bacterial superinfection and even bacteremia. Burrows may not be evident because of the thick overlying crust. These patients are infested with millions of mites, andpruritus, if present, is often only minimal. This form of scabies is usuallymisdiagnosed and, because it is an extremely contagious process, it becomes a walking source of infestation for the health care workers and other patients for prolonged periods of time before patients are correctly diagnosed andadequately treated. It should be noted that there have been no reported cases of HIV transmission via scabetic mites passed from patient to health care worker. Chpt 09 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:23 AM 19526 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 196Differential Diagnosis Classical scabies forms of ec- zema and lichen planus. Diagnosis Identification of the mites, their eggs, or their feces from skin scrapings is necessary for diagnosis. The region most fruitful for scraping is a nonexcoriated papule, especially inthe burrows. Scrapings can also be performed from under the fingernails because this is aprotected area. Once an adequate sample is scraped onto a microscope slide, a drop of mineral oil is placed on the specimen and covered with a coverslip before viewing under the microscope. Treatment Scabetic infestation represents a good example of why topical steroids should not be givento patients until an exact diagnosis has been reached. Suppression of the local immuneresponse around the infection will only help the mite, not the patient. Even though the estimated life span of the mite outside of human hosts is very short, it is important that the patient's environment, including bed sheets, towels, and personal clothing that have beenworn and are not freshly laundered should all be washed. Whenever possible, carpeting and upholstery should be cleaned. This should be done after the patient has completed the recommended treatment. In addition, all intimate contacts and nonintimate house-hold or roommate contacts should be treated simultaneously. Health care workers who had direct skin contact with the patient or their bed should also be treated as soon as possible. Topical antiscabetic preparations include permethrin 5%, crotamiton 10%, andlindane 1%, applied to cover the entire body surface once, washed off 10 to 12 hours laterand repeated 10 to 14 days later when the female mite's eggs hatch. Ivermectin, although not FDA-approved for this purpose, has shown to be effective as a single-dose oral treat- ment for scabies in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. 11 The dose is 200 mi- crograms (\u00b5g) per kilogram of body weight once and repeated 10 days later if necessary. This is a good option when compliance is questionable and in epidemics affecting hospi- tals and hospices. Case reports have noted that for the thick plaques of crusted scabies, acombination of oral and topical antiscabetic regimens is likely most effective. For cases of crusted scabies, a keratolytic agent such as salicylic acid 3-5% or urea 20% should also be used to facilitate removal of the crusts that harbor thousands of mites and penetration ofthe antiscabetic medication. Side effects of ivermectin include eosinophilia and constitu- tional symptoms. It should not be given to young children, pregnant women, or breastfeeding mothers. Kaposi's Sarcoma Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most common tumor seen in patients infected with HIV and is an AIDS-defining illness. More common in homosexual or bisexual men, KS is also 300 times more common in AIDS patients than in patients immunosuppressed for transplants. The etiol-ogy is clearly multifactorial; however, there have been significant strides made in the past de- cade in understanding the pathogenesis of this tumor. At the heart of the pathology is angiogen- Chpt 09 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:23 Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 197esis, and various mechanisms are known to be responsible, namely sexual transmission of hu- man herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), an altered cytokine environment and the HIV trans -activating pro- tein, Tat.12 It is thought that in the presence of a dysregulated cytokine milieu, Tat induces HHV8, which also encodes on its genome, viral IL-6. This IL-6 leads to increased expression of endothelial growth factor which, in turn, promotes angiogenesis. 13, 14 Clinical Appearance The skin is the most commonly affected organ, where this disorder may present with ei-ther a few localized lesions or diffusely (Color Plate 9-10). Any body area may be involvedwith red or purple, hyperpigmented, indurated patches, papules, nodules, plaques, or tu- mors, but there appears to be a higher predilection for the lower extremities. The lesions tend to be oval shaped, be symmetrically distributed, and to follow skin tension lines. Inthe oral cavity, the palate and gingiva are usually involved. Chronic lesions may show su- perficial changes such as scaling and crusting and they may even ulcerate. Differential the clinical diagnosis is in question, simple punch biopsy of the lesion should be diagnostic. Treatment Options for treatment vary according to the extent of the disease, rate of progression, the development of new lesions, and presence of systemic involvement. Therapeutic options for localized cutaneous disease are very different from widespread, symptomatic, systemicinvolvement (reviewed in Dezube, 2000 15). Local disease can be treated by any number of modalities, including cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen, CO2 anthracyclines doxorubicin These modalities are useful for disseminated, symptomatic KS. Paclitaxelis very effective but has a higher incidence of myelosuppression, alopecia, and arthralgiasthan the liposomal anthracyclines, which are widely considered first-line chemotherapeu- tic agents in these patients. Radiation therapy is also very effective for palliation in ad- vanced, symptomatic, and extensive disease. A radiation schedule of 3.5Gy/fraction at 3fractions per week for a total cumulative dose of 21 Gy has shown to reduce visible tumor burden as soon as 2 weeks after completion of therapy. The importance of successful antiretroviral therapy cannot be overstated. Studies have shown that HAART dramatically reduces the incidence of new KS lesions and can de- crease the size of or even clear existing lesions. 16 Drug Eruptions AIDS patients are at high risk for the development of adverse drug reactions because of the sheer number of medications they require as well as their body's dramatically altered immuno- logic milieu. The most critical knowledge for the health care worker caring for these patients is Chpt 09 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:23 AM 19726 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 198the ability to differentiate between drug reactions that are serious and even life-threateningand those that may be tolerated in order to continue a necessary medication.It has been widely recognized since the early 1980s that patients with AIDS suffer from anincreased incidence of cutaneous eruptions directly attributable to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 17 and that the incidence of drug eruptions from all sources was likely to be approximately ten times higher than in the general population. 18 Clinical Presentation Unfortunately, the cutaneous manifestations of adverse drug reaction are manifold. Whilea morbilliform eruption with widespread erythematous macules and palpable purpura, erythema multiforme, and others are also not rare. Diagnosis The goal is to be able to differentiate between a primary cutaneous process in an ill patientand a drug-related cutaneous reaction. Here, the timing of the medication with the devel-opment of rash is critical because most eruptions begin 7-12 days after initiation of therapy.For unfamiliar lesions, a biopsy is always the safest route, making sure an analysis bydirect immunofluorescence for immunoglobulin or complement deposition in the skin isperformed. This is especially important in the bullous eruptions or eruptions suggestive ofvasculitis. Treatment Table 9-3 enumerates the most important indications for discontinuing a medication be-cause of an adverse cutaneous reaction . Apart from discontinuing medications, lesions of erythema multiforme that are causingsignificant discomfort may be treated with systemic corticosteroids. It should be notedthat their use does not prevent progression to the more severe toxic epidermal necrolysis.Systemic corticosteroid use in toxic epidermal necrolysis in Stevens-Johnson syndrome is debated. Intravenous immunoglobulin has been reported on a case-by-case basis to be successful in treating the more severe cutaneous drug eruptions, in-cluding toxic epidermal necrolysis. 19 However, to date there have been no controlled trials to prove its efficacy. If the offending medication is absolutely necessary, desensitizationmay be performed in cases of non-life-threatening adverse reactions. 20 SKIN PROBLEMS IN THE CHRONIC, BED-RIDDEN PATIENT Immobilization during the latter stages of AIDS, especially when in the hospice environment, generates by itself a number of potentially chronic skin disorders. These often chronically bed-ridden patients, who lack any immune function, suffer from not only skin breakdown and infec-tion, but also from disorders uniquely associated with increased body temperature as well asincreased sweating and impedance of the normal sweating mechanisms. The following sectiondeals with the diagnosis and management of intertriginous infections, and with miliaria andGrover's disease, which are often seen in such 09 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:23 AM 19826 picas Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 199Table 9-3: Cutaneous Signs of Dangerous Adverse Drug Reactions Syndrome Clinical signs, symptoms Constitutional symptoms Fever, rigors, intolerable pruritus and skin discomfort, etc. Vasculitis Palpable purpura or new digital infarcts, livedo erosions of the oral mucosa of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or the deadly toxic epidermal necrolysis, which presents with generalized skin sloughing Blister formation Diffuse or localized bullae Hypersensitivity syndrome May present as a morbilliform eruption but with severe systemic symptoms including high fever and organomegaly with elevated LFTs and peripheral eosinophilia.

If there is airway compromise itbecomes a medical emergency requiring immediate ventilatory support. Intertrigo Intertrigo is a general term that describes inflammation and/or infection of the intertrigi- nous areas, specifically the perineum, inframammary region, axillae, and skin foldsin obese infections\u2014dermatophyte or tinea infections, Candida in- fections, and erythrasma, which is caused by Corynebacteria\u2014 all thrive in the warm, moist areas of the intertriginous spaces and are seen in both the healthy and the AIDS populations. Clinical Presentation Tinea infections classically present with erythematous patches showing a more active,slightly elevated, scaling border as the fungus advances at the outer edges. The border isfrequently scalloped and well defined. The scrotum is hardly ever involved in tinea infec- tions. This is in contrast to Candida infections, which are generally more moist, weepy, and erythematous, with the characteristic satellite lesions at the periphery of the largepatch. Erythrasma is much less common than the above but is important to recognize because of its clinical similarity and because, as a bacterial infection, will not respond to Chpt 09 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:23 AM 19926 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 200antifungal agents. It usually presents as an erythematous/brownish intertriginous patch that has a characteristic coral red fluorescence under Woods lamp. Prompt attention tothese conditions is important because inflammation and the frequent maceration seen predispose these patients to skin breakdown and superinfection with bacterial pathogens. In addition to the overt infectious processes from dermatophytes, Candida , and Coryne- bacterium , other mimicking conditions may also flourish in the perineal region. Although psoriasis typically affects the extensor surfaces (i.e., knees, elbows) inverse psoriasis of- ten appears in intertriginous spaces. Again with an erythematous, well-demarcated patch with heavy silvery scale, inverse psoriasis may resemble infectious intertrigo. When afriable bleeding base is revealed from gentle removal of scales, this condition should be considered. Additionally, as AIDS progresses, seborrheic dermatitis often becomes more widespread and not uncommonly involves the perineum. Greasy yellow scale on an ill-defined, erythematous base differentiates this condition from inverse psoriasis and infec- tious intertrigo. Finally, irritant contact dermatitis is a very common problem in the hospice setting. As patients approach terminal illness, incontinence and/or chronic diarrhea is veryprevalent. This causes tremendous irritation, not dissimilar to diaper dermatitis of infants,accelerating the formation of decubitus ulcers and enhancing bacterial superinfection. Treatment The treatment of dermatophyte and Candida infections is covered in Other Common In- fections. The treatment for erythrasma is with topical erythromycin and antibacterial soaps, including benzoyl peroxide washes. In general, it is critical to reduce maceration and predisposing conditions. Appropriate skin care includes washing the affected areasdaily or twice daily followed by the use of drying agents such as aluminum acetate or diluted acetic acid soaks and lotions. Hydrophobic barrier creams and ointments such as petroleum jelly or dymethicone- or silicone-containing creams can also be used to preventrecurrence of the problem. One therapy often used for uncomplicated diaper dermatitis is a compound made of 15 g of nystatin cream, 15 g of 2.5% hydrocortisone cream com- pounded in a zinc oxide base. Zinc oxide helps to dry the area, nystatin reduces yeastcolonization, and the steroid reduces inflammation. Miliaria and Grover's Disease Miliaria and Grover's disease are the more common heat-related conditions in bed-ridden patients. Miliaria, or \"prickly heat\" is a transient condition usually seen in children during thesummer months and it is related to obstruction of eccrine sweat gland ducts. Grover's disease was originally described as a transient vesiculopapular eruption occurring usually in men over 50 years old. Chronic forms are not uncommon. Clinical Presentation Miliaria cristalina presents with small, clear superficial vesicles in bedridden patientswith increased perspiration and inadequate ventilation from tight or excessive clothing. Miliaria rubra, or prickly heat, is a very pruritic papulovesicular eruption that produces a burning or tingling sensation. It is common in the flexural fossae and intertriginous areas.Grover's disease is generally limited to the trunk and presents with erythematous 2 to3 mm papules and vesicles. There is usually mild pruritus. Grover's disease is associated with increased temperature and 09 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:23 AM 20026 picas Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 201Treatment Miliaria is a self-limiting condition and requires no specific treatment besides reducing immobilization by frequent decubitus changes, and reducing overheating and heat entrap- ment by avoiding excessive clothing. Grover's disease, if chronic, can be treated with Class IV topical corticosteroids twice daily. For persistent cases, alternatives include a 6-month course of isotretinoin or PUVA. Decubitus Ulcers The bedridden patient in any hospital or hospice environment is at constant risk for primary skin breakdown. This represents a significant risk in this immunologically debilitated popula- tion because open wounds, chronic diarrhea, and warm, moist environments are fertile ground for superinfection. The diagnosis and treatment of decubitus ulcers will be discussed sepa-rately. (See Chapter 25: Prevention of Skin Breakdown.) CONCLUSION A careful history and a comprehensive physical examination with review of pertinent medica- tions, medical history, and exposures are all essential to making a rapid diagnosis of the many potential dermatologic conditions that may arise in the AIDS patient. For the immunocompromised patient, it is essential that topical steroids not be given indiscriminatelywithout accurate diagnosis. When in doubt, a simple biopsy and referral to a dermatologist will save the patient critical time spent on topical therapies that, through their ineffectiveness, may only prolong patient suffering.

INTRODUCTION There are significant direct consequences to the invasion of HIV into the nervous system that may present as neurological, neuropsychiatric, and /or psychiatric syndromes and disorders. Inaddition, as the immune system deteriorates, myriad secondary physiologic and psychologicalproblems can cause additional disturbances of brain function. These problems may arise acutelyand require rapid evaluation and intervention or they may be chronic, sometimes subtle, andoften present along with physical complaints. Particularly during palliative or end of life care,attention to disturbances of brain function improves quality of life and the ability of providers tohonor patient wishes about limits of care.Early involvement of mental health clinicians, particularly psychiatrists who can help with thedifferential diagnosis of presenting neuropsychiatric and psychiatric symptoms, should be soughtwhenever possible. The assessment and treatment of neuropsychiatric complaints are essentialto both the overall well-being of the patient and to the efficacy of other treatments, particularlypalliative care. In addition to the enormous psychological burden of progressive illness and lossof physical function, even subtle and subclinical changes in brain function may significantlyaffect both quality of life and the ability for a person to participate in his or her own medicalcare. This, in turn, has impacts on family members, loved ones, providers\u2014that is, on the pallia-tive care team itself. (See Chapter 20: Care for the Caregiver.)Changes in a patient's mental state, either acute or chronic, throughout the course of HIV infec-tion must be evaluated using a comprehensive conceptual framework that includes pre-existingmedical and psychiatric disorders, as well as those arising from HIV (see Table 10-1).Table 10-1: Differential Diagnosis of Acute and Chronic Mental Status Changes through the Course of HIV Infection \u007f The direct effect of HIV itself on brain tissue and function (primary HIV neuropsychiatric syndromes) \u007f The consequences of immune deficiency in the central nervous system itself: opportunistic infections, neoplasms, vasculitis \u007f The impact of systemic illness on brain function\u007f Endocrine or metabolic disturbances which affect brain function \u007f Effects of antiretrovirals and other medical and psychiatric treatments on brain function \u007f Pre-existing (to HIV) neurological and psychiatric disorders \u007f Neurological and psychiatric disorders that arise after HIV infection\u007f Persistent or intermittent substance use or withdrawal states Chpt 10 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 20726 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 10: Psychiatric Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 208INITIAL ASSESSMENT Changes in mental status are always to be considered abnormal, not simply an understand- able problem associated with having HIV, and should be considered a medical emergency. Theinitial assessment should begin by ruling out and treating any acute process (see Table 10-2).Some questions that may be useful to the clinician in the differential diagnosis are listed inTable 10-3.Table 10-2: Causes of Change in Central Nervous System (CNS) Function Type of Manifestation Condition Acute HIV-1 infection \u007f Viral meningitis \u007f impairment \u007f Minor cognitive motor disorder \u007f HIV-1 associated dementia (HAD) of 10 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, AM 20826 Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 10: Psychiatric Problems X U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 209Table 10-3: Assessing Changes in Mental Status \u007f Is the change acute? or chronic? What is the time frame for the change? \u007f Does the problem appear to be in thinking, attention, mood or behavior? \u007f What specific changes in function, or symptoms, are reported by patient or others that might give a clue to the particular problem? \u007f Are presenting symptoms accompanied by fever? pain? other signs of autonomic dysfunction? \u007f Are there any focal neurological signs or symptoms? \u007f Have any new medications been started recently, including antivirals, psychiatric medications? \u007f Is there evidence of substance use by a complete toxic screen or other report rather than the patient's own report? \u007f Are there pre-existing psychiatric symptoms? Since a patient may be unable to give a complete or accurate history, family and friends must be asked about any unusual behavior or sudden changes in the person's mental state. Any changein the patient's typical behavior or engagement must be evaluated urgently. Irritable and anx-ious patients often come to attention because they are obviously disturbed. Attention must alsobe paid, however, to the withdrawn and quiet patient. Changes in personality, level of activity or interest in others may signal an acute CNS distur- bance. Some changes are the direct effect of brain dysfunction, while others may be due to theacute psychological distress of a systemic problem. For example, the acute onset of pain in thefeet due to neuropathy might affect cognition and behavior because of an acute anxiety or panicthat the person is dying. On the other hand, the presence of transverse myelitis is often associ-ated with HIV-related cognitive impairment. The first step is to make an accurate diagnosis of one or more disorders that might account for the clinical presentation. The most common psychiatric diagnoses are depression, adjustment disor- ders, anxiety disorders, and the neuropsychiatric disorders resulting from HIV in the central ner-vous system. Table 10-4 presents a format to use to conduct a complete mental status exam.

Assessment of Suicidality Assessment of Thoughts A positive response to any of these questions should lead to referral to a psychiatrist. \u007f Have you ever felt that your thoughts were being controlled by another person or that others could read your thoughts? \u007f Do you think that people are out to get you? That there might be a plot against you? \u007f Do you hear voices, or see or smell things that others don't?\u007f Do you ever think that the radio or TV is sending you a private message from somewhere else? \u007f Have you heard voices tell you to hurt yourself or others?The mental status examination is done by observation and by questioning thepatient.Elements of the Mental Status Examination Chpt 10 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 21026 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 10: Psychiatric Problems X U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 211HIV enters the brain at the time of initial infection. This may cause a cascade of immune re- sponses that can cause acute or chronic cognitive impairment. With progressive disease, de- lirium often occurs as a consequence of illness and/or treatment, presenting with cognitive changes that are important to distinguish from depression or dementia. HIV-infected patients with cognitive-motor impairment have increased mortality rates.1 While specific cognitive deficits may be assessed most accurately by neuropsychological testing, thereal impact on patients is related to their functional status. Changes in cognition, motor capac-ity, mood or behavior may be subtle or overt and can be dramatic. Even subtle neurocognitiveimpairments may affect the ability to work and psychological coping. 2,3 In the untreated adult, HIV-related neuropsychiatric disorders are most likely to be evident inlate-stage illness. The neuropsychiatric syndromes (due to HIV itself in the brain) are dementia(HAD), minor cognitive-motor disorder (MCMD), and subclinical cognitive-motor impairment.In all cases, the diagnosis of primary HIV cognitive-motor disorder must be made as a diagnosisof exclusion. It has been argued that focusing on minor cognitive-motor disorder may be moreimportant a focus of treatment than overt dementia because it is more likely to be reversible. 4 Figure 10-1: The Course of Untreated HIV Infection in Adults and Adolescents Clinical Neuropsychiatric Syndromes While most primary brain impairment in adults occurs late in the course of infection, it is not possible to rule this out when patients present early with changes in mental status.

In adults the impact is on the developed brain and peripheral nervous system, with deterioration evident as the loss of neurological integrity or mental capacity. In children and adolescents HIV can prevent the normal growth and development of neural pathways, achievement of developmentalmilestones, or integration of cognitive, motor and affective components of the self at age-appro-priate stages. For adults the impact is a loss of function whereas in children it is the failure tothrive or achieve some function altogether. HIV Dementia There is now evidence that the presence and severity of HIV dementia correlates with the levels of HIV production in the CNS, as well as with macrophage activation.5,6 HIV vRNA in the peripheral blood may not reflect the level of brain vRNA nor the degree of neurological dysfunc-tion. 7-13 HIV dementia is classified as a subcortical dementia and manifests as one or more of a clinicaltriad of progressive cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and behavioral abnormalities. 14 Early symptoms include slowed information processing, cognitive and psychomotor slowing, and prob-lems with verbal memory and new learning. Later on, evidence of difficulty with executive func-tioning appears, along with visual and spatial difficulties, and apraxias, and in the end stagesmay look similar to the global cortical dementias. (See Table 10-5.)

Since memorydifficulty is a common symptom, other psychiatric disorders and prior brain trauma must beruled out. (See Table 10-6). Table 10-6: Differential Diagnosis of Early HIV Dementia in Adults \u007f Anxiety \u007f Depression \u007f Medication protease inhibitors)\u007f Alcohol and other recreational drugs HIV-infected patients may have mild neuropsychological impairment that does not meet criteria for any specific disorder. It is important to recognize that this may be the initial stage of developingdisease and should be followed closely. In doing so, clinicians must consider other conditionssuch as head trauma, epilepsy, learning disorders, aging, low intellectual ability, and alcohol orsubstance use. Deficits due to HIV would be evident as decline from previous function prior toHIV infection, thus requiring monitoring of impairment over time. Cognitive deficits due to otherconditions would not necessarily be expected to progress if the underlying condition was stableor in remission, whereas impairment due to HIV would be expected to progress over time. Dementia While prior estimates of dementia had been reported at 20% to 25% of individuals with AIDS,15 it is now thought that the cumulative prevalence of dementia has been reduced to 7% to 10%, as aresult of multidrug antiretrovitral therapy. 3 This figure may rise as drug resistance increases and adherence falls over time. This may be due to the relatively poor penetration of antiretroviralsinto the CNS, leading to incomplete viral suppression, resistance and reseeding of the periph-eral blood with drug resistant strains of virus. The blood brain barrier (BBB) thus creates asanctuary for HIV in the CNS, making it impossible to achieve complete viral suppression.Table 10-5: Clinical Signs and Symptoms of HIV-Associated 10 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 21326 Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 10: Psychiatric Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 214The diagnosis of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) is made by excluding all potential causes for a change in mental state according to criteria set out by the American Academy of Neurology, 16 shown in Table 10-7. Risk factors for dementia are listed in Table 10-8. Table 10-7: Definitional Criteria for HIV-Associated Dementia (HAD) Criterion Description 1.

MCMD may result from manyof the same risk factors as dementia. It is important to distinguish between progressive demen-tia and MCMD because the latter is a less severe disorder and does not progress necessarily tofull dementia. This information may ameliorate a patient's fear of a continuing decline.

Subclinical Neurocognitive Impairment The impact of HIV in the CNS may show up in neurocognitive testing in the absence of signifi- cant or consistent clinical complaints, signs or symptoms. A patient may have a very mild prob- lem with memory, for instance, which might show up on testing but does not affect the person'sability to function in his or her work or home life. Since such neurocognitive testing would showevidence of cognitive deficits in patients without HIV as well, the long-term implications of suchfindings are not yet clear. Whether such patients are more likely to progress to MCMD or HAD astheir viral loads increase and immune systems decline needs to be determined.

Additional elements may also be necessary for a comprehensive evaluation. For example, an acute change of mental state in a person known to be abusing drugs would require toxicologicalscreening. Likewise, lumbar puncture and imaging studies may help confirm a diagnosis of HAD,as shown in Table 10-11. It must be remembered that co-morbidity is common and changes canoccur rapidly, often requiring repeated examinations over time.

Neuropsychiatric Disorders in Children CNS deficits in children may be due to the direct impact of HIV; intrauterine or perinatal insults; or, other environmental problems.20,21 HIV-associated progressive opathy or HIV encephalopathy , rather than dementia , are used to designate the primary impact of HIV on developing neural tissue. Because there are other syndromes, such as mental retarda-tion, prematurity and maternal drug use, that can present with similar symptoms, longitudinalassessment is necessary to make diagnoses of HIV encephalopathy in children. Three profiles have been described in HIV-positive children: those without impairment in func- tion, those with compromise of the CNS, and those with encephalopathy. 22,23 While progressive encephalopathy is generally observed in the context of immunosuppression, CD4 count and other markers of immunologic functioning do not correlate with the degree of cognitive impair- ment.24 Cognitive deficits in children with compromise of the CNS tend to be milder and less global thanin children with encephalopathy. Children infected perinatally who experience early and severeimmunodeficiency may show pronounced developmental problems. Progressive encephalopathicchanges cause impaired brain growth, including motor dysfunction, impaired social skills devel-opment, dysprosody, flattened affect, and apathy, as well as abnormal developmental milestones.HIV-infected children may have impairments in intelligence and language functioning, with expressive language more impaired than receptive. Many HIV-positive children have poor aca- demic performance, exacerbated by frequent absences due to medical illnesses. Visual motordeficits are common and may correlate with progression of disease. 25 Chpt 10 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 21926 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 10: Psychiatric Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 220Treatment of Neuropsychiatric Disorders in Adults and Children Treatment includes strategies for decreasing viral load in the brain and periphery, rapid and adequate treatment of co-occurring systemic illness, and restitution of metabolic and endocrinefunction. The major impediment to achieving viral suppression in the CNS has been the lack ofpenetration of antiretrovirals across the BBB. While AZT has the best evidence of being able toimprove cognitive motor impairment associated with HIV, only high doses (1000-2000mg/d) haveproven to be clinically significant. 26 Table 10-14 shows the relative penetration of antiretrovirals into the cerebrospinal fluid.27-30 Table Brown SJ, Catalan J, et al.

More recent studies haveshown that there may not be a correspondence between antiretroviral levels in the CSF and thelevel of HIV activity in the brain. So far, the best predictor of maintaining cognitive functionseems to be decreasing peripheral viral load as much as possible. The incidence of cognitive impairment has decreased since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART), but may be on the rise because of incomplete viral suppres-sion and increasing viral resistance. Since other AIDS-defining diagnoses have decreased in theera of multidrug therapy, dementia constitutes a higher percentage of AIDS-defining illnesses. Immune modulation using calcium channel blockers (e.g., nimodipine, memantine), inhibitors of Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNFa) (e.g., pentoxifylline), and alpha interferon and naltrexone, have been studied. There are, however, no clear guidelines to their use in clinical practice at this time. Psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and pemoline, have generally been found to be clinically effective in enhancing attention and executive function. 33,34 Dosage information for these drugs appears in Table 10-15. Modafinil, which has FDA approval for nar-colepsy, has been clinically useful in some HIV patients with fatigue and excessive daytimesleepiness, although there is limited information as to its effect on cognitive function.

Should not be used in patients with co-morbid HIV and hepatitis C. Dopaminergic agonists have improved neuropsychological performance in some instances. Case studies of carbidopa, L-dopa, and selegiline, a monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor, sug- gested some preliminary benefit. The use of donzepil and tacrine to increase cholinergic trans- mission may also prove to be of value, but to date there are no studies to support this.35,36 Correction of nutritional deficits in cobalamin (vitamin B12 ) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) may boost a patient's cognitive function and general well-being. Other nutritional interventions thatmay prove to be useful include omega-3-fatty acids, folate, s-adenosylmethionine and zinc. 37,38,39 The routine workup for a change in mental state should include vitamin B12 and folate levels. Supportive and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies are effective in addressing a patient's anxi- eties and fears about progressive cognitive decline. Associated with entering a more terminalphase of illness, end of life issues always arise, and providers can offer palliative treatment withantiretrovirals and psychostimulants to maximize cognitive capacity and quality of life.

At this point, a patient's intellectual function, decisionmaking capacity and behavioral control may be impaired.Psychostimulants should be evaluated often and decreased if there are signs of agitation orexcessive motor activity. Late-stage dementia is often complicated by concurrent delirium dueto medications, metabolic disturbances, or acute infections. Agitation and psychotic featuressuch as hallucinations or paranoia can best be treated with risperidone and/or lorazepam. If anoral route of administration is not possible, IV haloperidol (.25 to 1mg) and IV lorazepam may behelpful in controlling agitation and psychotic features. Treatment of Cognitive Disorders in Children There are limited studies of AZT and ddI showing improvement in children with AIDS and thatfor the most part, these medications are well tolerated. 40,41,42 While psychostimulants have not been systematically studied in children and adolescents with HIV, there is a long medical expe-rience with them in treating attention deficit disorders in children and adolescents. Delirium and the Impact of Medications on Central Nervous System Function Delirium in the HIV-infected patient can result from acute primary HIV infection of the brain, consequences of infections, metabolic derangement, medications, and acute substance intoxi-cation or withdrawal, and is more likely in the setting of advanced illness or hospitalization. 43,44 Hypoxemia due to pneumocystis carinii pneumonia may cause an acute change in mental state, as can uremia secondary to HIV nephropathy or elevated ammonia levels due to hepatic disease.Table 10-16 lists common side effects of medications used in the care of the HIV-infected patientthat also must be considered. 45 Intoxication or withdrawal from either prescribed or non-prescribed medications must be ruledout. There can be multiple causes of acute changes in mental status.

Many psychiatric disorders become appar-ent at an age when risk for HIV may be high, such as in late adolescence or early adulthood. Theappearance of psychiatric symptoms is not necessarily directly attributable to the neuropathiceffects of HIV. 46, 47, 48, 49 Table 10-17: Common Clinical Misperceptions Regarding Psychiatric Issues Psychiatric Issue/ Clinical Remember to Disorder Misperceptions Ask About Major depression Bipolar mood disorderPsychosis Delirium Sexual abuse/assault history Anxiety, panic, agoraphobia Domestic violenceSuicidal would be depressed or grieving,\" forgetting biologic depression \"Depressed mood must mean depression,\"forgetting bipolar symptoms \"The patient seems normal,\" forgetting hallucinations andparanoia \"The patient is clearly schizophrenic orpsychotic,\" forgetting acute medical personal; may anxious\" \"Seems like a nice person\" \"May plant the thought in their mind, provoke it\"Vegetative symptoms (early morning awakening, diurnal mood variation, appetite disturbance); anhedonia more than sadness Hypomanic/manic symptoms (history of racing thoughts,hyperactivity, no need for sleep, grandiose plans, irritability) Psychotic symptoms: \"Do you ever hear your name called, turn around and no one is there? or a phoneringing?\" \"Ever feel like people are talking about you walking down the street?\" Distractibility, disorientation, \"Were you ever sexually, physically abused in childhood?

Depression, for example, has been associated with shorter survival times inHIV-infected men 50 and women. Appropriate mental health care is also essential if patients are to engage in treatment and sustain sobriety and protective sexual practices. It is never appropriate to assume that a psychiatric symptom is merely an \"understandable\" emotional reaction to a particular situation. Table 10-17 lists some common misperceptions in this regard. Mood Disorders Mood disorders are associated with substance use, impaired quality of life, mental suffering, suicide, poor adherence to antiretroviral regimens and increased risk for behaviors such asmultiple sexual partners and drug use that transmit HIV. 51 Depression Studies show that depressive disorders are very common but underdiagnosed and undertreatedin HIV infection. 52,53 Depressive symptoms increase over the course of HIV illness, especially after the onset of AIDS. These increases are not necessarily associated with HAD or MCMD. Depression must be differentiated from many other conditions common in HIV which are pre- sented in Table 10-18. Major depression is never a \"normal\" response to a particular situation. It must be approached with the same rigor as any other medical illness. Patients often feel that they are depressed for good reason, or that they feel fatigued and sad because they are sick. Providers must understand and make clear that depression is a treatablemedical illness that responds well to both psychotherapy and medications. Somatic symptoms,such as fatigue, trouble sleeping, decreased appetite or sexual drive, and mental slowing arealso symptoms of HIV-related cognitive disorders. Symptoms of anhedonia, guilty feelings, sad-ness and loss of hope may be helpful in distinguishing depression from cognitive impairment. Depression at the End of Life Even at the end of life, depression is a disorder that requires treatment, and should never beconsidered a normal response to illness or dying. Patients who are not clinically depressed maytalk about the sadness of leaving others behind, of dying, or of fear of the unknown. Depressedpatients near the end of life will likely have flattened affect or an inability to respond appropri-ately to loved ones, or might be withdrawn and mute. When in doubt, using low dose psychostimulants may be very helpful in reducing the depression, and increasing cognitive func- tion even in the last weeks of life. In the agitated or anxious patient very low doses of risperidone(.25 to 1mg) or olanzapine (1.25 to 5mg) may be a helpful treatment. Providers must distinguish between depression and grief. While sadness may be present in both conditions, grief is a normal reaction to loss or impending loss. Further, grief may manifestdifferently across cultures. Anticipating the loss of function and quality of life, and acknowledg-ing an impending death, can appear to observers like depression. Grief, however, is often accom-panied by powerful and profound affective states and crying, while severe depression appears more like an emotional paralysis, with patients often unable to mobilize any affect other than hopelessness.

Among adolescents, 34% had majordepression according to one study, 54 and 25% had major depressive disorder and high rates of distress in another.55 Children and adolescents come to the attention of providers less with internalizing disorders (depression and anxiety) respond with laughter; worse at night; specific neurologicaldeficits; CT scan often abnormal Fluctuating mental status with altered level of consciousness; distractibility; inability to focus or sustain attention; dysarthric syphilis.

Suicidality must be thoroughly assessed and treated. One study showed 28% of HIV-positive adolescents reported a suicide attempt.57 Another study showed one third of HIV-positive adolescents re- quired hospitalization because of a suicide attempt.54 Children and adolescents may express hopelessness over the future, fear of themselves or their infected parents dying, or being unableto participate with their peers as \"normal\" children due to physical or cognitive limitations. Mania As with depression, rates of mania increase as HIV disease progresses. Only 1 to 2% of patients with early HIV experience a manic episode. Since this is only slightly higher than rates for mania in the general population, this may reflect the increased risk for infection with HIV due to hyper-sexuality, poor judgment and/or substance use that are associated with bipolar disorder. How-ever, as HIV progresses to AIDS, 4 to 8% may have a manic episode. 58,59 In addition, mania in advanced disease can be associated with cognitive changes or HIV dementia. AIDS-related mania can differ clinically from the true mania of bipolar disorder in that irritabil- ity, rather than true grandiose euphoria, is the core symptom.60 Common symptoms of mania include the following: \u007f Decreased sleep, increased activity \u007f Increased talkativeness, pressured speech\u007f Evidence of racing thoughts\u007f Attention to unimportant or irrelevant activities\u007f Grandiosity or inflated sense of self\u007f Hallucinations or delusions\u007f Increased goal-oriented activity \u007f Psychomotor agitation \u007f Excessive spending, or sexual activity without good judgment The clinical presentation of mania requires emergency psychiatric intervention, particularly if psychotic symptoms are present and judgment is impaired. Prescribed and illicit use of androgenic and/or anabolic steroids can cause or exacerbate mania or hypomania and should be ruled out in the work-up of this symptom. Gancyclovir and dapsonehave also been associated with increased rates of mania. Treatment of Mood Disorders Treatment of mood disorders must be tailored to the individual patient's illness and circum-stances. Although antidepressant medications are commonly prescribed by primary and pallia-tive care providers, referral to a psychiatrist should be made when the patient experiencessignificant side effects or does not respond to the psychopharmacological intervention. Clini-cally depressed patients with HIV have been shown to benefit from a therapeutic relationshipand from medications to alleviate depressive symptoms. 61 Additional studies have indicated that some types of psychotherapy and medications together may be more effective in treating de- pression than either one alone.62 Additionally, management of psychotropic medications in the debilitated, fragile AIDS patient may be difficult and warrant specialist consultation.

Older antidepressants such as tricyclics may be effective and tolerated in early HIV;however, they may exacerbate both cognitive impairment and gastrointestinal disturbances as a result of their anticholinergic activity. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are ef-fective antidepressants but are often problematic because of sexual side effects. Newer antide-pressants such as buproprion and venlafaxine are very effective, with few drug-drug interac-tions. Bupropion (more activating) and nefazodone (more sedating) are tolerated well.Nefazodone must be used cautiously with patients on protease inhibitors (particularly ritonovir),which may raise blood levels 4 to 8 times. Mirtazapine is a sedating antidepressant compatiblewith antiretroviral medications, and may also stimulate appetite and weight gain. A more re-cently approved SSRI, Escitalopram, is reported to have fewer side of effects, minimal interac- tion with other drugs metabolized by the P450 cytochrome enzymes, and may have a faster onset of action. So far there are no studies of its use in people with HIV. Antidepressants should be started at low doses and gradually increased. It is important to use sufficient doses of medication to achieve a therapeutic level. Raising doses too quickly, however,Table 10-19: Common Psychiatric Medications (continued) Abbreviations: SSRI-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; PTSD-post-traumatic stress disorder * Must be used with caution in patients on protease inhibitors. ** Use with caution in later-stage illness.*** Some anti-HIV medications increase levels of methadone, others decrease (see chart on medication interactions). **** Concerns about pemoline-induced liver failure necessitate frequent blood tests to evaluate liver function.

Many patients who are in recovery may be reluctant to take antidepressants because they believe that mind-altering substances must be habit-forming. The patient must be educated and supplied with information about depression, its treatment, and the differences between antidepressants and benzodiazepines ornarcotics. Because they can present with similar symptoms (poor concentration, memory impairment, fatigue and/or mental slowing), depression and other mood disorders must be differentiatedfrom MCMD or HAD. Psychostimulants are well tolerated in the medically ill patient and maytreat symptoms of both depression and cognitive impairment. As depression and cognitive im-pairment often co-exist in advanced HIV, psychostimulants may be used alone or in conjunction with an antidepressant. 63 Mood may improve significantly in the hypogonadal patient (male or female) with correction of the underlying androgen deficiency.64 People with HIV may be particularly sensitive to side effects of antidepressants. Starting withlow doses and anticipating side effects for the patient increases his or her ability to tolerate themedication. It is important to allow a reasonable period of time to assess effectiveness of aparticular medication and dose. Psychological support is very important in adherence to antidepressants and other medications. Some clinical suggestions in this regard are as follows: \u007f Start low and go slowly in dosing psychiatric medications. Increase meds according to the half-life and time-to-reach-steady-state to avoid overshootingtherapeutic levels. \u007f Anticipate side effects, and suggest that most of the time they may subside in time. \u007f Encourage patient to call health care provider four to five days after starting medication to report how well it is being tolerated, and what side effectsare present. \u007f Dose sedating antidepressants one to two hours before sleep time to help initiate sleep. Taking medications right at bedtime does not give them timeto be absorbed and to reach peak sedating levels. Treatment for mood disorders in children and adolescents also includes psychotropic medica- tions and a variety of psychological and psychosocial interventions. Medications for mood disor-ders in children and adolescents with HIV have not been well studied, although the SSRIs areused clinically. Individual, group and family therapy are effective in treating issues specific toHIV in adolescents, such as future goals, intimacy issues and self esteem. In the later stages of disease, preparation for disability and death may require intensive, multidisciplinary approaches. Suicide Evaluation Suicidal ideation must always be taken seriously. Table 10-20 contains important elements in evaluating suicide risk. Attempts increase under the influence of psychoactive substances andalcohol and in the midst of a delirium or psychosis. 65 Chpt 10 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 23026 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 10: Psychiatric Problems X U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 231It is important to ask specific and direct questions such as the following: \u007f How are you feeling today? \u007f Has it ever become so (painful, frustrating, difficult, frightening) that you have thought about giving up? About ending your life? Would you ever considerdoing so? Under what circumstances have you considered this? \u007f Do you currently have any thoughts or plans to hurt yourself? 66 When a patient admits to suicidal ideation, inquire about whether he or she has thought about a specific plan to carry it out. Ask about the consequences of doing so, to the patient and those in the patient's life. Assess whether there is an intent to die, even if the methodology seems not very lethal to the provider, for example, the patient says he or she will take 20 pills which maynot be biologically lethal, but psychologically is intended to end life. Providers are often reluctant to ask about suicidal ideation. Asking does not engender such ideas in people who do not have those thoughts to begin with. When a provider asks aboutsuicidal ideation, it acknowledges the amount of pain and suffering the patient has endured,and often feels supportive and caring to the patient. It is also important to understand that theidea of suicide may provide to some a sense of ultimate control when it appears that control over the mind, body, or environment is slipping away. It would be unusual for anyone who experi- ences the shock of a new diagnosis of HIV, cancer or loss of function to not consider how muchlife is worth living and under what circumstances. Simply being able to verbalize the feeling ofhaving ultimate control, and deciding if that is even a possibility, may help patients feel under-stood and more in control of their lives. Suicidal ideation may also be a sign of undiagnoseddepression, undertreated pain, or other co-morbid conditions.Table 10-20: Risk Factors and Considerations in the Evaluation of Suicide Risk \u007f Significant suicidal ideation* \u007f Specific intent or \u007f Previous suicide attempts* \u007f Depressed mood, mood disorders*\u007f Family history of suicide or mood disorders* \u007f Schizophrenia, psychosis (not necessarily command hallucinations)* \u007f Organic mental syndromes* \u007f Intoxication with alcohol*, other substances \u007f Recent major loss, particularly through suicide \u007f Preoccupation with death\u007f Fantasies of reunion through death \u007f Homicidal rage \u007f Caucasian race* *These factors have been documented as risk factors for suicide.

Brief periods of anxiety directly related to specific events usually respond to support and help in coping with the specific problem. Anxiety disorders,however, can impair overall functioning and the capacity for self-care. 67 Anxiety often coexists with depression and substance abuse. Anxiety disorders in HIV/AIDS patients range up to 40%. However, there is no clear association between specific types of anxi-ety and HIV status or stage of disease. Diagnosis of anxiety is important as anxiety can affect thecapacity of the patient to take in information, plan ahead, or adhere to a treatment plan. Health care providers must rule out biological causes\u2014presented in Table 10-21\u2014for anxiety symptoms. Once biological causes have been ruled out, it is important to diagnose the anxietydisorder correctly in order to determine the treatment.

Many patients may have been suffer-ing with GAD prior to the diagnosis of their HIV disease, but develop a more profound and disabling anxiety disorder as they enter treatment. Likewise, chronic substance users may un- mask GAD when they initiate sobriety as a result of being diagnosed with HIV. Major depressionwith anxiety must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of GAD. Panic Disorder Panic symptoms can be terrifying to the person and can, in severe or chronically untreatedsituations, lead to suicidal ideation and attempts. Many patients are worked up for cardiovascu- lar, neurological, or respiratory disorders before a diagnosis of panic disorder is made. A medical evaluation should rule out alcohol withdrawal, cocaine or other stimulant abuse, overuse ofcaffeine, arrhythmia, hyperthyroidism, asthma, pneumonia, or the use of herbal compoundsthat include ephedra, gingko, ginseng, ma huang, or guarana. Signs and symptoms of panicdisorder are described in Table 10-22. Table 10-22: Panic Disorder Panic Disorder Diagnosed by the following (1) recurrent panic attacks (see below); and (2) at least one of the attacks has been followed by one month or more of one or more of the following:\u007f Persistent concern about having additional attacks \u007f Worry about the implications of the attack or its consequences (i.e. losing control, having a heart attack, \"going crazy\"); or \u007f A significant change in behavior related to the attacksTable 10-21: Differential Diagnosis of Anxiety (continued) Chpt 10 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 23326 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 10: Psychiatric Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 234Panic attack Diagnosed with or without agoraphobia (see below), is defined as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which four (or more) of the following symptoms developed abruptly and reached a peak within 10 minutes: \u007f Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate \u007f Sweating \u007f Trembling or shaking \u007f Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering \u007f Feeling of choking \u007f Chest pain or discomfort \u007f Nausea or abdominal distress \u007f Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded or faint \u007f Derealization (feeling of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself) \u007f Fear of losing control or going crazy \u007f Fear of dying \u007f Parasthesias (numbness or tingling sensations) Chills or hot flashes Agoraphobia includes the following: \u007f Anxiety about being in places or situations in which escape might be difficult (or embarrassing) or in which help may not beavailable in the event of having an unexpected or situationally predisposed panic attack or panic- like symptoms. Agoraphobic fears typicallyinvolve characteristic clusters of situations that include being outside the home alone; being in a crowd or standing in line; being on a bridge; and traveling in a bus, train or automobile. \u007f The patient avoids the situations (e.g. travel is restricted) or else endures marked distress oranxiety about having a panic attack or panic-like symptoms, or requires the presence of a companion. \u007f The anxiety or phobic avoidance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) About 2% of the general population have a lifetime prevalence of OCD symptoms including re- current and intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and/or behaviors (compulsions) intended to re-duce the obsessional thinking. People with HIV may obsess about CD4 counts, viral load, sideeffects of medications, physical symptoms, weight loss or change in body habits. These obses-sions may lead to requests for repeated tests, or intense concerns about insignificant changes inphysical signs.Table 10-22: Panic 23426 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 10: Psychiatric Problems X U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 235Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has not been well studied in HIV disease. Manifested by hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, anxiety, social withdrawal and fears associated withthe original trauma, PTSD is particularly associated with a history of physical and sexual abuse inpeople with HIV. Intrusive medical procedures, hospitalization, new providers and untowardreactions to medications can precipitate an increase in PTSD symptoms. PTSD may manifest itselfwith increased risk-taking behavior, depression, self-imposed isolation, and mistrust and angertowards others, including medical personnel, leading to disrupted care and/or negative interactionswith providers and poor adherence to medication regimens and clinical care. Treatment Considerations As with most psychiatric disorders, the treatment of anxiety disorders almost always involvesboth pharmacotherapy (see Table 10-19) and psychotherapy. For short-term treatment of symp-toms of anxiety, benzodiazepines (BZs) may be used until psychotherapeutic treatment helps tore-establish coping mechanisms or the patient can learn behavioral techniques to manage symp-toms. Benzodiazepines that are particularly useful in HIV are lorazepam, oxazepam, andtemezepam, as they have short half-lives, hence less accumulation and side effects. There canbe important drug interactions between these agents and some antiretroviral agents. Alprazolamis best avoided because of its very short half-life, and may interact with protease inhibitors. Benzodiazopines are often the only immediately effective medications that can be tolerated and may help engage a person in treatment. Benzodiazepines should, however, be avoided in activesubstance abusers, because of the risk of dose escalation, dependence and intoxication. In peoplewith a history of substance abuse, BZs must be used cautiously, with careful monitoring of use,frequent and limited prescriptions, and attention to the risk of relapse. See Table 10-23 forclinical suggestions for prescribing medications that have potential to be abused. Table 10-23: Clinical Management of Medications with Potential for Abuse Establish a written contract regarding how medications will be used, and spell out under what circumstances medications may be withheld or withdrawn. \u007f Prescriptions will be written initially for one week (or less if appropriate), with refills as needed. \u007f Only one provider will write prescriptions (or a designee when not available). \u007f Pills that are lost or stolen will not be replaced.\u007f Toxic screens may be performed spontaneously. \u007f Medications will not be prescribed if the patient is high.\u007f Medications must not be shared or sold to others. \u007f Patient must be in some active relapse prevention or recovery program. Psychological counseling or group therapy to address use of controlled substances should be mandated as part of the management of patients with substance abuse history, and offered toanyone concerned about using controlled substances as part of his or her treatment. Chpt 10 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 23526 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 10: Psychiatric Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 236For longer-term or chronic anxiety disorders, maintenance with antidepressants may help avoid the use of potentially addictive agents, and are generally effective for generalized anxiety disor- der, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and social phobia. Venlafaxine is effective for general anxiety disorder, usually well tolerated in people with HIV, and has few interactions withother HIV medications, although sexual side effects may interfere with the person's willingnessto continue the medication. All of the SSRIs as well can cause significant sexual and gastrointes-tinal side effects sufficient to cause patients to be non-adherent. Anticipating such side effectsand starting with lower than typical doses may help alleviate these problems and allow patientsto accommodate more easily to the medications. Adding buproprion to a regimen of other antidepressants to help counter the sexual side effects may enhance adherence. However, buproprion alone is not usually sufficient to treat anxiety, and is stimulating, so caution must be used in adding it into the regimen in anxious patients.Using long-acting (SR) formulations, and simply anticipating the potential problems will oftencomfort patients enough for them to try tolerating the medications. Buspirone may be effectivefor GAD but requires several weeks of bid-tid dosing to be effective. Medications which are most effective in treatment of OCD include the SSRIs, particularly fluvoxamine, sertraline, and fluoxetine. These are typically required in higher dosages than fordepression. Anafronil, strongly anticholinergic, is effective for OCD but not well tolerated in the person with HIV. The SSRIs and some mood stabilizers may be useful for diminishing the physiological responses associated with PTSD. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be particularly useful in addressing the underlying distorted thinking, irrational thinking, and maladaptive behavior. Specific techniques that address par- ticular anxiety syndromes, short-term psychoeducational groups, individual therapy and ongo-ing therapy groups all may be useful in reducing anxiety symptoms. Anxiety Disorders in Children and Adolescents Anxiety symptoms and disorders occur more frequently in HIV-positive than HIV-negative chil-dren. 68,69 Anxiety in children may focus on life span, how they contracted HIV and health con- cerns. Ruminations about death may be excessive and disabling. Physiological changes, such as shortness of breath, gastrointestinal symptoms, or neurological problems may compound theseconcerns. The extent to which psychological functioning is affected varies with the cognitiveand developmental stage of the child. As in adults, treatment includes anti-anxiety medication and psychotherapy. Clinically, SSRIs are used for long-term anxiety and BZs for short-term, situation anxiety. Teaching children touse deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery may relievesymptoms and provide some sense of mastery to children feeling out of control of their feelings and bodily functions.

Psychostimulants and alpha agonists can be effective.71 Social skills training can help children with HIV with attention deficits cope with stigma. Conduct disorders and substance abuse are common among HIV-positive adolescents.57 Treat- ment must be specialized to reduce psychiatric morbidity and decrease associated risk-takingbehaviors. (See Chapter 11: Substance Use Problems.) Sleep Disorders Sleep disorders are common and distressing, and exacerbate other symptoms associated with HIV such as fatigue, cognitive impairment, memory loss, decreased work performance, dimin-ished coping capacity, and reduced social interaction. 72,73 Sleep disturbance can contribute to poor adherence, failure to engage in treatment, relapse of substance use in the attempt to self-medicate, poor impulse control and impaired judgment. Treating sleep disorders in people withHIV is not only helpful to the patient in terms of reducing fatigue, but also enhances the treat-ment alliance. In HIV, sleep disturbance is marked by shorter total sleep time, longer sleep onset latency, reduced sleep efficiency, more frequent awakenings and more time spent awake. The impact ofsleep deprivation becomes more significant as illness progresses and stamina and energy de-cline. Sleep pathology has been associated with growth hormone dysregulation. 74,75 Hypersomnia, as- sociated with advanced disease, may be related to elevated levels of TNFa. The differential diag-nosis of sleep disturbance appears in Table 10-24.

Non-phamacologic treatments include the following: \u007f Sleep hygiene (set sleep and wake times)\u007f Exercise, at least four hours before bedtime\u007f Avoid napping if possible\u007f Small bedtime snack\u007f Relaxation training, sound machine or tapes\u007f Psychotherapy for stress\u007f Treatment of underlying psychiatric disorder\u007f Treatment of pain Providers often fear overmedicating sleep disorders. Although habituation to sleeping medica-tions occurs often, the potential for addiction is rare.

(See Chapter 11: Substance Use Problems.) Patients with a triple diagnosis ofHIV, psychiatric disorder , and substance use are at increased risk for poor access to care, pooradherence to medical treatments and increased psychological distress leading to increasedmorbidity and mortality. Substance-using patients, including those receiving methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), have high rates of prior psychiatric morbidity and suicidal ideation. 76 Screening for substance abuse and psychiatric disorders should be routine. Psychiatric Treatment of HIV-Positive Substance Users The diagnosis and treatment of drug users with HIV is complicated by multiple risks for neu- ropsychiatric disturbance. Acute and chronic effects of alcohol and substances of abuse, metha-done, head trauma, and HIV itself can each and in combination cause significant mental statusimpairments. Problems secondary to past trauma or substance use can be differentiated from current use and HIV neurocognitive effects by serial assessments. Past brain injury or substance abuse would not continue to cause increasing CNS impairment. Current substance use, CNSinfection, or HIV related cognitive impairment would continue to show decrements of functionover time. There are few studies to show the safety or efficacy of pharmacological treatment of psychiatric disorders in substance-using patients with HIV. Safety, abuse potential and adherence capacitymust all be considered when prescribing medications for cognitive or psychiatric disorders.Likewise, the capacity for adherence to antiretrovirals often impacts the decision to start orcontinue anti-HIV medications.Table 10-25: Pharmacologic Agents Used for Chpt 10 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 23926 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 10: Psychiatric Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 240One national study of alcohol or other substance-using individuals with HIV reported less adher- ence to combination therapy (45% vs 59% adherence in the past seven days) than non-usingcounterparts. 77 Some clinicians believe that waiting until the substance abuse and psychiatric disorder are stabilized will decrease the probability of poor adherence leading to viral resis-tance. Many experienced HIV clinicians encourage dual diagnosis treatment. Treating eitherthe substance abuse or psychiatric disorder independently or in sequence has not been shownto be effective in stabilizing patients with co-morbidity. Harm reduction programs, when absti-nence programs are not working, may offer an opportunity to keep patients engaged in treat-ment. The use of antidepressants and anti-anxiety agents in substance-using patients may be fraught with difficulty. Substance users are usually impatient for a response to psychiatric medications,preferring the rapid onset of action of BZs rather than buspirone or antidepressants. Efficacymay be delayed or diminished by current substance use. Efforts should be made to engage theHIV-positive substance user in both drug treatment and psychiatric care at the same time. Pa-tients with untreated psychiatric disorders may be less able to enroll and adhere to a drugtreatment program. The treatment of substance abuse in patients with HIV is often more complicated than in non- infected substance users. Concerns about illness, depressed mood, hopelessness, and suicidalideation often impede progress in drug abuse treatment, requiring a harm-reduction approach.Inpatient detoxification may be necessary for medically ill HIV-positive substance users, as with-drawal from substances may precipitate relapse with serious potential for overdosing. Aftermedical stabilization and detoxification, treatment is geared to maintain sobriety and reducethe incidence of relapses. Cognitive impairments and psychiatric distress will be more evidentwithin a few weeks of detoxification. Retention in substance abuse programs may be enhanced by early treatment of emerging psy- chiatric disorders, which may be precipitants for relapse. Methadone maintenance may be nec-essary for some opioid abusers to stay clean long enough to engage in psychiatric care. Metha-done must be monitored carefully, with increases and decreases in dosing when interactionswith medications occur. Nevirapine and rifampin may increase the elimination of methadone,requiring increased dosing to avoid opioid withdrawal. Methadone itself may reduce serum con-centrations of ddI, d4T, and AZT. Table 10-26 presents relevant medication interactions. 78 Metha- done must be maintained even when additional narcotics must be used to treat pain. Methadone maintenance provides for many patients a stablization of the narcotic addiction, allowing for more consistent HIV and psychiatric care. In addition to intensive outpatient treatment, adjunctive pharmacologic treatments such as disulfuram for alcohol dependence and naltrexone for opioid and alcohol dependence may helppatients manage cravings and enhance participation in 12-Step and dual diagnosis programs.Disulfuram is given in doses of 250 to 500mg per day, and naltrexone 50mg per day. Whiledisulfuram is an aversive drug, creating intense nausea and vomiting if taken with alcohol,naltrexone requires abstinence from opioids for seven to 10 days prior to initiating treatment to avoid precipitating an acute opioid abstinence syndrome. 79 It is particularly important to note that naltrexone must not be used in patients who are treated with narcotic analgesics for paincontrol. Clonidine has also been used to treat the effects of opioid withdrawal.

Providersmust understand their own preconceived notions about psychiatric patients. While during theacute phase of a psychotic or manic illness it may be difficult for patients to fully understand orengage in their treatment, the same patients may become quite able and willing to adhere toantiretroviral regimens. Patients who have been adherent to their psychiatric regimens may be likely to adhere to antiretroviral treatments as well. Antiretroviral medications, however, should never be started in the acute phase of a psychotic or mood disorder. Every patient should be offered the same opportunity to be educated about howthe medications work, why adherence is so crucial, and why taking psychiatric medications isimportant to help minimize an adherence failure. A low threshold for psychiatric hospitaliza-tion will minimize the impact of medication lapses and reduce the chances of resistance. Closemonitoring of medication side effects, strategies to enhance adherence to all medications, anddrug treatment programs may be required to provide the best medical care for patients with serious co-morbid disorders. A case management approach with an integrated care model ad- dressing medical, psychiatric and substance use can be helpful. Patients who have suffered from a serious mental illness may express ambivalence and despair about HIV. Periods of hopelessness and feelings of contamination and defectiveness may be-come prominent and require intensive psychiatric intervention. Suicidal ideation is common.Delusions about the nature of HIV infection, sexual anxieties, and paranoid ideation can compli-cate the treatment relationship. Reducing psychosis and enhancing cognitive capacity are im-portant goals of treatment. Psychopharmacologic treatment is effective in treating psychosis in the HIV-infected patient. 82 Patients with manic psychosis showed more improvement than those patients with schizophreniform psychosis, and positive symptoms responded more readily than negative symp-toms. Anti-anxiety agents, antidepressants and mood stabilizers can be helpful as adjunctiveagents. Two case reports suggested that catatonia responded to lorazepam. 83 Personality Disorders It is important for providers to recognize serious character pathology as soon as possible in the treatment of HIV. Compared to uninfected patients, those with HIV have higher rates ofpersonality disorders in the range of 19% to 37%. 84 Borderline and histrionic disorders tended to be the most common.85,86 Those personality disorders found among people with HIV are associ- ated with increased rates of psychiatric symptoms, injection drug use, depression and maladap-tive coping mechanisms. 87,88 Essentially, character pathology is syntonic to the individual but problematic to those around him or her. The most serious character disorders in terms of complicating the treatment of HIV Chpt 10 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 24226 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 10: Psychiatric Problems X U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 243are antisocial personality, narcissistic personality, borderline personality and histrionic person- ality. These disorders tend to create difficulty for patients in relationships with providers, whereas other personality disorders, such as avoidant or passive patients, may elicit provider feelings of not being able to do enough to engage patients in ongoing treatment. Problematic character traits are distinguished from serious character disorders by the consis- tency and intractability of the behavior regardless of the external environment. Many patientsmay exhibit some traits that seem to be components of their basic personality, but are evidentonly under extreme duress. Patients with cognitive impairment who are frightened and havingtrouble completing automatic tasks, patients in pain, and patients intoxicated or withdrawingfrom either substances of abuse or prescribed medications are particularly at risk for exhibiting problematic behavior which usually resolves when the underlying problem is adequately ad- dressed. Social stressors that often complicate treatment relationships include homelessnessor unstable living situations, unstable support systems, rejection from families of origin, andrelapsing criminal or drug related behaviors. A provider's reactions to a patient's character pathology may include anger, fantasies of aban- doning or withdrawing care, impulses to limit access to the provider, or frank fear of encounterswith the patient. These emotional reactions to a patient should alert the provider to the likeli-hood that the patient may have a difficult character disorder. While each type of character disorder has particular defense mechanisms, most employ denial (the inability to acknowledge or believe something; e.g., \"I can't infect others because I reallydon't have HIV\"), projection (putting onto others what one is feeling or believing; e.g., \"you must hate me\"), and splitting (telling different things to different providers with the hope of confus- ing each provider or getting one provider to believe that another is being unjust, uncaring orincompetent). Lying, or confabulating, to acquire, for example, increased pain medication, iscommon. The fear of abandonment often provokes in the patient an increased neediness andunwillingness to admit any improvement for fear the provider may withdraw or decrease the level of involvement. Projective identification (feeling what a patient is feeling) often leads providers to think something is wrong with themselves, instead of identifying the problem as aprojection onto them by a patient. People with character disorders are also vulnerable to psychotic, mood, and anxiety disorders, and have rates of substance abuse at least comparable to the general population. Providersoften may find that granting requests made by such patients provokes a sense of being abused.Errors in treatment can follow from either withholding appropriate treatment or overgratifyinga request in order to end more quickly an encounter with the patient. Communication with Other Providers in Personality Disorder Unless there is constant communication among members of the palliative care team, a patient'ssplitting will wreak havoc on the team's effectiveness. When a patient states something about amember of the team to another member (reporting what was said or done), confirmation isimperative. The provider should never rely on the patient to convey information. While no specific psychotherapeutic technique has been shown to be effective in treating personality disorders in HIV, some clinical guidelines may be helpful; see Table 10-27. Otherpsychiatric syndromes may be present along with personality disorders and should be treatedappropriately.

Irritability? Non-adherence? Devaluation? Underlying depression, anxiety orpsychosis? \u007f Establish and identify the treatment team and have the patient sign a consent for free and unrestricted communication among ALL providers, within thesame system and outside (e.g., methadone treatment program staff, casemanagers, housing authority staff). \u007f Establish concrete treatment goals that are reasonable and can be renegoti- ated at specified time intervals. \u007f If at all possible, establish an agreement regarding pain management before the need for pain treatment actually begins. Write a pain managementcontract with rules spelled out regarding refills, how doses will be determinedand increased, which meds will and will not be used. \u007f Set limits on refilling prescriptions, identify which provider will be responsible for which medications, and who will be covering when the primary prescriber is away. Also set limits on how and when patients should access their primary care provider vs. their mental health provider, person on call, or emergencyservices. \u007f Establish rules of behavior for the clinic's entire patient population. Identify what behavior will not be tolerated and enforce the rules fairly and withoutindividual variation. Have the limits for behavior clearly spelled out andapproved by a consumer advisory board or patient constituency group. \u007f When a patient is admitted to the hospital for medical care or psychiatric care, establish contact with the treatment staff to discuss rules regarding limit-setting, making goals clear and responding to patient requests without bias. \u007f Provide a space for clinicians to share feelings and thoughts about difficult patients. Knowing that one is not alone in having trouble with a particularpatient can be comforting and prevent acting out on the part of the provider. HIV-Associated Syndromes with Psychiatric Implications Several HIV-associated syndromes such as wasting, fatigue, sexual dysfunction and pain have psychiatric implications. As with sleep disturbance, treating complaints that are important to patients and that affect cognitive functioning will increase patient adherence to care and help build a therapeutic alliance between patient and provider. Pain and fatigue are discussed else-where in this guide. (See Chapter 4: Pain and Chapter 5: Constitutional Symptoms.) Wasting syndrome and sexual dysfunction are often associated with impaired self image, a sense of being defective, and body dysmorphia. These feelings can lead to obsessional concerns andbehaviors. Testosterone replacement may be beneficial in these settings. 87,88 While testosterone may improve libido, it may not address all sexual dysfunctions. Underlying problems such as Chpt 10 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 24426 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 10: Psychiatric Problems X U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 245neuropathy, vascular disease, autonomic insufficiency, premorbid psychological disease, and drug side effects should be addressed so that as normal a sexual life as possible is possible. Erectile dysfunction may be facilitated with sildenafil but caution must be urged with regard to dosing in the presence of protease inhibitors. Psychotherapy, particular behavior and cognitive therapies to treat sexual inhibitions and anxi- eties, and couples therapy may enhance both sexual function and adaptation to declining sexualfunction. 89 PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES Even with the advent of multidrug therapy, the future of most people with HIV is uncertain. Living with such a tremendous burden of unpredictability often affects people's ability to main-tain emotional stability and retain control over their lives. Many issues arise throughout thecourse of HIV infection. Each change in medical status, every blood test result, and every recog-nition of a new change in mental or physical function can create enormous stress on an infectedindividual and the people in his or her life. 90 Primary care providers are increasingly faced with complex medical and social issues. The im-portance of mental health and practical support to help patients meet these challenges cannotbe overstated. All too often, medical providers do not see the need for mental health care orunderstand the contributions that mental health clinicians can make to a treatment team, andmay convey that bias unwittingly to patients. Early involvement of mental health care in thetreatment of the HIV- infected patient allows the development of a relationship that can preventcrises from becoming disruptive to the care of the patient or the medical provider's practice. Table 10-28 lists some of the most important issues facing people over the course of their HIV infection. Two of the most emotionally difficult issues for many patients are permanency place-ment for minor children, and creating advance directives.

Discussion about some issues, particularly those thatbecome critical in the later phase, often gets postponed due to collusion on the part of provid-ers and patients to refrain from addressing difficult topics until absolutely necessary. How-ever, it is best to begin discussing all of these issues early in care. Early in HIV Diagnosis \u007f Adjusting to new diagnosis of HIV seroconversion: acute vs. chronic adapta- tional responses (fear of imminent death, guilt of infecting others, exacerba-tion of existing psychiatric conditions, acute suicidal ideation) \u007f Disclosure to others; informing intimate contacts, partners and children\u007f Adapting safer sexual and drug using behaviors \u007f Accessing appropriate HIV medical and psychiatric care \u007f Assessing substance use and need for detox, treatment, methadone maintanence \u007f Accommodating to medical evaluation and assessment of level of illness (lab results, etc.) \u007f Establishment of health care proxy; defining those involved in the care of the patient Middle Phase \u007f Accommodating work and family needs to physical and emotional impact of illness \u007f Dealing with learning about the nature of the illness and the potential treatments \u007f Adherence issues\u007f Decisions about working, going on disability, back-to-work issues, feeling productive \u007f Maintaining relationships and managing normal developmental issues in the context of the uncertainty of the progression of illness \u007f Dealing with untoward effects of illness and/or treatment; e.g., medication side effects, lipodystrophy syndrome and body image, fatigue and depression Later Phase \u007f Permanency planning issues \u007f Advance directives \u007f Existential issues; e.g., the meaning of one's life, hope versus despair, spiritual concerns and death anxiety, \"rational suicide\" \u007f Decisions about withdrawing care at the end of life\u007f Preparations for death Chpt 10 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 24626 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 10: Psychiatric Problems X U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 247Permanency placement evokes powerful feelings in parents who fear abandoning their children, and who grieve the probability that they will not see their children grow up. Accepting that permanency placement is necessary means accepting one's inevitable death, a problem for both the patient and his or her health care providers. Guilt and shame inevitably emerge as parentsget sick and face the possibility that they will die, leaving others to care for their offspring.Particularly in cases where there are difficult family relationships, many parents feel ambiva-lent about having to place their children with family members they don't like or don't trust withtheir children. Providers can support parents with HIV by acknowledging that permanency placement plan- ning is a very painful process that takes time and continued reflection and consideration, and often involves wavering back and forth from one decision to another. Helping parents to estab- lish a working relationship with a mental health provider before permanency planning issuesmust be addressed can make it easier for them to deal with such powerful concerns when theydo arise. For patients, trying to establish a strong, trusting relationship with a provider broughtin during a crisis is very difficult. With a relationship built early in the care of the infectedparent, a skilled mental health clinician can raise issues of permanency placement before theacute fears and denial set in when a medical crisis occurs. Another difficult issue for HIV-infected people is the establishment of advance directives. (See Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues.) Psychologically this requires the patient to acknowl- edge that life is finite and death may be imminent. Again, a relationship with a mental healthprovider can provide a safe place for the patient to explore fears of dying, and of death. Helpinga patient to think about the quality of life near the end of life is best done in the context ofongoing relationships with both a primary provider and a mental health clinician, working to-gether to explain the medical details and the emotional components of the decisionmakingprocess.

INTRODUCTION It is axiomatic in palliative care that suffering occurs in physical, emotional, practical, and spiritual domains and that each of these domains has an impact on any given symptom.1 Al- though in many ways these domains are more complicated in patients with substance use histo-ries, the approach to palliative care for the substance user is fundamentally the same as for anyother patient. Given the importance that substance use plays in the HIV epidemic, however, it isimportant that care providers explore, understand and address these complications. Clinicianscan often become frustrated with and alienated from substance-using patients, in whom self-destructive behaviors and care providers' own negative attitudes can interfere with treatmentsuccess. However, by attending to the specific clinical issues pertaining to substance use andintegrating these into a palliative care treatment plan, providers can effectively care for thischallenging population.If a patient has a history of or is currently using alcohol or illicit drugs, care providers mustknow. These issues should be, therefore, part of every history taken by members of the healthcare team and can be readily addressed in the routine primary care encounter (see Table 11-1). 2 It is a mistake to raise issues of substance use only with patients who arouse suspicions or fitcertain stereotypes. Care should be taken, however, to ensure that the patient or family mem-bers are not made to feel judged or guilty during these discussions. Table 11-1: Screening for and Diagnosis of Substance Abuse History of Substance Abuse Substances used Opioids (heroin, prescription analgesics) Stimulants (cocaine, prescription stimulants) Alcohol (beer, wine, spirits, nonbeverage sources) Sedative-hypnotics (benzodiazepines, barbiturates) Tobacco (cigarettes, chewing tobacco) Other Routes of administration Injection (intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular) Intranasal Inhaled Oral Pattern of use Amount Frequency Duration Most recent use Needle-sharing or shooting gallery use Chpt 11 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 25326 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 11: Substance Use Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 254The CAGE questionnaire is one helpful method of eliciting important information regarding alcohol use (see Table 11-2).3 Table 11-2: The CAGE Questionnaire C: Have you ever felt you ought to Cut down on drinking? A: Have people Annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? G: Have you ever felt bad or Guilty about your drinking? E: Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover ( Eye-opener)? Source: Ewing, JA. Detecting alcoholism: the CAGE questionnaire. JAMA 252:1904-7, 1984. It is often easiest to include questions regarding drug use among questions regarding smoking and alcohol use in a straightforward, matter-of-fact manner. Physical and laboratory examina-tions can also be helpful. Track marks, evidence of soft tissue infections, nasal septum erosion,liver function abnormalities, tremor, or asterixis can support a diagnosis of substance use.Table 11-1: Screening for and Diagnosis of Substance Abuse (continued) Treatment history Setting (outpatient, inpatient, residential) Drug treatment program Pharmacologic treatment Treatment outcome Complications of Substance Abuse Medical Needle-induced: viral, bacterial, and fungal infections; peripheral vascular disease Drug-induced: withdrawal, organ-specific to cardiac ischemia due to cocaine; gastrointestinal, cardiac and neurologic disease due to alcohol) Other: tuberculosis, sexually transmitted disease Social Unemployment Family disruption Legal problems Homelessness Physical Examination Signs of injection drug use Recent: \"tracks,\" cellulitis, abscess Past: \"track\" or abscess scars Evidence complications Laboratory Tests Toxicologic screening of urine E.g.: opioids, cocaine, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, hallucinogins, alcohol Screening for medical complications E.g.: hepatitis B, C serologies, liver function abnormalities Source: O'Connor PG, Selwyn P A, Schottenfeld RS.

If a history of substance use is identified, further exploration is needed. It is important to be aware that poly-substance use is common. At a minimum, the type of substance(s), amount,route of administration, frequency of use, and medical complications, including signs of toler-ance and dependence should be understood (see below). If a patient has been in substance usetreatment, the palliative care team should know the approach that was used and its impact onthe patient's drug use. In these circumstances, the palliative care team should include an ex-pert in treating addictions. GENERAL MEDICAL CARE While this chapter does not attempt to review the myriad medical complications of substance use and HIV, it is important that the palliative care provider be aware of the scope of issues thathe or she may face and be prepared to seek consultation when necessary. 3, 4 Substance users can be at higher risk for diseases besides HIV/AIDS. Hepatitis B, C, and deltaare transmitted parenterally, as are bacteria causing endocarditis, soft tissue infection and otherinfections. Tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases are more common in this populationand must be ruled out. Chronic lung disease associated with exposure to substances used to\"cut\" cocaine and heroin and chronic liver disease associated with alcohol can make provisionof palliative care medically complex. Active drug users are at risk for withdrawal (from opiates, alcohol, barbiturates and benzodiaz- epines), which can be a life-threatening emergency. Cocaine, particularly when injected or smoked, can cause cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, hyperpyrexia, rhabdomyolysis, and cere-bral or coronary artery vasospasm. Substances that suppress consciousness and respiration caninduce coma and death. Opiates, in addition, can cause non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. PAIN Pain is often poorly managed in the substance-abusing patient or in the patient with a history of substance use.5 This can be because pain is not recognized as such and is interpreted as manipulation or \"drug-seeking;\" because unique predispositions to pain are not understood; orbecause of ignorance of basic principles of addiction and/or pain management. To manage painappropriately, providers need a systematic and thoughtful approach. Substance Use and Pain It must first be understood and accepted that a history of substance use does not preclude someone from having real pain. In many cases, in fact, substance use may predispose a patient to experience physical pain (secondary to trauma, chronic venous insufficiency, infections, alco-holic or nutritional neuropathies, etc.) or to have pain that is difficult to control for a variety ofreasons. Patients who have developed tolerance to opiates may require doses of narcotic medi-cations considerably higher than non-tolerant patients, and this may make some providers un-comfortable. Additionally, it has been shown that some substance users treated with methadonemay have a lower pain threshold than others. 6 Finally, the profound emotional, practical, and even spiritual complications of substance use contribute to pain symptoms and must be ad-dressed to manage pain successfully.

Trust between clinician and provider is fundamental to mobilizing an effective treat- ment regimen. If the patient has lied, manipulated, sold prescription drugs or otherwise created cause for mistrust, such a negative atmosphere is not easily overcome. In these instances, theprovider should discuss the situation directly and frankly with the patient, articulate reasonablelimits, develop a written contract and move on. Such a contract should stipulate the following: \u007f The total amount of medication is specified that will be prescribed over a short period of time (with the provider dispensing only small amounts, as necessary,to limit the possibility of abuse) \u007f Only one person will write and one pharmacy will fill prescriptions for controlled substances \u007f Refills will not be given for \"lost\" or \"stolen\" prescriptions\u007f Random toxicology screenings will be part of the treatment plan\u007f Forgery of prescriptions or other serious violations of the law will result in criminal prosecution of the patient While these efforts can be very effective in helping to prevent manipulation and abuse of pre- scribed narcotics, abuse can sometimes still occur. It is important for providers to recognize thetypes of behaviors suggestive of abuse, in order to be able to prevent and address these problems(Table 11-3). 5 Table 11-3: Spectrum of Aberrant Drug-Related Behaviors Occurring during Treatment with Narcotic Analgesics More Suggestive of Drug Abuse Less Suggestive of Drug Abuse \u007f Reports of 'lost' or 'stolen' prescriptions \u007f Selling prescription drugs \u007f Prescription forgery \u007f Stealing drugs from others \u007f Injecting oral formulations \u007f Obtaining prescription drugs from nonmedical sources \u007f Concurrent abuse of alcohol or illicit drugs \u007f Repeated dose escalations or similar noncompliance despite multiplewarnings \u007f Repeated visits to other clinicians or emergency rooms without informingthe prescriber \u007f Drug-related deterioration in function at work, in the family, or socially \u007f Repeated resistance to changes in therapy despite evidence of adversedrug effects\u007f Aggressive complaining about the need for more drugs \u007f Drug-hoarding during periods of reduced symptoms \u007f Requesting specific drugs \u007f Openly acquiring similar drugs from other medical sources \u007f Occasional unsanctioned dose escalation or other noncompliance \u007f Unapproved use of the drug to treat another symptom \u007f Reporting psychic effects not intended by the clinician \u007f Resistance to a change in therapy associated with tolerable adverse effects \u007f Intense expressions of anxiety about recurrent symptoms Source: Passik SD, Portenoy RK.

A provider who does not take a complaint of pain seriously simply because of a patient's socioeconomic status, race or history of substance use is violating the implicit trust that the patient places in his or her hands. Several studies havedemonstrated that nonwhite patients are more likely to have pain underdiagnosed andundertreated than white patients. 7 It has also been shown that pharmacies in poor minority neighborhoods may not stock narcotic medications and thus make access to pain treatmentmore difficult. 8 As will be discussed below, substance-using patients often have long histories of negative interactions with the health care system. Provider prejudices, when brought to thepalliative care of an HIV-infected patient, can inflict further damage precisely at a time whentrust and healing are most needed. Pharmacologic Properties and Physiologic Impact of Substances Providers must know what substance(s) the patient is using, the pharmacologic properties, and the physiologic impact. A patient with a chronic addiction to alcohol will have differentphysiologic response to a given dose of an opiate than someone who has become tolerant toheroin. Similarly, someone with alcohol-related peripheral nerve damage might experience HIV-related neuropathy more severely than a cocaine user. Care must be taken to precisely describe the patient's use of the substance. Tables 11-4 and 11- 5 provide definitions of commonly used terms in this regard. 5, 9, 10, 11 Proper use of these terms allows clear communication among all members of the palliative care team (including addiction specialists) and forms the basis of an explicit clinical rationale for both pain and addictiontreatment decisions. Table 11-4: Definitions of Substance Dependence and Abuse Substance Dependence: A maladaptive pattern of substance abuse, leading to clinically significant impairment or dis- tress, as manifested by three or more of the following, occurring at any time in the same twelve-month period: Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: \u007f A need for markedly increased amounts of substance to achieve intoxication or desired effects, or \u007f Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: \u007f The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substance, or \u007f The same (or closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful effort to cut down or control substance use. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the substance, use the substance, or recover from its effects \u007f (e.g., visiting multiple doctors or driving long distances, chain smoking).

The substance use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated bythe substance \u007f (e.g., current cocaine use despite recognition of cocaine-induced depression, or continued drinking despite recognition that an ulcer was made worse by alcoholconsumption). Substance Abuse: A maladaptive pattern of substance abuse, leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by one (or more) of the following, occurring within a twelve-monthperiod: Recurrent substance use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home: \u007f repeated absences or poor work performance related to substance abuse, \u007f substance abuse-related absence, suspension,\u007f expulsions from school, or\u007f neglect of children or household. Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous, such as: \u007f driving an automobile, or \u007f operating a machine when impaired by substance use. Recurrent substance-related legal problems, such as arrests for substance-related disorderly conduct. Continued substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance \u007f (e.g., arguments with spouse about consequences of intoxication, physical fights). The symptoms have never met the criteria for substance dependence for this class of substance. Sources: Passik SD, Portenoy RK. Substance abuse issues in palliative care.

Tolerance A state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug's effects over time. Pseudo-addiction Syndrome of behavioral symptoms which mimic those seen with psychological dependence, including an overwhelming and compulsive interest in the acquisition and use of opioid analgesics. Unlike true psychological dependence, pseudo- addiction is an iatrogenic syndrome caused by the undermedication of pain. Symptoms and aberrant behaviors resolve once pain is effectively controlled.

It is always best to keep pain management and addiction treat- ments as separate items on the problem list with distinct strategies and approaches.12 However, at the same time, both pain management and addiction treatment must be integrated into anoverall plan of care. Table 11-6: Treating Pain in Methadone-Maintained Patients Methadone used as daily maintenance therapy for opioid addiction has no significant anal- gesic effects. It is legal and permissible to prescribe opioid analgesics to narcotic-ad-dicted patients for the treatment of pain if these opioids are clinically justified and pre-scribed with appropriate documentation and precautions to prevent abuse. In metha- done-maintained patients receiving opioid analgesics, these opioids should be given in addition to the daily maintenance dose of methadone. Due to opioid tolerance, it is generally necessary to use higher and more frequent doses of opioid analgesics in methadone-maintained patients compared with non-tolerant patients. Methadone is an excellent opioid analgesic agent when used to treat pain (e.g., tid or qid dosing) but due to possible therapeutic confusion, miscommunication and regulatory is-sues, it is preferable to use another opioid when this class of analgesic is required in metha-done-maintained patients. In inpatients or homebound patients with chronic severe pain, in the end stages of termi- nal illness, patients' entire opioid analgesic dose plus the daily methadone maintenancedose may be converted into a continuous subcutaneous or intravenous infusion of parenteralmethadone or another opioid as clinically indicated. Source: Selwyn P A. Pain management in substance users. In Manual for Primary Care Providers: Effectively Caring for Substance Abusers . New York: New York Academy of Medicine, in press. The baseline methadone dose should never be assumed to be sufficient to treat pain. Further- more, increasing a patient's daily methadone dosage for purposes of treating pain has seriousdrawbacks, as follows: \u007f It can greatly confuse psychosocial aspects of addiction treatment \u007f It will be ineffective as a means of pain control (methadone when used for pain is dosed q 6 to 8 hrs, and when used for addiction treatment is dosed only qd; patients already on methadone maintenance would need significantlyhigher additional doses of methadone to achieve any analgesic effect) \u007f It can potentially expose the palliative care team to legal confusion and difficulties as it is illegal to prescribe methadone for addiction treatmentoutside of a licensed methadone maintenance program Near the end of life, inpatient or homebound patients on methadone maintenance may benefit from a less rigid approach. A total daily opiate dose (e.g., morphine, hydromorphone) can begiven via 1/28/2003, 26026 Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 11: Substance Use Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 261 XIGeneral Pain Management Issues In patients with substance use histories, as with other patients, the provider must develop an understanding of the pathophysiology of the pain in question and a rational, incremental ap-proach to its pharmacological management. (See Chapter 4: Pain.) After taking a careful historyof the pain complaint (site; quality; exacerbating and relieving factors; temporal quality; onset;associated symptoms and signs; impact on life and psychology; and effect of current treatments),the provider can determine whether the pain is of nociceptive or neuropathic origin. This dis-tinction is important as it can have treatment implications. Nociceptive pain results from stimu-lation of afferent receptors and can cause myriad painful sensations: localized or diffuse; so-matic (involving skin, muscle, bone and soft tissue) or visceral; mild to severe. Neuropathic painderives from damaged or otherwise compromised nerves and tends to result in shooting, stab-bing, burning, electric shock-like pain, or discomfort that is caused by minimal stimulation tothe skin (allodynia). As is true in any patient, effective pain management in the substance-using patient involves multiple modalities and usually requires contributions from all members of the palliative careteam. The pharmacological approach is best guided by the World Health Organization (WHO)three-tiered ladder-starting with non-narcotic analgesics (step one); followed by weak narcot-ics (step two); and finally moving to strong opioids (step three). (See Figure 4-1 in Chapter 4:Pain.) Adjuvant analgesics can be added at any step (e.g., for neuropathic pain). It is importantto be aware, however, that in a patient who has developed tolerance to narcotics, strong opiates(step three) may be needed sooner, at greater frequency, and at higher doses, than would other-wise be expected. It is better for the primary care provider to work and be comfortable with oneor two drugs in each class (doses, pharmacokinetics, conversions, side effects, interactions etc.) than to have only a superficial knowledge of all of them. As a general rule, it is best to push lower level treatment to the maximum before advancing to the next level. In cases of moderate tosevere pain, therapy can rightly begin at step two. While taking reports of pain seriously, providers should also act to minimize the likelihood of abuse. This often means opting for the alternative that is least tempting to the patient, avoidinguse of a stronger, more readily abused drug for mild to moderate pain if an alternative is avail-able that is less likely to be abused. For example, codeine is weaker, less euphorigenic, moreconstipating, and of lower \"street value\" than oxycodone, morphine, or hydromorphone. Although this is not a firm rule, long-acting drugs tend to be less likely to be abused than short-acting ones, and certain formulations (e.g., the transdermal fentanyl patch) may be less prone to abusethan others (e.g., brand-name oxycodone pills, which have a higher \"street value\" than genericoxycodone). As noted above, the concepts of tolerance and dependence are very important in assessing and treating pain in substance users. (See Tables 11-4 and 11-5.) Because of tolerance, patients willhave higher narcotic requirements than patients who are opioid-na\u00efve, meaning that opioidswill have to be prescribed at higher dosages and more frequently. This is sometimes counterintuitive to providers who are reluctant to prescribe opioids to patients with histories of opioid abuse. However, unless the provider accounts for the patient's actual dosage needs, thetreatment will be guaranteed to fail. Moreover, a common scenario which then unfolds is thatproviders may interpret patients' requests for higher doses or early prescription refills as signsof drug-seeking, thus confirming their prejudices about manipulative behavior in substance us-ers, when in fact this patient response is entirely predictable based on the pharmacology ofopioid medications. Chpt 11 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 11: Substance Use Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 262The concept of dependence is important in that the symptoms of drug withdrawal (which may include malaise, musculoskeletal pain, and abdominal pain) may need to be distinguished from the underlying pain disorder in patients who become opioid-dependent and may require addi- tional intervention (e.g., use of longer-acting drugs) to ensure a steady-state over the 24-hourdosing period. When switching between opioids and analgesics clinicians must be familiar with conversions between different drugs in order to maintain a constant level of analgesia and avoid side effects.(See Chapter 4: Pain.) As cross-tolerance between opioids is not always complete, however, theinitial dose of a new opioid should be about half of the calculated dose and the patient observedfor side effects. Rapid scale-up of the medication can follow. Meperidine (which has long-acting metabolites) and mixed agonist-antagonist agents that can precipitate withdrawal such as pentazocine and butorphanol should generally be avoided.Providers should also be careful when prescribing narcotic combinations that include poten-tially oxycodone or codeineplus acetaminophen). In many cases, the dose-ceiling for these drugs is due to the acetami-nophen (for which the daily dose should not exceed 4 gm/day and in some patients even less),and not the opioid itself. This is particularly true in a drug-using population with HIV alreadyat high risk for hepatitis. Neuropathic pain also can be pharmacologically managed using the WHO ladder. Effective man- agement, however, often involves more aggressive use of adjuvant treatments, particularly thoseknown to act on the central nervous system: anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, and others.(See Chapter 4: Pain.) Route of administration of opiates is also an important issue in this population. Some patients whose substance use is in remission may strongly object to administration of any drug using aneedle and be much more comfortable with oral or transdermal preparations. In other cases,when there is concern that medications may be sold on the street (either by the patient orhousehold members), long-acting, transdermal, and generic formulations are best, even thoughmisuse can still occur with all of these options. Indwelling catheters pose particular problems inthat they can be, and are, misused by some patients. In these cases, a percutaneous infusionpump may be a better option. Physicians often fear that they are being manipulated to over-prescribe controlled substances. Alternatively, they may be concerned that they will create or re-establish an addiction. Thereare no easy answers to these dilemmas. Both are real dangers. However, if decisions are in-formed by a solid understanding of the precise nature of the patient's substance use as outlinedabove, the chances of such bad outcomes are lessened. That said, the fear of over-prescribing should not prevent effective pain management. Surgical teaching on treatment of appendicitis holds that: Accuracy of preoperative diagnosis should be about 85%. If it is considerably less, some unnecessary operations are probably beingdone, and a more rigorous pre-operative differential diagnosis is inorder. On the other hand, an accuracy consistently greater than 90percent should also cause concern, since this may mean that somepatients with atypical but bona fide acute appendicitis are being\"observed\" when they should have prompt surgical intervention. 13 Chpt 11 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 26226 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 11: Substance Use Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 263 XIA similar line of thought might well be applied to the use of controlled pain medications. It is better to tolerate a degree of manipulation and drug-seeking behavior in a population of pa- tients than to allow a high prevalence of un- or undertreated pain. This is especially true in the case of the patients who are the concern of this book\u2014those living with HIV/AIDS who needpalliation and end-of-life care. Symptoms other than pain are managed much the same in the substance-using population as in other groups. It should be remembered, however, that pain (physical, psychic or spiritual) canand will exacerbate suffering associated with a variety of symptoms. If, therefore, pain is notappropriately managed in the substance user, it is less likely that other symptoms will resolveeither. PSYCHOLOGICAL, SPIRITUAL, AND SOCIAL CONCERNS Substance users typically have histories of negative interactions with health care institutions and providers. The palliative care provider may, therefore, find himself or herself faced with amistrustful or even hostile patient requiring considerable effort, time, and compassion. Over-coming this barrier can be especially rewarding, particularly if it means that a patient is able tomeet his or her death in an environment of trust and respect. Alcohol aside, substance use is an illegal activity. Discovery or admission of substance use car- ries with it fear of criminal prosecution, loss of children, dissolution of family structures, loss ofemployment, and other social sanctions. The clinician should anticipate these fears and have inmind a reasonable plan of action should they be raised. At times, the patient and palliative careteam must have legal advice to ensure that the patient's interests are protected. Substance users often live in chaotic social situations that make home care impossible. Medica- tions with a street value are stolen; violence is common (women living with HIV and substanceuse are at increased risk for physical and sexual abuse); 14 reliable primary caregivers are diffi- cult to identify; and providing security to members of the care team can be problematic. In thesecases institution-based care may be sought earlier than would otherwise be clinically indicated. There are high rates of psychiatric co-morbidity in the substance using population. All patients presenting with active substance use should therefore have a psychiatric evaluation. (See Chap- ter 10: Psychiatric Problems). Even when substance use is in remission, providers should re- member that HIV/AIDS is in and of itself a stressor, that stages of clinical deterioration areespecially difficult from a psychological point of view, and that there is high risk for relapse atsuch times. Spiritual concerns among substance users are as varied and universal as among any other people. (See Chapter 13: Spiritual Care.) There are, however, some additional considerations.Many former substance users rely upon deeply held religious convictions to maintain sobriety.It is critical that these beliefs be understood and respected by the palliative care team. If, for example, a patient is a member of Alcoholics or Narcotics Anonymous, providers may want to include the patient's sponsor as a member of the care team. Active users, on the other hand,may have experienced repeated rejection from religious institutions and initially be mostcomfortable dealing with spiritual concerns in other ways. Many people who are alienatedfrom religious institutions of their youth desire, as their health deteriorates, to re-engage. Itis important, therefore, that the palliative care team maintain a high degree of flexibility andopenness in this regard. Chpt 11 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 26326 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 11: Substance Use Problems U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 264Care providers often see substance users as a source of frustration, mistrust, and negative inter- actions. However, when providers understand the basic principles of addictive disease, and can incorporate some of these simple principles into their management of such patients, the re- wards can be very gratifying. Just as providers bring their own prejudices to the encounter withthe patient, so too do the patients themselves. Substance using patients may have concerns thattheir reports of pain will not be taken seriously, that they will be dismissed as drug-seeking ormanipulative, or that they will generally be treated with hostility and disrespect. This negativeframework often guarantees even before an encounter begins that it will be a failure. A provider'sability to overcome this negative framework can be critically important both to patient out-comes and provider satisfaction. Especially for patients at the end of life, opportunities for em-pathy, understanding, and healing occur frequently, and provide continued affirmation that sub-stance use need not disqualify patients from receiving effective care.

INTRODUCTION All HIV clinicians, whether they care for adults or children, need to understand the basic issues and needs of children and adolescents in order to provide palliative care. Pediatric HIVproviders must have the knowledge and skills to provide palliative care to their patients throughoutthe disease trajectory. They must also be cognizant of the palliative care issues that affect thefamily members in a child's life. Providers for adults with HIV must understand the needs ofchildren and adolescents in the lives of their adult patients, especially as they relate to pallia-tive care and care at the end of life.This chapter first describes the developmental continuum of children and adolescents, andthen addresses pain and symptom management. Finally a range of issues related to caring forchildren with advanced disease is discussed, including prognostication, several aspects ofdecisionmaking and communication including disclosure of HIV status, and support of affectedchildren including permanency planning. HIV Is a Family Disease HIV is a family disease in every sense. In pediatric HIV infection, there are usually at least two generations of the family infected: mothers (and often fathers) and children. Parents continuecaring for sick children as their own disease progresses. Families living with HIV often includeseveral people with HIV, increasing the disease's impact on each individual almost exponen-tially. When multiple adult siblings are infected, substantial caregiving burden falls to theiraging parents. If those adult children have children themselves, caregiving responsibility forsick mothers and sick children often falls to grandparents or other elderly family members. Children and Adolescents Infected with HIV Young people with HIV/AIDS require high quality care throughout the continuum of their disease, including high quality palliative care. The advent of highly active antiretroviral combi-nation therapies (HAART) has not made palliative care obsolete. In fact, it helps refocus ourgoals. As symptom management is an important component of palliative care, managing thesymptoms associated with antiretroviral therapy should be an integral component of initial HIVmanagement in a newly diagnosed patient.HAART has not cured HIV. A cohort of children has survived into adolescence on serial monoand dual therapies. These young people, now in their mid-teen years and often in non-parentcare, are grappling with the failure of medical treatment to stem the progression of their disease. Chpt 12 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 26726 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 12: The Care of Children and Adolescents U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 268Children and Adolescents Affected by HIV Besides the children and adolescents who are infected with HIV, many non-infected children and adolescents are affected by the disease. Children and adolescents affected by loved oneswith HIV\u2014including parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends and lovers\u2014areoften called the forgotten children of the epidemic. Although HAART has provided a respitefrom the multiple deaths of parents and other treasured adults, the losses have not stopped andare beginning to escalate again. The needs of children and adolescents include basic care andprotection, nurturing, discipline, and mentoring in order to grow into independent adults. Chil-dren also need support in anticipating and preparing for loss and in experiencing healthy be-reavement. DEVELOPMENTAL CONTINUUM The single characteristic that makes children stand apart from adults is their rapid growth and development. Because the changes are so large and so rapid during life's first two decades,any engagement with children and adolescents, whether infected or affected, must begin with asense of where a child is on his/her developmental trajectory. Health care providers need tounderstand a child or adolescent's level of development in order to offer appropriate support. For purposes of description, four streams of development will be presented: \u007f Physical growth and physiological maturation \u007f Motor skills development\u007f Cognitive maturation\u007f Social and emotional maturation Some streams may have greater relevance than others to certain situations. However, we must always remember that all four streams are intertwined into the unique whole of eachindividual child or adolescent. Physical Growth and Physiological Maturation Childhood and adolescence are periods of rapid physical growth. Newborns triple their body weight in the first year of life. By the age of 15, an adolescent will weigh two-thirds more than heor she weighed as a ten year old. Appetite, diet, and caloric intake increase substantiallyas a child grows. Clothing and shoes become too small before they are worn out. Basic carerequires close supervision and protection by nurturing adults with the means to support thegrowing child. Growth, Size and HIV Infection Growth failure is a common complication of HIV infection. Short stature in adolescents may lead to teasing by peers and inappropriate treatment by adults who think the adolescent is a younger child. Clearly \"one size\" cannot \"fit all.\" For children with special health care needs, equipment must be available in appropriate sizes. Blood pressure cuffs, wheelchairs, beds, and walkers come ina range of sizes. Using safe and familiar items creatively is desirable. For instance, children feeling too weak or tired to walk around or go outside may enjoy rides in a wagon filled with pillows and blankets.

Metabolism and excretion of medications change with the maturation of body organs. Early infancy is a time of rapid matura-tion in hepatic and renal function. There are further changes at puberty that are less well de-fined. Therefore, chronic medication dosing must be recalculated as children grow or regress(Table 12-1). Common pediatric medicines such as antibiotics have been studied for safety, efficacy, and opti- mal dosing in even the youngest patients. Often, children require and tolerate higher total dosesthan adults. However, many medications that are used to manage symptoms and complicationshave not been formally tested in children. Table 12-1: Example Illustrating the Need for Flexible Dosing Formulations: Range of Doses for a Common Antibiotic Prescribed during Childhood and Adolescence Age Weight Dose Calculation Dose Administered 2 months 5 kg or 11 lb 50 mg/kg/day 85 mg tid 3 years 15 kg or 33 lb 50 mg/kg/day 250 mg tid 9 years 30 kg or 66 lb 50 mg/kg/day 500 mg tid 14 years 50 kg or 110 lb (equiv to 15-30 mg/kg/day) 250-500 mg tid 154 lb (equiv to 10-20 mg/kg/day) 250-500 mg tid Medication formulations must provide flexible doses in a form that can be easily swallowed. Liquid formulations offer the most flexible dose titration and are the easiest to swallow if theflavor and odor are tolerable. Sustained release preparations can reduce the frequency and number of doses, but must be available in multiple strengths in order to be useful at all with children or adolescents. Transdermal patches, an ideal delivery system, are available only for alimited number of drugs and in adult dose ranges. Motor Skills Development Human infants are completely dependent on adult caregivers for all basic care and daily activities until they develop into independent people responsible for their own care. Gross mo-tor skills are the first developmental milestones we see, as infants learn to sit, stand, walk, run, and climb. Fine motor skills include using hands to accomplish increasingly complex tasks such as grasping, carrying, self-feeding, and gaining voluntary control over intake and elimination(chewing, swallowing, bowel and bladder control). Motor skills influence the extent to which children can cooperate with or perform their self-care or care for others. They are markers of independence and usually great pride. However, adultssometimes assume that physical skills predict cognitive or emotional maturity. This error canlead adults to expect children to shoulder burdens that are not appropriate for their cognitive oremotional level of development.

HIV can cause progressive neurologic deterioration, with loss of milestones and increased dependency on others for ambulation and self-care. HIV also causes fatigue and weakness that functionally restrict a child's independence. Assessing changes over time, espe-cially the loss of skills, is an important component of care planning for children with chronicand progressive illness. Cognitive Maturation A child's developing ability to think is reflected in his or her ability to communicate in writ- ten and spoken language, and in the ability to solve problems. Expressive language includes the vocalizations, body motions, or writings that a child will use to attempt to express ideas to others. Primitive skills will communicate comfort or discomfort (smiling, crying). As cognitionadvances, expressions become more intricate and refined, becoming recognizable words, thensentences, then paragraphs and conversations. With patients who are children, our ability toascertain their experience of physical symptoms or psychological loss is limited by their abilityto express these ideas in ways we can understand. Receptive language skills include a child's ability to hear and understand the spoken word and see and read the written word. All these skills are necessary for children and adolescents (andadults) to participate effectively in decisionmaking. These skills develop gradually as a childmatures. Young children understand events concretely while adolescents are better able to think abstractly. Our explanations of what is going to happen and why, or of choices about treatment, can only be shared to the extent that a child has the receptive skills and cognitive processing tocomprehend what is being communicated and its implications. Social and Emotional Maturation A child's social interaction begins with parents and other daily caregivers. During the first year, infants begin to distinguish self from others, and familiar others from strangers. They be- gin to remember people even when the people are not physically present. During the second year, children begin parallel play and later become truly interactive in their play. Social interac- tion with peers becomes important throughout the school years, and takes on greater impor-tance as adolescents become more independent from adults. Table 12-2 presents suggestions forhealth care providers to use in working with children and adolescents at different stages ofsocial development. A personal or family illness will interfere with the normal progression of a child's socialization process. Missing school and other opportunities for age-appropriate play can cause arrest orregression of this component of development. Emotionally, a child's experience of loss (self, family, friends) will vary according to his or her developmental age. The same loss may be re-experienced in new ways at critical points in thechild's development.

Because HIV remains a disease without curative treatment, in some sense, all care ispalliative in intent. We must attend to patients' physical problems in order to support furtherexploration of the emotional, spiritual, and social issues that concern them. We strive to improvethe quality of living through HIV-specific therapies and other supportive and preventive thera-pies. Symptom Management This section explores the range of physical symptoms experienced by children and adoles- cents with HIV/AIDS, management options for these symptoms, and strategies for successfullyimplementing effective management. Conscious use of this framework for care from the time ofdiagnosis will help to facilitate the transitions in care that must occur as disease progresses. The range of symptoms experienced by children and adolescents is similar to that for adults with HIV/AIDS. Some symptoms are caused by the underlying disease and its complicationsand some are caused by the procedures and treatments that are used to manage the disease(Table 12-3). Table 12-3: Causes of Symptoms in HIV/AIDS Patients SymptomCauses Disease Procedure Treatment Pain Nausea Anorexia Vomiting Diarrhea Constipation Fatigue Fever Dyspnea Cough Bleeding Seizures Anxiety Fear Depression Sleep disturbance Skin lesions Chpt 12 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 27226 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 12: The Care of Children and Adolescents XII U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 273Managing symptoms follows a logical approach: assessment, treatment, and reassessment. Health care providers should repeat this sequence of actions rapidly until symptoms are controlled and then on a routine basis to assure maintenance of control. Preventing Iatrogenic Pain and Symptoms The clinician's first obligation is to prevent the pain and symptoms associated with the tests and treatment provided to patients. This means being conscious of these symptoms and actingpreemptively to prevent or control them. The most common procedure-associated symptom ispain due to needle sticks (injections, phlebotomy, intravenous access, lumbar punctures). EMLAcream (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) is readily available and easy to use for all of these indications. A barrier to its use is a provider perception that there is not enough time for it to work. Usually the lack of time for application of EMLA is a result of providers' failure to antici-pate the need for EMLA at the beginning of a clinical encounter. Some families successfullyapply EMLA at home prior to traveling to a clinical appointment; again, this is possible whenproviders anticipate the predictable need for topical pain relief and spend the time and effortahead of time to implement a strategy for prevention. Anticipatory fear and anxiety are common procedure-associated symptoms in pediatric patients, as in adults. With children, preparation for procedures using medical play is very effective inreducing fear, improving a sense of mastery and control, and thereby improving the patient'scooperation with procedures. Child life specialists are trained professionals who provide devel- opmentally appropriate psychologic preparation and can provide direct support to the child throughout the procedure. Techniques include the use of dolls, medical equipment that thechild can touch and manipulate, pictures and books, and role-playing with the child taking therole of the health care professional. Distraction, imagery, relaxation, music, and hypnosis aretechniques used during procedures to complement analgesia and preparation. Many medications have the potential to cause side effects. HAART regimens are common cul- prits, causing nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dysphoria, or paresthesia. Children initiat-ing therapy early in the course of HIV disease may feel well until starting medicine and then feel sick. For children with progressive disease, medicines may add or obscure symptoms. Whenever possible, providers should minimize treatment-associated symptoms through thoughtful pre-scribing, patient preparation, and medical management. Assessing Symptoms The first step is to determine whether a patient is experiencing any symptoms and, if so, which? Each symptom must be assessed regarding the following factors: \u007f Onset \u007f Severity\u007f Duration\u007f The presence of precipitating, aggravating, and relieving factors While this assessment can be challenging with adult patients, it can seem impossible in children. Direct observation of the child and the report of a parenting adult are essential components to pediatric assessment. In preverbal children, behavioral observation of crying, irritability, with- drawn or depressed affect, tense body position or facial grimacing, and fearfulness may each Chpt 12 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 27326 Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 12: The Care of Children and Adolescents U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 274point to underlying pain. Adults who spend a lot of time with the child are able to describe changes or patterns in behavior suggestive of pain. But it is almost never too early to ask the patient directly. Even very young children can provide important information. Their descrip- tions can be charmingly accurate and to the point. Unfortunately, they also learn quickly thattelling the doctor or nurse about a problem may lead to more tests that cause further pain anddiscomfort, so a child's denial of a symptom that seems likely to be present must be taken incontext as well. For instance, a therapeutic trial of analgesia is sometimes the best way to sortout how much pain is contributing to the patient's current condition. Pain Assessment Pain comes in many forms. Remarkably, patients may not report pain unless a provider askswhether it is present. Pain is an important symptom for alerting providers to problems thatrequire further investigation and treatment. Pain is also a problem in and of itself for the pa-tient and requires specific management, regardless of its underlying etiology. Pain assessment logically begins with location. Providers should ask, \"Where does it hurt?\" \"What other pains do you have?\" A list of all the pains helps the provider organize an approach toassessment. Possible pains in children and adolescents include the following: \u007f Headache \u007f Stomach Ache or Abdominal Pain\u007f Chest Pain \u007f Back Pain \u007f Ear Ache, Sore Throat, Mouth Pain, or Tooth Pain\u007f Extremity Pain Knowing when a child has multiple pains helps the provider address each type of pain with appropriate modalities and allows specific reassessment to assure the patient's optimal responseto each intervention. The severity or intensity of the pain can be assessed using the behavioral rating scale, FACES scale, or the 1-10 scale. (See Figures 4-2 to 4-5 in Chapter 4: Pain.) Pain rating scales helpproviders to determine when a patient's pain is getting worse and when interventions are pro-viding relief. The character of the pain may be more difficult to elicit. Some children are able to use adult descriptors that suggest an etiology of the pain, such as aching versus shooting pain. However, many children will simply say it hurts. Some can describe onset and frequency, but others willonly be able to tell the provider if the pain is present now and whether it is sometimes not there.Colicky pain may require adult observation of the exacerbation/remission cycle of the pain. Physical Examination and Verbal Questioning of Children to Assess Symptoms Physical examination begins with the careful observation of the patient's position, spontaneous movements, and level of arousal/interaction. This phase of the exam is particularly important with children. Children become frightened and start crying even in anticipation of an exam thatmay cause them further pain. Once a child reaches this state, it is nearly impossible to discrimi-nate areas of tenderness or to complete an adequate exam. Chpt 12 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 27426 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 12: The Care of Children and Adolescents XII U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 275Simple preparation before touching the patient and respect for a patient's request to stop a portion of the exam will achieve a more informative evaluation than wrestling with a screaming child. Visual inspection (without touching!) of the skin reveals lesions or wounds. Palpation and manipulation helps to discriminate the presence and location of tenderness as well as otheraggravating factors. Asking a child to help the examiner by telling him or her as soon as some-thing hurts, so that further hurt can be minimized, helps include the child in the evaluation andpromotes cooperation and improved feedback about symptoms. Neuropathic pains may have associated motor and sensory changes. Sensory neuropathy causes hyperesthetic areas that cannot tolerate even light touch. The pain of nerve root compressionmay feel deep and aching but not be made worse by direct palpation in the area of referred pain. The assessment of symptoms other than pain in children is less well studied. We rely on direct observation by parents and health care professionals and the subjective reports of the patients.Behavioral observations can make us suspicious that a child is experiencing a symptom, but maynot indicate specifically which symptom. For this, providers need the child's feedback. However,the child's capacity to provide this feedback is limited by his or her developmental level. Adultproxies may not provide an accurate assessment. In addition, we have few reliable severity mea-sures, inhibiting our ability to detect changes in severity over time other than by behavioralimprovements in response to specific interventions. Sometimes the provider can only deter- mine the presence or absence of a symptom. (See Table 12-4).

These patients are too young to use the bathroom independently, change their clothes, or pre- pare and eat meals. Therefore the presence and severity of symptoms that require adult atten- tion can be ascertained by asking a parenting adult. This person certainly will know whether ayoung child is experiencing vomiting, diarrhea, infrequent stools, decreased appetite, decreasedactivity, disturbed sleep, or fussy behavior. As discussed above, behavioral observations regarding changes in appetite, activity, sleep, and mood do not necessarily indicate the presence of a specific symptom. For instance, pain ornausea could cause the same spectrum of behaviors; identifying the correct symptom is neces-sary for effective symptom management. Providers need to ask older children directly about their symptoms, in addition to asking adult caregivers for their observations. Children may not recognize or accurately use \"medical\" de-scriptors. Nonetheless, their reports are critical pieces of symptom assessment. Nausea is diffi-cult to describe or explain. Constipation may be missed because children do not keep track oftheir bowel movements. Fatigue may be misinterpreted by adults as laziness. Anxiety, fear, anddepression can cause behaviors that adults could label as oppositional or \"limit-testing\" withoutexploring their underlying etiology. Treating Symptoms An effective symptom management plan will include both pharmacologic and non-pharmaco- logic modalities. Pharmacologic treatment of infants, children, and adolescents entails chal-lenges uncommon in adult medicine. The safety and efficacy of many common medications havenot been established in the youngest age groups. Similarly, pharmacokinetics, dosing levels andintervals are unavailable for many drugs. This is particularly true for patients who fall into thetwo periods of rapid physical growth and maturation: infancy and puberty. Pediatricians often extrapolate information from adult studies, using promising medications in difficult situations and \"guesstimating\" doses. However, adult medications may not be available in formulationsthat young children can swallow or doses that young children can take. Some routes of adminis-tration may be frightening or painful. Pain Managing pain involves identifying and treating any reversible causes of pain (e.g. infectionsresponsive to antibiotic therapy). Specific pain management should complement curative thera-pies until the underlying problem is resolved and no longer causing pain. Many pains, especiallyin advanced disease, will elude clear delineation of etiology or be due to conditions for which there is no effective therapy. In these circumstances, specific pain management is the preemi- nent therapy. (See Chapter 4: Pain.) Within the field of pediatrics, we have experience with non-pharmacologic approaches such as distraction, relaxation, and breathing techniques for procedure-associated pain. Health careproviders treating children and adolescents need to expand and refine the use of these tech-niques for chronic and complex pain syndromes. Providers also need to be comfortable with the use of analgesics (Table 12-5). Having a few basic medicines in our armamentarium will go a long way toward relieving patient pain. Understand- ing their mechanisms of action, dosing options, and potential for synergistic effects, side effectsand toxicities reduces the barrier of provider ignorance and discomfort.

How- ever, parents need reassurance that decreased food intake will not cause death; it is to be ex- pected at the end of life. The body has decreasing nutritional requirements as death approaches. Forcing a child to eat or drink can be uncomfortable at this time, causing choking, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. (See Chapter 5: Constitutional Symptoms.) Fatigue and Sleep Disturbance Promote sleep through adequate symptom control, a peaceful and comfortable environment,and orders not to awaken the child unless he or she is taking around-the-clock pain medication.Move as quickly as possible to long-acting agents. Offer quiet activities. Encourage the child toplay, walk outdoors, and remain awake during the day to promote sleep at night. Stimulantmedication (methylphenidate 0.1-0.5 mg/kg/dose) can be prescribed to promote arousal duringthe day. 1 (See Chapter 5: Constitutional Symptoms.) Skin Care Bathing, moisturizing, and massage all promote skin integrity and prevent skin breakdown.Cushion the child's pressure points and change his or her position frequently to prevent pres- sure sores. (See Chapter 25: Prevention of Skin Breakdown.) Dyspnea Several strategies exist to help relieve the sensation of shortness of breath: humidified air, and as-sistance with ambulation. (See Chapter 6: Pulmonary Symptoms.) Anxiety and Depression The value to a patient of another human presence should not be underestimated. Encourage thepatient to use both verbal and non-verbal avenues for expression. Anxiolytics and antidepressantshave important roles in relieving these symptoms. Drug interactions are common with proteaseinhibitors and NNRTIs so the choice of agent will depend on the child's other current medications.Lorazepam (0.02-0.04mg/kg/dose q 4-6 hours) 1 can generally be used concomitantly with protease inhibitors. However, midazolam is contraindicated. (See Chapter 10: Psychiatric Symptoms.) CARING FOR CHILDREN WITH ADVANCED DISEASE Prognostication: How Do We Know When the End of Life is Near? Accurate prognostication requires knowledge about disease trajectory, the range of individual variation, and the potential impact of therapeutic interventions. Although we know that HIV isultimately a fatal disease, there are wide ranges of severity and survival within the pediatric andadolescent age groups. Declining CD4 counts and clinical complications indicate progressivedisease. In the era prior to HAART, we were able to predict moderately well when a child was approach- ing the end of life. Children experienced recurrent hospitalizations with new and evolving infec- tions and end organ disease. Their recoveries with each exacerbation never returned them to Chpt 12 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 27826 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 12: The Care of Children and Adolescents XII U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 279their precomplication baselines; the progression of disease was like a roller coaster ride with an overall downward slope. Now we are learning all over again. If a child is deteriorating, we must ask ourselves whether we have provided the best primary therapy for his or her disease. Chang- ing HAART regimens and assuring 100% adherence continue to make remarkable improvementsin children and adolescents who have what would otherwise be end-stage disease. Children and adolescents are very resilient. They tolerate many therapies better than adults do. They recover more quickly and completely from injury or surgical interventions. They some-times prove our predictions wrong and recover from complications we predicted would be fatal.On the other hand, children and adolescents sometimes die suddenly, unresponsive to full at-tempts at resuscitation. Health professionals sometimes have difficulty acknowledging how poor a patient's prognosis is. We generally err on the side of optimism, thinking that our patients have much longer to livethan they actually do. Our need to feel that we have \"done everything\" and not \"given up\" ismagnified when working with young people who have only begun their lives. Although provideroptimism feels hopeful and positive, it must not blind us from the work to be done providingexcellent palliative and end of life care. Role of Antiretroviral Therapy in End-of-Life Care The role of antiretroviral therapy in palliative and end-of-life care is not clearly defined. The advent of protease inhibitor combination therapies caused the same dramatic clinical improve-ments in children that were observed in adults with HIV/AIDS. And in younger populations weare seeing the same disappointments when HAART does not achieve complete viral suppres-sion. However, laboratory values do not tell the whole story. We see immunologic benefit in the appar- ent absence of virologic control. We see clinical improvement in the absence of immunologic improvement. Clearly these changes translate into improved quality and longevity of life forpatients with HIV/AIDS. When highly active combination therapies fail to keep a patient feelingwell or cause intolerable pill burden or side effects, they should be discontinued. \"Suboptimal\"regimens can be considered if they offer some slowing of disease progression without undueburden. These regimens would not be considered if decisions were based solely on medicationtreatment history and genotypic analysis. But in palliative care, we have permission to look tothe patient first and offer care that is helpful, even if it is not \"standard\" in the traditional sense. Withholding or Withdrawing Life-Sustaining Therapies A broad range of invasive, high technology therapies are used in pediatrics to support vital functions while a child recovers from injury, surgery, or treatable illness. Interventions such asartificial ventilation play an important role in supporting children with HIV through treatablecrises. However, the use of such therapies should not be automatic, just as they should not beroutinely withheld. The likelihood of benefit must be considered and balanced against the risksand burdens of the intervention. This balance will shift over the course of a child's diseasetrajectory. The values and beliefs of the child and family regarding life, illness, suffering and death form the foundation for their consideration of our medical information and recommendations. Parents and health care providers alike need to know that they have done everything within their power Chpt 12 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 27926 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 12: The Care of Children and Adolescents U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 280to provide the best life possible for the child in their care. We do not and should not \"give up\" on children. But we must keep in mind that regardless of our interventions, HIV is ultimately fatal. When life-sustaining therapies become death-prolonging, we can support families in deciding to forgo or withdraw such therapies, knowing such decisions are a means toward their goal ofproviding the best quality of life possible for their child. Providing Care: Who and Where? Most care for children and adolescents occurs in the home. Home is a familiar place of com- fort where family members come together to love and care for the child. Current practices inpediatric home care and hospice care are based on this foundation. Home care professionals provide in-home assessment and training, permitting parents and other caregiving adults to provide even highly technical and specialized care outside the hospital setting. Accessing home care or hospice services is sometimes difficult depending on the child's health insurance and health status. Many insurance plans require patients to be \"homebound\" to receivehome care services. Yet the health care provider's goal of keeping children active and functioningin a developmentally appropriate way may clash with traditional definitions of \"homebound.\"Advocating that services should be rendered and reimbursed based on need and least restrictivesetting is consistent with pediatric principles of care. Unfortunately the AIDS epidemic has disproportionately hit vulnerable families who may not meet this pediatric ideal. Some children live with parents who also have progressive HIV dis-ease, with resulting weakness, confusion, repeated hospitalizations, and early death. There maybe serial caregivers both short and long term, causing discontinuity in the child's basic care andmedical care. Some children live in substandard housing, some without utilities. However, noneof these conditions is a contraindication to home care if there are caring adults willing andavailable to provide care for the child. Palliative care is generally \"low tech\" and depends moreon \"high touch.\" As long as the child is warm, dry, safe, and comfortable, the other aspects ofcare can be addressed. In situations where there is no reliable adult and no safe place to live, we need to look to resi- dential and inpatient alternatives. These are in particularly short supply for children. There arealmost no pediatric hospices in the United States. Adult hospices are not prepared to acceptpediatric inpatients. Home hospice services vary in their capacity and readiness to provide child-centered services. At a minimum, they need pediatric training and backup to provide pediatric home hospice care. We should look for opportunities for partnership between community-based hospice servicesand children's hospitals or other pediatric specialty and tertiary care facilities to build the capacityto care for these children and adolescents. Health Care Decisions Collaboration with the Family Making good decisions depends on the collaboration of the patient, family, and health care providers. Each person brings unique information and perspective to the choices posed at pointsalong the disease trajectory. Identifying these key individuals and preparing them to participateeffectively is a critical component of palliative care.

Providers should be able to present all of the different options that exist and to articulate the following aspects of each option: \u007f What the patient will have to do \u007f Implications for the patient's daily routine and level of comfort\u007f Any restriction of activities\u007f The \"downside\" of each option such as side effects, need for procedures or hospitalization \u007f The alternatives, including \"doing nothing\" One way to think about this process is to imagine standing at a fork in the road and considering which pathway to take. What is the destination? Do all paths lead to the same or different desti-nations? What good or bad things might be encountered along the way? Will the path be smoothand flat or steep and rocky? What if there is an unanticipated problem, e.g., a landslide blocksthe way, you get a flat tire, the weather turns cold and wet? Can you turn back? Or is there apoint of no return? What is unknown? Providers must have specific knowledge of treatments for specific problems and be able to an- swer questions including the following: \u007f Which medicines can be used to treat this problem? \u007f What are the dose, route and schedule?\u007f What are the side effects and interactions?\u007f Can this problem be treated at home? As an outpatient? As an inpatient?\u007f How long will the treatment last?\u007f How likely is it to work?\u007f How will you know if it worked?\u007f Will the problem recur? \u007f What will happen if no medicine is given? These are considerations for each treatment we offer throughout the course of a patient's dis- ease. Practicing conscious consideration of all the relevant issues from the time of diagnosislays a strong foundation for open consideration of all issues at advanced stages of disease. Whichchoices are made may change over time as the patient's disease progresses. (See Table 12-7:Health Care Decisionmaking: Case Example.) It is critical for the treatment team to discuss all the options and come to consensus prior to presenting information to a patient and family. Hearing conflicting and fragmented information causes distress and confusion for patients and families. As HIV disease progresses, it involves more body systems and therefore more specialists. The burden for organizing the input of mul-tiple specialists and making coherent recommendations falls to the primary health care pro-vider. This burden should not be shouldered by the patient and family. The process of decisionmaking is collaborative. Health care providers need to grapple with which option they think is the best for this particular patient at this particular time, recognizing thatsome patients and families will disagree and choose another option, and some families will look Chpt 12 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 28126 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 12: The Care of Children and Adolescents U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 282to the provider for guidance: \"what would you do in my situation?\" Health care providers are in a powerful position to influence decisions, even unconsciously, by the content of the information they provide and the manner in which it is provided. We must be vigilant to maintain honesty and truthfulness while providing guidance as needed by the patient and family. We should notabdicate our responsibility as the health care experts to provide our best recommendations. Table 12-7: Health Care Decisionmaking: Case Example Situation Mary is a three-year-old with advanced AIDS and her third central line infection. She has candida esophagitis, wasting,diarrhea, neurodevelopmental delay, and cardiomyopathy. Dueto previous difficulty with peripheral and central venous access,her line is currently her only venous access for hydration,antibiotics and parenteral nutrition. Her blood pressure islower than usual and the house staff are preparing to send her to the ICU for pressor support. What are the options? 1. Transfer to the ICU for full support 2. Maintain current level of care 3. Arrange home hospice care Analysis Any of these options might reasonably be considered. Progno- sis and parent-provider collaboration are critical. Option 1 provides the best chance of fighting her presumed sepsis. But it has its own burdens, such as physicaltransfer to a new unit, disconnection from familiarcare personnel, an increased number of invasiveprocedures, and a risk of complications. The benefitis not guaranteed. Option 2 allows her to remain in a familiar care environment, but may not effectively treat her underlying infection. Option 3 provides the opportunity for the child and parents to shift the focus of care to being home together as a family for the precious time she remains living. Including Children in Decisions The ethical tenet of autonomy supports the inclusion of even young children in decisions regard-ing their health care. There is a strong tradition within the field of pediatrics to talk with chil-dren of all ages in a developmentally appropriate way about what is happening. Children areoften excellent sources of information for how they are feeling and what they can and cannottolerate. They are better able to cope with treatments and procedures when prepared and sup-ported for these interventions. The legal age of majority varies from State to State and with the clinical situation. State law may allow minors to seek care for certain conditions, such as sexually transmitted diseases, repro- Chpt 12 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 28226 Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 12: The Care of Children and Adolescents XII U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 283ductive health, prenatal care, substance abuse, and mental health, without parental consent. Some States allow provider discretion regarding notification of a parent about treatment of a minor. Minors cannot consent to experimental treatment or research independently, regardless of their cognitive maturity. The maturity of a particular child or adolescent helps determine the level at which they can participate in their care planning. Just as with physical and emotional development, the devel- oping ability to understand, ask questions, consider future implications is a continuum, not ayes/no switch. Hence it is unnatural to assume that a 15-year-old has no ability to decide whatcare is best for her or him, just as it is unnatural to assume that an 18-year-old no longer needsthe support of family or friends when considering life-threatening issues. Disclosure of HIV Diagnosis to Infected Children and Adolescents It is assumed in our western culture that adult patients with life-threatening conditions havebeen informed of their diagnosis and treatment options, and offered some prognosis. This is nottrue for children and adolescents. Well-meaning adults often try to \"protect\" young people fromthe truth. They believe that sharing this information will take away the child's hope and will tolive. However, decades of experience in the field of pediatrics support the opposite conclusion.Children with cancer diagnoses, the most commonly studied, are better prepared and less anxious if they receive developmentally appropriate information about what is happening to their bodies and why. Providing developmentally appropriate choices and control over interventions improvesa child's ability to cooperate and make choices that best enhance his or her quality of life. Only the patient himself or herself can say what is most important, what hurts, and what helps. This truth holds, regardless of the age of the patient. If we approach all people as unique indi-viduals and communicate in the most effective and appropriate way for them, we will providebetter opportunities for all patients to participate meaningfully in their own care. With young HIV/AIDS patients, anticipating questions early in the disease process allows infor- mation to be shared in stages of increasing complexity and detail (see developmental sectionabove). For most children, information about whether they need blood tests, have to stay in thehospital, or how many medicines they have to take, is most critical. These issues can be dis-cussed in great detail without disclosing the name of the diagnosis. As children's cognitionadvances, more detailed information about what blood tests are or how medicines work be-comes appropriate. Ultimately, describing and naming the child's health condition permits himor her to become a partner in care. The fear of telling is primarily an adult fear. We fear the reaction we might get. We fear the questions we cannot face answering. We fear our own emotional reaction to the disclosure andproject that onto the child. We fear that the secret will be shared with others. Disclosure mayforce us to face the truth when we would rather brush it aside for another day. But childrenshould not be held captive to our fears. Information and inclusion need to be based on thechild's interest and ability to be involved. Information should not be withheld, just as it shouldnot be forced. There are natural opportunities to disclose information to a child. The time of diagnosis is an obvious one. This is the time when health professional and parent are learning the diagnosis. Itmakes sense that the person who owns the diagnosis should learn about it as well. Because thetime of diagnosis can be fraught with so much emotion among the adult family members, it may Chpt 12 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 28326 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 12: The Care of Children and Adolescents U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 284make sense to approach the child in the context of initiating therapy. In this way the diagnosis is discussed in the context of what can be done to control it and at a time when adults have had some time to adjust to the situation. For children whose diagnosis and initial therapy occurred when they were very young, natural opportunities arise when they ask questions about why they take medicine or go to the doctor'soffice more often than their friends do. It is critical at these times that adults tell the truth,including partial truths only if that is all that the adult can provide at the time. For example, itis better to say, \"You need to ask Dr. Smith about that\" than to lie to a child. Children need toknow they can trust the adults in their lives, and this need increases as children enter adolescence. Another natural opportunity to discuss a diagnosis occurs when therapies need to change, espe- cially when they are becoming significantly more complex. Children will naturally be curiousabout why this change is occurring. It is respectful to answer this question honestly in a develop-mentally appropriate way. These natural opportunities are far preferable for discussion of anHIV or AIDS diagnosis to times of crisis, such as hospitalization or admission to the ICU, or theonset of sexual activity. Sometimes providers encounter parents or guardians who refuse to tell their children even as the children enter mid-adolescence. This is clearly beyond the range of \"normal\" secrecy orprotectiveness and requires active intervention by a health care team in order to prevent harmto the adolescent. Awareness of his or her diagnosis is a prerequisite for including the child oradolescent in decisions about his or her care at the end of life. Including Guardians in Decisions Guardianship is where many child and adolescent patients are left in limbo. Many have hadserial caretakers and the current caretaker may lack a sense of the child's life history and val-ues. The guardianship may not be clear or well documented. The guardian may be a governmentagency rather than an individual adult with an investment in the well-being of the child. Providers should take practical steps to determine who should participate in decisionmaking regarding an infected child or adolescent's health care, based upon answers to the followingquestions: \u007f How old is the child? \u007f What is his or her ability to understand the issues at hand?\u007f With whom does he or she live? Who is the responsible adult? (Is it a parent? Is there a responsible adult at all? Is the role shared, or does it shift aroundamong family members?) \u007f Is a parent still living. If so, does she or he have parental rights? Has this parent been involved in the child's life? \u007f Is the adult with whom the child lives a relative? Has that person formally been granted guardianship? The health care provider should ask to have acopy of the court order. \u007f Is the child in foster care? Living with a family? Long-term? In a group home? Usually a foster parent at best has limited guardianship for purposes of enrolling the child in school and seeking routine medical care. The foster care Chpt 12 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 28426 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 12: The Care of Children and Adolescents XII U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 285agency or state government may be the legal guardian. A foster parent who has raised a child may be best suited to be the adult proxy decisionmaker for the child. In that case, petitioning the court to bring the legal documents in line with the human relationship may be the best strategy for the child. \u007f Does the responsible adult with whom the child lives (and/or the guardian) have the competence and capacity to make health care decisions? Many adultswith advanced HIV disease experience complications that diminish theircapacity, such as dementia (memory loss, confusion). Many children have been raised by grandparents or other senior family members. These seniors maynow be facing their own health concerns, which may include dementia. Supportive Care for Children Affected by HIV/AIDS AIDS is a family disease. More than any other, this disease tears at the very fabric of vulner- able families, causing illness and death within and across generations in the same family. All family members, whether infected with HIV or not, are deeply affected by the illness and loss of others. Grandparents may continue to care for surviving grandchildren with evolving social andemotional needs, even while they are themselves aging and encountering personal health prob-lems. As the elder caregiving generation dies, the children left behind experience another waveof losses. (See Chapter 16: Grief and Bereavement and Chapter 20: Care for the Caregiver.) One of the most heart-wrenching situations is a dying mother who cannot ensure that her surviv- ing children will be safe, loved, and cared for. Permanency planning is a crucial but emotionallydifficult responsibility for parents with life-limiting conditions. Care providers should encour-age and support parents to honestly consider the possibility that they may become disabled ordie. There are concrete steps that parents can take to plan for their children's futures. Standby guardianship (see Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues) was created in response to the AIDS epidemic to enable HIV-infected parents to identify another trusted adult to care for minorchildren in the event of temporary or permanent disability or at the time of death. For parentsliving in States with these statutes, this process facilitates seamless transition of legal authorityto care for children at a time of crisis. When planning has not been done, children may be placedin foster care. Siblings may be separated. Placements may change repeatedly. These additionallosses can be catastrophic for children who have just lost a parent. Legacy building can occur when families acknowledge the possibility that life will be shortened. Parents can write letters or leave videotapes for their young children to read and view when they are older. Hand molds can be made, regardless of the age of the dying patient, becoming keep-sakes for those who survive him or her. Photographs, artwork and poetry can be part of a richcache of memories. Creating these legacies can be directly beneficial for the person who isdying and are enormously valuable to those whom he or she leaves behind. Communication Clear and effective communication is a mandatory component of palliative care. It is so inte- gral to excellent care that commenting on it seems to state the obvious. Yet most of the prevent-able distress and anger on the part of patients, families, and care providers can be traced toineffective or nonexistent communication. (See Chapter 21: 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 12: The Care of Children and Adolescents U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 286Communication among care providers must be accurate, timely, and respectful of the interdisci- plinary nature of the care we provide. Challenges to effective interprofessional communication can include the following: \u007f Different care venues \u007f Different work schedules\u007f Different views of a patient's health status\u007f Different views of the options for treatment and care\u007f Different levels of skill in communication\u007f A lack of unified or continuous information systems The benefits of effective team communication among providers include the following: \u007f Greater efficiency \u007f Greater satisfaction\u007f Reduced errors\u007f More complete assessment of the patient\u007f More coordinated treatment\u007f Improved discharge planning Important communication occurs within family units. In optimal situations, these roles and relationships among family members are clear and supportive of providing the best care for the child patient. Unfortunately, there are families in which relationships are rancorous, sometimes erupting into arguments at the child's bedside. In other families, the breadth and depth offamily communication and involvement may be almost invisible to the care team. Asking openlyabout a family's communication, and supporting ongoing communication within families, willfacilitate the best assessment and plan for care for all concerned. Communication with the child patient is discussed earlier in this chapter but needs reiteration. The child is the patient and deserves to be the center of attention. Asking questions, sharing information, and supporting the child's inclusion and involvement in decisionmaking can and should be tailored to the child's developmental and physical capacity as discussed above. Com- munication between the health care team and the child-family team then has the best chancefor success. Impact on Pediatric Health Care Providers This chapter is not complete without acknowledging the deep commitment of pediatric health care professionals to promoting the best care for children and adolescents infected and affected by HIV/AIDS. This work is as deeply rewarding as it is remarkably difficult. If we are to provide the best palliative and end of life care, we must know and understand the paradoxical world inwhich we work. Death remains the exception in the practice of pediatrics. Just as it is unnatural for children to predecease their patients, so it is unnatural for our child patients to die. Although efforts arenow increasing, providers receive little training in how to care for children and families who aredying. This often leaves us feeling incompetent to provide the expert care we know our patientsdeserve.

We have seen dramatic clinical improvements in children with end stage disease who begin HAART therapy. We also see chil- dren and families who simply cannot successfully adhere to these complicated regimens. How far should we go to assure that young patients have had the best available treatment to keepthem healthy? Do we recommend, or insist on, the placement of gastrostomy tubes for medica-tion administration? Do we recommend, or insist on, a child being removed from a mother's carebecause her failure to assure medication adherence is medical neglect? How do our answerschange depending on where the child is on his or her disease and treatment trajectory? When isenough enough, despite sub-optimal social circumstances? How can we as health care providersfeel we have \"done everything\" we should to control our patient's HIV, and still have the time andwherewithal to provide palliative and end-of-life care? We must continue to engage in this struggleto define a path to walk with our patients and their families. REFERENCES 1. World Health Organization. Cancer Pain and Palliative Care in Children .

Carlos Sandoval, MDSpiritual CareChapter 13. INTRODUCTION Illness is a major life event that can cause people to question themselves, their purpose, and their meaning in life. It disrupts their careers, their family life, and their ability to enjoy them-selves; three aspects of life that Freud said were essential to a healthy mind. Illness can causepeople to suffer deeply. Victor Frankl noted when writing about concentration camp victimsthat survival itself might depend on seeking and finding meaning: Man is not destroyed by suffering; he is destroyedby suffering without meaning. 1 Palliative care has long recognized that, in addition to physical and psychological symptoms,patients with advanced illness will suffer existential distress as well. Existential distress is prob-ably the least understood source of suffering in patients with advanced disease, for it deals withquestions regarding the meaning of life, the fear of death, and the realization that they will beseparated from their loved ones. 2 These issues take on greater importance in HIV/AIDS because of the stigma and judgment that still accompany people living with this disease.In our own clinical experience, we have found that people cope with their suffering by findingmeaning in it. Spirituality plays a critical role, because the relationship with a transcendent beingor concept can give meaning and purpose to people's lives, to their joys and to their sufferings.A number of surveys and studies demonstrate the importance of considering spirituality in thehealth care of patients and document the relationship between patients' religious and spirituallives and their experiences of illness and disease. 3, 4 These findings are particularly relevant in the delivery of palliative care.5, 6 From the very early years of the modern hospice movement, spiritual aspects of health, illness, and suffering have been emphasized as core aspects of care.Several studies support the relevance of spirituality in the care of seriously ill patients.A 1997 Gallup survey showed that people overwhelmingly want their spiritual needs addressedwhen they are close to death. In its preface, George H. Gallup, Jr., wrote, \"The overarchingmessage that emerges from this study is that the American people want to reclaim and reassertthe spiritual dimensions in dying.\" 7 Other studies have found spirituality to be an important factor in coping with pain, in dying, and in bereavement.8, 9 Patients with advanced cancer who found comfort from their spiritual beliefs were, for example, more satisfied with their lives, werehappier, and had diminished pain compared with those without spiritual beliefs. 10 An American Pain Society survey found that prayer was the second most common method of pain managementafter oral pain medications, and the most common non-drug method of pain management. 11 Chpt 13 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 28926 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 13: Spiritual Care U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 290Quality of life instruments used in end of life care measures often include an existential domain which measures purpose, meaning in life, and capacity for self-transcendence. Three items were found to correlate with good quality of life for patients with advanced disease: \u007f If the patient's personal existence is meaningful \u007f If the patient finds fulfillment in achieving life goals\u007f If life to this point has been meaningful 12 In HIV, patients struggle with existential crises as do other patients with chronic illness. How- ever, the social stigma of the illness may affect how patients view their illness, particularly for those patients who are religious. In a study of patients with HIV, those who were spirituallyactive had less fear of death and less guilt about their illness. Fear of death was more likely among the 26% of religious patients in this study who felt their illness was a punishment from God. Fear of death diminished among patients who had regular spiritual practices or who statedthat God was central to their lives. 13 WHAT IS SPIRITUALITY? In a study of spirituality among the terminally ill, Reed asserted, \"Spirituality is defined in terms of personal views and behaviors that express a sense of relatedness to a transcendentdimension or to something greater than self.\" 14 Another, more clinical, definition is: Spirituality is recognized as a factor that contributes to health in many persons. The concept of spirituality is found in all cultures andsocieties. It is expressed in an individual's search for ultimatemeaning through participation in religion and/or belief in God,family, naturalism, rationalism, humanism, and the arts. All of thesefactors can influence how patients and health care professionalsperceive health and illness and how they interact with one another! 15 How people find meaning and purpose in life and in the midst of suffering varies. Whatever formspirituality takes, its active practice can help patients cope with the uncertainty of their illness,instill hope, bring comfort and support from others, and bring resolution to existential con-cerns, particularly the fear of death. It is important that the palliative care team accepts andhonors all approaches to existential concerns. This requires open-mindedness, cultural sensitiv-ity, and a willingness to learn from the life experiences of others. For many, these existential questions are mainly expressed in a formal religion by belief in a deity, the theology of the religion, the concept of an afterlife, and the rituals and practices of the religion used to express those beliefs. Many religions have a rich tradition and experience in giving meaning to the cause of suffering and in restructuring suffering into a positive experi-ence. Addressing the role of religion in medicine in the first decade of the last century, WilliamOsler wrote: Nothing in life is more wonderful than faith, the one great moving force which we can neither weigh in the balance nor test in thecrucible. Intangible as the ether, ineluctable as gravitation, the radium of the moral and mental spheres, mysterious, indefinable, known only by its effects, faith pours out an unfailing stream ofenergy while abating nor jot nor tittle of Chpt 13 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 29026 Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 13: Spiritual Care XIII U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 291Osler concluded that not only did faith have important effects on health outcomes but that practitioners should seek to encourage and incorporate faith as part of clinical care. By definition, palliative care focuses on aspects of treatment that are not intended to achieve cure. Much of medical training has to do with finding a cure or fixing a problem. In chronicillness and end-of-life care, this may no longer be possible. The oft-quoted phrase \"there is noth-ing more I can do for you\" comes out of that medical \"fixer\" model. In fact, there is a lot we cando for our patients, and it is also our obligation as physicians \"to continue to care for patientseven when disease-specific therapy is no longer available or desired.\" 17 This is where spiritual care becomes so critical. It allows us to care for our patients even when cure is not possible. The basis, then, of spiritual care is compassion\u2014being present to our patients in the midst of their suffering. By being present and caring for our patients, we connect to them as individu-als. That interconnectedness at the level of our humanity helps to provide hope and comfortto our patients. By discussing issues of suffering, spiritual values, and conflict with our pa-tients, we provide them the opportunity to find a sense of resolution and perhaps peaceful-ness; we help them heal. At its core, palliative care recognizes that healing can occur evenwhen cure or recovery is impossible. Although illness may disrupt a person's life, it can alsooffer a person the opportunity to see life in a different way. Many people with serious andterminal illness talk of seeing a richness and fullness in life that they had never seen before. Some people find new priorities in their life and new appreciation for aspects of their life that they never noticed before. In dying, for example, healing or restoration of wholeness may be manifested by a transcendent set of meaningful experiences while very ill and a peaceful death. In chronic illness, healing maybe experienced as the acceptance of limitations. 18 A person may look to medical care to alleviate his or her suffering, and, when the medical system fails to do so, begin to look toward spiritualityfor meaning, purpose, and understanding. It is the combination of both good clinical-technicalcare and good spiritual care that can provide the best chance for healing at any stage of illness. SPIRITUAL CARE It is important to include a spiritual assessment or history as part of the overall clinical assessment of a patient. Doing so enables the provider to assess spiritual needs and resources,mobilize appropriate spiritual care, and enhance overall caregiving. Spiritual assessment hasbeen included in coursework on spirituality and medicine 19 and is performed by many practicing clinicians in the U.S. The acronym FICA\u2014for faith and belief, importance, community, and address in care\u2014can be helpful for structuring an interview regarding a patient's spiritual views.

A compassionate spiritual assessment helps to integrate spiritual concerns into therapeutic plans. Clinicians should strive to discuss these concerns in a respectful manner and as di- rected by the patient. Providers should always respect patients' privacy regarding matters of spirituality and religion and must be vigilant to avoid imposing their own beliefs. Providerscan encourage religious and spiritual practices with their patients if these practices are al-ready part of the patient's belief system. However, a nonreligious patient should not be told toengage in worship any more than a highly religious patient should be criticized for frequentchurch attendance. 20, 21 Patients may ask health care providers to pray with them. It is appropriate to allow a moment ofsilence or a prayer. Not respecting such a request may leave the patient with a sense of abandon- ment. If the provider feels conflicted about praying with patients, he or she need only stand by quietly as the patient prays in his or her own tradition. Chpt 13 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 29226 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 13: Spiritual Care XIII U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 293Once a spiritual assessment has been made, then the appropriate spiritual intervention should be offered. While spiritual and religious interventions can be provided by any clinician, integrat- ing a pastoral care provider in the health care team will ensure that the team becomes familiar with religious and spiritual issues and that patient's spiritual needs are met. Some examples ofspiritual practices are meditation, guided imagery, art, journaling, spiritual direction, pastoralcounseling, yoga, religious ritual and prayer. Appropriate referrals to chaplains and other pastoral care providers are as important to good healthcare practice as are referrals to other specialists. It has been argued that discussionswith patients about spiritual matters should be initiated solely by chaplains. 21 Others recognize that healthcare providers can use spiritual histories as a screening tool to understand the role that a patient's beliefs play in his or her health and illness. Some patients may have compli- cated ethical and spiritual issues. Providers need not feel that they must solve these dilemmas;most physicians are not trained to deal with complex spiritual crises and conflicts. Chaplainsand other spiritual caregivers are, and often work with physicians in the care of patients. It is important that healthcare providers be aware of their own values, beliefs, and attitudes, particularly toward their own mortality. A spiritual perspective on care recognizes that the clini-cian-patient relationship is ultimately a relationship between two human beings. Confrontingpersonal mortality enables a provider to better understand and empathize with what the patient is facing, to better handle the stress of working with seriously ill and dying people, and to form deeper and more meaningful connections with the patient. PASTORAL CARE The Role of the Chaplain In recent years the chaplain has become an increasingly important member of the healthcare team. Traditionally, the role of the chaplain has been to administer to the patient certain prayers and rites particular to the patient's religion. Today the role of a chaplain is often much broader. The chaplain can act as an extension of the patient's personal and community support system,as well as be a source of spiritual support for the patient. When the chaplain has a regularpresence in a healthcare setting, the opportunity exists to provide support to the staff as well.William Hulme, a Christian minister and author, defines pastoral care as the following: Pastoral care is a supportive ministry to people and those close to them who are experiencing the familiar trials that characterize the world,such as illness, surgery , incapacitation, death and bereavement. 22 It is the spiritual aspect of human nature that raises questions about ultimate meaning andpurpose, questions for which medicine and science have no answers. These issues require a unique language in which symbolism, story, and ritual are often involved. Chaplains have exper- tise in this form of communication and are often best able to answer such questions. Some of these questions and concerns might be stated in the language of faith or religion. Here the patient might invoke God, and in this instance statements of faith would be used to deal withthe questions. At other times, questions dealing with the purpose of one's life might be moreappropriately answered in existential terms. The chaplain can deal with these issues in terms ofhow the world works, spirituality, and what we consider the essence or meaning of life. 23 Chpt 13 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 29326 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 13: Spiritual Care U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 294The main goal of a chaplain is to support the patient and to be present for him or her emotion- ally. This is what is called a ministry of presence, which is centered on a caring acceptance, a nonjudgmental stance, and physical and emotional availability. It is important that the chaplain give the patient complete autonomy in the relationship. To this end, the health care providershould be familiar with the capabilities, attitudes, and philosophy of a chaplain or spiritualpractitioner before making a referral\u2014not all religious practitioners are capable of allowingautonomy and respecting divergent points of view. A chaplain certified in clinical pastoral edu-cation (CPE) is a good referral. CPE-certified chaplains have been trained to address the spiri-tual issues presented in a clinical setting. Chaplains are not necessarily clergy, although theycan be, but all CPE-certified chaplains know how to work with patients with different religiousor spiritual beliefs. These chaplains can also work with atheists and agnostics. More information about chaplains can be obtained from the following organizations: \u007f National Association of Catholic Chaplains, 3501 South PO Box 07473, Milwaukee, WI www.nacc.org \u007f Association of Professional Chaplains, E. Woodfield Road, Suite 311, Schaumburg, IL 60173, www.professionalchaplains.org Dying patients have no control in the progress of their illness, and enabling them to have control in the relationship is especially important. 23 Pastoral Care Models Health practitioners working in hospitals and other institutions should be familiar with mod- els of pastoral care. There are basically two approaches: denominational and one for all . In the denominational model, the chaplain of a specific religious denomination or faith serves all thepatients of his or her faith or denomination. Though this is the more prevalent and traditionalmodel, a disadvantage is that it is logistically difficult for the chaplain to be integrated into the treatment team. In the one-for-all model, a chaplain is designated to one or more specific units in the clinical setting, becoming part of the treatment team and providing pastoral care for allpatients and staff on the assigned unit. The disadvantage of the one-for-all model is that thechaplain may not be able to meet the specific needs of all denominations or faiths. Many institu-tions provide a mixture of these two systems as a way of offering a continual integrated presenceand meeting specific denominational needs. 23 Religious Counseling For patients who are not religious, there are many nontraditional forms of spiritual expres- sion that the pastoral care provider can offer or that the patient may already practice. These will help the patient have a sense of meaning and connectedness with the surrounding world and include the practice of meditation or guided imagery, journaling and the reading and writing ofpoetry, and other creative arts such as music and gardening. For religious patients, one of the services that chaplains can provide is religious counseling. This is defined as the explicit interaction between the chaplain and the faith system of thepatient and family members. It consists of four main tasks: assessment, emotional faith support,intellectual faith support, and interpretation. 23 Chpt 13 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 29426 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 13: Spiritual Care XIII U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 295Assessment Assessment is necessary to learn about a patient's beliefs. If the patient is religious, it is helpful to ascertain if the individual believes in God or a higher power and to gain their unique perspec-tives. Some people primarily see God as a doer, a God of action who creates, destroys, heals,inflicts, etc. Other people see God as a supporter, one who although capable of doing things, isprimarily involved in making sure we get by. The patient's perception of his or her disease,suffering, and death can be significantly influenced by these beliefs. If the patient is not religious, it is important to find out about other spiritual beliefs and prac- tices. In either case, religious or spiritual, what may ultimately give a patient a sense of meaningand purpose may be within the context of the particular identified beliefs or outside of thatcontext. Patients may talk of career, relationships, pets, or other aspects of their lives. Connec- tions to a community, religious or otherwise, may be important to patients. The assessment should, therefore, enable the chaplain to ascertain the parts of the patient's belief system thatare supportive, as well as those that may hinder the patient's coping ability. 23 In a hospital or hospice setting, there are CPE-certified chaplains who know how to facilitate the ongoing con-nection with patients' religious communities. Emotional Faith Support The chaplain's role also includes supporting the patient's faith system as it is, helping to strengthen it, and helping the patient deal with the emotions related to issues of faith. Here the chaplain tries to reinforce the positive aspects of the faith system by accepting and affirming them butalso by clarifying them. A patient who is having doubts in his or her faith as a result of the crisishe or she is in needs to be reassured that these doubts are normal and not to be feared. Patientsneed to feel that there is hope, if not for physical healing, then certainly to know that they willnot be abandoned, will be able to bear their sufferings, and will always be cared for and loved bytheir caregivers and the community. In summary, emotional faith support is not intended to change the patient's faith system but to help the patient maximize the support it provides. 24 Intellectual Faith Support Intellectual faith support involves changing the patient's faith system or refocusing on its posi-tive aspects rather than simply supporting it. This is a cognitive process in which both the pa-tient and the chaplain work together to change parts of the patient's faith system that bothagree are not helpful. Interpretation The final part of the religious counseling is the interpretive function of the chaplain. This in-volves representing the faith issues and systems of patients to the staff, so that better communi-cation can be achieved and proper medical care can be administered, while at the same timerespecting the traditions and beliefs of the patients. The medical staff may also want informa-tion on certain religious beliefs and customs that are foreign to them, such as the beliefs ofJehovah's Witnesses about receiving blood, or the beliefs of Santer\u00eda, an increasingly prevalent Chpt 13 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:19 AM 29526 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 13: Spiritual Care U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 296religion in Southeast Florida. The chaplain can also become a mediator between patients and staff when misunderstandings concerning faith questions occur. It is important that the chap- lain have some knowledge of psychology, so that his interpretive function can be spoken in both the language of religion and the language of psychology. The chaplain will then become theliaison between the arena of faith and the arena of science. 23 RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL RITUALS Every faith or cultural tradition is rich with practices and rituals that are of great support to the believer, particularly in moments of crisis. The most common religious ritual is prayer. Manypatients have set times in the day when they pray and are helped by having this practice in-cluded in their care plans so that the ritual is facilitated. It is entirely appropriate (and should be encouraged) to invite caregivers who would like to pray with their patients to do so, if the patients agree to it. Prayers need not be formal. Theycan be a single thought or a wish that the patient and caregiver have been talking about. Itmay be a simple blessing or simply the silent presence of the caregiver while the patientarticulates the prayer. Along with prayer, the reading of texts sacred of the patient's spiritual tradition can be of great support. This too should be included in the care plans so that the patient has time set aside forthis reading. When a patient is too infirm to read texts on his or her own, a caregiver can offer toread to the patient from the selected texts. Both prayer and reading serve as effective methods of relaxation. There are also many rituals that patients may find comfort in from their own cultures, and some families and patients haverituals they have created themselves. Other rituals can be provided either by the chaplain or by the patient's spiritual or cultural leader. It is important that there be good communication between chaplaincy services and thepatient's community in order to help the patient remain connected with his or her community. 25 Religious and cultural beliefs may impact practical decisions as well. For example, diet may bean important aspect of a patient's religious observances. Many hospitals make provisions to meet these special dietary needs as long as the patient's health is not compromised. Some reli- gions recommend that articles of clothing be worn in the hospital or offer ways to prepare thebodies of the deceased once death occurs. Chaplains are good resources to find out this informa-tion, as is a resource booklet prepared by The University of Virginia Health Sciences Center. 26 Whatever form it takes, the active practice of spirituality can bring resolution to existentialconcerns, particularly the fear of death.

Spirituality is that aspect of all human beings thatseeks to find meaning in life and, hence, it is a way that people heal. All care providers (doctors, nurses, chaplains, social workers, therapists, family, faith communi- ties) can participate in the spiritual dimension of a patient's life. Each professional is trained todeal with spiritual issues in a different way. The interdisciplinary model of palliative care thatincludes spiritual support is intended to ensure that patients receive the best care and opportu-nity for healing possible in a compassionate, caring health care system.

INTRODUCTION What is culture? Culture refers to learned patterns of behaviors, beliefs and values shared by individuals in a particular social group. It provides human beings with both their identity and aframework for understanding experience. 1 When we refer to culture in its broadest sense, we usually think about a group of people with similar ethnic background, language, religion, familyvalues, and life views.Culture and nationality, however, are not synonymous. The United States, for example, is a coun-try made up of individuals from many countries and traditions, each with a unique culture. Formany years we have viewed this country as the great \"melting pot\" of the world; however thisvision is being rejected. 2 The truth is that the U.S. is a multicultural or pluralistic society, made up of members of different ethnic, racial, religious or social groups, living side by side, sharingaspects of the dominant U.S. culture, but maintaining their own values and traditions.Since culture provides individuals with a framework for understanding experience, it is of greatimportance to consider culture in the medical setting. Each cultural group has its own viewsabout health, illness, and health care practices. 3 These views affect how individuals respond to illnesses and their symptoms, including pain; identify and select medical care; and comply withprescribed care. 4, 5, 6 In his acclaimed book, How We Die, S.B. Nuland said There has never been a disease so devastating as AIDS. Medical sci-ence has never before confronted a microbe that destroys the verycells of the immune system whose job it is to coordinate the body'sresistance to it. 7 As the HIV epidemic enters its third decade, rates of infection continue to rise in much of theworld and in certain minority communities in the U.S. While HIV has only recently ceased to bethe leading cause of death for persons between 25 and 44 in the U.S., 8 this is not the case in many parts of the developing world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. In the U.S., HIV is rapidly becom-ing a disease of minorities, particularly African Americans and Hispanics.Considering the impact of culture is very important in managing HIV disease. Today, as earlier inthe epidemic, a diagnosis of HIV infection or AIDS is universally feared. The consequences ofHIV are well known and they are usually associated with increasing debilitation and suffering asthe disease progresses. In addition, HIV often has psychosocial consequences for the patientand can lead to subtle or overt discrimination, abandonment by family and peers, loss of employ-ment and other negative consequences. In spite of the advances in medical management of HIV, Chpt 14 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 30126 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 14: Culture and Care U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 302it remains an incurable condition. Often, the diagnosis brings to the forefront issues such as homosexuality or substance abuse, which many patients have concealed from their loved ones. How patients confront these issues is affected by their culture. Therefore, if we are to provide appropriate and effective palliative care for persons with HIV/AIDS it is important that we havean understanding of the cultural context within which such care will be provided. It is beyondthe scope of this chapter to cover all or even any culture in the U.S. in depth. The intent offocusing on Hispanic and African American cultures is, rather, to increase familiarity with someimportant aspects of these cultures as well as to exemplify the importance that cultural vari-ables can play in the delivery of palliative care. HISPANIC CULTURAL VALUES AND HIV DISEASE In 1990, the Census Bureau reported that there were about 22 million Hispanic Americans in the U.S., comprising about 9% of the total population. In the subsequent decade, the Hispanicpopulation grew an estimated 58% to represent about 31 million of the country's residents. His-panics will soon surpass African Americans as the largest minority group in the country. The first point that must be considered when referring to Hispanics is that the term is a label of convenience for a cultural group with a common cultural heritage stemming from Spain's colo-nization of the Americas. 9 Hispanics can be of any racial group (e.g., indigenous American, Ne- groid, Asian, Caucasian, or of multiple racial ancestry). Hispanics include several subgroups, each with important social and cultural differences. The major Hispanic subgroups in the UnitedStates traditionally have been Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans and Cubans. However, thedramatic increase in Hispanics observed in the 2000 census was fueled primarily by immigrationfrom Central and South America. There are some differences among Hispanic subgroups, related to country of origin, that country's racial/ethnic makeup, different histories of immigration to this country, or, as in the case of Puerto Rico, the population's experience with colonization. 10 However, these subgroups share a common language, religion, traditional family structure, and several common Hispanic values.Incidentally, Brazilians, a product of Portugal's colonization in the Americas, speak Portuguese,and are therefore not Hispanic; however, they too are emigrating to the U.S. in significant numbersand share many family values and cultural, racial, and religious characteristics with Hispanics. In addition to differences in subgroups, Hispanics in the U.S. also differ in terms of their level of acculturation or assimilation into mainstream culture. Language use is one very good exampleof these differences. For instance, while many Hispanics in the United States are bilingual, the degree to which they speak either Spanish or English varies considerably. It can range from virtually no English in recent immigrants and many of the elderly, to full bilingualism in accul-turated Hispanics, to very limited Spanish in second and third generation Hispanics. These pat-terns are observed across different Hispanic cultures. One value shared by most Hispanics is their religion. Although individuals' degree of practice and church participation varies, the majority of Hispanics are Christian, predominantly RomanCatholic. 11 However, many Hispanics practice other religious beliefs that they have incorporated into their Christianity, such as forms of ancestor worship with rituals dating back to pre-Columbian times in Central American Indians. Many Caribbean Hispanics practice Santer\u00eda, a syncretism of Catholicism and the Yoruba religion brought to Cuba by African slaves.12 Hispanic religious/ spiritual beliefs include views on dying and death. For example, it is common to hold a contin- Chpt 14 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 30226 Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 14: Culture and Care XIV U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 303ued vigil over an older family member with a terminal illness. After death, it is common practice to offer daily masses or light candles in honor of the deceased.13 These and other practices honor the loved one and form part of the bereavement ritual. Family plays a very strong role for most Hispanics, with ties that exist within an extended net- work of uncles, aunts, cousins, grandparents, and family friends.14 Included in the important role the family plays is the concept of familismo , emphasis of the family welfare over that of the individual. In addition to language, religion and family, there are five more cultural themes that influence Hispanic culture. These are the following: \u007f Personalismo: Trust building over time based on the display of mutual respect. \u007f Jerarquismo: Respect for hierarchy. \u007f Presentismo: Emphasis on the present, not the past or the future.15 \u007f Espiritismo: Belief in good and evil spirits that can affect health and well-being. \u007f Fatalismo: The belief that fate determines life outcomes, including health, and that fate isbasically unbeatable. 16 An example of the importance of understanding the interaction between Hispanic culture andHIV disease is the impact of cultural values upon beliefs and norms around homosexuality. Thisis an important issue because the majority of HIV and AIDS cases among Hispanics are men whohave sex with men. 17 Rafael Diaz, in his book Latino Gay Men and HIV , identified several cul- tural barriers or competing factors that will have a direct impact on gay and bisexual Hispanicmen with HIV/AIDS. Among them we have familismo , poverty, and racism. 18 While familismo leads Hispanics to care and support family members, it can become a source of conflict, isola- tion and abandonment, if homosexuality is perceived as immoral or shameful.18 Furthermore, the marginalization caused by poverty and racism will lead Hispanics to self-perceptions of pow-erlessness, and this, coupled with fatalism, will prevent many from seeking adequate medicalcare. End-of-Life Care Preferences How do Hispanic values, beliefs and practices influence end-of-life preferences? While re- search is limited, we will review the following: patient autonomy, advance directives, life-pro-longing treatments, and the role of hospice. It must be noted, however, that these studies reflectend of life issues in general, not specifically related to HIV/AIDS. The stigmatic nature of thisillness cannot be overlooked, and would have a direct impact on some patient preferences. Patient Autonomy In a study in Los Angeles comparing Mexican, Korean, African, and European Americans onseveral issues relating to patient autonomy, researchers found that Mexican and Korean Ameri-cans were less likely to believe that a patient should be told about a terminal diagnosis or make Chpt 14 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 30326 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 14: Culture and Care U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 304decisions about using life support. Instead, the researchers found that Mexican and Korean American elders were more likely than African and European American elders to want family members to make these decisions.19 This study also found differences among Mexican Americans by income, degree of accultura- tion, and age; that is, younger and more acculturated respondents and those with higher in-comes were more likely to favor truth-telling about the diagnosis. 19 In a series of focus groups exploring general medical treatment decisions with a random sample of 50 Mexican Americanelders in San Antonio, Talamantes and Gomez found that 46% of the elders wanted their doctorto make these decisions, 24% would prefer to make their own decisions, and 18% would discussthe decision with their families. When asked whether it bothered them to talk with their fami-lies about these issues, 84% said that it did not. 20 Advance Directives The aforementioned Los Angeles study on patient autonomy among Mexican, Korean, Africanand European Americans also compared knowledge on completion of advance directives. Theyfound that while Mexican and European Americans were significantly more knowledgeable thanKorean and African Americans on advance directives, only 22% of the Mexican Americans actu-ally possessed advance directives, in comparison to 40% of the European Americans. They alsofound that the Mexican Americans who had advance directives were more highly acculturatedthan the ones who did not. 21 Three years earlier, at the University of Miami in Florida, Caralis, Davis, Wright, and Marcial had conducted a multicultural study examining the influence of ethnicity on attitudes toward advance directives, life-prolonging treatments and euthanasia.Regarding advance directives, the researchers found that Hispanic Americans, the majority be-ing of Cuban heritage, were less knowledgeable than African and non-Hispanic white Americansregarding living wills. 22 Life-Prolonging Treatments When it came to the issue of life-prolonging treatments at the end of life, Caralis, et al. foundthat Hispanic and African Americans were more likely than non-Hispanic whites to report want-ing their doctors to keep them alive regardless of how ill they were (42% and 37% vs. 14%, respec- tively). Furthermore, only 59% of Hispanics and 63% of African Americans agreed to stop life- prolonging treatment, compared to 89% of non-Hispanic whites. 22 This disparity may have been due partly to the Bible commandment \"Thou shalt not kill;\" a religious Christian might interpretwithdrawing or withholding treatment as an infraction of this commandment. Hospice A few studies have suggested that Hispanics are low users of hospice services. This may be dueto unfamiliarity with hospice, insurance coverage issues, language barriers, unpleasant experi-ences with or distrust of the health care system. 23 In addition, Wallace and Lew-Ting proposed that the low utilization of hospice among Hispanics may be due to physician referral patterns; that is, a physician might not refer Hispanic patients to hospice because they observe families providing care themselves and believe that hospice might be unnecessary or culturally inappro-priate. 24 Chpt 14 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 30426 Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 14: Culture and Care XIV U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 305Interventions Taking into account Hispanic core values, aforementioned barriers, and end-of-life prefer- ences, what can the health care provider do to improve palliative care for the Hispanic client?First, it is important that health care professionals increase their knowledge about Hispanicculture, by becoming familiar with the history of the subgroups they are dealing with, along withthe family, social, and religious values associated with Hispanic culture. This as well as learningto speak Spanish will help providers display respect and build trust. 10 Second, the provider should include family members in discussions with the patient regardingpalliative care. Needless to say, there may be situations in which the patient may not desire tohave the family included, and this, of course, should be respected. 15 Finally, it is important to have open and clear communication with the patient and family, sincedeference and respect to the provider due to jerarquismo may lead the Hispanic patient to withhold information or hesitate to communicate honestly. The provider must ascertain whetherthe patient understands the treatment being offered, and whether he or she fully agrees withthe treatment plan. 25 This is particularly important when it comes to end of life decisionmaking and advance directives, as research indicates that there are several factors that discouragediscussions on these topics. 22, 23, 19 Jerarquismo may lead the patient and family to have unreal- istic expectations as to what conventional treatment can offer. The family may be expecting amiracle cure for the terminally ill patient, and thus may refuse to consider palliative care treat- ment options. Further, perceived conflicts between the patient's religion and withdrawing or withholding of treatment may be addressed and clarified by including a clergy member indecisionmaking. The role of community education cannot be overstated, particularly when one considers the degree of marginalization many Hispanics face due to language, racism and other socio-eco-nomic barriers, including legal status. Education should be provided directly by the health careteam because of the value placed on personalismo , and the target audience should include the entire community: patients, families, and community leaders, including clergy. The provider can share with the Hispanic community not only general information about HIV/AIDS, but also infor- mation about end-of-life issues, palliative care and the role of hospice. Education can also beenhanced by identifying members of the community living with HIV/AIDS to serve as role mod-els to share their own experiences with the illness. The provider should not rely on brochuresalone for education, since the language used in many brochures may be above the reading levelof many Hispanics, may only exist in English, or may be poorly translated. 26 Chpt 14 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 30526 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 14: Culture and Care U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 306Table 14-1 presents a framework of issues to be considered with regard to Hispanic patients and palliative care.15, 27 Table 14-1: Hispanic Cultural Themes That Can Influence Palliative Care Source: Adapted from references 15 and 27.Theme for Provider Meaning Implication Emphasis on the well-being of the family over the individual Patient isolation due to family homophobia Trust-building over time, based on the displayof mutual respect Respect for authority Patient and families may have unrealistic treatment expectations Emphasis on the present, not on the past or the future Belief in good and evil spirits that can affect health and well-being Fate determines life outcomes, including health, and is unbeatableInclude family members in health care and end-of-life discussions Learn about patients and their culture Personal and open communication Check whether patient is withholding information out of deference to provider Patient and families may avoid end-of-life discussions and advance directives Patients may seek spiritual healers such as curanderos , instead of standard treatment Patients may be Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 14: Culture and Care XIV U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 307AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE AND HIV DISEASE In 2000, the population of the U.S. was approximately 281 million, of which 35 million were African Americans. They are the largest minority group in the U.S. While the term African Ameri-can refers to a racial group, like Hispanics, they are heterogeneous and are comprised of severalsubgroups. Most African Americans are the descendants of slaves and were part of the U.S.population even before this country's independence from England. Some are immigrants fromother places in the Americas, particularly the West Indies. More recently, there has been aninflux of immigrants from the African continent. To one degree or another, African Americansshare a legacy of slavery, segregation, and discrimination, and like most minorities, they experi-ence a high degree of unemployment and overall poverty. 28 These challenges are reflected in a lower life expectancy and higher death rate for AfricanAmericans. In a 1996 CDC report, the 1993 age-adjusted death rates for African Americans werehigher than those for the Caucasian population for all causes of death combined and for eight ofthe 10 leading causes of death. Life expectancy for African American males was 8.5 years lessthan that for Caucasian males; this difference is attributed to higher death rates for homicide,heart disease, cancer, HIV/AIDS and perinatal conditions. 29 The life expectancy for African American females was 5.8 years less than that for Caucasian females for similar conditions. Andwhile African Americans only represent 13% of the American population, the number and pro-portion of annual AIDS cases reported among African Americans exceeded that among whites.The CDC HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report for 2000 reported 13,218 new cases of AIDS in African American males, versus 11,466 in non-Hispanic Caucasians and 6,285 in Hispanics. 17 African American Core Values Despite a long history of adversity, African Americans have remained strongly bound together by the importance they place on family, which they view as an extended network of kin andcommunity, 30 and a series of core values described by Sudarkasa as the Seven Rs ,31 defined as follows: \u007f Respect: The respect of others from parents and relatives to elders or leaders in the community. \u007f Responsibility: Being accountable for self and for those less fortunate in one's own extended family and even one's community. \u007f Reciprocity: Giving back to family and community in return for whathas been given to one (mutual assistance). \u007f Restraint: Giving due consideration to the family or community/groupwhen making decisions. \u007f Reverence: Deep awe and respect firstly toward God, toward ancestors, and toward many things in nature.

The Role of Religion Religion is another core value among African Americans, just as it is among Hispanics. His- torically, the church has been the center of the African American community serving as thesingle most important institution advocating improvements in health, education, and financialwelfare: 32 As the center for the extended family, reinforcing the sense of self andself-esteem within the culture, the church offers opportunities for thewhole family's development. 33 While the majority of African Americans are Protestant Christians, a large proportion beingBaptist, some are Roman Catholic. 34 Certain African American subgroups, however, such as those from Haiti, have beliefs in voodoo, hexes, curses, which will also have a direct effect on health care views and practices. The history of deportation from the African continent, slavery and oppression in the new world, coupled with their Christian heritage, have determined how Afri-can Americans view end of life decisions. Many believe in the God of the Old Testament, an all-powerful and fighting God, who liberated the Hebrews from the oppression of the Egyptians, andwho liberated African Americans from slavery. From this comes the notion of divine rescue and thus the belief that God's power can conquer all and that miraculous interventions can occurwhen all hope seems lost. 35 The notion of divine intervention and rescue might influence pa- tients to oppose continuing aggressive medical treatment, in order to allow \"God's will\" to bedone. 36 End-of-Life Care Preferences How does the African American experience influence end-of-life care preferences? Research findings indicate that African Americans are less likely than other groups to trust health careproviders, communicate treatment preferences, complete advance directives, and withhold/with-draw life-prolonging treatments in the face of futility. Issues of Trust The long history of past and even current discrimination has led African Americans to displaydistrust in the institutions established by the dominant Caucasian society, including those insti-tutions that provide health care. This institutional distrust is not without foundation, as thereare several studies which document minorities' lack of access to available health care. Studieshave suggested that certain procedures such as coronary bypass operations and organ trans-plants have been performed less frequently on African Americans than on Caucasian Ameri-cans. 37 A study documented lower survival rates in African Americans with Stage I lung cancer, the second most common cause of death among African Americans, and suggested that this was Chpt 14 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 30826 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 14: Culture and Care XIV U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 309in part due to lower referral rates for African Americans for potentially curative surgical proce- dures as compared to Caucasian Americans.38, 39 Some authors have suggested that these differences are due to discriminatory practices thathave led African Americans not to trust Caucasians or their social institutions. 40 The 40-year-old Tuskegee Syphilis Study, in which the U.S. Public Health Service lied to and denied standardtreatment to 400 poor African American sharecroppers, is a reminder of why African Americansfeel they cannot trust the health care system. In fact, one recent study of 520 African Americanmales sampled door-to-door showed that 27% believed that HIV/AIDS was a government con-spiracy against black people. 41 Discriminatory practices also extend to pain management. In studies in various medical settings,such as emergency rooms 42, 43 and cancer centers,44, 45 pain severity was more likely to be underestimated and effective analgesia less likely to be prescribed for African Americansand Hispanics than for Caucasian Americans. These and other studies clearly document a racialbias on the part of medical care providers. Thus the distrust demonstrated by African Americansis warranted, as subtle discrimination continues. 46 In addition, the studies document that the medical care received by minorities is less than optimal, which has led to AfricanAmerican distrust of health care institutions and has affected how African Americans viewend of life care. Communication of Treatment Preferences The same distrust appears to have inhibited many African Americans from effectively communi-cating end of life decisions. In a study of communication of treatment preferences among 1,031AIDS patients, researchers found that Caucasian patients were twice as likely as African Ameri-can patients to have discussed their treatment preferences with their physicians. Perhaps notcoincidentally, the study also found that African Americans were half as likely as Caucasians toprefer a treatment approach that focused on pain relief as opposed to extending life. 47 Suspicion about proposed palliative treatments may deter African American patients from honest, opencommunication with health care providers. Without adequate communication, the patient and family inadvertently give the decisionmaking power to the health care provider, which becomes a form of \"paternalism by permission\" 48 and decreases patient autonomy. Advance Directives A retrospective chart review of 1,193 frail elderly in South Carolina found that African Ameri-cans were less likely than Caucasians or Hispanics to have completed advance directives, 49 while in another study African Americans were less likely than Caucasians or Asians to completedurable power of attorney for health care. 50 While reasons for this are several, lack of access to medical care in general is of primary importance. If an advance directive to withhold life-pro-longing therapies is seen by African Americans as yet another way of limiting their access to adequate health care, then they might be more inclined not to complete one. 51 Along with the decreased use of advance directives among African Americans is a low use of hospice services when compared to Caucasians. This is partially due to lack of access to and lackof education regarding hospice care. 52 Chpt 14 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, AM 30926 Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 14: Culture and Care U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 310Life-Prolonging Treatment In an article concerning the implementation of the Patient Self-Determination Act of 1991, Young and Jex pointed out that African Americans tend to equate life support with life, and viewthe withholding of any life-sustaining therapies as another attempt at genocide by the system. 53 Therefore, African Americans might be reluctant to consider palliative care as a treatment op-tion for fear that it might result in neglect or being allowed to die prematurely. 28 In a study comparing attitudes toward life-prolonging treatments among 139 patients at a gen-eral medicine clinic, only 63% of African Americans approved of stopping life-prolonging treat-ments, compared to 89% of Caucasians. Furthermore, 35% of Caucasians approved of physician-assisted suicide, compared with only 16% of African Americans. 22 Finally, Caralis, et al. in their 1993 study found that African Americans were more likely than the general population to choose life-prolonging treatments, even in the face of a poor outcome.22 Interventions In view of the long history of discrimination to which African Americans have been subjected over the years, the single most important intervention that must be made is to develop a sense oftrust and reliability. This ongoing process will require open and continuous communicationbetween the health care provider and the African American community. The recruitment ofmore African American health care providers, preferably members of the local community, will help overcome distrust of institutions by the African American community, and will establish better lines of communication between the community and the health care organization. Com-munity-based organizations should be developed to identify and address the specific health careconcerns of local African American communities. One such organization is the Harlem Palliative Care Network in New York City, whose specific objectives are as follows: \u007f To increase access to palliative care services for patients and their families residing in Central and East Harlem who are facing progressive,life-threatening illness \u007f To overcome cultural and environmental barriers among minority populations in receiving timely intervention \u007f To enhance the continuity and coordination of care through greater integra- tion of community-based and institutional services \u007f To improve the quality of life for Harlem patients through better pain and symptom management \u007f To provide support services to meet the emotional and spiritual needs of the patients and their families 54 Since research has shown that many African Americans lack knowledge about palliative care and hospice programs,55 education is of prime importance. Physicians should be included in education because many lack knowledge of the broad range of palliative care interventions,particularly pain management. For this there are resources for up-to-date training on palliativecare, such as Education for Physicians in End of Life Care (EPEC), http://www.epec.net.

This education should include prevention, intervention and life enhancement in HIV/ AIDS. It should also include a thorough understanding of palliative care and the role of hospice.Thus empowered, the church will be able to deal with controversial issues associated with HIV/AIDS, such as drug abuse, sexual promiscuity and homosexuality, as well as help African Ameri-cans overcome the perception that palliative care treatment modalities are an abandonment ofcare. 56 The church can provide not only spiritual support, but also, practical social support through its various lay organizations. Finally, whenever possible, recognition should be made of the role African American family members play in the treatment, care, and support of patients living with HIV/AIDS. It is in the family and the core values that bind it together that African American patients will find thestrength and support they need to face end-of-life issues. CONCLUSION While health care providers treating persons with HIV/AIDS cannot become familiar with every cultural issue related to medicine, they can become more sensitive to the role that cultureplays in how people access and experience palliative care services. Recognizing the role of cul- ture and being familiar with the core values of a cultural group will not only aid in eliminating barriers to treatment, but also optimize patient care, particularly end-of-life care.

INTRODUCTION People who are young or old, homeless, new immigrants, incarcerated, or newly released from jail or prison may have needs that differentiate them from other people living with HIV/AIDS. Clinicians should recognize that these needs may prevent such people from followingroutine clinical pathways for palliative care. Individuals within each group have internal andexternal barriers to being in care. Recruiting and maintaining them in care requires personalcontact and often involves outreach. Otherwise, patients may fall out of care and die too soon, inpain, and without support.Young gay men and young heterosexual women, as well as people over 65 years of age, all haveunique issues that may limit their access to palliative care. Even greater barriers are encoun-tered by people who are homeless, those who have immigrated from other countries legally orillegally, and individuals who are incarcerated or recently have been released from jail or prison.People with substance abuse problems, who also experience barriers to care, are discussedelsewhere in this guide. (See Chapter 11: Substance Use Problems.)A need common to all these individuals is assurance that their healthcare providers understandand accept their particular circumstances. Establishing a trusting relationship is often criticalbefore they will accept care. The following recommended interventions are applicable to all ofthe vulnerable groups discussed in this chapter and can be crucial in establishing trust andpromoting the individual's engagement with care: \u007f Establish a personal connection with the individual during the initial visit.\u007f Arrange for the person to meet with a case manager, social worker or outreach worker during the initial visit. \u007f Obtain contact information for at least two people close to the person so that if she or he does not return, follow-up can occur. \u007f Arrange to be in contact with the person the day following the first visit, at least by phone if not by return visit. Providing palliative care to special populations has an additional level of complexity. Many peoplewho are marginalized from society and already underserved by the health care system havebecome mistrustful of \"the system\" or have difficulty understanding the HIV disease process,much less the highly technical aspects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Peoplewho belong to marginalized groups may perceive palliative care as second-class care, which theyare being offered instead of aggressive acute medical care. Palliative care should be the result ofan individual's empowered choice. The importance of gaining the trust of individuals in specialpopulations becomes even more apparent when this dimension is added.

Adolescents Adolescents feel omnipotent and immortal, have not completely internalized the concepts of cause and effect, and may mistrust adults in authority. A common adolescent response to adiagnosis of HIV, which is often given by an adult, is to reject the diagnosis, believing that avoid- ing the issue is avoiding the illness. For young gay and bisexual men, fear of their sexual orien- tation being revealed because of a diagnosis of HIV might also prevent their seeking care. (SeeChapter 12: The Care of Children and Adolescents.) Young mothers tend to allow their babies' care to take precedence over their own. If they are in denial that they might die, young mothers may avoid planning for the guardianship of theirchildren. (See Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues for discussion of permanency planning.) The following interventions may promote adolescents' acceptance of care: \u007f Offer to assist them with making decisions about disclosure of their status to parents, children and other family members. \u007f Arrange for peer support by other teens living with HIV if possible; otherwise, link them with other teens via the Internet. \u007f Begin discussions with adolescent mothers about who will care for their children; bring in other team members and agencies to assist them withpermanency planning. Other services that can facilitate a teen mother accepting care for herself include parenting skill classes, respite care, family support and homemaker services. 1 Resources for training staff about permanency planning are the National Pediatric and Family HIV Resource Center(www.pedhivaids.org) and The Family Center (www.thefamilycenter.org). Older People Senior citizens may not seek care because they fear the stigma of HIV/AIDS as well as be- cause they may be dealing with other health problems. The initial discussion of palliative care might confirm their fears that \"nothing more can be done for them.\" If they have been receiving care at a private physician's office, they may feel uncomfortable in a clinic situation. For oldergay men, who may have lived a \"closeted\" lifestyle, sharing their sexual orientation with healthcare providers may make them uncomfortable. For example, an older gay man may not be com-fortable receiving palliative care at home because he doesn't want his providers to know he liveswith his partner. For people with HIV who are older, the following interventions may be useful: \u007f Encourage them to contact the National Association on HIV Over Fifty (NAHOF), an organization for both consumers and providers that has anewsletter (www.hivoverfifty.org/). \u007f For patients who resist receiving palliative care services from an HIV- associated hospice agency, consider having their primary care cliniciansprovide the palliative care with consultation from a palliative care expert oragency needed.

PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS A good definition of homelessness is not having a stable residence in one's name. The term homeless applies equally to a person who has a temporary hotel room paid by a city program forindigents, a person sleeping in a shelter or in a car, and a person who is staying with a relativebecause she or he cannot afford to pay rent. People who are homeless are as varied in socioeco-nomic, ethnic and demographic characteristics as the general population; most lack stable hous-ing because of their economic situation. 2 However, a high proportion of those who are visible on street corners in cities and towns across the U.S. suffer from mental illness, chemical depen-dency problems, or both. In some cities, mobile vans or walk-in clinics bring services to the most visible people who are homeless, but in most cities the people must come to the services instead. They often wait untiltheir health problems are quite severe before going to emergency rooms for help. Palliativecare, which is by definition continuous and involves an ongoing relationship between the pro-vider and patient, may not be a familiar process. Providing palliative care to people who are homeless is difficult because of the multiple physi- cal, economic and social problems they already face and because of their transience. However,they have the same emotional and spiritual needs as others and can benefit greatly from thistype of supportive care throughout the trajectory of their illness. Medical Care To provide palliative care to people who are homeless, the clinician may have to address a number of practical matters. The interventions suggested at the beginning of the chapter are essential. Having social workers, case managers, outreach workers and pastoral care providerson the team facilitates these interventions and increases the possibility of linking homelesspeople to services that can meet their basic survival needs. The following interventions may alsohelp to improve treatment outcomes: \u007fRelax the clinic structure for people who are homeless. Individuals who are homeless may be unable to keep appointments. Makeexceptions for certain people, seeing them on a drop-in basis for morefrequent, shorter visits. Offer incentives such as food vouchers when they comefor appointments to increase their motivation to obtain health care on a regular basis rather than only when emergencies occur. \u007fAssess all new patients for homelessness. When assessing new patients, assume that they might be homeless or living intemporary quarters. Ask whether they go home to the same place every night,and whether they have a permanent address where they can be contacted. \u007fConsider prescribing small amounts of medication. Ascertain whether they will be able to keep their medications safely. Someshelters or group homes will set out residents' pills each day. Pain medicationsmay need to be provided in smaller quantities than usual to prevent theft or loss.

Certain medications require refrigeration (e.g., ritonavir), may need to be taken with food (e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir), or may require large amounts offluid intake which can pose problems if there is limited access to toiletfacilities (e.g., indinavir). All of these practical considerations, which can bevery challenging for homeless patients, with a predictable adverse impact onadherence, should help inform decisions about choosing specific treatmentregimens. \u007fMonitor closely and frequently. Be especially concerned about adequate nutrition, appropriate hygiene andwound care, and the need for personal care. Be ready to hospitalize homelesspeople more frequently than other people living with HIV for conditions suchas malnutrition, exposure and wound infection. \u007fLink with food programs. Linking homeless individuals with food programs is an important intervention.In addition, obtaining food or food vouchers to provide to people at clinicappointments can increase their attendance. \u007fLink with housing programs. Clearly, arranging for housing facilitates more effective palliative care for thehomeless. Even if the person rejects housing, anticipate the possible need for aprotected environment in the future, such as a long-term care facility, andwork slowly towards that goal. \u007fBe honest and frank. Be willing to be honest with people who are homeless. Make attempts to referthem to mental health and/or substance abuse services if their condition appears to warrant such assistance. If they are engaging in self-destructive behaviors, explain how these behaviors are shortening their lives. Have aknowledgeable member of your team discuss the merits of harm reductionwith both the patient and other staff members. \u007fEducate about the expected course of disease. Patients may feel that seeking care is useless if they believe they are dying.Discussing the stage of their illness allows them to begin to gain control oftheir own situation. Offer simple, concrete suggestions about self care.Sometimes physical deterioration and chronic pain, or the sudden realprospect of death, can be turning points that motivate people to make startlingchanges. A person might for the first time accept pastoral counseling,substance abuse treatment, or housing in a hospice facility. \u007fDiscuss advance directives (a medical term not often understood by those outside the medical system).After forming trusting relationships, it will be possible to ask homeless personsif they have thought about what might happen to them at the end of life. Manyclinicians tend not to ask about this, perhaps assuming that homeless peoplehave limited capacity. However, this denies individuals the opportunity toaddress the issues of how they want to live and to die. This is another potential Chpt 15 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 31826 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 15: Special Populations XV U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 319turning point for a person taking control of her or his life. If the person is not in contact with family, it is helpful to ask whether there are friends or others who should be contacted if the person becomes ill. Emotional and Social Support Biological Family Homeless people frequently have been estranged from their families of origin and from spouses and children. However, when they are dying, they may want to re-establish connections withtheir families and attempt to mend fences. Clinicians should always ask whether homeless per-sons would like to have their family members contacted when it is clear that they are not ex-pected to get better. Although some health care providers may feel uncomfortable asking or maynot think to ask, resuming contact with family members may be an important aspect of an individual's closure. If a palliative care team is in place, any team member who is trusted by the patient can ask the initial question and bring in others to share responsibility for followingthrough on the patient's wishes. It is important to remember that reconciliation can be time-consuming . Not only may the home- less person need support, but family members who are contacted may feel guilt because of theestrangement and may need support as they re-establish relationships with the homeless anddying individual. Shelter Staff as Surrogate Family For many people who are homeless, the staff of shelters and other service agencies becomesupport systems. These may be the most consistent, nonjudgmental people in their lives, andthe ones from whom they want comfort when they are dying. It is therefore important to find outwho should be contacted and included in an individual's care team. In fact, shelter and otherservice agency staff may need a support group or other bereavement services, either because oftheir involvement in a single individual's care, or because they are experiencing multiple lossesas numerous clients with HIV become sick and die. The stress and distress of being unable to domore for people who are homeless and dying can take a terrible toll on social service providersin community-based agencies. (see Chapter 20: Care for the Caregiver.) Other Homeless People Some people who are homeless have close relationships with other homeless individuals whohave become their families and may become dying person's caregivers in his or her last days. Forthis reason clinicians should respect and support close personal relationships, while also beingalert to potential abuse, such as a \"friend\" taking the patient's pain medications herself or himself. Incarcerated Family and Loved Ones For homeless people who recently have been released from jail or prison, their closest relation-ships may be with people who are still incarcerated. This may be an unfortunate result of \"com-passionate release\" for the dying. Other homeless people may have close family members whoare in jail or prison. Resolving this isolation is difficult, because the penal system rarely allowsprisoners to visit family members on the outside, much less loved ones who are not related, evenwhen those people are dying. Chpt 15 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 31926 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 15: Special Populations U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 320Spiritual Support Spirituality is an important aspect of the lives of people who are homeless. Many grew up in families that were deeply religious, and even if they are not actively practicing today, they maycarry those religious beliefs with them. Others have been exposed to the spiritual principles of12-Step programs such as Alcoholics/Narcotics Anonymous and find support and comfort in ahigher power. Addressing the spiritual aspects of palliative care is as important with the home-less as with other people. Clinicians should inquire about the religious background and current spiritual beliefs of people who are homeless. Sometimes this is the first step toward bringing in other members of thepalliative care team, such as pastoral counselors or clergy. Asking these questions not onlydemonstrates personal interest in patients, but gives them permission to discuss this aspect of their lives. PEOPLE WHO ARE NEW IMMIGRANTS Immigrants come to the U.S. and to other countries from all over the world. Many are from countries where the spread of HIV/AIDS has been exacerbated by poverty or civil unrest result-ing in social dislocation and economic disruption; for example, Guatemala, Myanmar, Russiaand Rwanda. Some come seeking safe asylum, while others seek educational and economic op-portunities. They all hope for a better life for themselves and their children. However, some already have become infected with HIV. People living with HIV who have immigrated to the U.S. from other countries may have cultural and legal issues that restrict their ability to access and accept palliative care. The culturalissues may include language barriers and differences between their cultures of origin and themainstream culture upon which the American health care system is based. The legal issuesrelate to whether or not they are in the country legally and, if they are, whether their HIV statusendangers their legal status and thus their access to benefits. An additional concern may be whether their visas allow them choices regarding whether to stay in the U.S. or to return home to die. Such issues are also relevant for immigrants in other countries. Unless palliative care providers are sensitive to immigrant clients' cultural differences and can identify legal barriers to their clients' accessing care, they risk losing clients before follow-up orleaving them outside any system of care. The clinician's first intervention with people who maybe immigrants should include assuring them that their relationship with the clinician and thehealth care agency is completely confidential. Only then will it be possible to determine eachindividual's situation and provide referrals to agencies that can provide immigration counseling and legal assistance. As with all special populations, obtaining contact information for family members or close friends is important so that follow-up can take place. Cultural Issues Immigrants may face many of the cultural issues common to minority groups in the U.S. (See Chapter 14: Culture and Care.) In addition, however, their status as immigrants may compoundsome of the issues they face, as opposed to people who have lived in the community for a longtime. Chpt 15 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 32026 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 15: Special Populations XV U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 321Language Immigrants often do not speak English, especially when they first arrive. If they come to a large community of people from their country of origin, that community may have interpreters withinthe health care system. However, language barriers may compound other cultural differencesbetween individuals and their care providers. Language difficulties may also make it more diffi-cult for them to sort out the complexities of the system upon which they depend for health care. Family Support In many traditional cultures, strong extended family networks provide support when membersbecome chronically or terminally ill. When individuals, or even nuclear families, move to an-other country, they leave these family networks behind and are left without the physical, finan- cial and emotional support systems that would normally be available. Thus, recent immigrants are isolated at a time when they most need family help. Moreover, in many cultures where familyprivacy is valued, the concept of volunteers becoming involved in personal caregiving may beunacceptable. Burial The issue of burial is complicated for people who come from other countries and wish to beburied in their native soil. Advance planning can help facilitate this, if providers include somespecific questions: When a person becomes terminally ill, does he or she want to return home todie to ensure burial there? If a person dies here and the family are available, will they be allowed to follow their religious and cultural practices in how the body is handled? If the family wish, can the body be sent back to their native country? If the cost is prohibitive, are there fundsavailable from local agencies that might be used? If there are no family members, who willarrange for the body to be buried locally? What resources will pay for burial? If family arriveafter the body has been sent to the morgue, what are the options? Africans and African Americans In recent decades, many people from Africa, the continent most ravaged by HIV/AIDS, havecome to the U.S. to study and work. It thus comes as no surprise that some African immigrants are HIV positive. Moreover, some immigrants living with HIV come to the U.S. and other industri- alized countries to obtain up-to-date treatment for their illness. Africans do not usually identifywith African American culture; in many cases, they may be better educated than African Ameri-can patients at the clinics where they receive care. They might feel uncomfortable if their healthcare providers were to treat them as if they were African American. Legal Issues The legal issues confronting immigrants living with HIV may involve not only their status and legal right to remain in a country, but their ability to take advantage of the public benefits andentitlements available for citizens (see Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues). Two U.S. federal laws passed in 1996 created much more stringent regulations for immigrants. 3 Immigrants need referrals to agencies that provide immigration counseling or to experienced immigration lawyersso they can learn about their legal options and the services that might be available to them.

The U.S. Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (also called the ille-gal immigration reform bill) established procedures for determining the admissibility of immi-grants. Even non-citizens who are legally in the U.S. may risk being deported by the Immigrationand Naturalization Service (INS) because of their positive HIV status. It is essential that non-citizens talk to an immigration law expert before speaking to the INS. In addition, it is essentialthat health care providers be able to assure their clients that everything they say, as well aseverything in their medical records, will be kept confidential and not reported to the INS. Public Benefits The U.S. Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (which created the welfare-to-work program, TANF, described in Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Is-sues) established new and complex eligibility rules for public benefits for legal immigrants. Thislaw also made several categories of previously eligible legal immigrants ineligible for most fed-eral public benefits. The illegal immigration reform bill established certain procedures for de-termining the admissibility of immigrants and heightened immigrants' fears that using publicbenefits, even legitimately using Medicaid, could jeopardize their ability to become legal perma-nent residents or U.S. citizens. A recent study determined that immigrants are less willing toapply for Medicaid, even if they are eligible, or to access primary care as a result of these laws.Barriers such as poverty, language differences, and lack of transportation compound the diffi-culties for immigrants in accessing public benefits. 4 Legal Resources Although local resources are absolutely necessary for individuals needing legal counsel, the following national resources may be useful for clients in the U.S., as well as for providers at-tempting to understand their clients' problems: \u007f The National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild published an updated version of HIV and Immigrants: A Manual for AIDS Service Providers , funded and distributed by the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. 3 The manual provides a comprehensive and detailed presentation of issues and is available free of charge from the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, P .O.

Call (202) 797-2105 or contact irsa@irsa-uscr.org PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED OR NEWLY RELEASED Background More than two million people are currently incarcerated in jails and prisons in the U.S. Afri- can Americans and Hispanics constitute an overwhelming 75% of all new admissions. In 1997, anestimated 8,900 inmates had AIDS and 35,000 to 40,000 inmates were living with HIV, represent-ing a prevalence of infection and disease five times higher than that of the overall population. The HIV rate among inmates is disproportionately high for racial and ethnic minorities: rates are as high as 11.3% and 11.1% among Hispanic and African American inmates, respectively,compared to 3.7% among white inmates. 5 The proportion of inmates living with HIV varies by region as well as by institution. As the management of HIV has improved with antiretroviral therapy, HIV has become a chronic as well as terminal illness; in either case, palliative care is an important aspect of care. Provid-ing palliative care within correctional institutions poses unique challenges. The concern forsecurity in jails and prisons determines how medical care is provided in those settings. Pallia-tive care, with the goals of preventing further deterioration and maximizing the patient's com-fort and function rather than curing disease, is less readily adapted than primary medical care to the rigid hierarchical structure and culture of a corrections environment. 6 For example, for security reasons it may be appropriate for most inmates to be transported in shackles. Whileputting a dying inmate in shackles would be unnecessary and unreasonable from a health carestandpoint, corrections protocols may require such treatment. In 1976 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that prison and jail inmates have a right to health care while incarcerated. 7 However, palliative care is difficult to provide behind bars in a manner that meets both the individual's need for symptom relief and the institution's need for security andcontrol. By definition, compassionate care requires deviation from the correctional norm whose goals are segregation, stigmatization, and punishment. Dying inmates need increased medical atten-tion, expanded visiting hours with family and clergy, access to special foods, and relaxation ofroutine restrictions. 8 Jails and prisons differ in both structure and motivation in terms of how they provide medicalcare to inmates. Jails are temporary quarters for persons who have been arrested and are await-ing trial, and turnover is generally fairly rapid. Therefore, with nonacute medical problems,cost-shifting can occur; if a medical problem is not immediately addressed, the inmate may bedischarged without the jail having expended resources. Prisons, on the other hand, are perma-nent quarters to which people are sentenced for long periods of time. The prison assumes re- Chpt 15 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 32326 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 15: Special Populations U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 324sponsibility for financing health care, even if the person would be eligible for insurance such as Medicare on the outside. Therefore, it is in the interest of a prison to provide or manage their inmates' health care rather than refer inmates to outside health care institutions that will bill the prison for care provided. Palliative Care in Correctional Institutions: Unique Issues Whether a patient is in jail or prison, certain issues affecting palliative care stand out: \u007fPatient autonomy. If patients are to provide true informed consent for palliative care, they must also be assured of continued access to curative care. Medical prognosiscombined with prisoner wishes and values will determine the relative balanceof curative and palliative interventions. Palliative care should be an adjunct tocurative care plans. \u007fConfidentiality. Protecting an inmate's medical confidentiality is difficult even when access tomedical records is restricted to medical staff. Correctional staff, as well asother inmates, who observe an inmate being taken for special appointments ortaking certain medications, can figure out his or her diagnosis. Also,corrections officers may be involved in discussions with medical staff aboutpatient care for security reasons. Correctional staff should receive special training in safeguarding medical information. In some institutions, they are required to sign agreements regarding the protection of confidential medicalinformation. \u007fMedical advocacy and negotiation. The clinician should be the advocate for the individual inmate in designingand pursuing a palliative care plan. However, the plan must be approved bycorrections staff, who may not be willing to support the plan. \u007fPain management. Providing access to appropriate analgesic medication is perhaps the mostproblematic area for clinicians providing palliative care within corrections. \u007fAdvance directives. The issue of advance directives is extremely delicate in penal situations, where self-determination is by definition abridged. Care providers must be assured that a patient's decisions are voluntary and uncoerced regarding access to andwithholding of life-sustaining treatment. Health care proxy appointments risksetting up conflicts of authority in a correctional institution unless the proxiesare family members or friends. \u007fCompassionate release. Compassionate release is the release of a terminally ill inmate to thecommunity so that she or he can die in an appropriate setting, with appropri-ate care. Although the process of review for compassionate release exists inmany institutions, it is often so time-consuming that most inmates die inprison before release is approved. 9 Chpt 15 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 32426 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 15: Special Populations XV U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 325\u007fVolunteer assistance. Volunteers are used in prison hospice programs, and inmates benefit greatly from the opportunity to be trained and volunteer within prison hospice programs. Nevertheless, the possibility for abuse exists, especially forvolunteers to be used rather than professional staff. \u007fClustering. Instituting hospice programs may provide the specific services needed byinmates who are chronically and terminally ill, but it also creates a problem.Clustering inmates requires that many of them be moved from the institutionsin which they have been housed. This separates them from others with whomthey may have formed close bonds. If a state has only one hospice program, apatient/inmate may be taken to an institution very far from family and closefriends in his or her community, further isolating the patient at a time whenhe or she most needs the support and comfort of loved ones. \u007fDischarge planning. The boundary between correctional health care systems and health caresystems that inmates re-enter upon discharge into the community is distinct.Because it is impossible to make pre-release application for Medicare orMedicaid, inmates experience a hiatus in medical coverage betweenincarceration and their return to the community. Programs on the outside thatfacilitate discharge planning for soon-to-be-released inmates find that thework is labor-intensive and linkages are difficult to establish. Standards of Care HRSA has funded the development of standards of care for palliative care in correctional insti- tutions by the American Public Health Association (APHA), the National Commission on Correc- tional Health Care (NCCHC), and Guiding Responsive Action for Corrections at End of Life (GRACE).Copies of the APHA standards are available from the APHA publications department, (202) 777-APHA. The GRACE Project standards can be obtained by phone, (703) 341-5000, or on the Web atwww.graceprojects.org. The GRACE Project, part of the non-profit agency Volunteers of America,also has other resources for end of life care for incarcerated or recently released people living withHIV/AIDS. These include a handbook for caregivers and managers, a brochure on grief for peoplein prisons or jails, articles, and a videotape for training institutional staff. 10,11 Clinical Pathway for the Recently Released Inmate The transition from a correctional facility to the community often involves a break in the continuity of health care. A red flag should immediately go up when a person who has just beenreleased from jail or prison presents for care, with the following concerns in mind: \u007f The person may have been discharged from the facility because he or she was in advanced disease. \u007f If the person has been prescribed antiretroviral medications, he or she may have only a few days' supply or none at all. \u007f The person may have no one in the community for support and thus may have no resources or place to stay.

Clinicians should have a specific clinical pathway for persons recently released from jail or prison. The clinical pathway should involve the following immediate actions: \u007fAssessment. Obtain a baseline assessment and lab work immediately. \u007fConnection with social services staff. Arrange for the person to meet with a case manager or social worker duringthis visit, and establish contact with an outreach worker. Expect the person toneed to apply for a range of entitlements and services, especially emergency housing. \u007fReconnection with family. Identify at least one family member and begin the process of reconnection. \u007fContinued personal contact. Make a plan for how to maintain contact. Do not expect the person to return intwo weeks for a follow-up visit; agree to have a next-day conversation. Linking Recently Released People with Community Care: Models The U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration HIV/AIDS Bureau (HRSA/HAB) Spe- cial Projects of National Significance is collaborating with the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention on an initiative to develop models to enhance prevention and care services for incar-cerated people at risk for HIV or living with HIV. 12 Two key components of the model programs that link inmates to community services are discharge planning while the inmate is still in prison or jail, and case management either inside the institution or outside in the community.For HIV-positive prisoners in the San Francisco County Jails, for example, The Homebase Projectarranges to have a case manager meet individuals at the gate when they are released and pro-vides them with up to three months' housing in a single-room occupancy hotel, while linkingthem with social and medical services in the community. This immediate assistance is an excel-lent example of an intervention for the clinical pathway described above. While incarceratedindividuals in the early stages of HIV disease may benefit from such interventions, persons withadvanced HIV disease are in even more critical need of the continuity of care that such interven-tions afford. Unfortunately, these models are not the norm at correctional facilities in the U.S. Chpt 15 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 32626 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 15: Special Populations XV U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 327REFERENCES 1.

The experience of a death of a loved one can be one of profound sadness and loss. The multidimensional responses to a loss are all part of thegrief process. This process is often complicated when the death is AIDS-related. If the death ofone individual can be as devastating as Dickens' question presupposes, what happens when people experience multiple significant deaths, as most bereaved in the HIV community do?There are unique challenges and needs in the bereavement process for people coping with AIDS-related deaths. This chapter will explore the nature and process of grief and identify interven-tions for use by the palliative care team in helping the bereaved cope with their losses, adjust toa changed life, and be open to personal growth and transformation. THE LANGUAGE OF GRIEF Grief is the normal, dynamic process that occurs in response to any type of loss. This process encompasses physical, emotional, cognitive, spiritual, and social responses to the loss. It ishighly individualized, depending on the person's perception of the loss and influenced by itscontext and concurrent stressors. 1 Mourning is often used interchangeably with grief, but mourning more specifically refers to the public expression of grief. This public expression (perhaps crying or wailing) does not necessar-ily relate to the significance of the loss; it is usually related to cultural and religious values andencourages social support for the mourner. 2 Bereavement is the state of having suffered a loss. This incorporates the period of adjustment in which the bereaved learns to live with the loss. The root of the word \"bereaved\" means to berobbed of something valuable. 2 Complicated mourning arises from an interrupted or obstructed grief process. Rando2 uses this term to refer to potentially harmful outcomes, from somatic discomfort to chronic emotionaldistress, and even the possibility of death, when grief is unaccommodated. There are risk factorsthat can lead to complicated mourning; many of these factors apply to AIDS-related deaths.Elizabeth A and Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 16: Grief and Bereavement U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 330ANTICIPATORY GRIEF Grief responses do not begin at the death of the loved one; rather, they begin as soon as symptoms develop that people perceive as life-threatening. Lindemann referred to these re-sponses as anticipatory grief. 3 Both the person with AIDS and those who care for that person experience anticipatory grief. However, the anticipatory grief does not replace the necessity ofgrieving after the death. 4 Rando delineates these responses from postdeath grief and asserts that the term anticipatory grief is misleading because \"anticipatory\" connotes future losses, whereas in actuality people are dealing with past and present losses as well.5 Anticipatory grief includes changing assumptions, adapting to role changes, finding a balance for staying separate from, yet involved with, the patient, and experiencing feelings of sadness, depression, and anxiety.6 The patient and caregivers have the opportunity to absorb the im- pending loss gradually over time. Often the people involved must change their assumptionsabout the way the world works and what their future will hold. Statements such as \" I always thought ...\" or questions like, \" What will I do? \"and \" How will I live ?\" are examples of this process. Patients and caregivers also struggle with secondary losses: loss of health, security, employ- ment, relationships, meaning, and the future. As the disease progresses, the losses increase and intensify. Facing these losses can be overwhelming for all involved. 7 One benefit of this process is the opportunity for people to complete unfinished business, whether practical, emotional, or spiritual. The opportunity to get affairs in order, make wishes known,prepare for final arrangements, reconcile with loved ones, express gratitude, and say goodbyecan be meaningful for the patient and the caregiver. 6 If the illness is prolonged, the period of anticipatory grief may become problematic. Thosecaring for the person with AIDS may emotionally withdraw too soon and experience ambiva-lence about the length of the illness and caregiving responsibilities. This can lead to feelings ofguilt during the illness and during bereavement. 8 Another complicating factor is that often the caregivers are HIV positive as well. In dealing withtheir own physical health issues, the threat of personal loss and facing their own mortality are very real. 8 There have been conflicting studies as to whether the opportunity to grieve before the death impacts the bereavement process by lessening the length of bereavement and/or easing the painof grief. 9 Worden notes that grief is multidimensional and it would be too simplistic to claim that a time to prepare for the death of a loved one correlates positively with a shortened bereave-ment period. 8 However, the palliative care team should be aware of the process and common themes thatemerge during anticipatory grief because the responses may have an effect on caregiving andthe emotional status of the person with AIDS. 8 Brown notes that suffering surrounds loss and death over the entire illness trajectory.4 Chpt 16 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 16: Grief and Bereavement U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 331Health care professionals can facilitate the anticipatory grief period by: \u007f Identifying and legitimizing feelings of sadness, anger, guilt, and anxiety \u007f Encouraging expression of feelings in private, comfortable settings \u007f Redefining terms related to expressions of grief (\"lose control\" or \"break down\" can be reframed into \"emotional releases,\" which are normal, expectedaspects of coping with stress and grief) \u007f Enabling people to complete unfinished business\u007f Encouraging people to live fully and enjoy life whenever and wherever they can 10 As people face their death, they want to know that they will be remembered and that their lifehad meaning. Engaging patients and caregivers in life review and memory work are effectiveinterventions in coping with anticipatory grief. 11 Zulli suggests religious rituals, meditation, use of photography and/or videos, and journeys (one last trip to a favorite place) as therapeutic tools.12 FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE GRIEF PROCESS Several factors affect the length and intensity of the grief process. These may help or hinder the bereaved move through the grief process. For those dealing with AIDS-related deaths, manyof the factors experienced indicate significant risks and often complicate the grief process,leading to potentially dangerous health outcomes. The Nature of the Relationship between the Deceased and the Bereaved This is a crucial factor during the grief process. Generally the greater the bond between the deceased and the bereaved, the greater the grief experienced. The type of bond (parent, child,partner, sibling) does not necessarily indicate the intensity of grief; every relationship is unique.However, the death of a child is usually always considered a high risk for the bereaved parent(s). 2 If there was an ambivalent or codependent relationship, this can also complicate the grief pro- cess, as the bereaved may face intensified emotional responses.8 For those dealing with AIDS-related deaths, another complicating factor is that often the rela- tionship may be disenfranchised , or not socially recognized as a valid relationship for which to grieve.13 These disenfranchised relationships can include the death of a partner, an ex-spouse, a friend or co-worker. Additionally, young children, the elderly, and the developmentally disabledare often considered unable to comprehend the loss, therefore unable to grieve. Anyone who isable to create a bond is able to grieve when that bond is threatened or broken. 13 Often these disenfranchised grievers need additional support due to the risk factors experi-enced during their loss and yet are denied even general sympathy from society. Some are ex-cluded from the postdeath rituals, denying them an opportunity to say goodbye to their lovedone and limiting the social support at a crucial time. 8 The Manner of Death The perception of preventability of the death is a crucial factor that can complicate the grief process. For those grieving deaths from early in the AIDS pandemic, the fact that the loved one did not live long enough to benefit from new treatments is difficult to reconcile.7 And for those Chpt 16 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 331A Clinical Guide and Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 16: Grief and Bereavement U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 332grieving recent AIDS-related deaths, there to be faced: medi- cation noncompliance, accessibility of treatment, and efficacy of treatment.7 If the bereaved believe the death could have been prevented, the risk for a complicated grief process increases.2 Length of illness is another important factor. Now that living with AIDS is often a chronic illness, there is a longer period of uncertainty about the future. Trends seem to indicate thatdeath from AIDS is now met with disbelief rather than as an anticipated fact. 7 Chronic or pro- longed illness often means the entire family structure is changed in order to accommodate care.People may have to rearrange work schedules or not work at all; they may need to find additionalcaregivers and/or financial support. These stressors on the family system can also complicatethe grief process. 2 As treatment advances, health care professionals may find that their antici- patory grief and bereavement period are affected by closer bonds that have developed as a resultof patients who are living longer. 7 Symptoms and side effects of the disease may also affect the grief process. Doka identifies two symptoms that correlate positively with complicated grief: disfigurement and mental disorien-tation. 11 The challenge of coping with these symptoms can create ambivalence and premature detachment from the patient. People with AIDS are at risk for both symptoms. Unfortunately, an AIDS-related death is still a disenfranchised death in most societies (along with deaths from homicide, suicide, and drugs). Patients sometimes choose not to inform fam- ily members or friends of their diagnosis and AIDS is often not mentioned in obituaries or atfunerals. The social stigma associated with AIDS-related deaths can lead to complicated griefresponses. 14 The time of death experience is an individualized factor. Some may experience increased guiltif they were not able to be present at time of death; some may experience increased distressdepending on their perception of the dying experience. Social Variables A key indicator in how the bereaved will cope is the availability and use of a good support system. The support system may include family, friends, coworkers, neighbors, religious com-munities, pets, and professional support. Many families come to rely on the support of thehealth care team during the patient's illness; in fact, due to the disenfranchised nature of thedeath, other typical sources of support may be lacking. Once the patient has died and the healthcare team is no longer regularly involved, the family is coping with not only the death of a loved one, but the loss of their main support as well. Reinforcing or feeding into the anger felt by the bereaved at the lack of family and community support only further distances them from poten-tial sources of future support. Rather, encourage and strengthen connection with family, friends,and the community. Cultural and religious beliefs and practices may provide comfort for the bereaved but may also intensify grief responses. Regardless of cultural and ethnic background, the family of originplays a significant role in how the beliefs inform the bereaved's coping style. (See Chapter 14:Culture and Care.) Familiarity with the beliefs and practices of other cultures and religiousgroups will provide a general framework for the palliative care team. 15 Cultural differences should be considered before judging a person's grief style as \"abnormal\" or \"pathological,\" but stereo- typing grief responses of an individual based on a cultural group can be inaccurate and offen- sive.16 It is best to ask the individual person how their beliefs and practices are affecting their grief process.

There is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to grieve (as long as it is not harmful to the bereaved or another); the key is to find ways that work for that particular person. Some people will never shed a tear publicly, others will cry every day for months. Talking about the loss and expressingfeelings related to the death can be very healthy for some people, yet threatening for others.Doka and Zucker are exploring different styles of grief and define a continuum of grieving stylesfrom highly intuitive (process, feeling-oriented) to highly instrumental (linear, task-oriented). 17 Identifying styles on the grief continuum will have implications for grief support. For example,a highly instrumental griever who is focused on cognitive responses and benefits from accom-plishing tasks may not find a bereavement support group that encourages expressions of feel-ings particularly helpful. 17 Some communities are coping with a disproportionate number of AIDS-related deaths. This canlead to bereavement overload, when the bereaved experience a series of losses and accumulate unaccommodated grief that may lead to unhealthy physical, emotional, and spiritual responses. 18 In addition to experiencing the deaths of many loved ones and friends, the bereaved may alsoexperience other losses. These losses may include loss of their community, loss of meaning andpurpose, loss of privacy, loss of role in society. Coping with bereavement overload and multiplelosses increases the risk of a complicated grief process. 2 Other stressors that can complicate the grief process are mental health issues, substance abuseissues and problems with physical health. If the bereaved survivor is also living with HIV, he orshe may be experiencing normal physical grief reactions that can mirror AIDS symptoms. Forexample, a typical physical grief response is weight loss, yet a symptom of AIDS is wasting. Acommon cognitive response to grief is the inability to concentrate and this can mirror the AIDSsymptom of dementia. 19 It would be important to refer the bereaved for appropriate medical evaluation in these circumstances. Substance abuse issues can complicate the grief process in several ways. Survivors may experi- ence guilt related to participating in activities that increase the risk of transmission of HIV.8 Corless notes that, \"In the gay community, bereavement tends to occur among members of the same generation. In communities where injecting drug use is high, members of different gen-erations of a family are dying of the same disease.\" 20 Unfortunately, many children are orphaned when parents, and even other siblings, die from AIDS. In other situations, drugs and/or alcoholare used as coping mechanisms during bereavement and this often leads to complicated griefbecause these methods of coping mask the actual grief responses and can limit the opportuni-ties for the bereaved to deal fully with their grief issues. Again, it is important to note that grief itself is not pathological but the factors noted above can interfere with, or complicate, the grief process. Various terms that have been ascribed to ob- structed grief: \" morbid, atypical, pathological, neurotic, unresolved, complicated, distorted, abnormal, deviant, or dysfunctional.\" 2 The inconsistency of terms mirrors the issues in defin- ing and treating grief that has been complicated.2 (See Chapter 10: Psychiatric Problems.) Chpt 16 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 333A Guide and Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 16: Grief and Bereavement U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 334TASKS OF THE GRIEF PROCESS Many grief theorists use attachment theory to develop their understanding of how grief works. British psychiatrist John Bowlby proposes that human beings tend to make strong affectionalbonds with others as part of a need for security and safety. 21 When these bonds are threatened or broken, strong emotional reactions occur; we name these responses grief. Recent grief theorists have built on Bowlby's work (see Table 16-1). There are distinctions among each theory, but most include an initial phase of shock or numbness, a time of disorgani-zation and a process of reorganization. These traditional models have been challenged in recent years. One issue is the use of \"stages\" to describe the grief process; this term implies a passive reaction to loss, and critics assert thatmoving through grief is an active process. 5 Some believe that traditional models focus too heavily on emotional responses to loss and de-emphasize cognitive responses.5, 17, 22 Another concern is that in these models the aim of the grief process is for resolution, or a return to the premorbidstate of being. Rando encourages the term accommodation rather than resolution, recovery , or completion . 2 Accommodation implies an active process of adapting to fit specific circumstances, rather than a linear process with a final endpoint. Recent models of bereavement highlightgrief as a dynamic process around which certain themes can be distinguished and personal growth and transformation emerge as possible outcomes. 23 Traditional bereavement models usually describe grief that results from a single loss; AIDS- related grief experiences of multiple loss and bereavement overload challenge these frame-works. 1 The work of William Worden is used to illustrate the grief process in this chapter. His \"tasks ofmourning\" are a way to understand the grief process more fully. 8 The word \"tasks\" is used intentionally to emphasize that dealing with the responses to grief takes effort; hence \"griefwork.\" Worden acknowledges that the tasks do not have to follow a specific order and thatpeople can work on more than one task at a time. TASK I: ACCEPT THE REALITY OF THE LOSS The first task of grieving is to acknowledge and accept the reality that the person is dead and will not return. This task can take time, as the bereaved often experiences a period of numb-ness, shock and disbelief even if the death was expected . 8 The bereaved may experience a pe- riod of searching or yearning for their loved one. Some people report they expect to see theirloved one when they arrive at home, or attempt to contact them by calling out or reaching for thetelephone before remembering that the person is gone. Many people find themselves continu- ing their old routine, such as setting the table for two people even though one spouse/partner has died. The bereaved may even refer to their deceased loved one in the present tense or usethe present and past tense together in the same conversation. These are all examples of work-ing to accomplish the first task: accepting the reality of the loss. Traditional rituals such as funerals or memorial services can help people accomplish this task. This public method of saying good-bye helps people confront the finality of the death. Often thefirst visit to the cemetery reinforces the finality of the loss as well.

It may take days or weeks for the reality to be accepted, even longer for it to be fully absorbed. TASK II: EXPERIENCE THE PAIN OF GRIEF The second task of mourning is for the bereaved to allow the pain of grief some form of healthy expression. The pain of grief includes physical, emotional, behavioral, cognitive, spiritual, and social responses to the loss (see Table 16-2). This task is crucial because if the bereaved cannot, or does not, acknowledge the pain of grief in some way, these responses could manifest them-selves in unhealthy ways. 8 Coping with the pain of grief will be unique to every individual. These responses are commonthemes that occur during bereavement; not every person will experience every response. People do experience actual physical responses to a loss. Although Stroebe reports that the physical health of the bereaved is at risk after a loss, many of the symptoms reported to physi-cians during bereavement are normal, expected responses to grief, not pathological. 24 This can lead to inappropriate use of health care services.25 As noted earlier, in AIDS-related deaths, often the survivors may be HIV positive and experienceboth normal physical responses to loss, as well as symptoms of AIDS 19 and appropriate medical evaluation is warranted. Emotionally, people tend to experience a wide range of feelings. The initial shock and numb- ness usually subside after a few weeks or months and thoughts and feelings that were present allalong begin to surface. Many bereaved report significant emotional responses 6 months afterthe loss as the reality is fully absorbed: \"I thought everything was fine but now I feel like things are worse.\" While some people need to express their feelings and talk about the loss repeatedly, others do not experience grief emotionally as their primary response and therefore do not need to process their feelings. Some may even experience dissonance if painful feelings are experi-enced but are unable to be expressed: \" I may appear normal on the outside but on the inside, I'm screaming.\" 11 Sleep disturbances and appetite changes are the most common behavioral responses. Behav-ioral responses may vary due to cultural and gender factors, 8 but most cultures include crying as an acceptable response to death.16 The bereaved should be wary of the risk of increased use of alcohol, tobacco, and tranquilizers.25 Recent grief theories are emphasizing the cognitive responses to loss.5, 23 This may be the pri- mary way some people experience grief (the \"instrumental griever\"17). Initially many bereaved report a fear of \"going crazy;\" education and normalization of the grief process may help assuagethis fear. Spiritual responses to loss are also highly individual. Even those who have a strong spiritual or religious belief system may not be comforted by their beliefs. One of the crucial aspects of thespiritual response to loss is the ability to make meaning from the experience. 23, 26 An aspect of grief that is often ignored is the social response to loss. In AIDS-related deaths,people may be coping with social isolation due to stigmatization. 1 Neimeyer highlights the im- portance of the social unit in his work on using constructivism to facilitate the grief Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 16: Grief and Bereavement U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 337Table 16-2: Common \u007f Breathlessness \u007f Hollowness in the in the throat/chest \u007f Dry mouth \u007f Changes in energy level \u007f Loss of sexual desireEmotional \u007f Numbness \u007f withdrawal \u007f Crying \u007f Sighing Increased use of alcohol, tobacco \u007f Disbelief \u007f Confusion \u007f Sense of \"going with the deceased \u007f Sense of presenceSpiritual \u007f Search for meaning \u007f Loss of faith \u007f Comfort from faith\u007f Changes in relation- ship with AlienationSocial \u007f \u007f 16 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 337A Clinical Guide and Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 16: Grief and Bereavement U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 338TASK III: ADJUST TO THE LOSS The third task refers to the work of developing the skills and filling the roles necessary to move forward without the deceased being physically present.8 Usually this task can only begin after several months of dealing with the loss. It may include adjusting to living alone, being asingle parent, getting a job, learning to manage finances, or taking on household tasks. Forthose dealing with HIV, it can also mean needing to find other caregivers. Some bereavement support groups use the image of Janus, the Roman god of departures and returns, beginnings and endings, as a symbol for their group. This two-faced god, who looks both forward and backward, is an appropriate symbol for this task as the bereaved struggle withlooking back to acknowledge what has been lost and beginning to look ahead to see what ispossible in their lives. Part of adjusting to the loss is facing all the significant \"firsts\" that occur in the first year of bereavement. Coping with the first holiday, birthday, or anniversary without the loved one cantrigger a temporary upsurge of grief. 2 Grief responses can be triggered by cyclic precipitants such as holidays or anniversaries, linear precipitants that are one-time occurrences related to experiences or age (i.e., not being present at an important function), and stimulus-cued precipi- tants, including music-elicited reac- tions.2 An upsurge of grief may include a return of physical symptoms, various emotional re- sponses, changes in social behavior, and spiritual distress. These temporary reactions must bedistinguished from complicated grief, and should not be misdiagnosed as pathological responses. TASK IV: REINVESTING ENERGY FROM THE DECEASED INTO NEW LIFE The fourth task of mourning refers to the ability to transfer the emotional energy invested in the relationship with the deceased into new, healthy approaches to life.8 This does not mean that the deceased is now \"forgotten\" or that the bereaved has \"obtained closure.\" Rather thistask refers to the bereaved's ability to establish a new connection with the deceased, one thatcan transform their new life. Browning explains this concept as \"saying good-bye to grief, with-out saying good-bye to the loved one.\" 28 Reinvesting the emotional energy into new life may include a variety of methods. Simple ges-tures such as considering the deceased's perspective in a difficult situation or wearing a locketwith a picture of the deceased are examples of this reinvestment. Others reinvest the energyoutward in sociopolitical actions such as working for justice, fundraising, or creating a memorialfor the deceased. Signs that a person is learning to accommodate their grief include: \u007f A return to good health (or their health status before the death of their loved one) \u007f Acknowledgment of the reality of the loss\u007f Redefined identity\u007f Emergence of new skills or 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 33826 picas Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 16: Grief and Bereavement U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 339\u007f Establishment of or reconnection with a social support system \u007f Ability to cope effectively with temporary upsurges of grief \u007f Comfort with the quest to find meaning \u007f Personal growth/transformation Those who grieve the death of a loved one never truly \"get over\" the loss. Even after people accomplish the tasks of grieving, the pain of the loss is still present though hopefully less in-tense and more manageable. UNIQUE ASPECTS FOR CHILDREN As noted earlier, children are often disenfranchised grievers because they are considered \"too young\" to understand what has happened. This is compounded when dealing with AIDS-related deaths, another type of disenfranchised grief. The age, intellectual and emotional devel-opmental stages, and circumstances of the loss will all affect the child's grief process. Wolfeltnotes that initially children often experience shock and disbelief, then experience similar physi-ologic responses to adults: fatigue, changes in sleep patterns, appetite changes, headaches,tightness in the throat. 29 They also tend to experience a wide variety of emotions and cognitive responses. One unique aspect of children's grief is regressive behavior (such as wanting tonurse, sleep with a parent, use baby talk, suck their thumb even though they have not exhibitedsuch behavior for a while). Wolfelt attributes this to a desire to return to an earlier time whenthe child felt protected and secure. 29 He also describes the phenomena of a child approaching their grief \"in bits and pieces\"\u2014crying or calling out for the loved one and then returning to play within minutes. This coping mechanism works well for the child but can be difficult for thefamily to understand. Often children will \"act out\" in an attempt to get attention. Even if a child is not able to compre- hend the loss, she can respond to the changes in the emotional status of the family. Developmentally, children must come to understand that death is final, irreversible, inevitable, unpredictable, and universal. They must also perceive the concept of nonfunctionality and dealwith causality. 29 Table 16-3 illustrates children's developmental stages, possible responses and suggested interventions. Children dealing with AIDS-related deaths may be coping with the deaths of other family mem- bers or have HIV themselves. They are at risk for complicated grief because of the multipledisenfranchised nature of their grief experience. (See Chapter 12: The Care of Children and Adolescents.) SUPPORT FOR THE BEREAVED The palliative care team can provide support to the bereaved by acknowledging the loss, sharing memories of the deceased, normalizing grief responses, and encouraging good self-care.1, 14 To do so, the palliative care team should be familiar with the dynamics of the grief process andbe able to identify healthy and unhealthy coping behaviors. Immediately after the death, it is important to reach out to the bereaved, acknowledge the loss, and give permission to grieve. In AIDS-related deaths there may be conflicts among the biologi-cal and chosen families. The palliative care team should appreciate the perspectives of bothfamilies, without taking sides or judging their actions. 2 Chpt 16 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 339A Clinical Guide and Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 16: Grief and Bereavement U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 340 Table 16-3: Children's Developmental Stages Age 0-3 years 3-5 years 6-9 yearsThoughts \u007f Loved one will return \u007f Loved one is just away \u007f Wonder if loved one can return \u007f Deceased can still function\u007f Their actions or words caused deathFeelings \u007f Confused \u007f Anxious\u007f Fearful of separation\u007f Confused \u007f Anxious\u007f Fearful of separation\u007f Sad or angry\u007f Fearful they might die tooActions \u007f Cry \u007f Exhibit clinging behavior \u007f Exhibit regressive \u007f Cry \u007f Temper tantrum\u007f Nightmares\u007f Exhibit regressive Temper tantrum\u007f regressive behavior\u007f Exhibit clinging behaviorInterventions \u007f Hold the child \u007f Offer words of reassurance in a calm tone of voice \u007f Provide extra attention \u007f Offer reassurance calmly, don't worry about the \"right words\" \u007f Provide extra attention \u007f Tell the truth; give only appropriate information \u007f Reassure the child they were not responsible for the death \u007f Encourage physical or artistic expression of grief \u007f Maintain structure, limits and rules \u007f Use children's books about death to normalize 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 34026 picas Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 16: Grief and Bereavement U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 341\u007f Provide extra attention \u007f Tell the truth; give only appropriate information \u007f Reassure the child they were not responsible for the death \u007f Encourage physical or artistic expression of grief \u007f Maintain structure, limits and rules \u007f Seek community and school support \u007f Maintain structure, limits and rules\u007f Encourage physical or artistic expression of grief\u007f Exhibit aggressive or impulsive behavior \u007f Engage in risky or dangerous behavior \u007f Decline in grades\u007f Difficulty concentrating \u007f Exhibit aggressive or impulsive behavior \u007f Engage in risky or dangerous behavior \u007f Decline irreversibility of death \u007f Their actions or words caused the death \u007f Understand finality, irreversibil- ity, nonfunctionality of death \u007f Their actions or words caused the death9-12 years 12-18 years Table 16-3: Children's Developmental Stages of Grief (continued) Age Thoughts Feelings Actions Interventions Chpt 16 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 341A Clinical Guide and Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 16: Grief and Bereavement U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 342After the death of a patient, families appreciate general expressions of condolence and sympa- thy. Telephone calls, cards, and notes are all appropriate responses from the health care team. An acknowledgment of the death and expression of sympathy are meaningful, but another way the health care professional can help the bereaved accept the reality of the death (Worden'sTask I) is by providing details and information about the illness, as appropriate. Many familiesdo find it helpful to meet with the physician or members of the health care team after the deathof a loved one to review the course of treatment or ask questions about the plan of care. Thebereaved need reassurance and affirmation that they did everything possible to help their lovedone and they did not hasten the death of their loved one (perhaps by administering the \"lastdose\" of medicine or providing inadequate care). Malacrida reported survivors are often not satisfied with the information provided about the cause of their loved one's death. 30 It appears that the communication and information provided to the bereaved by the palliative care teammay also influence their bereavement recovery. 31 Some people may not need, or want, further contact with the palliative care team. It may be apainful reminder of the illness and death, especially if they have not accepted the reality of theloss. Take cues from the bereaved before assuming they wish to remain in contact. Educating about the grief process and normalizing appropriate grief responses can lessen some of the stress and anxiety experienced by the bereaved as they face Worden's second task ofmourning\u2014experiencing the pain of grief. Often the image used to describe the grief process isthat of a \"roller coaster ride.\" This image highlights that those moving through grief do notnecessarily feel better and stronger each day but experience \"ups and downs\" and \"twists andturns\" that are normal for the ride. The bereaved need to learn what typical physical, emo-tional, spiritual, cognitive, and social responses they can expect, but also be allowed to experi-ence and express their own process. \u007f Reassure them that it is normal to experience upsurges of grief related to significant days or events such as birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays, as well as some upsurges that will occur at random. \u007f Educate them that anticipation of the significant day is usually worse than the day itself. \u007f Encourage them to divert the energy from worrying about the significant day into making plans for how to spend the day. \u007f Remind them that the grief journey takes as long as it takes; there is no time frame for grief. Tables 16-4a and 16-4b suggest techniques for supporting the bereaved during the grief process. Good self-care is a significant part of learning to adjust to the loss (Worden's Task III). Remind the bereaved the grief affects their entire person: physically, emotionally, cognitively, and spiri-tually. Encourage physical exercise (as appropriate), proper diet, and proper rest. Explore theirspiritual responses to their losses and accompany them as they search for meaning. Know thatthey are not looking for external answers; they need to find their own answers, or learn how tolive with the questions. Help them develop the creative aspect of their beings by encouragingthem to keep journals or incorporate art and music techniques as part of working through theirgrief. 32 Strengthen their support systems and be aware of the community resources in the area. Nord notes that \"social support, community involvement, and fostering a sense of purpose areuseful\" in learning to accommodate a loss. 33 Chpt 16 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 34226 picas Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 16: Grief and Bereavement U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 343What NOT to Say Because Even if others experienced a similar loss, every relationship is unique. No one knows exactly how the bereaved feel. People do not \"get over\" their grief. They can learn to manage it and learn to adjust to life.Many bereaved equate \"getting over it\" with forgetting their loved one. Though meant as reassuring, this is often perceived by the bereaved as an attempt to \"shut down\" their grief. This can offend nonreligious people and even religious people may not be comforted by this. Avoid clich\u00e9s. The idea of replacing the loved one is abhorrent to the bereaved.This puts the effort on the bereaved. Since most people experience decreased energy during bereavement, they are unlikely to call. The length of time a person suffers is irrelevant to the bereaved; their focus is on the death of that loved one.\"I know just how you feel.\" \"You'll get Or \"You'll someone else.\" \"If you need anything, me.\" \"You should be glad s/he didn't suffer more.\" At various points along the grief journey, it may be appropriate to encourage use of ritual. Van de Hart states that rituals can provide therapeutic expressions that symbolize transition, continu-ity, and healing. 34 Therapeutic bereavement rituals are usually rituals of transition or continu- ity.2 Rituals of transition may relate to the separation of the loss or the transition to adjusting to life without the loved one. These symbolic actions may include writing letters to the deceasedand then perhaps burning them, taking off a ring or melting it into another piece of jewelry, andputting away photographs of the deceased. Transition rituals may be most appropriate duringWorden's Tasks I and II. Rituals of continuity may be related to the transformed relationshipwith the deceased as a new type of connection is established. 2 These rituals may include visits to the grave, mentioning the deceased's name during a prayer, or creating a square for the AIDS quilt, and may be most effective during Tasks III and IV. The elements of a ritual include the people involved, the symbols to be used, the ritual action and the characteristics of the ritual. The ritual, like the grief process, is a personal experienceand must be created for the individual. It will arise from the circumstances, the personality, andthe beliefs of the bereaved. 2Table 16-4a: Supporting the Bereaved during the Grief Process (See next page for Table 16-4b.) Chpt 16 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 343A and Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 16: Grief and Bereavement U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 344What to Say Because Acknowledges the loss. A lack of response or acknowledgement is hurtful to the bereaved. Acknowledges the pain the bereaved is experiencing and affirms your care for them. Gives permission for expression of grief and offers reassurance of support. Bereaved often fear that people will forget their loved one. It does not upset them more to hear the name of the deceased; the worst has already happened. Validates the importance of the life of their loved one. Offers reassurance that the person will not be forgotten. Allows for individualized responses. Encourages the bereaved to prioritize and focus. Normalizes grief responses but also invites individualized responses.\"I'm sorry.\" \"I don't know how you feel but I do care about you.\" \"I'm sorry that you are hurting.\" \"I can't imagine what you are going through right now.\" \"Go ahead and cry. It's okay. I'm here for you.\" Refer to the deceased by name. Share specific stories that you remember about the deceased. Use open-ended questions: \"How has losing your partner to AIDS affected you?\" Use superlative phrases in questions: \"What has been the worst part for you?\" \"What has been most helpful?\" Use third-person statements to initiate the conversation: \"Some people tell me that coping with loneliness is the most difficult thing for them. What has it been like for you?\" or \"Many people tell me they find it difficult to concentrate. What has your experience been?\" Sources: References 1, 24, and 35. It is possible to experience personal growth and positive transformation through the grief pro- cess. Trends indicate that people who are able to create meaning in the death, have a sense of connectedness with life, and are flexible in coping with change are likely to be positively trans-formed by their grief. 26 Neimeyer builds his grief model on constructivism, asserting that hu- mans need to find meaning and organize their lives around basic assumptions. The grief processcan be a time to explore this more deeply. 27 The health care team can help facilitate this process, recognizing that positive transformationdevelops as people move through the grief process and should not be expected within the initialgrief response. Three questions can be raised to help the bereaved work on this transformation process: 35 \u007f What do you want to bring from your old life into your new life?Table 16-4b: Supporting the Bereaved during the Grief Process 16 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 34426 picas Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 16: Grief and Bereavement U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 345\u007f What do you need to leave behind? \u007f What do you need to add? In summary, interventions suggested to help people coping with AIDS-related death include: \u007f Reaching out to the bereaved \u007f Giving the bereaved permission to grieve in ways that work for them \u007f Normalizing responses to grief\u007f Educating about the grief process and what to expect, especially during the first year \u007f Encouraging good self-care\u007f Referring for appropriate medical evaluation\u007f Encouraging use of creative techniques such as keeping a journal, art and music\u007f Encouraging use of ritual \u007f Exploring spiritual responses, especially the search for meaning \u007f Strengthening and encouraging use of a support system\u007f Affirming efforts to re-engage in life\u007f Helping the bereaved recognize opportunities for personal growth and transformation In reaching out to the bereaved, the palliative care team may experience their own issues of grief and loss. This is a normal response; the important thing is to confront these issues separately so that one can be fully present to the bereaved in their time of need. It may be appropriate to cry with, or in front of, the bereaved as long as they do not have to comfort members of the palliative care team. Health care professionals have a responsibility to process their own grief work in order to be present to others who are grieving. Good self-care and identification ofhealthy, appropriate coping mechanisms are essential. (See Chapter 20: Care for the Caregiver.) It is also important for the palliative care team to maintain a therapeutic perspective in reach- ing out to the bereaved. Remember: \u007f No one can take away the pain of grief. \u007f Don't let a sense of helplessness prevent outreach to the bereaved.\u007f Recognize the value of \"being present\" to the bereaved.\u007f Develop empathetic listening skills. 2 In dealing with AIDS-related deaths, there are further challenges for the palliative care team. Mallinson notes that in addition to addressing grief issues, health care professionals must also address the concurrent stressors: substance abuse, mental health issues, and the effects of homophobia, racism, and stigmatization, and advocate for accessible services and communityresources. 1 CONCLUSION Palliative care is a holistic approach to medicine that does not end with the death of a pa- tient. Caring for the bereaved is a responsibility and a privilege. In AIDS-related deaths, thebereaved face significant issues that can complicate their grief process. Interventions that incorporate a holistic approach to grief and loss can facilitate the bereavement process, possi- bly improving the bereaved person's ability to function, reducing some of the pain experienced,and providing an opportunity for transformation. 1 Chpt 16 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 345A Clinical Guide and Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 16: Grief and Bereavement U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 3461.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 349This chapter presents some of the important ethical issues that arise in palliative medicineand will pay particular attention to how these issues bear on the treatment of patients livingwith AIDS. This chapter is not intended to be either comprehensive or introductory . It does,however, provide a systematic approach to the ethics of palliative medicine-one that groundsthe ethical principles appropriate for this field in the theoretical ideals of palliative medicine.It will show how these ideals and principles can be applied to resolve concrete cases involvingpatients living with HIV/AIDS. THEORETICAL IDEALS Like other fields of medicine, palliative medicine is informed by theoretical ideals1, 2 that guide clinical decisions. Two of these ideals are discussed in this section: the ideal of honoringpatient dignity and the ideal of promoting patient well-being. Clarity regarding these two idealsis essential in properly framing and addressing some of the most troubling dilemmas that arisein the palliative care context.The ideal of honoring patient dignity is sometimes identified with the need to respect the patient'sautonomy. Patients in need of palliative care, like other patients, have desires about the kind oftreatment they would like to receive. The need to respect these desires grounds a number ofclinical duties, some negative and some positive. Negative duties include the duty not to imposeunwanted treatment on the patient. For example, if a competent patient refuses life-sustainingtherapy, physicians must not administer it, even if they believe that it is necessary to keep thepatient alive. Positive duties include the duty to assist patients in becoming adequately in-formed about the treatment options open to them. It also includes the duty to assist patients inthinking about the medical treatment they would like to receive should they become incapaci-tated. This is normally accomplished by encouraging the patient to fill out an advance directiveor to appoint a surrogate decisionmaker. (See Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues.) Withrespect to patients living with HIV/AIDS, obtaining an advance directive can present specialchallenges. Fear of social and family stigmatization can make these patients reluctant to engagein end-of-life planning with their physicians. For example, some patients may attempt to keeptheir diagnosis a secret from their family members. Physicians must be aware of this possibility.They should discuss these concerns of stigmatization with their patients early on in the diseaseprocess. They should encourage their patients to consider appointing a suitable health careproxy and to inform the health care proxy of their underlying HIV/AIDS status (see Case 1 onpage 358).Respecting patient autonomy is an important part of honoring patient dignity, but it is not theonly part. Clinicians should not simply defer to the autonomous desires of their patients, what-ever these desires may be. This is obvious in cases where patients ask their physicians to ini-tiate interventions that are clearly medically inappropriate. If a patient asks his or her physi-cian to administer treatment that the physician believes would set back the medical interests ofLynn A Jansen, RN, PhD, Barbara E Johnston, MD and Daniel P Sulmasy, MD, Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 17: Ethical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 350the patient, then the physician need not provide the treatment. This is particularly important to bear in mind when dealing with patients near the end of life. These patients may ask their physicians to shorten their lives because they have decided that continued life is no longer a benefit, but a burden (See Case 2 on page 359). Or they may ask for care that is biomedicallyfutile. For now we wish to point out only that honoring a patient's dignity may, at times, requirethe physician not to comply with his or her patient's requests. 3 This point is easily misunderstood. It is often said, for example, that human life is sacred or inviolable. Regardless of one's religious views, these expressions refer to the status of humanbeings as beings that command respect. Physicians, as well as others, must respond appropri-ately to this value. Consider, for example, the case of a patient living with HIV/AIDS who desires to participate in an experimental study with no known benefit and with excessive risk. A physi- cian might reasonably refuse to enter the patient into the study, even if the patient desires to beenrolled, because the physician believes that to do so would be to fail to honor the patient'sdignity. Of course, it will require ethical judgment to decide how, and when, a physician shoulddefer to the desires of his or her patients. The point here is that honoring patient dignity is notexhausted by the need to respect patient autonomy. The second theoretical ideal of palliative medicine is to promote the well-being of patients at the end of life. Patient well-being is promoted by advancing the patient's interests. But what are these interests? It is useful to divide patient interests into two broad categories. These are 1) phenomenological interests (those that directly relate to the actual experience of the pa-tient) and 2) nonphenomenological interests (those that do not solely relate to the actual expe-rience of the patient). The first category refers to the interests that patients have in beingcomfortable. A primary objective of palliative medicine is to provide relief for the pain andsuffering that often are present at the end of life. Although in large measure these experiencesare personal and subjective, good palliative care attempts to identify and measure them. Thus,to take just one example, patients in need of pain relief are asked to rank their pain on a scale of0 to 10. Doing so provides guidance to clinicians who seek to restore them to a level of comfort. To further the phenomenological interests of their patients at the end of life, then, health care providers must respond appropriately to pain. They must also, however, respond to suffering.The terms pain and suffering are related but are not synonymous. According to a standard definition, pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual orpotential tissue damage. 4 By contrast, suffering is a broader condition\u2014one that includes pain, but is not limited to it. An important dimension of suffering concerns the social and psychologi-cal consequences that result from the perceived sense of damage to one's identity. 5 For example, patients often suffer as a result of reflecting on their condition. Illness and disease may causepain and deterioration in a patient's physical condition. The patient may then reflect upon theconsequences of this for his or her life and sense of who they are. This may, in turn, lead tofurther suffering. ASSESSING PAIN Pain is reasonably well understood. As several writers in this volume have already discussed (see Chapter 2: Overview of Clinical Issues and Chapter 4: Pain), there are standard measuresfor clinicians to assess pain and standard interventions for relieving it. Suffering is a differentmatter. It is an ill-defined, controversial, and poorly understood experience. As one writer has Chpt 17 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 35026 picas Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 17: Ethical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 351noted, \"there are no agreed-upon and validated standards or measurement instruments for health care providers to assess suffering and to discriminate how much there is. Similarly, there are no clear interventions that should be instituted and no clear understanding of when adequate pal- liative measures for suffering have been tried and failed.\"6 This uncertainty over the notion of suffering has important ethical implications in the delivery of palliative medicine, and we shallreturn to it when we discuss the practice of terminal sedation, below. Much of palliative medicine is focused on the phenomenological interests of patients at the end of life. But the nonphenomenological interests of these patients should not be ignored. Theseare interests that are not well characterized in terms of maintaining the patient's comfort. Apatient's interest in having his privacy respected or in remaining alert even if his pain is not fully controlled are examples of such nonphenomenological interests. These are discussed here be- cause recent studies suggest that it is easy for clinicians to overlook them. 7 Taking these inter- ests seriously often requires clinicians to engage in active deliberation with their patients abouttheir treatment options. The two theoretical ideals of palliative medicine that have been discussed\u2014the ideal of honor- ing the dignity of the patient and the ideal of promoting the patient's well-being\u2014will some-times come into conflict. Not everything that furthers the interests of a patient is compatiblewith honoring him as a being worthy of respect. Determining how to respond appropriately to these potential conflicts forms an important part of the ethics of palliative medicine. MEDIATING PRINCIPLES The theoretical ideals of palliative medicine guide clinicians in determining which interventions and treatment options are appropriate for their patients. But, on their own, theseideals cannot resolve the ethical problems that arise in the palliative care setting. These situationsrequire recourse to ethical or mediating principles. The term mediating is used because they intercede between the theoretical ideals discussed above and the concrete cases clinicians encounter. There are several important ethical principles that are relevant to the practice of palliative medicine. This chapter will discuss three of them: 1) the Principle of Deliberation, 2) the Ruleof Double Effect, and 3) the Principle of Proportionality. Each of these principles has beendiscussed in the medical ethics literature. 9-15 However, they have not been discussed systemati- cally in the context of palliative medicine and in the treatment of patients living with HIV/AIDS. Before discussing these principles a few words of caution are in order. First, the three prin- ciples that we shall discuss are not the only ethical principles relevant to palliative medicine.Given the space constraints of this chapter, we cannot present an exhaustive discussion of theseprinciples. However, the three principles that we will discuss are very important; and an under-standing of them should provide an understanding of how ethical principles can be applied toconcrete cases in palliative medicine. Second, some of the principles that we will discuss\u2014andin particular the rule of double effect\u2014are controversial. We shall, however, indicate to thereader when we advance claims that not all medical ethicists would agree with and we shallprovide references to alternative points of view. Chpt 17 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 35126 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 17: Ethical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 352The Principle of Deliberation The principle of deliberation concerns the manner or process by which physicians communi- cate with their patients. According to this principle: Physicians should take an active role in eliciting from the patient the patient's own understanding of his condition and the values that may or may not bear onits treatment. This dialogue should be critical and deliberative. It should be basedon the recognition that patients often do not have fully formed values and that theyoften make mistakes in thinking about how their values translate into particulartreatment decisions. This principle relies on a particular model of shared decisionmaking. Therefore, to explain this principle more fully, we must say a few words about shared decisionmaking in general. Shareddecisionmaking depicts medical decision making as a collaborative process regulated by a divisionof labor between physician and patient. 8-11 In this process, the role of the physician is to use his or her training, knowledge, and experience to provide facts to the patient about the patient's diagno-sis and prognosis if alternative treatments (or the alternative of no treatment) are pursued. 8 By contrast, the patient's role is to bring his or her values and preferences to bear on the assessmentof these alternatives. In this way, shared decisionmaking enjoins patients to participate activelywith their physicians in reaching decisions about treatment goals and options. Shared decisionmaking is particularly important in palliative medicine. It has been well docu- mented that good patient care at the end of life closely correlates with the willingness of clini-cians to engage in discussions with their patients about prognosis and goals of care, advancedirectives, when to forgo specific treatment or diagnostic interventions and concerns aboutfamily support. 1, 7 Applied to these specific areas, the model of shared decisionmaking can help clinicians honor the dignity of their patients and promote their well-being. 16 This is true in two respects. First, in many areas of palliative medicine, there is a large measureof clinical discretion in decisions about which interventions are appropriate for specific pa-tients. For example, there is no uniform appropriate response a physician must give to his or herpatients regarding when to forgo medical interventions, how to best initiate an advance direc-tive, or the most appropriate method for relieving end of life suffering. On these matters, re-search indicates that patients with AIDS have a wide variety of needs and understandings. 16-20 Accordingly, the correct or most appropriate response to these issues will be known only afterthe physician has engaged in a process of careful questioning designed to elicit the patient'sgoals and expectations about the dying process. Indeed, with respect to these issues, the qualityof patient care will depend largely on the skill of the clinician in reaching an understanding ofthe patient's values and needs and coaxing them into clarity. 1, 7, 16, 19 Second, the preparation and approach to death involves patients in a series of unique and novelexperiences. The health care provider, in contrast, will probably have cared for a number ofdying patients and be much more familiar with the dying process than will his or her patient. 16 The fact that every patient dies only once and every death is a new experience16 presents a special justification for shared decisionmaking between the clinician and patient in the pallia-tive care context. Through shared decisionmaking the clinician can promote patient well-beingby realistically describing to the patient what he or she can expect from the dying process.Although the clinician may not be able to predict with certainty when a patient is going to die, Chpt 17 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 35226 picas Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 17: Ethical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 353shared decisionmaking enables the clinician to assist the patient in setting reasonable and achievable goals. This model of decisionmaking also enables clinicians to identify mistaken beliefs that their patients may hold about what they should expect from the dying process. For example, some patients with AIDS-related pain may hold the belief that their pain is inevitableand that it is improper or useless to report it. 11, 17, 21 Collaborative discussion with their physician is necessary to identify and correct these mistaken beliefs. The extent to which shared decisionmaking serves the ideals of honoring patient dignity and promoting patient well-being turns, in part, on how the role of the physician is conceived in thedecisionmaking process. On this matter, there are competing understandings. 9 One might ar- gue, for example, that physicians should provide their patients with adequate information and then simply let the patients decide for themselves which course of treatment should be under- taken. Against this, we believe that physicians\u2014at least physicians in palliative medicine\u2014should adopt a more \"deliberative\" stance with their patients. This means they should initiate areflective and critical dialogue with their patients about how the patient's values and prefer-ences bear on the treatment options available to them. The point of such a dialogue should beto help patients come to reasoned decisions about the treatment options they face. 11 It is important to understand that the principle of deliberation does not direct physicians to cor-rect, modify, or change their patients' values. Rather, it asks health care providers to take an active role in stimulating patients to deliberate about their values in a reasoned and well-informed man- ner. The goal of this is to improve the understanding of both the physician and the patient. One objection to deliberative decisionmaking might be that it seems unduly time-consuming, hence clinically inappropriate. For those who specialize in delivering primary and palliativecare to patients living with HIV/AIDS, however, these demands need not be excessive. Most HIV/AIDS clinicians as a matter of course already establish long-term relationships with their pa-tients living with HIV/AIDS, providing both the physician and patient ample opportunities toengage in effective deliberation about the future palliative care needs of the patient. 16 The fact that there is no uniquely correct treatment option for many situations at the end of lifefurther underscores the importance of deliberation in this context. Depending on the valuesand preferences of the patients, a regimen that is good for one patient may be inappropriate foranother, even though both have the same underlying HIV/AIDS diagnosis. Accordingly, in manyinstances, to determine the correct regimen for a particular patient, the physician will need toengage the patient in deliberative decisionmaking. 11 For these reasons, then, a strong case exists for holding that the principle of deliberation should be a fundamental ethical principleguiding palliative care. The Rule of Double Effect Deliberative decisionmaking helps clinicians honor patient dignity and promote patient well- being through a process of reasoned dialogue that identifies, clarifies, and, where necessary,helps their patients to modify their preferences for care at the end of life. However, taken byitself, the principle of deliberation is insufficient for ethically appropriate palliative care. Whilethe principle of deliberation enjoins clinicians to discuss their patients' preferences with re- spect to end-of-life care, it offers no guidance on the type of ends or goals that clinicians may permissibly advance. Nor does it speak to the issue of when it is permissible for clinicians torefuse to comply with the desires of their patients that emerge in the deliberative process.

They reinforce the point that clinicians are not ethically required simply to defer to the autonomous desires of their patients, whatever these desires may be. Indeed, as was stressed earlier, honoring a patient's dignity may, at times, require the clinician not to comply with his or her patient's requests. These consider- ations suggest that clinicians must be capable of bringing other ethical principles to bear on thedeliberative process. One such principle that has special relevance in the palliative care setting is the rule of double effect. This rule has a long history in moral philosophy and in medical ethics. 12-15, 22 In palliative medicine, it is most frequently invoked by health care professionals to explain the moral differencebetween administering high-dose pain medication to a patient and euthanizing a patient as a means to treating his suffering. 12, 13, 23 According to the rule of double effect, the essential difference between these two acts rests on the important distinction between an intended effect and anunintended side effect of a clinical intervention. In the instance of administering high-dose painmedication to relieve suffering, the intended effect is pain relief, and the unintended side effectmay be the hastening of death due to respiratory depression. By contrast, in the instance ofeuthanasia, the intended effect is the death of the patient as a means to the patient's pain relief. Despite widespread acceptance of this rule among members of the medical community, many clinicians remain unsure of how to apply the distinction. 23 Indeed, research suggests that lack of certainty in this regard results in inadequate control of distressing pain symptoms in terminally ill patients.23, 24 Because the distinction between an intended act and an unintended side effect is crucial to understanding the rule, it will be helpful to begin by considering a simple illustra-tion, one that is not controversial and one that is not related to medical practice. Consider the difference between the strategic bomber and the terror bomber. 22 Both are en- gaged in a war and both drop bombs that result in the deaths of innocent civilians. However, thestrategic bomber, unlike the terror bomber, does not intend to kill any innocent civilians. Hebombs a munitions factory, and although he is aware that doing so will have the side effect of killing innocent civilians, he does not intend to kill them. The terror bomber, in contrast, inten- tionally kills the innocent civilians as a means of weakening the resolve of the enemy. It iswidely believed that the action of the terror bomber is morally worse than that of the strategicbomber. The rule of double effect explains why this is the case. In medicine, physicians rely on the distinction between an intended effect and an unintended side effect all the time. For example, when a physician treats streptococcal pharyngitis withpenicillin, he or she foresees the possibility that the patient may develop an anaphylactic reac-tion and die. 13 It is clear, however, that the intent is not to kill the patient. The foreseeable death of the patient in this kind of case would be an unintended side effect of the intervention. Not every medical ethicist believes that the principle of double effect is as important to medical practice as is stressed here.15 For example, it has been claimed that the rule of double effect is weakened because the intentions of clinicians are inherently ambiguous.15 Even if this were the case it is most often clear both to clinicians and to others what their intentions are. And, whenit is not clear what their intentions are, morally reflective clinicians will make some effort toclarify them. We have said that the rule of double effect rests on a distinction between an intended effect and an unintended side effect of an action. Although it has been formulated in different ways, thefull statement of the rule reads as 1/28/2003, 10:20 Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 17: Ethical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 355An action with 2 possible effects, one good and one bad, is morally permitted if the action: (1) is not in itself immoral, (2) is undertaken only with the intention of achieving the possible good effect, without intending the possible bad effect even though it may be foreseen, (3) does not bring about the possible good effect by meansof the possible bad effect, and (4) is undertaken for a proportionately grave reason. 13 The statement on the rule of double effect notes four conditions that can be understood byreturning to the example of the physician prescribing penicillin for streptococcal pharyngitis.The physician is intending to bring about a good effect: the destruction of the bacteria strepto-coccal pharyngitis. This action is not itself immoral. Indeed, it is an action that any competentphysician would undertake in these circumstances. It therefore satisfies condition (1). Thephysician also does not intend the bad effect, although he may foresee it as a possibility. Herealizes that there is some chance that the penicillin will kill the patient, but bringing aboutthis possible bad effect is no part of his intention to act. His action therefore satisfies conditions(2) and (3) as well. The only remaining issue, then, is whether the physician's intervention was done for a proportionately grave reason. This means that if the intended good effect of the intervention is significant and if the foreseeable bad effect is either less significant or veryunlikely to occur, then the intervention will count as one undertaken for a proportionately gravereason. Because the possibility that a patient will die from penicillin is very remote, the physician'sintervention in this example satisfies condition (4). The same analysis can be applied to distinguish aggressive pain management from euthanasia (see Case 2 on page 359 and Case 3 on page 361). Administering high-dose pain medication hasboth a possible good and a possible bad effect. The possible good effect is the relief of the patient's suffering. The possible bad effect is that the intervention will hasten the patient's death. If a physician were to administer the medication with the intent only of achieving thepossible good effect, then his action would not be in itself immoral. It would satisfy conditions(1) and (2). If the patient's suffering were sufficiently intense, and if it were of the kind that isappropriately managed by pharmacological interventions (see discussion of the modified prin-ciple of proportionality on page 356), then the physician's intervention would be undertaken fora proportionately grave reason and would therefore satisfy condition (4). This leaves only con-dition (3). Unlike euthanasia, aggressive pain management does not aim to bring about thepossible good effect by means of the possible bad effect of the intervention. In short, aggressivepain management does not kill the patient as a means to relieving his suffering. Rather, itadministers medication to relieve his suffering that may have the foreseen, but unintended, badeffect of hastening his death. The rule of double effect is ethically important in care of the terminally ill HIV/AIDS patient. In the previous section it was stressed that one of the theoretical ideals of palliative medicine is tohonor the dignity of the patient. We claimed that this means that patients inherently have a statusthat commands respect. This status, in turn, grounds limits on how physicians may respond totheir illness or disease. The rule of double effect adds content to this requirement in that it impliesthat physicians must never intend bad effects when treating their patients. This includes neverintending to make one's patients dead. This point has particular relevance in the discussion ofterminal sedation and its implications for the proper treatment of patients, including patients living with AIDS, at the end of life. When this rule of double effect is properly applied distinctions can be made that make clear the difference between physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia andappropriate treatment of intractable pain (which risks hastening death).

Not every medical ethicist believes that it is as important to medical practice as we have suggested.15 But the fourth condition in the rule of double effect\u2014the one that specifies that a physician must act for a proportionatelygrave reason\u2014is widely accepted even by those who reject the rule of double effect. Thereforeit can and should be considered on its own terms. So understood, we shall refer to it as theprinciple of proportionality. This principle is very important to palliative medicine. A number of writers have appealed to this principle in their explorations of when, and under what conditions, a physician's obligation to relieve terminal suffering may justifiably override his or her obligation to prevent harm. 12, 25 According to Timothy Quill, Bernard Lo, and Dan Brock, for example, the concept of proportion- ality requires that the risk of causing harm bear a direct relationship to the danger and imme-diacy of the patient's situation and expected benefit of the intervention. 25 These writers have proposed the following formulation of the proportionality principle for regulating physicians'use of vigorous pharmacological measures in the palliative care setting: [T]he greater the patient's suffering, the greater risk the physician can take of potentially contributing to the patient's death, so long as the patient understands and accepts the risk. 25 This formulation of the principle, however, does not specify what type (or types) of suffering justifies a physician's use of pharmacological interventions to treat suffering. It simply instructsphysicians to sum up the total amount or intensity of the suffering their patients are experienc-ing. In this formulation all terminal suffering is on equal footing and it is all subject to therequirements of proportionality. This principle of proportionality can be extended and refined by considering the theoretical ideal of promoting patient well-being and distinguishing between different kinds of pain and suffering and the different sorts of therapeutic interventions they may require. For example, apatient living with HIV/AIDS who is nearing the end of life may experience suffering that resultsfrom his terminal condition as well as suffering that results from his own reflection on his con-dition. Suppose, for example, that this patient blames himself for his illness and this causes himgreat inner turmoil. The resulting psychosocial suffering may be as intense as, or even moreintense than, the pain and suffering caused by his underlying physiological condition. It wouldbe a mistake, however, simply to sum up his suffering as if it were all the same. Some of thesuffering that this patient experiences\u2014what we have referred to here as psychosocial suffer-ing\u2014is not appropriately managed by aggressive pharmacological measures. Unless thesethoughts are symptoms of major depression, the patient's psychosocial suffering should be man-aged by appropriate psychological or spiritual counseling. This point is important for all patients in need of palliative care, but it has particular force when applied to patients living with HIV/AIDS. Recent studies suggest that a high proportion of pa-tients living with HIV/AIDS who desire euthanasia or assisted suicide do so for reasons otherthan the need to avoid pain. 6, 26 Depression, hopelessness, psychological anguish, distress caused by stigmatizing events related to their HIV status, and loss of community have been identified askey factors contributing to the suffering of these patients. 26 These forms of suffering, however, are not appropriately managed by high-dose narcotics.14, 27 This strongly suggests 10:20 Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 17: Ethical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 357cians who treat patients living with HIV/AIDS at the end of life should not rely on a simple formulation of the proportionality principle if they are to diagnose and treat their patients' suffering appropriately. A reformulation of the principle of proportionality that takes these issues into account follows: A physician's therapeutic response to terminal suffering is justified, even if it foreseeably hastens the patient's death, if and only if (1) the measures implemented properly correspond to the intensity of the patient's suffering; (2) the measures implemented are appropriate for the type of suffering the patient is experiencing;and (3) the patient understands and accepts the risks associated with the measures. 14 Clearly, the word \"appropriate\" in the second clause of this principle is crucial. It should beunderstood in light of the interest the patient may have in being restored (as much as theircondition permits) to a state of psychosocial well-being. As has been suggested, one importantway in which this interest can be ignored is when physicians prescribe high-dose narcotics totreat psychosocial suffering. Such interventions are effective in the sense that they alleviatesuffering, but they are inappropriate in that the restorative interests of patients are ignored orset back. The requirement that the therapeutic measure be appropriate to the kind of suffering the pa- tient is experiencing calls for discrimination on the part of the physician in diagnosing suffer-ing. In particular, it enjoins the physician to attempt to distinguish between the pain and suffer-ing that is caused by the underlying physiological condition of the patient and psychosocialforms of suffering. 5, 14, 27, 28 Additionally this modified principle of proportionality requires physicians to recognize the lim- its of their medical authority. Physicians can fulfill their duty to relieve certain types of suffer- ing by relying solely on pharmacological measures, but these measures are inappropriate re-sponses to other forms of terminal suffering that are likely to be experienced by patients livingwith HIV/AIDS. With respect to psychosocial suffering, patients may need other measures suchas counseling or spiritual support. 5, 14, 28, 29 Some physicians are skilled in providing these inter- ventions, but many are not. For those who are not, they best fulfill their obligation to relieve thiskind of terminal suffering by involving other members of the palliative care team in the care ofthe patient. The modified principle of proportionality therefore differs significantly from the simple formu- lation of the principle of proportionality introduced at the beginning of this section. It providesa more precise response to the specific types of ethical dilemmas surrounding pain and suffer-ing that clinicians are likely to encounter in the palliative care context. These include dilem-mas surrounding the use of terminal sedation and other measures that go beyond routine clini-cal interventions. Different types of suffering at the end of life may call for different therapeuticinterventions. Thus, to comply with this reformulated principle of proportionality, physicianstreating patients living with HIV/AIDS must develop skill in working as a member of an interdis-ciplinary team as well as in diagnosing, and appropriately attending to, the different types ofsuffering present at the end of life. The training clinicians should receive to develop these clini-cal skills is addressed in detail in other chapters of this guide. Chpt 17 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 35726 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 17: Ethical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 358CASE STUDIES The following three cases are presented to illustrate how the theoretical ideals and ethical principles that have been discussed can be brought to bear on clinical decisionmaking. Case 1: AIDS, Patient Confidentiality, and Surrogate Authority Mr. A is 62 years old, is HIV positive, and has hepatitis C cirrhosis and chronic renalinsufficiency. He has been on antiretroviral therapy since his diagnosis of HIV. Hehas attended clinic appointments regularly and he has stated that he does not wantanyone in his family to know that he is HIV seropositive. End-of-life care issues werenot documented in the record of these visits and Mr. A did not assign a durable powerof attorney for health care nor did he write a living will. After being admitted to the hospital, Mr. A was eventually transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure and anoxic encephalopathy. After numerousfailed attempts at extubation, the medical team requested that the ear, nose, andthroat (ENT) team evaluate the patient for tracheostomy. At this point a familymeeting was held. In attendance were the patient's wife and two children. Thepatient's wife was the court-appointed surrogate decisionmaker for Mr. A and sheconsented to the tracheostomy. Given Mr. A 's previously expressed wish to keep hisHIV status confidential, the ICU physicians felt an obligation not to disclose thisinformation to Mr. A's wife. The ENT surgeons, however, objected that she could notgive informed consent to the tracheostomy unless she were informed of her husband'sHIV status. They believed that Mr. A had active AIDS, and was not merely HIV posi-tive, and that his surrogate decisionmaker needed to know this. An ethics consult was called. 30 The central ethical question raised by this case is how physicians can respect a patient's inter- est in keeping his HIV status confidential when it conflicts with his surrogate's right to have full information about his condition. The patient's interest in confidentiality is an example of a nonphenomenological interest. Respecting this interest serves the patient's well-being. Thisremains true even when the patient has become incapacitated. The surrogate's right to be fullyinformed, however, is also an important right that serves both the patient's autonomy and hiswell-being. Finally, this case underscores the importance of the principle of deliberation for thepalliative care of patients living with HIV/AIDS. There is no clear consensus as to how this case should be resolved. Some have argued that if the knowledge that Mr. A is HIV positive is reasonably thought to be relevant to the medical deci- sions the surrogate decisionmaker must make, then this information must be disclosed to the surrogate. 30 Physicians have an ethical, and in many states a legal, duty to ensure that surro- gates have complete and accurate information on which to base their decisions.30, 31 This duty is not defeated by the patient's interest in confidentiality. The patient's interest in confidentiality,while certainly important, is not absolute. It can be overridden for a number of reasons. 32 For example, health care providers are required to report certain sexually transmitted diseases topublic health authorities to allow for contact tracing. 12 Additionally, many state surrogacy stat- utes grant the surrogate the right to access the patient's medical records.30 Thus, some con- clude that if people with HIV/AIDS do not wish to have their condition disclosed to family mem- Chpt 17 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 17: Ethical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 359bers, they must take active steps such as executing an advance directive or executing a health care proxy. This would assure that adequate care would be provided should they become inca- pacitated and that their interest in confidentiality would be fully protected.33 Others, however, maintain that the patient's interest in confidentiality is not defeated by the surrogate's need tohave full relevant medical information. They point out that given the fact that society has tendedto stigmatize those who have AIDS, the presumption in favor of patient confidentiality is espe-cially strong in this kind of case. 34, 35 The intent of this case is not to resolve the ethical dilemma but to demonstrate how deliberativedecisionmaking could have prevented it. It is clear that physicians and patients must devisestrategies to avoid this kind of situation. The principle of deliberation is critical to such an approach. The fundamental mistake in Mr. A's case was made prior to his becoming incapaci- tated. His physician should have discussed with him early on the possible limits to patientconfidentiality. He should have helped Mr. A understand that if he became incapacitated, thenhis surrogate decisionmaker would need to be fully informed about his condition. With this inmind, Mr. A and his physician could have discussed possible options for protecting his interestin not disclosing his HIV status. Empirical data suggest that virtually all persons with HIV dodisclose their diagnosis to at least one nonphysician. 36 It is very likely, then, that there was some person who knew about his HIV status that Mr. A could have appointed as a surrogatedecisionmaker. Alternatively, Mr. A could have written an advance directive that appointed asurrogate, but explicitly limited the surrogate's right to have full information. 30 End-of-life decisionmaking is never easy for either the health care provider or the patient. Thisis especially true for physicians caring for patients who are HIV positive. 16, 18, 20 Because this disease is becoming increasingly chronic in nature, physicians may be tempted to put off havingthese discussions until late in the course of the patient's illness. 30 Moreover, they may be tempted to allow the health care surrogacy laws that many States have enacted in recent years to substi-tute for more deliberative discussions about durable powers of attorney for health care. 30 How- ever, given the importance of the interests involved, health care surrogacy laws are a poor sub- stitute for deliberative discussion between physicians and patients. To avoid the type of conflictillustrated by Mr. A's case, physicians should adhere to the principle of deliberation. 30 Specifi- cally, they should take an active role in initiating discussions about advance care planning. This is the best strategy for respecting both the rights of patients and the duties of surrogates. Case 2: AIDS, End-of-Life Suffering, and Terminal Sedation Mr. B is a 38-year-old patient who was first identified as HIV positive 10 years ago. Mr. B's condition has deteriorated over time and he has been admitted to the ICU aftercontracting pneumonia. Although his pain can be managed, Mr. B is bed-bound andnear death. He is not clinically anxious or depressed, and a consulting psychiatristasserts that he retains decisionmaking capacity. Mr. B fears what he sees as theimpending loss of control over his life and becoming a burden to his family. Herepeatedly asks his physician to induce a barbiturate coma, and to provide no artifi-cial hydration or nutrition. After a prolonged consent discussion, his physician agrees to do so. Mr. B dies 14 days later. Chpt 17 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 35926 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 17: Ethical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 360An important goal of palliative medicine is to ensure that patients do not needlessly suffer in the dying process. Those living with HIV or AIDS often express the worry that their deaths will be slow and painful.26 Many experience hopelessness, disintegration of self, and a loss of commu- nity. In responding to the terminal suffering of these patients, physicians frequently experiencean ethical conflict between their duty to relieve suffering and their duty not to cause harm. Thephysician in this case administered terminal or palliative sedation. 14, 25, 27, An important ethical question for palliative care physicians who treat patients living with HIV/AIDS is when, if ever,such a practice is justified and can be distinguished from physician-assisted suicide. Some may hold that because he respects the desires of his patient, the physician in this case acted correctly. However, as we have argued above, to honor the dignity of patients, physicians must do more than respect their autonomy. Recourse to the rule of double effect, accordingly, can assist the physician in thinking about what is morally permitted in this kind of case. It might be held that in administering terminal sedation Mr. B's physician acted consistently with the rule of double effect in that he did not intend to hasten Mr. B's death but, rather,wanted to relieve his terminal suffering. This is a misapplication of the rule of double effect. Itis clear from the description of the case that even if the physician's ultimate objective is torelieve Mr. B's suffering, he intends to hasten his death as a means to this objective. Importantly,however, the rule of double effect holds that one should never intend the bad effect of an intervention whether as an end itself or as a means to an end. This remains true even though Mr. B's physician intends his death as a means for bringing about an important treatment goal (therelief of suffering). If the rule of double effect is a valid rule, and the physician is opposed toeuthanasia, then this intervention, even though motivated by good will, is ethically impermissible. It has been noted above that the rule of double effect is controversial and that some medical ethicists deny its validity. A further analysis of this case is therefore warranted to explore othermorally significant features. This case also raises the principle of proportionality. From the description of the case, we know that Mr. B does not suffer from unmanageable physi- cal pain but from his fear of losing control of his life and becoming a burden to his family. Thiskind of suffering is significant and can often be intense. The application of the unmodifiedprinciple of proportionality discussed (and rejected) above holds that in order to determinewhether terminal sedation would be ethically appropriate for a patient like Mr. B, the totalamount or intensity of his suffering should be quantified and weighed against the bad effect ofshortening his life. If we do this, it may then be reasonable to conclude that Mr. B's suffering issufficiently grave to warrant terminal sedation. However, a refined principle of proportionality\u2014one that discriminates between different kinds of pain and suffering\u2014would lead to a different conclusion. Mr. B experiences different kinds ofsuffering. Some of these, such as the dyspnea that results from his AIDS-related pneumonia,are appropriately managed by opioids. Other kinds of suffering , however, are not appropriatelymanaged in this way. For example, the psychosocial suffering that results from his fear of losingcontrol of his life is best managed by psychological and spiritual counseling, which may helprestore Mr. B to a state of psychosocial health. 14, 27, 28 Restoration of psychosocial health is a central goal of palliative care regardless of the stage ofillness. Patients confront many important issues in their approach to death. How should theyface death? Should they pray or not? How should they say goodbye to loved ones and familymembers? Do they have outstanding concerns that have not been addressed? Mr. B, like other Chpt 17 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 36026 picas Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 17: Ethical Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 361terminally ill patients, has an important interest in responding to these questions in a manner that is consistent with his character and considered values. He has, therefore, an important interest in being in a psychosocial condition that makes this possible.14, 28, 29 For these reasons, a refined principle of proportionality rules out terminal sedation in this case. While his suffering is intense, it would be a disproportionate and, therefore, inappropriate inter-vention to sedate Mr. B into oblivion. Importantly, it does not follow from this that terminal sedation\u2014or as we would prefer to call it, the sedation of the imminently dying\u2014is never justified. 37 There are circumstances in which hastening the death of the patient plausibly can be considered a morally permissible side effectof treating pain and suffering that is both unresponsive to standard palliative care and not ap-propriately managed by other interventions. 13 Many physicians, fearful of unwittingly partici- pating in euthanasia, have become reluctant to prescribe high-dose opioids for pain relief.23 The rule of double effect and the principle of proportionality are important to palliative medicinebecause they explain how physicians can conscientiously use potent drugs to treat terminally illpatients while maintaining a commitment to the value of human life. Case 3: The Principle of Proportionality and the Rule of Double Effect Mr. C is a 30-year-old man with end-stage osteogenic sarcoma. Cure is no longerpossible after years of struggle with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. In experthands, he has required increasing doses of morphine for pain relief. However, he hasnow developed very bothersome myoclonus as a side effect of protracted high-doseopioids. He is bed-bound, dyspneic, and near death. Standard doses of muscle relax-ants and benzodiazepines have not controlled the myoclonus and, despite adjuvantpain treatments, his pain is increasing and responds only to increasing opioids, therebyexacerbating his myoclonus. He is groggy, but alert. After a prolonged consent dis-cussion with him and his family about the risk of complete sedation, his physician\u2014who herself has principled objections to physician-assisted suicide and active eutha-nasia\u2014prescribes increasing doses of benzodiazepines until the myoclonus is con- trolled. The dose required to do so precipitates a coma. Mr. C dies 2 days later. 14 In this case the patient suffers from intractable pain that is caused by his deteriorating physi- ological condition. His physician has attempted to manage his pain by less drastic measures, but these have all failed. Mr. C is not experiencing any significant psychosocial suffering. The issue before his physician, then, is whether the need to respond to his intractable physical painand myoclonus might justify administering high doses of sedating medication. The rule of doubleeffect permits sedation in this case. Mr. C's physician has a duty to treat Mr. C's intractable painand the myoclonus that treatment has precipitated. In discharging this duty she can plausiblyconstrue an appropriate intervention (such as high doses of diazepam) that might hasten Mr.C's death to be an unintended side effect of the intervention. Thus, if relieving Mr. C's pain is aproportionately grave reason\u2014and from the description of the case it appears to be so, then Mr.C's physician can permissibly administer the sedating medication. She can do this, moreover,while consistently maintaining her principled opposition to physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia.

Although certainly not definitive, the discussion of these cases has shown howthe theoretical ideals of palliative medicine inform certain fundamental ethical principles, whichin turn provide guidance in clinical cases. These cases and the principles they illustrate are not the only ones relevant to the ethics of palliative medicine. We have not discussed a number of issues that raise important ethical prob- lems for palliative care physicians, such as issues that surround decisions to withdraw or with-hold medical interventions. To be sure, the principles that we have discussed in this chapter arerelevant to these issues. For example, according to the rule of double effect, a physician shouldnot withhold food and fluids from his patient as a means to hasten the patient's death. Nonethe-less, she could withhold or withdraw feeding tube treatment from a patient whose medical con-dition had made him unable to eat if the treatment were disproportionately burdensome, even ifthis would forseeably (but unintentionally) shorten the lifespan of the patient. We have notattempted to provide a full discussion of these issues here. The cases that we have discussed in detail, however, are particularly important for several rea- sons. Studies indicate that ineffective communication between physicians and their dying pa-tients is a major cause of inappropriate care for dying patients. 6 Likewise, uncertainty over the rule of double effect has been cited as a key factor in the inadequate control of distressingsymptoms in terminally ill patients. 23 And\u2014for HIV and AIDS patients in particular\u2014the issue of patient confidentiality remains a vital one as physicians struggle to honor the dignity andpromote the well-being of their patients as they approach death. 38, 39 With respect to each of these pressing issues, a good understanding of the considerations discussed in this chapter isessential if health care providers are to respond adequately to the difficult ethical challengesthey now confront, and will continue to confront, in treating AIDS patients.

One lesson learned is the necessity of addressing legal and financial matters as early andcomprehensively as possible. This is crucial to maximizing the ability of people living with HIV toaccess financial and health care resources, maintain control over their lives, and protect theirloved ones. At the advent of the AIDS crisis, too many people died without the benefit of planningaround legal and financial issues. Two decades of battling a disease concentrated disproportionatelywithin marginalized communities has made clear the importance of using all the legal and financialtools available, and fighting to expand the available legal and financial options whenever necessary,so that people living with HIV can enjoy the autonomy and sense of security to which they areentitled. The goal of this chapter is to provide information about the legal and financial planningtools available to people with advanced terminal HIV disease, although it is important to note thatthese tools are equally relevant for those individuals in the earlier stages of HIV/AIDS.Fortunately, today there are many legal and financial planning options that provide people livingwith HIV in the United States with the power to make critical decisions involving their healthcare, finances, dependent children, and end of life options. Expanded access to Medicaid andother government-funded programs provides health care access to people living with HIV withoutrequiring an AIDS diagnosis. Newly created government and private insurance programs givemany people living with HIV access to much-needed financial support. Recently enacted standbyguardianship laws in several States make it possible for a parent to appoint a caretaker for herchildren during periods of incapacity without forcing her to surrender her own parental rightsprematurely. Court cases in many States have legitimized living wills, allowing for the terminationof artificial life support when an individual has clearly expressed such a preference. Carefullydrafted and properly executed wills provide people living with HIV with the opportunity to directthe disposition of their assets and personal belongings upon death.For people living with HIV, estate and financial planning is central to maximizing control overpersonal decisionmaking and financial resources. Delaying important legal decisions too oftenresults in the wishes of the person living with HIV being thwarted. For example, if it is believedthat a standby or temporary guardian may be needed to care for children, delay in completingthe legal process necessary to appoint one could eventually result in the court appointing aguardian other than the one the parent intended. Even worse, children could be placed in Statecustody. Similarly, when a person living with HIV fails to execute a health care proxy naming herbest friend as her agent, it is likely that her health care providers will turn to her nearest biologicalrelatives to make important medical decisions on her behalf. When a person living with HIVleaves employment and fails to exercise her rights to continued group health insurance (underthe Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, or COBRA), access to the mostcost-effective and comprehensive health care coverage may be lost. Finally, if a person livingwith HIV lets a disability insurance policy lapse because of her inability to pay the premium,when in fact the policy contained a premium waiver for disabled people, unnecessary financialhardships may ensue.Chapter 18. Robert Greenwald, JD, and AM 365A Clinical Guide and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 366All of the programs and legal options described in this chapter can enhance the sense of well- being of a person living with HIV. Knowing that all potential avenues of support have been utilized and that plans are in place in the event of incapacity or death is a part of the larger effort to ensure that persons with HIV live with respect and dignity. PART 1. ACCESSING INCOME AND HEALTH CARE SUPPORT PROGRAMS Federal and State governments and the private insurance industry offer a broad range of programsdesigned to ensure that disabled individuals, including those living with HIV, have access tofinancial resources and health care and treatment programs. These programs provide supportto people living with HIV, particularly those who find themselves without the ability to affordbasic necessities, such as food, shelter, and clothing, let alone meet the high costs associatedwith the care and treatment of a debilitating illness such as HIV. A. INCOME SUPPORT 1. Federal Social Security Programs The Federal Social Security Administration (SSA) provides two types of income support programs for disabled individuals: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and SupplementalSecurity Income (SSI). Both programs provide financial support on a monthly basis to disabledindividuals. Individuals living with HIV may be eligible for one of these programs or both. In order to be eligible for either SSI or SSDI a range of rules apply. For both programs an individual must be permanently and totally disabled. The SSA defines disability as a severe medical condition(physical or mental) that prevents or is expected to prevent an individual from engaging in any substantial gainful activity for 12 or more consecutive months, or will result in death. An AIDS diagnosis will often qualify an individual as disabled. The additional eligibility rules for both programsare discussed in detail below. More information on these programs is also available through theSSA at 1 (800) 772-1213 or on the SSA web site at www.ssa.gov. Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI or SSD) SSDI, often shortened to SSD, is a governmental disability insurance program. In addition to the eligibility requirement that an individual must be permanently and totally disabled as defined by the SSA, successful applicants must have a lawful immigration status andhave a sufficient work history. Since SSDI is a federal insurance program and not a need-based program an individual's income or assets generally do not effect eligibility or monthlybenefit payments. The SSDI program pays a monthly benefit to disabled individuals with HIV who have made sufficient Social Security contributions through payroll deductions or self-employment taxpremiums (under the Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or FICA). What qualifies as sufficient contributions depends upon an individual's age at the time she or he became disabled. \u007f Those 31 years of age or older must have paid sufficient taxes for at least 20 of the last 40 3-month periods or \"quarters.\" \u007f Those between the ages of 24 and 30 must have paid sufficient taxes for at least half of the quarters between their 24 th birthday and the time of disability. Chpt 18 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 36626 picas Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 367\u007f Those under 24 must have paid sufficient taxes for at least six quarters during the 3 years before becoming disabled. Once determined to be eligible, an individual with HIV is entitled to monthly SSDI payments until death or until the individual is no longer disabled. An individual's monthlySSDI benefit can range from a couple of hundred dollars a month to over $1500 per month.Monthly SSDI benefit levels vary greatly depending upon Social Security contributions,age at the onset of disability and date of disability. A monthly benefit is also available forthe dependent spouse or children of an SSDI recipient. There is a 5-month waiting period for SSDI. Monthly disability payments begin at the start of the 6 th month after the onset of disability. Upon applying for SSDI an individual may be entitled to past due benefits if the SSA determines that the individual becamedisabled prior to application. Past due benefits are limited to up to 12 months. Receiving past due SSDI benefits can have an adverse impact on an individual's SSI and Medicaid eligibility since both SSI and Medicaid are need-based programs with strictasset limits for eligibility. In such circumstances, consulting with a benefits expert orattorney is advised as steps can be taken to maximize a person's ability to both retainassets and remain eligible for need-based programs. After a disabled person has received SSDI for 24 months, she is automatically entitled to Medicare coverage. The total Medicare waiting period for an SSDI recipient is 29 months,given the 5-month waiting period for SSDI benefits to begin. Depending upon her financialstatus, an individual may also be eligible for Medicaid. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) SSI is a need-based program that provides monthly benefits to individuals who are disabled, blind, or over 65 years old and who have limited income and assets. As with SSDI, oncedetermined to be eligible for SSI, an individual with HIV is entitled to monthly paymentsuntil death or until the individual is no longer disabled. For an individual living with HIV, in addition to the requirement that she must be permanently and totally disabled as defined by the SSA, there are strict citizenship and immigration status rules, and income and asset restrictions. In general, in order to be eligible to receive SSI payments an individual must be a U.S. citizen, a noncitizen who was receiving SSI on 8/22/96, or a lawfully present noncitizenwho entered the U.S. before 8/22/96. An individual cannot have more than $2000 in assets, excluding a home (if the individual resides there), and a car (if it is regularly used for transportation to medical appointments).If an individual is married and living with a spouse the asset limit is $3,000. The assetlimit is $5,000 for a disabled child living with two parents. Strict income limits also apply. To be eligible for SSI an individual's monthly \"countable income\" must be less than her SSI benefit level. Countable income over an individual'sSSI benefit level will result in ineligibility for SSI for each month in which the income is received. Not every dollar received or earned by a disabled individual is countable income. In general, countable income includes unearned income (i.e., interest and dividends)and the value of in-kind gifts and services, minus a $20 set-aside. It also includes earned Chpt 18 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 367A Clinical Guide and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 368income, minus the $20 set-aside, minus the first $65 in earned income and one-half of the remainder. The calculations are a bit complicated, so here are a few examples: \u007f John is a disabled individual eligible to receive $530 per month in SSI benefits. John receives $25 each month as a gift from his sister and earns $25 in interest from a smallinvestment account he has. John will receive $500 per month in SSI. ($50 in-kindincome - $20 set aside = $30 deducted from his original $530 SSI award = $500.) \u007f Jane is a disabled single individual eligible to receive $530 per month in SSI benefits. She has started a small home business and earns $245 per month. Jane will receive$450 in SSI. ($245 in earned income - $20 set-aside - $65 earned income exclusion =$160. One-half of the $160 =$80 of countable income. The original SSI award of $530- $80 of countable earned income = $450.) A base SSI monthly benefit amount is set by the SSA, and State governments have the option to increase that amount through a State supplement. Nineteen States provideState supplementary SSI payments increasing the total SSI benefit received. Total SSI benefits therefore vary from State to State. Benefit levels also depend upon one's living arrangements. For example, an individual who lives in someone else's household willreceive SSI at a lower level than an individual who lives alone. SSI will readjust the levelof payment if an individual's living arrangements change. The Federal SSA monthly benefitfor SSI is $530 for a single individual, and $398 for a member of a couple, who does notlive in another person's household. Only the disabled person may receive SSI. There are no benefits available for spouses or dependent children of a disabled person, unless they are also disabled. The disability of one or more parents may, however, entitle the remaining family members to some other form of government assistance. (See discussion of TANF below.) It is very important thatindividuals apply for SSI as soon as possible since there are no retroactive SSI benefits. In many States, recipients of SSI are automatically eligible for Medicaid. In other States, an SSI recipient must independently apply for Medicaid. In those States, Medicaid applications aregenerally successful as most States use the same criteria for determining Medicaid eligibility asthe SSA uses for SSI eligibility. 2. Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) TANF is an income assistance program funded and regulated by both the Federal and State governments. The program provides cash and automatic medical assistance to poor families sothey can provide basic necessities for their children. Because TANF is administered by Statewelfare departments, eligibility, calculation of benefits, work requirements, and exemptionsvary from State to State. Generally, TANF provides assistance to eligible families consisting of a single parent and one or more minor children. Most States also provide assistance to families with two parents (whereone parent is disabled or unemployed, or income is below a given level), families where a childlives with a relative who is not a parent, and pregnant women. Nearly all States will allow somechildren, exclusive of any parent or guardian, to qualify for assistance. Families are eligible for cash assistance if their income is below the established standard. Most States also take assets, excluding the family home, into consideration. In some States, receipt Chpt 18 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 36826 picas Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 369of SSI benefits may affect eligibility. The maximum benefit amount varies according to family size, and is calculated according to State-determined guidelines. One of TANF's key provisions is the time limit. Eligible families are permanently barred from the program after receiving assistance for 5 years. However, many States make exceptions forchild-only cases, and families where a parent or guardian is disabled. The TANF standard ofdisability varies from State to State, although in many States it is an easier standard to meetthan the SSI disability standard in that it only requires incapacity reducing or eliminating aparent's ability to work for at least 30 days. TANF was created in 1996, to replace Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Act of 1996 (often referred to as welfarereform). Families eligible for TANF may also be eligible for Food Stamps, Women, Infants andChildren (WIC), School Breakfast and Lunch, Fuel Assistance and other programs available tolow-income persons. 3. Other State-Run Income Support Programs Many States provide need-based income support programs to individuals who for a variety of reasons are ineligible for SSI or TANF. These programs are wholly funded by States and thereforeeligibility rules and program benefits vary from State to State. Several States operate programsthat provide income support to individuals, including those living with HIV, who do not meet theSSI or TANF disability requirements. In some States, citizenship or immigration statusrequirements are more flexible. In general, information on the programs that exist in your Stateis available through the State welfare office and/or community-based AIDS organizations. 4. Private Disability Insurance Private disability insurance is designed to replace income lost as a result of a health condition that prevents an individual from working. The insurance coverage is generally either short- term(up to 2 years) or long-term (up to age 65 or for life). For those who have a private disabilityinsurance policy, upon disability, the policy will generally pay a monthly income benefit equal toa percentage of an individual's predisability earnings or to a maximum dollar amount. Coverage terms vary greatly as private disability insurance companies have tremendous flexibility in setting the parameters of coverage. Policies include varying definitions of disability. Somepolicies consider a person disabled if she is unable to perform the main duties of her presentjob, others consider a person disabled only if she is unable to do any job. Policies include varyingqualification periods. Some policies require that an individual be disabled for 30 days before receiving benefits, others preclude coverage for the first year of disability. Some policies include disability premium waivers that waive the payment of premiums after a person has been disabledand receiving benefits for a specific period of time. (It is extremely important to determinewhether such a provision exists. Many individuals let their policies lapse and lose coveragebecause they could not afford the payments when in fact premiums could have been waived withcoverage remaining in place.) To determine the exact terms and conditions of a specific policyit is often necessary to obtain a copy of the policy and have it reviewed by an attorney. Disability insurance policies are generally obtained three ways: employer programs, group programs, and individual programs. Employer programs are the most common. They are disability insurance policies provided through an individual's employment. These policies vary from Chpt 18 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 369A Clinical Guide and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 370employer to employer and not all employers have disability coverage for their employees. Even if a disabled individual is no longer employed, it is important to investigate whether or not she was part of an employer program. Often, individuals have coverage, leave their job because of disability, and never realize that they are entitled to monthly income from a disability insurancepolicy. If an individual has left her employment as a result of disability she may still be coveredunder the group plan if she was qualified for the coverage at the time she was an employee.Coverage will in part depend upon whether or not the policy contains a requirement that anapplication take place within a specified timeframe after the onset of disability. Group programs are disability insurance policies provided through various professional, industry, fraternal, and other affiliation groups. Individual policies are purchased directly by an individual. In most cases, an individual will know if she purchased a group or individual policy as an individual tends to pay her own premiums and receives statements under these plans. 5. Life Insurance: Accelerated Benefits and Viatication While life insurance polices are generally designed to provide income support to the survivors of a deceased life insurance policy holder, they can also provide much-needed income support toa person living with HIV. Many life insurance policies include an accelerated benefits provisionthat allows a terminally ill person with HIV to obtain a portion of the life insurance proceeds that would normally be reserved for the surviving beneficiaries. The remaining proceeds go to the surviving beneficiaries upon the terminally ill person's death. In general, in acceleratedbenefits provisions, the definition of terminally ill is defined strictly as a life expectancy of1 year or less. In addition, private viatical settlement companies are often willing to purchase the life insurance of a person living with HIV and pay a percentage of the value of the policy. The standard of whatconstitutes terminal illness is more flexible in viatication, but it is important to note that if aperson's life expectancy is greater than 2 years the proceeds received will be taxable for Federaltax purposes. With viatication, the policyholder sells the policy to the viatical settlement companyand upon the policyholder's death all of the life insurance proceeds are distributed to the company. An individual considering either an accelerated benefit or viatication should consult with an attorney or benefits expert. The viatical settlement industry, in particular, is largely unregulatedand the transaction requires oversight to ensure that a person living with HIV receives satisfactoryterms of sale. B. HEALTH CARE ACCESS SUPPORT 1. Medicare Medicare is government health insurance covering people over 65, the blind, and the disabled. Since it is a Federally administered program, Medicare rules are consistent throughout thecountry. Medicare coverage consists of two parts: Part A (which is free) covers limited hospital care, skilled nursing care, and hospice care; and Part B (which is optional and requires a monthlypremium) covers doctor's services, outpatient hospital services, and other medical services. Ifan individual elects Part B coverage a monthly premium is deducted from the SSDI payment,although some States have a program for people living with HIV that covers the cost. Presently,neither Part A nor Part B covers outpatient pharmaceutical drugs. Chpt 18 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 37026 picas Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 371Some individuals who are covered by Medicare buy private insurance, called \"Medigap policies,\" to cover medical costs not covered by Medicare. Medigap policies vary greatly, but many cover the costs of Medicare deductibles and/or health services and pharmaceuticals not covered by Medicare. Several States have a program that will pay for the purchasing of a Medigap policy fora person living with HIV. Medicare Hospice Benefit The Medicare program also offers a hospice benefit for those who have a terminal illnesswith a life expectancy of 6 months or less. The hospice benefit provides a range of valuableservices, all of which concentrate on improving an individual's quality of life as much as possible during the end stages of a terminal illness. The Medicare hospice benefit covers four categories of care: 1) routine home care, 2) continuous home-based nursing care, 3)respite care, and 4) general inpatient palliative care related to terminal illness. The hospicebenefit includes services provided by a broad range of caregivers, including physicians,nurses, therapists, home health aides, clergy, social workers, and counselors. It also coversthe purchase or rental of any durable medical equipment necessary to care for the individualin the home. In addition, the program covers the costs of services not typically covered byMedicare such as outpatient drugs, respite care, custodial care, and continuous nursingcare in the home during medical emergencies. The Medicare hospice benefit generallycovers all these programs and services in full. The amount of care received depends on theneeds of the individual and the resources of the hospice-Medicare sets no maximum orminimum limits on the amount of care provided. There may be small copayments for respite care or prescription drugs. The Medicare hospice benefit does not cover curative treatment of terminal conditions for individuals who have elected hospice care. The programdoes, however, pay for curative treatment for unrelated conditions, such as injuries resultingfrom an accident or a fall. In order to qualify for the Medicare hospice benefit, individuals must satisfy three basic program requirements. They must 1) have Medicare Part A, 2) be certified by their attendingphysician and the medical director of a Medicare-certified hospice to have an advanced,terminal illness with a life expectancy of 6 months or less if the disease runs its normalcourse, and 3) consent in writing to choosing palliative care rather than curative care.Despite these requirements, it is important to note that patients DO NOT NEED to be in a severely deteriorated physical condition or in an irreversible medical crisis in order to choose hospice. Choosing hospice earlier in the process, as long as the above requirementsare met, often results in greater comfort and satisfaction for individuals suffering from achronic, terminal condition. Moreover, a patient's decision to pursue hospice care ratherthan curative care is not final. Any individual who has chosen hospice may return tocurative treatment under the traditional Medicare program at any time by withdrawingfrom the hospice program. Hospice care is divided into the following benefit periods: two 90-day benefit periods and an unlimited number of 60-day periods. These benefit periods may be used continuously or at separate intervals. Regardless of how an individual's periods of hospice care aretimed, she must be certified as terminally ill with a life expectancy of 6 months or less atthe beginning of each period by the medical director of the hospice. If an individual choosesto withdraw from hospice during a benefit period, then any remaining days in that benefit Chpt 18 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 371A Clinical Guide and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 372period are lost. For example, a patient who opts out of hospice care in the middle of the second 90-day benefit period loses the remaining days in that period, but is still eligible for an unlimited number of 60-day periods. If an individual has chosen hospice and her prognosis changes during the course of hospice enrollment, the hospice may discharge heror not recertify her for a subsequent benefit period. Medicare-certified hospices may be located by contacting the State Health Department, the discharge planning office of a hospital, or the National Medicare Hotline at 1-800-MEDICARE. Information about hospice care is also available from the Hospice Associationof America at (202) 546-4759 or the National Hospice Organization at 1-800-658-8898. 2. Medicaid Medicaid is government health insurance funded jointly by the Federal and State governments and administered by State government. Under State administration, States have many optionsregarding who is covered by the program and what services are provided. Medicaid rules varygreatly from State to State. All States must provide the following Federally mandated Medicaid services: inpatient hospital services, outpatient hospital services, laboratory and x-ray services, skilled nursing facility services, physician's services, early and periodic screening, diagnosis and testing services, andfamily planning services and supplies. Federally optional Medicaid services include the following: prescribed drugs; hospice services; home health care services; nursing home services and intermediate care facility services; durablemedical goods; private day nursing physical,occupational and speech therapy; optometrists; and hearing aids. In general, Medicaid's resource or asset limitations are similar to the SSI limitations. To be eligible for Medicaid an individual cannot have more than $2000 in assets, excluding a home (ifthe individual resides there), a car (valued at $4,500 or higher if it is regularly used fortransportation to medical appointments), and a few other exceptions. (Under some circumstancesthere are strict ineligibility rules regarding the transferring of assets in an attempt to secureMedicaid eligibility. A transfer of assets to meet Medicaid's resource rules could result in aprolonged period of ineligibility and thus should never be attempted without seeking professionalguidance.) There is no income limitation for Medicaid eligibility. However, if an individual's countable income exceeds the SSI level, most States will consider this surplus income and not pay for anequivalent value of medical expenses. Historically, the path to Medicaid eligibility for disabled individuals was closely tied to SSI eligibility. More recently, States, with the cooperation of the Federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, have implemented health care access expansions and waivers. In several States, pre-disabled persons with HIV are now eligible for Medicaid. In others, income and assetrestrictions have been eased, allowing those with greater resources access to Medicaid. Since the rules regarding access to Medicaid and the range of services provided vary greatly from State to State it is important to contact the State Medicaid office to determine the parametersof the program in your State and to obtain assistance with the application process.

Private Health Insurance Many individuals have private health insurance policies that provide a range of health care benefits. In most cases, individuals have obtained private group health insurance through theirjobs or are covered because a family member has group insurance coverage from work. In someinstances, individuals have purchased their own individual policies. In either case, the types ofpolices offered can differ widely in terms of cost and coverage. Private insurance companiesoffer a broad range of plans so the particular terms will depend upon the plan selected. Many health insurance policies include benefits limits, including specific limits on coverage or a maximum benefit for the policy as a whole. Others include copayments, deductibles or other\"out-of-pocket\" expenses that an individual is responsible for paying. Some allow individuals tochoose any doctor, whereas others restrict access to health care professionals under contract with the plan. Understanding the specific health insurance terms under any individual policy is difficult. Often questions can be answered by customer service staff provided by the insurance company orthrough the human resources department of an employer who provides group health insurance.An in-depth analysis of the terms of a policy often requires obtaining a copy of the policy forreview by an attorney or benefits expert. Finally, many States operate programs that pay the private health insurance premiums for people living with HIV. It is, therefore, always important to see if such a \"buy-in\" program exists before anindividual decides to terminate her private health insurance. The specific eligibility rules varyfrom State to State, but some cover individuals receiving and/or eligible for SSI, SSDI, privatedisability insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare. For many people living with HIV buy-in programsrepresent an opportunity to maintain their preferred choice of health care access and support. 4. The Consolidated Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) COBRA is a Federal law that requires employers who sponsor a group health plan to allow their employees and/or their dependents to remain covered under the group plan after theyleave employment or are no longer qualified for coverage under the plan's rules. In general,continued coverage is available to employees who were covered under the plan and reduce theirwork hours, leave their employment, or are terminated for reasons other than gross misconduct.This continuation of coverage is also available to the spouse and/or dependent children of theemployee if they were covered under the plan. This coverage is very important because accessto group health insurance is generally cost-effective and provides a broader range of benefitsthan those typically found in individual policies. For many disabled individuals leaving employment, COBRA offers the most cost-effective and comprehensive health insurance available. This is true despite the fact that individuals aregenerally required to pay the premiums or costs of this private group health insurance.(As discussed above, in the private insurance section, many States have programs that will coverthese costs.) In the context of HIV, whether paid for through a government program or by an individual, COBRA offers much-needed insurance coverage to those ineligible for the need-based Medicaid program. For those eligible for Medicare through SSDI, COBRA can provide coverage during the 29-month Medicare waiting period. (See SSDI discussion on page 366 for an explanation of thewaiting period.) Chpt 18 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 373A and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 374In general, under Federal law, COBRA applies to employers who offer a group health care plan and employ 20 or more employees. Generally exempt are churches, small employers who employ less than 20 people, and the Federal government. COBRA does not apply to life insurance or disability insurance plans. Several States, however, have COBRA laws that cover employeeswith less than 20 employees, so it is important to check if your State has such a law. COBRA coverage must be elected by the later of 60 days after leaving employment or within 60 days of receiving notice of COBRA rights by the employer. Employers are legally required toprovide written notice of COBRA rights within 45 days after a person loses coverage. The length of COBRA coverage depends upon several factors. In general, COBRA coverage lasts for 18 months. For those determined to be disabled by the Social Security Administration forSSI or SSDI purposes, at any time within the initial 18-month period, COBRA is extended to 29months. In general, COBRA coverage is 36 months in the event of the death of a covered employee,for the loss of dependent child status under the plan, for divorce or legal separation of thecovered employee, or when the covered employee becomes eligible for Medicare. 5. State-Run Health Care and Treatment Programs Many States support health care programs for individuals living with HIV who have no other means of accessing treatment. Through a combination of Federal and State funding, includingthe Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act, many States operateprograms that provide early intervention health care and access to medications. These programsare administered by States and, therefore, the services provided vary greatly. Information onthe programs in your State is available through the State health department and/or community-based AIDS organizations. PART 2. LEGAL OPTIONS FOR MAXIMIZING CONTROL OVER DECISIONMAKING DURING PERIODS OF INCAPACITY AND IN DEATH Several important legal tools are available to people living with HIV who are concerned with maintaining control over important personal, financial, and health-related decisions. Healthcare proxies, living wills (also known as directives to physicians), powers of attorney anddeclarations as to remains all provide an individual living with HIV with the opportunity toclearly express her wishes with respect to crucial personal matters. They also allow a personliving with HIV to appoint a trusted friend or family member to carry out those wishes on herbehalf. A critical point regarding each of these legal options is that none of them acts to replace the individual's own judgment or curtails her decisionmaking capacity so long as she remainscompetent and able to act on her own behalf . All of the documents are easily amendable and revocable, so a person can change her mind about any decisions at any time. Generally, torevoke the document any person previously appointed should be notified in writing of the change and the original document should be destroyed. 1. Health Care Proxy A health care proxy is a written instrument in which an individual legally delegates authority to another person (referred to as \"the agent\") to make certain health-related decisions 1/28/2003, 10:20 picas Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 375behalf. This can include conventional medical treatment decisions, decisions to change providers or to pursue a second opinion, and decisions regarding levels of pain-relieving medications and other palliative care. The agent can also make decisions regarding the priority and extent of visitation by friends and family members during periods of hospitalization. It is important to note that the health care proxy document only permits the agent to make these decisions when the individual who appointed her is either unable to make, or unable tocommunicate, those decisions herself. Indeed, a good health care proxy should contain a provisiondirecting that physicians and other health care providers make every attempt to communicatewith and solicit a response from the patient first, before relying on the agent to act on thepatient's behalf. Of course, the patient may also choose to direct her health care providers toconsult with or defer to the health care agent even during times when the patient is able tocommunicate but finds it difficult or stressful to do so. What is critical in such a situation is thatthe choice to include the agent remains firmly with the patient, so long as she remains legally competent and able to communicate. In the absence of a properly executed health care proxy, decisionmaking authority regarding health-related matters generally defaults to a person's \"next of kin,\" often the spouse or theclosest adult biological family member that can be found. The advantage of the health careproxy is that it vests control in a trusted individual specifically chosen by the patient, thusincreasing the likelihood that the patient's wishes regarding health-related matters will behonored. A person living with HIV is free to choose any competent adult to serve as her healthcare proxy. One can also name two co-agents in the health care proxy, who can share the responsibility for decisionmaking. A person naming two agents is advised to evaluate the ability of the two agents to work together and to consider naming one whose decision would control inthe event of a disagreement. It is not advisable for a person to appoint his or her health careprovider as a health care proxy. The primary purpose of the appointment is to choose someonewith a strong personal relationship to the person living with HIV, who can work with the providerto make difficult health care decisions. An additional advantage of a health care proxy is that it can be specifically tailored to express a person's preferences, beliefs, and instructions regarding health-related matters. This has the benefit of giving a person living with HIV an opportunity to clearly communicate her wishes tothe health care agent before a health-related crisis occurs. Such communication between thepatient living with HIV and her health care proxy is crucial, because the health care proxy's jobis to make health care decisions that accurately reflect the preferences and wishes of the patient,and not the proxy's own preferences. In most States, the health care proxy is authorized by statute and that statute will specify the mechanical requirements that must be met in order for the document to be legally valid. Typical requirements include the number of witnesses that must be present for the signing of the document, the minimum age of the appointed agent, and the signature of the individual makingthe appointment in one or more places on the document itself. It is recommended that thehealth care proxy document be notarized, regardless of whether notarization is a formalrequirement under a particular State's health care proxy law. Notarization lends an additionallevel of legitimacy to a document that may protect against future challenges from family membersor health care providers.

Living Will (Directive to Physicians) A living will (also known as a \"directive to physicians\" or \"advanced directive\") is a legal document authorizing the removal of artificial life-support systems for an individual who hasbeen diagnosed with brain death or whose condition has been deemed terminal and irreversible.The living will is directed to an individual's physician, and constitutes written evidence of theindividual's intent not to be kept alive by artificial means. A living will may also specify that apatient elects to forego other life prolonging treatments, such as artificial hydration and nutritionvia IV, antibiotics, and in, some cases, blood transfusions. Exceptional care should be takenwhen explaining these options and their effects to a terminally ill patient, so that the living willprecisely represents the patient's intent with respect to these life-prolonging treatment options. People living with HIV who are opposed to being placed on prolonged life support despite the occurrence of brain death or a terminal diagnosis are advised to execute a living will that clearly communicates their opposition. In the absence of a living will evidencing a clear intent, physicianscan find themselves both ethically and legally bound to do everything they can to keep a personalive - even if the person is clinically brain dead and being kept alive solely through technologicallife support measures. By the same token, many physicians, particularly those experienced inworking with people with HIV, are familiar with and generally respectful of the intent expressedby those who choose to execute living wills. It is a good idea for an individual's treating physicianto be aware of the existence of a living will when one has been prepared. Bear in mind that some hospitals with particular religious affiliations may be reluctant to honor a patient's expressed wishes even if a living will has been prepared and presented to the medicalstaff. In some cases, particularly where there is no law or statute authorizing the creation of aliving will, the religious institution that participates in setting hospital policy directs medicalstaff not to recognize living wills. Thus, people living with HIV who are strongly opposed tobeing placed on prolonged life support should consider where they receive their care, and whetherthe religious affiliation of their provider is likely to affect that provider's willingness or ability tohonor the living will. Laws in this sensitive area vary widely from State to State, and, in many States, there is no statutory authority for living wills. There have been, however, many important legal cases involvinga person's right to be taken off artificial life support and those cases have generally favoredhonoring a person's desire to terminate life support when it can be proven that the desire wasclearly expressed in advance. Still, it is advisable to work with someone familiar with the law in your particular state when preparing and executing a living will.

Durable Power of Attorney A person living with HIV may appoint someone else to manage her finances and to make economic decisions on her behalf by executing a durable power of attorney. As with the healthcare proxy, the person appointed in the power of attorney document is referred to as the \"agent.\"The person making the appointment is referred to as the \"principal.\" The power of attorneydocument can grant broad authority to the agent, allowing the agent to have broad access to andcontrol over the principal's financial and legal matters. Or, the authority granted can be limitedand specific, such as allowing the agent to sell the principal's home and use the proceeds for aparticular purpose designated by the principal. A power of attorney that is broadly given may bemore useful for someone who anticipates a long period of hospitalization or incapacity and whoneeds an agent who can access bank accounts, pay bills, pick up checks and mail, and handleother daily financial matters as they arise. In either case, the agent has a legal responsibility,known as \"the fiduciary duty,\" not to abuse the assets of the principal for her own personal benefit. As with the health care proxy, the absence of a properly executed power of attorney can greatly interfere with the ability of a person living with HIV to make her own choice about who shetrusts to handle her financial and legal matters. It should be noted, though, that where a personis incapacitated, a court may appoint a guardian or conservator for that person (typically acting on a petition filed by a family member) who is different from and whose authority takes priorityover the power of attorney. Still, in many cases, the durable power of attorney manages theeconomic affairs of the principal through periods of incapacity or absence without incident. The authority granted to the agent by the power of attorney document does not survive the principal's death. The authority under the power of attorney dies with the principal, and, assumingthe principal has a valid will, power transfers to the executor (also known in some states as the\"personal representative\"), who then assumes responsibility (with judicial oversight) for dealingwith financial matters, paying debts, and distributing assets in accordance with the will'sprovisions. 4. Declaration as to Remains The declaration as to remains is a document that, in essence, allows a person living with HIV to plan her own funeral and decide what will happen with her body upon death. By clearlyexpressing choices and preferences regarding burial, cremation, funeral services, memorialservices, and other arrangements, a person living with HIV can ensure that her wishes are carriedout and can also avoid potential controversies between biological family members and life partnersor close friends. Because it is a less familiar document to most people, as compared with a willor a health care proxy, it is a good idea for a person who executes a declaration as to remains tomake the existence of the document known to the person or persons who are designated to carryout the wishes and plans specified within it. Unfortunately, in some States, there is no statutory authority or law authorizing the creation of a declaration as to remains and, in others, the law states that a person's remains automaticallybecome the possession of the person's \"next of kin,\" a legally defined relationship that does not Chpt 18 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 377A Clinical Guide and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 378include one's life partner (except in the State of Vermont) or close friends. This means that even with a carefully thought out and well-executed declaration as to remains, an individual may not be able to completely insure that her dying wishes regarding funeral and burial or cremation are honored. It is still advisable, however, to execute a declaration as to remainsbecause 1) several courts have found that a competent adult has the legal right to plan her ownfuneral and decide what will happen with her body upon death despite the existence of contrarylaws; 2) it provides clear direction to loved ones regarding an individual's funeral and burialwishes; and 3) if a controversy does emerge, either between \"next of kin\" and life partners orclose friends, or within biological families as is also often the case, the presence of the declarationas to remains may be persuasive in resolving the dispute. PART 3. INSURING PROPER DISTRIBUTION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS, PROPERTY, AND PERSONAL BELONGINGS Comprehensive estate planning is the only way to insure that the financial assets, real property, and personal belongings of a person living with HIV are distributed in accordance with her wishes. The advantage of estate planning is that, using conventional tools such as wills, trusts,bank accounts, and life insurance policies, an individual living with HIV is free to distributeassets to anyone she chooses, * and thus she can protect and provide for loved ones even where there is no biological or marital relationship. Without an estate plan in place, the assets of adeceased individual are distributed in strict accordance with State intestacy laws - laws thatspecify who inherits, and in what order, and which do so in a manner that recognizes only spousesand biological relatives as proper heirs. Despite the obvious advantage of estate planning, it is often difficult to convince a person living with HIV of the need to make a will or of the importance of financial and benefits planning that would ultimately provide for a smoother transfer of assets. There are many barriers to such planning, including the natural resistance to thinking about one's death and the very commonmyth that estate planning is only necessary for people who are wealthy or who have significantassets available to distribute to loved ones. A person of limited means may convince herself thatan estate plan is unnecessary because she does not have anything that her loved ones wouldwant or value. In reality, however, this is almost never the case. Irrespective of financial assets,most people living with HIV will have personal belongings that carry important meaning forthose who are left behind. Over the years, there have been far too many stories of battles withinfamilies, or between family members and life partners or friends, over items of deep sentimentalvalue such as diaries and other personal writings, photographs, books and jewelry. A will thatspecifically designates who is to receive such items, or, a plan that includes giving some of theseitems away during one's lifetime, can guard against future heartache and strife. * There are a limited number of exceptions to the general rule that a person may distribute assets to anyone she chooses. In ma ny states, a person may not use her will to disinherit a spouse. The specific laws vary from state to state, but the general reme dy granted in these cases is the \"elective share.\" Elective share statutes provide that a specific portion of the decedent's esta te be made available to the disinherited spouse. In addition, several states have statutes that protect children when it appears tha t they were unintentionally disinherited. Finally, some states have statutes that limit a person's ability to leave her estate to char ity if she is survived by a spouse, parent, or children. Nonetheless, the presence of these statutes does not bar an individual from leav ing money, property, or other personal belongings to other loved ones, such as a friend or life partner. These laws simply limit t he amount available to others by virtue of providing a mandatory share of the estate to spouses, parents, and minor children. Chpt 18 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 37826 picas Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 379Thus, it is important for palliative care providers to emphasize the many advantages of estate planning and to support patients through the often painful process of thinking about how best to distribute assets and personal belongings. What follows are the areas that should be covered in nearly every estate plan. Because laws vary from State to State, it is critical to locate an attorneyfamiliar with estate planning to assist with the drafting of wills and other estate planningdocuments. 1. Probate versus nonprobate assets When a person dies, some of the property they leave behind will be \"probate\" and some will be\"nonprobate.\" \"Probate\" is the legal term for the process whereby property that passes through a will is accounted for, gathered, and then distributed to the persons named in the will. If there was no valid will the probate assets will be distributed under the intestacy laws to the heirsspecified under the State laws where the person living with HIV was domiciled. \"Nonprobate\"assets are those assets that pass automatically to a chosen beneficiary upon death. Examples ofnonprobate assets include life insurance policies with named beneficiaries, joint and \"in trustfor\" bank accounts, and trusts created outside of a will. There are many advantages to nonprobate assets. Because they pass outside of the will and are not subject to the probate process, loved ones do not have to endure a long wait before they canaccess the assets that have been left to them. In addition, the distribution of nonprobate assetsis much more difficult to challenge than the terms of a will. Whereas wills are filed with probate courts and subject to challenge and scrutiny, nonprobate assets pass to the intended beneficiaries quickly and quietly, without the need for a public accounting. Also, assets included in the probateof an estate can become subject to the claims of creditors. Creditors have 1 year to bring claimsof debt to the attention of the court where the estate has been probated. Thus, it is clearlyadvisable for persons living with AIDS to examine their assets and determine which assets canand should be moved into the \"nonprobate\" category. Bank Accounts Bank accounts are an excellent example of the type of asset that can easily be moved into the nonprobate category. If a person has a bank account with only her name on it, thecontents of that bank account will automatically become subject to probate upon herdeath. There are two primary options available for turning a bank account into anonprobate asset: a joint account, or an in trust for account. A joint account is anaccount that lists two account holders on the same account. Both account holders havefull and equal access to the funds in the account. If one co-holder becomes incapacitated,the other has easy access to the funds. If one co-holder dies, the funds automaticallybecome the property of the surviving account holder. Probate is avoided, and, except invery limited circumstances, creditors cannot get access to the funds to satisfy debts ofthe decedent. The downside of a joint account is that joint co-holders both have immediate access to the funds at all times and thus, if one co-holder wanted to, she could withdraw all the money at any time and leave nothing for the other account holder . An in trust for account avoids the problem of two people having full access to the same funds in the present. Instead, an in trust for bank account allows a person to name abeneficiary who will receive the proceeds from the account upon her death. The Chpt 18 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 379A Clinical Guide and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 380beneficiary of the account is similar to the beneficiary of a life insurance or retirement policy. She has no access to the funds in the account during the principal account holder's lifetime, but the proceeds of the account avoid probate and become immediately available to the beneficiary upon the death of the account holder. Life Insurance and Pension Plans Proceeds of life insurance and pension plans that pay out to a named beneficiary after a person's death are nonprobate assets. The key here is to make sure that a beneficiaryhas been named. Most plans and policies will allow the policyholder to name more thanone beneficiary. For example, a person living with HIV might designate her life partner and her two children as the beneficiaries of her life insurance policy. Some policies will allow the policyholder to specify the shares allotted to each beneficiary (i.e., 50% tospouse and 25% each to two children). An important part of estate planning is periodicallychecking to make sure that the company holding the policy has the correct informationregarding intended beneficiaries. If there are no beneficiaries named, or if the beneficiarynamed predeceases the policyholder, the ability to control who receives the asset may belost. Without a beneficiary named, many benefit plans will automatically distribute theproceeds to the policyholder's next of kin, or distribute the proceeds to the policyholder'sestate to be accounted for and distributed along with the other probate assets. Forms of Real Property Ownership If a person living with HIV owns real property with another person, it makes sense to examine the deed to determine the form of ownership. There are two forms of real propertyco-ownership that avoid probate and allow the property to pass automatically to thesurvivor upon death of the co-owner. The first form of co-ownership is \"tenancy by theentirety\" and is only available to legally married couples. Property owned as a tenancy bythe entirety is often the best possible option for married couples because not only does itavoid probate and allow the property to automatically pass to the surviving spouse, but italso avoids taxation upon the death of one spouse (that is, the surviving spouse is nottaxed on the inheritance because she already owned the \"entirety\"). For unmarried partners and other co-owners who prefer automatic passage of the property to the other co-owner upon death, the best available tool is owning property jointly \"withrights of survivorship.\" Under this form of ownership, the title to the property automaticallypasses to the survivor upon the death of the joint owner. Property that is held jointly withthe right of survivorship allows the surviving owner to sell the property immediately withoutseeking court approval in probate after the co-owner's death. In addition, jointly heldproperty does not bear the risk of a challenge that accompanies the probate of a will.Thus, joint ownership with rights of survivorship is an excellent estate planning tool. It is critically important to be aware that if two unmarried people jointly own property together and the deed does not specifically refer to rights of survivorship, a tenancy incommon will be presumed. With a tenancy in common, the co-owner does not inherit the property upon the death of the other owner. This may be an appropriate form of ownershipfor co-owners who do not intend to have the other co-owner inherit upon their death, andwho might prefer that their half of the property be distributed to other friends or familymembers in accordance with the terms of their will.

Once the trust is created and \"filled\" with the designated assets, the assets nolonger belong to the individual who created the trust. Instead, the assets \"belong\" to thetrust. The person with control over the distribution of the assets within the trust is the trustee. The person living with HIV who created the trust may make the trust revocable,name herself as the trustee, and name herself as the sole beneficiary during her lifetime.This will give her complete control over the assets within the trust during her lifetime.This type of revocable living trust is often the best way for a person living with HIV tomaintain control of her assets during her lifetime and ensure the easy transfer of theassets upon her death. As long as there is a successor trustee and a successor beneficiaryor beneficiaries named in the trust, the successor trustee can transfer all of the property or assets to the named beneficiaries without any probate court proceedings after the death of the person who created the trust. In order to be a valid legal document, the individual creating the trust must sign it and have it notarized. The document does not have to be witnessed or recorded. Most attorneysfamiliar with estate planning can assist a person living with HIV in creating a trust. 2. Wills A will is a central component of any estate plan. It is a legal document that allows a person to leave any portion of her estate, and any specific possessions, to any other persons or organizations.Despite the emphasis placed on removing assets from probate, there will almost always be propertyheld by the individual that cannot practically be held as joint property or placed in a trust.When a person dies without a valid will, all of her probate property passes in accordance withthe intestacy laws of her state. Because intestacy laws universally favor biological relatives anddo not recognize unmarried partners, close friends, or other people that an individual mightwant to inherit all or part of her estate, a valid will is crucial. In most States, there are very few formal requirements for drafting and executing a valid will. In general, a will must sufficiently describe an individual's possessions and who she wants to inherit them. The will must be signed and dated by the person and then by two witnesses who are notbeneficiaries under the will. Despite the fact that executing a will is relatively straight forward,absent emergency situations, individuals should not attempt to execute a will without theassistance of an attorney. 3. Homesteading Many States have homestead laws that allow homeowners to protect their primary residence from creditors. Filing a petition for homestead exemption (literally, a filing that exempts yourproperty from access to creditors) can be an important part of estate and financial planning forpeople living with HIV, particularly those who are worried about high levels of consumer debt.Filing early is strongly advised, as many States only exempt debts incurred after the filing of thehomestead petition. The extent of the homestead exemption varies from State to State, as dofiling requirements, so it is a good idea to consult with an attorney in the State where you reside.

Dealing with Debts and Creditors Many people living with HIV need assistance dealing with creditors and deciding how best to handle accumulated debt. Often people living with HIV are worried about mounting debt levelsand assume that there is no solution to protect them from financial ruin and from the incessantbarrage of threatening letters and phone calls from creditors. In fact, several options exist andattorneys and/or debt counselors can provide many services to assist persons living with HIV inaddressing their debt issues. Under many State fair debt collection laws, notification of representation by an attorney bars creditors from further collection efforts aimed directly at debtors. In effect, the first step takencan often eliminate threatening letters and phone calls. Next, an assessment of the persons debts and the potential for at least partial repayment must be evaluated. While many debts can easily be forgiven, through a discharge by creditors orthrough the courts, some types of debt are very difficult to discharge. Discharging outstandingstudent loans and Federal, State and local tax debts is quite difficult. Also, secured debts,where the creditor owns an interest in the property held by the creditor, such as car loans andhome mortgages, will generally result in loss of the secured property. Credit card debts, on theother hand, are generally easily dischargeable. With this in mind several courses of action can be taken. Many disabled individuals, particularly those who are not earning income, who have limited assets and who are dependent on need-based public benefits (i.e., SSI, TANF), are effectively \"judgment proof.\" Often, simply contactingcreditors and informing them of this situation will result in a disability-related discharge orforgiveness of the debt. In other cases, when a person's assets or income are too high, or whena creditor refuses to forgive the debt, personal bankruptcy may be the best option. An attorney can assist a person living with HIV in negotiating with creditors or filing a personal bankruptcy petition. The filing fee for a personal bankruptcy petition in the bankruptcy court is$200, and ironically it is one of the filing fees that the court will not waive. In most cases,through a bankruptcy court proceeding, a bankruptcy court judge will discharge the debts of adisabled person living with HIV. Most bankruptcy judges, however, will allow the debtor to paythe filing fee in periodic installments upon request. PART 4. PERMANENCY PLANNING: SECURING THE FUTURE OF AFFECTED CHILDREN There may be no more sensitive issue for parents living with HIV than how to plan for the future of their minor children. No parent wants to contemplate a time when she may become unavailableto care for her children. Indeed, parents living with HIV often resist permanency planning for their children because it is overwhelming to think about someone else raising their children and also because of a lack of information about parent-friendly planning options. In addition, some parents living with HIV may have minor children who are HIV-positive. When children also have HIV, the permanency planning must take into account the ability of theproposed guardian(s) to meet each child's specialized medical, social, and Chpt 18 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 38226 picas Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 383There are steps that parents with HIV can take in the present to insure that, if they die or become incapacitated, their children will be cared for by loving friends or relatives. It is strongly advised that parents work with an attorney with expertise in estate planning and family law when formalizing a permanency plan. 1. Standby Guardianship Proxy Laws In States where it is available, the standby guardianship proxy law is an excellent planning tool for parents living with HIV. Under the standby guardianship laws, parents with HIV whohave minor children in their care can legally arrange for someone to step in and care for theirchildren during periods of incapacity, without giving up their own parental rights. To date, 16 States have enacted standby guardianship proxy laws. \u00a7 Parents living with HIV should check with an attorney in their State to see whether standby guardianship is available. Standby guardianship allows a parent or legal guardian to designate an adult to care for her minor child during periods of incapacity without forcing the parent to give up custody or relinquish any ofher parental rights. As such, it is a particularly useful tool for parents living with HIV who may, attimes, require long hospitalizations or find themselves unable to care for their children but whoanticipate recovering enough to resume parental responsibilities. The process for appointing astandby guardian typically involves filing a petition with the appropriate court (often a family orprobate court) along with supporting documentation. In most States, the petition will require thesignature of the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) as well as the signature of the person who is being appointed the standby guardian proxy for the child(ren). If the child is above a certain age, his assent is required. The court may also inquire into the fitness of the proposed standby guardianproxy, by examining her criminal history or looking into any prior involvement with the State agencyoverseeing the welfare of children. If there is another legal parent, other than the custodial parentseeking to appoint the proxy, that parent must be notified. If the other parent is fit to care for thechild and objects to the appointment of the proxy, the court is unlikely to approve the standbyguardianship petition. It should also be noted that, in some States, standby guardianship is onlyavailable to parents or legal guardians who are suffering from a chronic, disabling or fatal illness.In those States, the petition for standby guardianship must present evidence of the health conditionthat may interfere with a parent's caretaking duties. Once the standby guardian proxy is approved by a court, the proxy's authority to act in a parental role begins upon the death of the parent, the consent of the parent, or the inability of the parentto care for the child as certified by a health care provider. There is no need to return to courtonce one of these triggering events occurs. Once effective, the proxy may act on the child'sbehalf for the period of time specified in the statute. Here again, laws vary considerably fromState to State. Some States allow the standby guardian proxy to act in the parental role for up to90 days (for example, Massachusetts), while others allow for a greater period of up to 6 months(for example, New Jersey). If the parent's incapacity to care for the child extends beyond thestatutory period, or if the parent dies, the standby guardian proxy must go to court and file apetition for permanent guardianship of the child now in her care. \u00a7 States that have standby guardianship proxy laws are Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Mas- sachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Advocates are working to introduce and insure passage of standby guardianship legislation in many of the states where it is not yet available .

Permanent Guardianship of Minor Children Permanent guardianship offers a parent with HIV the option of permanently placing her minor child in the care of another person. This may be a wise option for a parent who has become tooincapacitated to provide regular care for her child, and who does not anticipate recovering to apoint where she will be able to resume traditional parental duties. If the parent is so ill that shecan no longer care for her children, or anticipates that she will soon be unable to care for thempermanently, one advantage of initiating the permanent guardianship proceeding while she isstill living is that she can participate in the court proceedings and let the judge know her reasonsfor selecting a particular person as the guardian. This level of involvement in the decisionmakingprocess is important in that it allows the parent living with HIV to maintain a sense of controlover the future of her children. Once the permanent guardianship is established, the parent nolonger has to worry about who will care for her child if she dies. The process for appointing a permanent guardian is similar to the standby guardianship process in that they both require the filing of a petition with supporting documentation, a hearing beforea judge, and notice to, or assent of, the other living parent where applicable. A court willinvestigate the proposed guardian's background, including criminal history and any involvementwith child welfare authorities. Some judges might scrutinize the fitness of the proposed guardianmore carefully than they would in a standby guardianship proceeding because of the permanentnature of the appointment. Once the permanent guardianship is approved, the guardian'sauthority to make decisions and care for the child is effective immediately and lasts until thechild turns 18 years old. Children above a certain age must also consent to the appointment, and States vary as to whether older children must appear in court and consent orally or whether a notarized signature willsuffice. States also vary as to the age at which the minor's consent is required. Fourteen years ofage and above is typical, but some States require a minor's consent beginning at age 12. 3. Transfers of Custody/Modification of Custody Orders Modifying existing custody orders to transfer physical or legal custody to another parent is a planning tool available only to those parents whose children's custodial status was subject to aprior determination by a court. When a married couple with children divorces, the court thatapproves the divorce agreement - or that hears the case in the event of a contested divorce -also enters a judgment, called an \"order,\" regarding custody of the children. The custodyarrangement is then fixed by law and can only be changed by another subsequent court order. There are many variations of custody arrangements. One of the more common arrangements is for two parents to have \"joint\" or \"shared\" legal custody with physical custody resting with oneparent. This means that both parents have equal parental status, rights, and responsibilities inthe eyes of the law, but the children live with the parent who has physical custody, also referred to as the \"custodial parent.\" In such an arrangement, the parent without physical custody, or the \"noncustodial parent\" will typically have visitation on a regular basis. In cases where thechildren maintain a good relationship with the noncustodial parent, and where the noncustodialparent has expressed a willingness to care for the children in his home should it become necessary,a custodial parent living with AIDS who becomes unable to care for her children might seek tomodify the custody order to transfer physical custody to the other parent. Most courts willrequire that a motion to modify the prior custody order contain an explanation for the proposed Chpt 18 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 38426 picas Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 385modification. Many courts may also require a hearing on the matter, even where, as in this example, the proposed change is agreed to by both parents. 4. Testamentary Guardians Every parent living with AIDS should have a will that names a testamentary guardian for her children. Even if a parent living with AIDS has successfully appointed a standby guardian proxy,and that proxy has physical custody of the children at the time of the parent's death, a will thatspecifies who the parent wishes to have permanent custody of her children upon death isimportant for a number of reasons. First and foremost, some parents may choose a testamentaryguardian who is different from the standby guardian proxy. For example, a parent may select a close friend and neighbor to serve as the standby guardian proxy, so that her children may continue to attend the same schools and programs during any periods that the parent ishospitalized or incapacitated. Such an arrangement also facilitates the type of short-term \"co-parenting\" envisioned by the standby guardianship laws, as the disabled parent is still nearby and able to communicate her parenting preferences and concerns to the standby guardian proxy.The same parent, however, may have an entirely different wish for her children's care in theevent of her death. Upon her death, she may express a desire that the children be raised by aclose relative, perhaps an aunt or a grandparent, who lives farther away . Thus, it is important to make sure that her will clearly expresses this desire. Although there is no requirement that a person disclose the contents of her will to anyone before death, it is wise to consider a frank discussion with a proposed testamentary guardian. Certainly, it is best if a person who is in line to become the permanent caretaker of one's minorchildren is aware of the situation beforehand. Moreover, if the parent anticipates a challenge toher testamentary guardian from a relative, it is a good idea to prepare the testamentary guardianfor the possibility of such a challenge in advance. It is very important to note that naming someone in the will as a testamentary guardian is not dispositive of the issue. The question of who will become a child's permanent guardian upon thedeath of a custodial parent must be finally determined by a probate or family court judge in the State where the child resides. The person who is named as the testamentary guardian should file a petition seeking permanent guardianship and attach the relevant provisions of the parent'swill to the petition as evidence of the parent's intent for the child(ren). If the petitioner demon-strates an ability and willingness to care for the child, and meets the State's requirements (typi-cally the petitioner must be of a minimum age and not possess a criminal history that mightindicate the inability to responsibly care for a minor), she will be approved by the court as thepermanent guardian. It may be the case, however, that other interested family members will petition the court seeking permanent guardianship, even though they were not named as guardians in the will. In the overwhelming majority of states, when parents are deceased, the law recognizes a child'sgrandparents as the nearest living relatives or \"next of kin\" and will take very seriously a petitionfrom a grandparent seeking permanent guardianship even if the petitioning grandparent was not named as the testamentary guardian by the deceased parent. For advance planning purposes, aparent living with HIV should work with an attorney to prepare affidavits clearly explaining herchoice of guardian if she is concerned that her children's grandparents, or any other close relativesthat have standing, will seek guardianship despite her clearly expressed wishes to the contrary. Chpt 18 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 385A Clinical Guide and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 386CONCLUSION Palliative care providers are in a good position to discuss financial and legal planning options with people living with HIV. Presenting these options provides people with HIV with theopportunity to make careful decisions that will protect themselves and their loved ones in theevent of incapacity or death. In discussing financial and legal planning issues, it is important to bear in mind that laws vary considerably from State to State. Although many of the legal planning tools described hereinare available to people residing in every U.S. State, requirements for utilizing the laws are likelyto vary. Also, court cases interpreting those laws may lead to different, even conflicting, conclusions in different States. For these reasons, it is strongly recommended that people living with HIV consult with an attorney in the State where they reside if they are planning to make awill, appoint a health care proxy for themselves or a standby guardian for their children, or takeany of the other legal steps suggested in this chapter. Similarly, entitlement and benefits programsare administered differently from State to State, and it is advisable to contact an agency in theState familiar with these programs.

OVERVIEW \"Nothing would have a greater impact on the care of patients withadvanced incurable disease than instituting the knowledge we havenow to improve their quality of life.\" JAN STJERNSWARD Over 60 million men, women and children have been infected with HIV to date and more than 22 million people have died of AIDS. AIDS is now the primary cause of death in Africa.1 Preven- tion efforts initially dominated the public health agenda as the most realistic approach to re-ducing morbidity and mortality. Currently, however, attention to the need for care and treat-ment is increasing, allowing for the integration of these approaches into national health policiesand priorities. 2, 3, 4, 5 There is an urgent need to extend the benefits of disease-specific therapy to people living withHIV/AIDS in developing countries. This includes antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and prophy-laxis and treatment of opportunistic infections. Increased availability of these therapies shouldnot only have a positive impact on survival; such treatment should also promote the key pallia-tive care goals of pain and symptom management and improved quality of life, since disease-specific therapies in HIV/AIDS should have desirable effects on, and go hand-in-hand with addi-tional care for, the palliation of suffering. As efforts to provide HIV-specific therapies to re-source-poor countries continue, there remains a critical need to provide palliative care for thelarge numbers of HIV-infected persons in these countries who may or may not have access toanti-retroviral and other new therapies.Palliative care is crucial in every care setting, rich or poor, for it is a philosophy of care thatcenters on improving quality of life for patients and their families. In this chapter, we focusattention on the need to integrate palliative care into national government strategies in order toaddress the pandemic in resource-poor settings, which includes many developing countries andlow-income areas in some industrialized countries.

Control of pain, of other symptoms, and of psychological, so-cial and spiritual problems is paramount. The goal of palliative care is the achieve-ment of the best possible quality of life for patients and their families. Many as-pects of palliative care are applicable earlier in the course of the illness, in con-junction with [other] treatment. Palliative care: \u007f Affirms life and r egards dying as a normal process \u007f Neither hastens nor postpones death\u007f Provides relief from pain and other distressing symptoms\u007f Integrates the psychological and spiritual aspects of patient care\u007f Offers a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death \u007f Offers a support system to help the family cope during the patient's illness and in their own bereavement WHO recently updated this definition to reflect the full scope of palliative care, defining it as \"an approach which improves quality of life of patients and their families facing life-threateningillness through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification andimpeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial andspiritual.\" 7 In this chapter, the term \"palliative care\" refers to a philosophy of care that includes pain relief,symptom control, and supportive therapies for adult and child patients and their families. Both WHO and the Joint United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) list palliative care \"as an Essential Activity for Care and Support.\" 8 These two UN agencies and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the development agency of the United States, conceptual- ize palliative care as a fully integrated component of a care system that emphasizes patients' quality of life by ensuring symptom control and supportive therapies combined, when possible,with disease-specific therapies. The provision of palliative care is also considered crucial in theframework of integrated community- and home-based care. Palliative Care Services in Industrialized and Developing Countries Palliative care services need to be integrated and balanced with other care services to ad- dress the needs of patients and their families. Symptom control and supportive therapies are necessary throughout a patient's illness, although the proportion of palliative care services var- ies with the patients' trajectory of illness and the setting in which they receive care. For ex-ample, in developing countries, where many patients with cancer and/or HIV/AIDS first seektreatment when they are already in a far advanced stage of disease, palliative care may be themajor form of therapy provided to control a patient's symptoms, support the patient and family,address their psychological, cultural and existential distress, and serve as a prevention inter-vention. In settings with early diagnosis where disease-specific therapies are available, pallia-tive care services will support such therapies, increasing as needed along the disease trajectory.For many people with HIV/AIDS, the lack of available disease-specific therapies increases their Chpt 19 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 38826 picasA for \u007f Chapter 19: Palliative Care in Resource-Poor Settings XIX U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 389need for symptom control and supportive therapies to improve their quality of life. Figure 19-1 illustrates existing and ideal distribution of resources between active disease-specific therapies and palliative services for people with HIV/AIDS along the trajectory of their illness.6 Model 3: Proposed Allocation of Healthcare Resources in Developing Countries In this model of care, a greater proportion of healthcare resources is devoted to palliative care as patients typically present with advanced disease and disease-specific therapies areoften not available or appropriate.Figure 19-1: Models for Allocation of Curative and Palliative Care Resources Model 2: Proposed Allocation of Healthcare Resources in Developed Countries In this model of care, a portion of healthcare resources is devoted to pain relief and palliative care beginning at initial diagnosis.

In settings where disease-specific therapies are available, palliative care services are balanced with disease-specific therapies. It is important to stress that National AIDS Programs should avoid viewing palliative care and disease-specific therapies as an either/or phenomenon. The more modern and ethically appropri-ate approach is to view active disease-specific therapies and palliative care as part of a continuumin which patient needs and available resources determine the prioritization and balanced use ofcare strategies. Attention must also be given to how the available resources can be fairly distrib-uted to the largest population in a cost-effective and efficient system of healthcare delivery. Barriers to Implementing Palliative Care in Resource-Poor Settings Numerous reports have outlined the major barriers in resource-poor settings to implement- ing the key elements of HIV/AIDS care and support.9, 10 These barriers range from serious limita- tions posed by scarce monetary, nutritional, and human resources to the low priority placed onAIDS care in national health budgets. Medical, religious, gender, social, and cultural barriersalso exist\u2014including the social- and self-stigmatization of HIV/AIDS\u2014as well as behaviors andpractices that impede the implementation of prevention and care policies. People with HIV/AIDS often suffer significant psychosocial distress related to their experience of serious life-threatening illness at an early age, social ostracism associated with their illness,and the common and concurrent organic mental disorders caused by the HIV infection. Theyalso suffer significant physical distress due to complications of opportunistic infections andtumors, which may include major symptoms such as pain, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, insom-nia, anxiety, depression, and delirium. 11 In addition, major environmental and geographical fac- tors may add barriers to providing HIV/AIDS care and treatment; for example, many peopleliving with HIV/AIDS in the developing world reside in rural areas far from available treatmentresources. An estimated 50% to 60% of people with HIV/AIDS worldwide have no access to healthcare pro- fessionals to address their medical needs. In Uganda, for instance, 88% of the population livesmore than 10 kilometers from any kind of health facility, and many of these facilities lack trainedpersonnel and the most basic medical supplies and medications. 12 This lack of medical resources occurs in a setting where many people are also deprived of the most basic necessities of food,water, housing, and income. WHO and UNAIDS have summarized major barriers to implementing the key components of HIV/AIDS care and support: 8 \u007f Low priority of financial support to the health sector nationally and internationally \u007f Low priority of HIV care within national health budgets\u007f Globalization policies that prohibit a strong emphasis on HIV care in practice\u007f Lack of investments in building infrastructure\u007f Serious managerial weaknesses at all levels of the health sector \u007f Insufficient remuneration and support for care professionals \u007f Loss of staff due to high HIV-related mortality and morbidity Chpt 19 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 39026 picasA for \u007f Chapter 19: Palliative Care in Resource-Poor Settings XIX U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 391\u007f Shortages of relevant HIV information and HIV training opportunities \u007f Irregular and inadequate supplies of drugs, reagents, and equipment \u007f Insufficient local production of drugs and other commodities, given the weakness of local pharmaceutical manufacturers, markets and patent protection \u007f Lack of essential drug lists and drug procurement not adapted to needs of people with HIV/AIDS A NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO PALLIATIVE CARE Although it is far beyond the scope of this chapter to address ways of eliminating these barri- ers, we can offer some models for providing palliative care in developing nations. Against whatappear to be overwhelming odds, several model programs suggest that care and treatment canbe provided and that palliative care services can readily be instituted for the care of patients;however, a national strategy is needed to implement these models effectively. WHO endorses a national program strategy that requires an initial three-part process for im- proving palliative care. 4 The foundation measures for this public health approach are: 1. Governmental policy: adoption of a national palliative care policy 2. Education: training of healthcare professionals and the public3. Drug availability: assuring availability of drugs for pain control and symptom management Figure 19-2 provides a schematic representation of this three-pronged approach, which is dis- cussed in the following sections. All three of these foundation measures together are necessary,along with committed leadership, to achieve an effective national program.

In fact, generic palliative care programs can allow for the coordination of a variety of policy agendas andmay help reduce stigma associated with AIDS care. A strategic national program for palliativecare offers the most rational and effective means of improving the quality of life for the greatestnumber of patients and families, even where resources are severely limited. 13, 14 STEP 1: GOVERNMENTAL POLICY Adoption of a National Palliative Care Policy Establishment of a national policy for palliative care is the best way to ensure quality stan- dards, funding, and accessibility of adequate care for the greatest number of patients and fami-lies. A national policy serves as the official recognition of a commitment of financial support; itcan play a major role in facilitating the availability of essential drugs, as well as the necessaryeducational initiatives for healthcare professionals and the public alike, as part of its mandate. Numerous governments have already adopted a national palliative care policy, including Austra- lia, Canada, Spain, Uganda and the United Kingdom. 4 A national policy should set priorities that address access to palliative care across all healthcaresettings, including hospitals, clinics, and home-based care. Palliative care needs to be availablein both urban centers and rural areas as an integral part of the essential primary healthcareservices that people can expect. These palliative care services should be sustainable and sup-ported by healthcare professionals. Government budgets should appropriately address the needfor essential drugs and provide medications and services ranging from durable medical goods tocounseling programs. A number of resources exist to aid the development of a national health policy. WHO's National Cancer Control Programs: Policies and Managerial Guidelines can be used as a model for the development of specific policies, as well as national palliative care and/or AIDS programs ingeneral. 15 To integrate palliative care into a national healthcare policy, governments should ensure that:18 Palliative care programs are incorporated into their existing healthcare systems \u007fHealthcare workers are adequately trained in palliative care and the relief of HIV/ AIDS-related pain \u007fNational health policies are revised so that equitable support is provided for programs including home-based palliative care \u007fHospitals are able to offer appropriate back-up support for home-based care \u007fBoth opioid and nonopioid analgesics, particularly morphine for oral administration, are available Establishment of a national program, in which national healthcare policy is situated, may in- clude the following activities:15 \u007fIdentification and consideration of the capacities of existing healthcare systems Chpt 19 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 39226 picasA for \u007f Chapter 19: Palliative Care in Resource-Poor Settings XIX U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 393\u007fConsultation with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) \u007fInclusion of steps to ensure community involvement \u007fRecruitment of leaders \u007fReviewing the role of existing organizations \u007fIdentification of resources \u007fDevelopment of a communication strategy \u007fPreparation of a draft national plan \u007fDrawing up a budget for palliative care \u007fOrganization of a national conference \u007fChanging legislation if needed \u007fLaunching the program with workshops The functions of an established national program to provide palliative care are to: 15 \u007fRecommend legislative action \u007fRecommend priorities for the investment of additional resources \u007fEncourage the systematic development and coordination of specific palliative care activities to ensure the best use of available resources for the whole population \u007f Forecast future trends and coordinate the strategic development of health services, health systems such as quality assurance systems, and training and supply of healthprofessionals \u007f Develop and support palliative care programs for smaller populations for jurisdictions within the area it covers \u007f Coordinate the work of all agencies that can contribute to palliative care in the area UNAIDS has developed a four-guide series for the strategic planning process for a national re- sponse to HIV/AIDS, including situation analysis, response analysis, strategic plan formulation,and resource mobilization. 16 The Canadian Palliative Care Association's consensus document on Standardized Principles and Practice of Palliative Care presents guidelines for national committees to follow in developing palliative care standards; it is a clear framework for thisprocess, with sample goals, objectives, essential steps, accompanying policies and procedures,and desirable outcomes (see also http://www.cpca.net). 17 Integrated Community- and Home-based Care Policy In order to make services sustainable, the national policy should allocate resources to home- based care as well as to in-patient palliative care services and outpatient clinic services. Successfulnational HIV/AIDS palliative care programs that focus attention on integrated community- andhome-based care are seen as the most efficient and cost-effective approach to healthcare delivery. Throughout Africa, model programs are demonstrating the beneficial integration of hospice, community- and home-based care for people with HIV/AIDS. 18 For example, the South Coast Hospice in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, developed an integrated care program in which pa-tients with HIV/AIDS are referred to teams of nurses and trained community caregivers whocare for them in their own homes. 19 The program has halved average patient stays at the local hospital, and extended care provided at home costs less than a 2-day stay in the hospital.20 The Chpt 19 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, AM 39326 Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 19: P alliative Care in Resource-Poor Settings U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 394Hospice Association of South Africa (HASA) was supported by the National Department of Health to replicate this model in seven pilot programs.21, 22 People with HIV/AIDS and their families are cared for by and in their immediate communities with help from outside agencies and healthcare professionals who are committed to implementing palliative care standards.

Training Healthcare Workers Education of healthcare professionals is crucial for the dissemination and implementation of existing palliative care knowledge. Training programs should exist for medical students, resi- dents, practicing physicians, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, pastors, community-basedhome-care workers, and rural health workers. Successful experiences in several countries indi-cate that palliative care education can be incorporated into existing healthcare system trainingprograms. 23, 24, 25 Distance learning and certification programs developed for each group of healthcare workers will further increase education coverage. Education must be appropriate tothe situation in which they are performing their activities. Training in palliative care focuses on six major skill sets: 1. Communication 2. Decisionmaking3. Management of complications of treatment and the disease4. Symptom control5. Psychosocial care of patient and family6. Care of the dying WHO recommends that multi-dimensional education include at least a minimum of learning in three important areas: 6 1. Attitudes, beliefs and values: \u007f The philosophy and ethics of palliative care\u007f Personal attitudes towards HIV/AIDS, pain, dying, death, and bereavement\u007f Illness as a complex state with physical, psychological, social, and spiritual dimensions \u007f Multi-professional team-work\u007f The family as the unit of care 2. Knowledge base: \u007f Principles of effective communication\u007f Pathophysiology of the common symptoms of advanced disease\u007f Assessment and management of pain and other symptoms\u007f Psychological and spiritual needs of seriously ill and dying patients\u007f Treatment of emotional and spiritual distress\u007f Psychological needs of the family and other key people Chpt 19 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 39526 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 19: P alliative Care in Resource-Poor Settings U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 396\u007f Availability of community resources to assist patients and their families \u007f Physiological and psychological responses to bereavement 3. Skills. Opportunities should be provided for the application of learned knowledge through practice in the classroom, making use of role-plays and discussion of real case-histories.Important areas for practice include: \u007f Goal-setting in physical, psychological, social and spiritual dimensions\u007f Development of a family care plan\u007f Monitoring of pain and symptom management Various programs in resource-poor settings for the training of healthcare professionals have illustrated how the above-mentioned program components can be implemented. HASA initiateda model program for medical student training with a Diploma in Palliative Medicine at theUniversity of Cape Town. With no palliative medicine journals, minimal undergraduate and post-graduate training, and very few palliative care physicians in the country, this program is begin- ning to develop a standardized knowledge base within a group of educated professionals. HASA also trains professional nurses in palliative care at nine campuses in South Africa. The Mildmay Centre for AIDS palliative care in Uganda provides specialist outpatient palliative care and rehabilitation, using a train-the-trainer approach to disseminate its program and phi-losophy of symptom control throughout sub-Saharan Africa. 11, 26, 27 Educating Family and Volunteer Caregivers In developing countries, empowerment of family members and volunteers to be effective pal- liative caregivers may be the most realistic approach for meaningful coverage, especially inrural areas. Experts emphasize that home care should not become a version of acute care deliv-ery at home: it should rather \"encompass personal care, personal services, social companion-ship, and applied medical care,\" as reflected in education and training. 4 Training for volunteer caregivers is available through hospices and other care-giving bodies. St. Luke's Hospital inSouth Africa, for example, runs intensive trainings for community volunteers who will work withprofessional teams to provide care in home-based settings. Educating Traditional Healers In developing countries, traditional healers are a potential professional resource for the dis- semination of palliative care knowledge. Government-sponsored education of these healers hassought to increase coverage areas of effective palliative care and symptom control awareness inMozambique, Zimbabwe, Uganda, and South Africa. For example, in KwaZulu-Natal, South Af-rica, the AIDS Foundation's collaboration with traditional healers resulted in a training curricu-lum to increase the impact of AIDS prevention, education and management. 12 Resources for Education WHO's Cancer and Palliative Care Unit developed a series of monographs addressing the principles and practice of palliative care for both child and adult cancer patients, which can beadapted for National AIDS Programs. These include publications on cancer pain relief, guide-lines for opioid availability, symptom relief in terminal illness, and palliative care for children,all suitable for professional education in palliative care for HIV/AIDS. 6, 28, 29, 30 Chpt 19 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 39626 picasA for \u007f Chapter 19: Palliative Care in Resource-Poor Settings XIX U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 397Professionals. In addition to the WHO monographs, the following international documents are available for the education of professionals worldwide. \u007fThe Education of Physicians in End of Life Care (EPEC) is a train-the-trainer cur- riculum comprising four 30-minute mod-ules, available on CD-ROM (www.epec.net). 31 \u007f The Oxford Textbook of Palliative Medicine is a useful comprehensive medical text- book with chapters devoted to AIDS and various cultural settings.32 \u007f A Canadian training module is available, devoted exclusively to palliative care for HIV disease.33 \u007f The International Association for the Study of Pain published a core curriculum for professional education in pain.34 \u007f Guides for the use of analgesics also exist and should be widely distributed.35, 36, 37, 38 Pediatric clinicians. In the arena of pediatric palliative care education, the US National Pedia- tric and Family HIV Resource Center (NPHRC), a non-profit educational center, has focused oneducating professionals who care for children and families affected by HIV/AIDS(www.pedhivaids.org). 39 NPHRC's Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bagnoud International Pediatric HIV Train- ing Program has trained nearly 120 doctors, nurses, social workers, and other healthcare profes-sionals from around the world in the care of children with HIV/AIDS (www.fxbcenter.org). 40 Nurses and midwives. Training resources are available specifically for nurses and midwives that are particularly useful in resource-poor settings. \u007f The International Society of Nurses in Cancer Care has a core curriculum in palliative nursing care.41 \u007f A train-the-trainer course similar to EPEC for nurses, End of Life Nursing Education Consortium (ELNEC) Project , consists of nine content modules available on CD-ROM (www.aacn.nche.edu/elnec).42 \u007f WHO created a series of 13 fact sheets for nurses and midwives\u2014including a module on palliative care\u2014with general key issues, challenges and detailed information on care-provision issues (see www.who.in/HIV_AIDS/Nursesmidwivesfs/index.html).43 WHO encourages programs to disseminate these documents, adding illustrations and/or adapting the information to fit specific contexts. Public Education Palliative care education needs to be made available at the family, community and national levels. Patients, families and caregivers need good information regarding the illness, symptomcontrol, options for care and how care can be provided. Community and religious leaders, legis-lators and other community members, as well as government officials, policymakers and NGOs,need information about the essential components of palliative care and how and where it is provided to allow them to be effective supporters and advocates of palliative care at both the community and national levels. There is a major need for public education campaigns to facilitate community members' aware- ness of the nature of HIV disease and to provide them with information and knowledge for choosingcare options when disease-specific therapies are unavailable or no longer appropriate. Such Chpt 19 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 39726 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 19: P alliative Care in Resource-Poor Settings U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 398campaigns must emphasize that palliative care is focused on preventing needless suffering. There is also a particular need to educate the public about the role and appropriate use of analgesic drugs in pain management. According to WHO, it is essential that the public be made aware of the following:6 \u007f Palliative care will improve a patient's quality of life, even when disease is incurable. \u007f There is no need for patients to suffer prolonged and intolerable pain or other dis- tressing symptoms. \u007f Treatments exist that can relieve pain and many other symptoms of advanced disease.\u007f Drug therapy is vital to pain management.\u007f Drugs for pain relief can be taken indefinitely without losing their effectiveness. \u007f Psychological dependence (\"addiction\") does not occur when morphine is taken to relieve pain. \u007f The medical use of morphine does not lead to abuse. Public palliative care education need not be AIDS-specific. It must be delivered in a culturally sensitive manner that is accessible to every segment of the population. Media campaigns can beeffective in promoting awareness of palliative care issues, as can resource centers and overallcommunity participation in care. Where illiteracy precludes written educational materials, videoand theater are possible dissemination options. In settings where written materials are typi-cally unavailable and radio is a common method of communicating information, major radiocampaigns would be appropriate. \"Scribes\" or literate members of volunteer groups may alsoparticipate in education efforts. 12 All arenas of public education should give special consider- ation to stigma reduction. Distance learning and certificate programs for volunteer caregivers in the community can further advance education efforts. STEP 3: A NATIONAL POLICY FOR DRUG AVAILABILITY A national palliative care strategy should include basic directives that focus on both the necessary legislation and the administration process for drugs essential to the care and treat-ment of people with HIV/AIDS. To provide appropriate symptom control and supportive therapy,a national palliative care program must include policy measures regarding the need for a widerange of drugs to effectively address and control opportunistic infections and the major symp-toms that patients with HIV/AIDS report, including pain, nausea and vomiting, delirium andagitation, insomnia, fatigue, depression and anxiety. Such national policies should reflect lawsthat address the importation and distribution of needed supplies, and also determine the appro-priate amount of drugs to be imported and distributed. Particular attention should be given to pain management. Numerous studies suggest that more than 80% of HIV/AIDS patients with advanced illness have significant pain, which is currentlyboth under-assessed and under-treated. In a recent study in Uganda, hospice members foundthat pain was the first major source of distress for both cancer and AIDS patients and theirrelatives. 20 An excellent resource for the necessary legislative and administrative process for pain medications is the Guide To Opioid Availability, published in the WHO monograph Cancer Pain Relief .30 This document can help governments focus attention on developing a national policy for drug availability for palliative care drugs, particularly opioids. Chpt 19 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 39826 for \u007f Chapter 19: Palliative Care in Resource-Poor Settings XIX U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 399Psychological symptoms vary in prevalence, occurring in 10% to 60% of patients during the course of their illness. Both delirium and dementia are common features of advanced AIDS, and the use of psychotropic drugs to manage these symptoms must be included in a country's Essential Drug List. (The WHO Action Programme on Essential Drugs recommends that every country main-tain an Essential Drug List that includes the basic drugs needed to treat the diseases and condi-tions in that country. This assures that decisions regarding resource priorities are based onmedical needs of the majority of the population.) Other chapters in this book describe a wide range of drug regimens for particular symptoms in patients with HIV/AIDS. 28 These drugs, preferably in their generic form when available, should be incorporated into Essential Drug Lists. Essential Drug Lists should also include medications for patients' palliative care needs, such as non-opioids, opioids, and adjuvant analgesic drugs Table 19-1: Basic Drug List for HIV/AIDS Palliative Care Analgesics Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 19: P alliative Care in Resource-Poor Settings U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 400based on the WHO three-step analgesic ladder. A model Essential Drug List for cancer patients can be easily adapted for patients with HIV/AIDS but should also include cost-effective drugs forthe treatment of opportunistic infections and their serious side effects, antidepressants, neuroleptics and anti-convulsants, as illustrated in Table 19-1. National drug policy should address the handling of medications. A model of such a document is Uganda's Guidelines for Handling Class A Drugs . 44 WHO has suggested essential components for guidelines that regulate health professionals who dispense opioid drugs:30 1.Legal authority . Physicians, nurses and pharmacists should be legally empowered to prescribe, dispense and administer opioids to patients in accordance with local needs. 2.Accountability . They must dispense opioids for medical purposes only and must be held responsible in law if they dispense them for non-medical purposes. 3.Prescriptions . A prescription for opioids should contain at least the following information: \u007f Patient's name and address \u007f Date of issue\u007f Drug name, dosage strength and form, quantity prescribed\u007f Directions for use\u007f Physician's name BenzodiazapinesAdjuvant Drugs for Analgesia and Symptom Basic Drugs Alternatives Antibiotics and Antivirals for prophylaxisTable 19-1: Basic Drug List 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, for \u007f Chapter 19: Palliative Care in Resource-Poor Settings XIX U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 4014.Patient access . Opioids should be available in locations that will be accessible to as many patients as possible. 5.Medical decisions . Decisions concerning the type of drug to be used, the amount of the prescription and the duration of therapy are best made by medical professionalson the basis of individual patients' needs, and not by regulation. 6.Dependence . Physical dependence, which may develop when opioids are used to treat chronic pain, should not be confused with psychological dependence. Financing must be secured for essential drugs. In Latin America, the \"South-South Coopera- tion\" Initiative is using a strategy of partnership among neighboring countries to become morepowerful advocates for cheaper medications, particularly AIDS drugs. The Bamako Initiative isa revolving fund for financing essential drugs, with countries joining together to decrease pricesand maintain commitment to buy and distribute them. In India, the production of cheap imme-diate-release morphine has aided the distribution and affordability of this essential drug. 45 The cooperation of the pharmaceutical industry is needed to spread this practice to other nations. Drug availability must include medications appropriate for pain relief and symptom control, regardless of the availability of other types of treatment. Access to palliative care services willalways be essential, whether or not people have had access to other therapies including ART. In1997, the UNAIDS HIV Drug Access Initiative (DAI) was developed to improve access to ART inresource-poor areas. Until 1999, DAI focused exclusively on ART, but it now is also promotingother means of treatment\u2014including palliative care (see www.unaids.org/). 46 MODEL INITIATIVES TO ADVANCE PALLIATIVE CARE IN RESOURCE-POOR SETTINGS Palliative Care in Uganda The Ugandan Ministry of Health included palliative care as an integral part of all Essential Clinical Care in its National Health Sector Strategic Plan 2000/01-2004/05.47 48 Table 19-2 de- tails the palliative care component of the Ministry of Health's mandate for essential clinicalcare. Palliative care is in the core budget of the minimum healthcare package, with set goals forimplementation and verification. Uganda has an essential drug program, and the revision of restrictive drug laws now allows for trained palliative care nurses to prescribe and administer oral morphine in home-based settings. The program has developed a broad public education policy for AIDS that includes professional education in palliative care at all healthcare levels. The government supports \"Hospice Uganda\"as a resource and training center for community- and home-based palliative care. 49 Various NGOs, including The AIDS Support Organization (TASO), provide counseling, care and supportservices, further increasing the reach of palliative care in underserved areas. Uganda's Partner-ship for Home-Based Care in Rural Areas and the Mildmay Center for Palliative HIV/AIDS Carein Kampala have been cited in UNAIDS' Best Practice Collection. 27 The Enhancing Care Initiative The Enhancing Care Initiative is a collaborative effort of the Harvard AIDS Institute with AIDS Care Teams in Brazil, Puerto Rico, Senegal, South Africa and Thailand. The focus of thisinitiative is to implement continuity of care programs in 10 care areas. These include preventionapproaches with HIV counseling and testing, basic medical care services, and community-based Chpt 19 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 40126 Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 19: P alliative Care in Resource-Poor Settings U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 402care with care for the dying and care for caregivers. All 10 care areas have concurrent profes- sional educational programs. Each team has developed a unique approach to meet regionalneeds, working to integrate a comprehensive AIDS care program into every level of the healthcaresystem, including communities and families (Available at www.eci.harvard.edu). 50 WHO: A Community Health Approach to Palliative Care for HIV and Cancer Patients in Five African Countries WHO is developing a Community Health Approach to Palliative Care for HIV and Cancer Patients in five African countries (See Table 19-3 for prevalency rates in participating coun-tries). 51 The program is unique in combining policy advocacy for both AIDS and cancer patients within a national healthcare program. Each participating country is asked to develop and inte- grate palliative care initiatives into their national health policies. The program's long-term goalsare to foster national policies in palliative care, provide public and professional education onTable 19-2: Palliative Care Component of the Uganda National Health Sector Strategic Plan Verifiable Means of Activities at the Output Indicators Verification the Operational Level Source: Reprinted with permission from Ministry of Health, Republic of Uganda.

The Pain and Policy Studies Group at the University of Wisconsin is providing technical support to this project through its resource center to help facilitate drug availability for opioids.52 The United States The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act is a national policy of the US government funding healthcare and support services\u2014including counseling, homeand hospice care\u2014for underserved and resource-poor populations affected by HIV/AIDS. 53 In 1999, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) awarded five grants specifi-cally for palliative care through the Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) portion ofthis legislation. 54 As part of its development assistance, the U.S. government advocates palliative care through itsLeadership and Investment for Fighting an Epidemic (LIFE) Initiative by supporting the expan-sion of palliative care in community-based treatment of HIV/AIDS and opportunistic infectionsalong with the innovative use of ART and TB prevention and care. USAID, the Department ofHealth and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Defense collaborate in this $100million initiative by funding care and treatment improvements, primary prevention, and capac-ity and infrastructure development in 13 target countries in Africa and India. 55 The United Kingdom The National Health Service (NHS) of the UK supports hospice and specialist palliative care services, including professional educational programs. This is an evolving national policy that isworking to provide better access to care and the development of care pathways for patients withvarious diseases who can benefit from palliative care. Patients with AIDS, cancer and a widerange of other chronic illnesses are currently included in government-supported palliative careprograms. The program provides a seamless continuum in-patient palliative careservices to community- and home-based hospice programs. 56, 57 RECOMMENDATIONS Based on experience to date, the following recommendations may be made regarding pallia- tive care in resource-poor settings.6 1. Governments should establish national policies and programs for HIV/AIDS palliative care. 2. Governments should ensure that HIV/AIDS-related pain relief and palliative care pro- grams are incorporated into their existing healthcare systems; separate systems ofcare are neither necessary nor desirable. 3. Governments should ensure that healthcare workers (physicians, nurses, pharmacists, or other professional groups appropriate to local needs) are adequately trained in palliative care and pain relief. 4. Governments should review their national health policies to ensure that equitable support is provided for programs of palliative care in the home.

In light of the financial, emotional, physical and social burdens carried by family mem- bers who are willing to care for people with HIV/AIDS at home, governments should consider establishing formal systems of remuneration for the principal family caregivers. 6. Governments should recognize the singular importance of home-based care for people with HIV/AIDS and ensure that hospitals are able to offer appropriate back-up andsupport. 7. Governments should ensure the availability of both opioid and nonopioid analgesics. Further, they should make realistic determinations of their opioid requirements andensure that annual estimates submitted to the International Narcotics Control Boardreflect actual needs. 8. Governments should ensure that their drug legislation makes full provision for the following: \u007f Regular review, with the aim of permitting importation, manufacture, prescrib- ing, stocking, dispensing and administration of opioids for medical reasons \u007f Legally empowering physicians, nurses, pharmacists and, where necessary, other categories of healthcare workers to prescribe, stock, dispense and administeropioids \u007f Review of the controls governing opioid use, with a view to simplification, so that drugs are available in the necessary quantities for legitimate use Chpt 19 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:20 AM 40426 picasA for \u007f Chapter 19: Palliative Care in Resource-Poor Settings XIX U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 4051.

Although scientists havenot yet discovered a drug combination that can completely eradicate the virus, the new HAARTregimens are helping many HIV-positive individuals live longer and enjoy a better quality of life.Marked declines in rates of opportunistic infections and deaths have brought the hope that HIVcan be managed as a chronic disease.The populations that require HIV management also are changing. Growing numbers of HIV-positive Americans are poor, marginalized, and uninsured or publicly insured. 1 African Americans and Latinos now represent the majority of new AIDS cases and people living with AIDS in theUnited States. 2 Women and youth are experiencing rapid rates of increase in HIV infection.3 HIV incidence remains high among men who have sex with men (MSM) and injection drugusers, with young African American MSM experiencing particularly high rates of newinfections. 3, 4 The changing demographics of the HIV epidemic, along with the growing complexity of medicalcare, have created major challenges for the health professionals who provide curative andpalliative care and the informal caregivers who provide emotional and practical support torelatives and friends living with the disease. Although an estimated two-thirds of U.S. adultsliving with HIV infection are aware of their serostatus, only one-third are receiving regular medicalcare. 5, 6 For those who are in care, decisions must be made on when to start antiretroviral therapy, which drug combinations to use, and how to manage viral resistance and drug-specifictoxicities. Therapeutic regimens often must be adapted to meet the needs of homeless individualsand patients with comorbidities, such as mental illness and chemical dependence.As treatment options have expanded, so have the stresses experienced by caregivers. Theprolongation of the disease course, uncertainty about overall prognosis, and a \"roller coaster\"pattern of repeated exacerbations and remissions in later stages of HIV disease have intensifiedthe emotional and physical demands of caregiving. In-home caregivers increasingly are beingasked to help patients manage sizable pill burdens, frequent and complicated dosing schedules,and therapy-related side effects. Many of these caregivers face the added burdens of poverty,inadequate housing, and lack of knowledge about available resources. Some are themselvesHIV-positive. These developments underscore the importance of recognizing and meeting theneeds of HIV/AIDS caregivers over the long term\u2014both for their benefit and for the well-beingof people in their care.This chapter discusses the challenges of providing HIV/AIDS care and ways of helping caregiversmanage stress and maintain quality of life. The first section describes the types and prevalenceof HIV/AIDS caregiving. The next two sections examine the burdens and rewards of caregivingand factors that contribute to burnout.

While this chapter focuses on HIV/AIDS caregiving in the United States, the burdens experienced by caregivers are of worldwide concern. Many of the suggestions for counteracting burnout in informal caregivers may prove useful in resource-limited countries where family caregivers have little or no access to formalsupport systems. OVERVIEW OF HIV/AIDS CAREGIVING Two types of caregivers provide clinical care and supportive services to people with HIV/ AIDS. Formal caregivers include health professionals, behavioral health specialists, and socialworkers who are trained and compensated for their caregiving activities. The trained volun- teers and spiritual counselors associated with AIDS service organizations, AIDS care teams, and hospice programs also fall in this definitional category. Informal caregivers include relatives,spouses/partners, and friends who provide in-home care - usually on an unpaid basis. Thesecaregivers vary in the types of tasks performed, the amount of time devoted to caregiving, andliving arrangements (i.e., same or separate household). Prevalence of Informal Caregiving More than 54 million people - 27% of the adult U.S. population - served as informal caregivers for people with chronic illnesses or disabilities between August 1999 and September 2000.7 Fifty- six percent of these caregivers were female, and 37 percent lived in the same household as thecare recipient. As compared to the total U.S. population, informal caregivers were more likely tohave annual household incomes of less than $30,000 (43% vs. 35%). No current data are available on the proportion of U.S. adults providing in-home care to people with HIV/AIDS. However, telephone interviews conducted with a probability sample of U.S.adults between June 1990 and February 1991 found that three percent of all adults and sixpercent of central-city residents were caring for HIV-positive relatives or friends. 8 Nationally, 59 percent of these caregivers were female, and 22 percent were people of color. The vast majority were under age 40 (74%) and heterosexual (90%). Thirty percent had annual household in- comes of $20,000 or less. Findings from the HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study (HCSUS), a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults receiving medical care for HIV disease, indicate that 21 percent used in-home nursing and supportive services during early 1996. 9 AIDS-diagnosed individuals were much more likely to use home care services than people in earlier stages of disease (40% vs. 10%). Ofthe home care users with AIDS, 42 percent used unpaid (informal) care only, 35 percent usedpaid (formal) care only, and 23 percent used both types of care. The most common sources of unpaid care were family members other than a spouse or partner (38%) and friends (27%). While most AIDS-diagnosed individuals relied upon relatives and friends for help with householdtasks and personal care, 22 percent received in-home nursing services (e.g., injections, infusiontherapy, parenteral nutrition) from informal caregivers. Economic Value of Informal Caregiving Two studies offer important insights on the economic value of informal caregiving. The first study10 estimated the national economic value of all informal care provided to people with chronic illnesses or disabilities during 1997. Using a midrange estimate of caregiving prevalence (25.8 million), a national average of 17.9 hours per week spent on informal caregiving, and a wage rate Chpt 20 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 41026 picas Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 20: Care for the Caregiver U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 411of $8.18 per hour, the researchers determined that this care was worth $196 billion, an amount equivalent to 18% of total health care spending. An older study11 estimated the economic value of housework and personal care tasks performed by HIV/AIDS caregivers during 1990. The informal caregivers in this study reported spending anaverage of 8.5 hours per day on personal care tasks (e.g., meal preparation, bathing and toileting,companionship) and 19 hours per week on housework. Based on the market value of theseservices, the researchers estimated the annual per capita value of informal HIV care to be $25,858. Roles of Informal Caregivers Informal caregivers perform a variety of roles that help people with HIV/AIDS adhere to treatment regimens, avoid unnecessary hospital admissions, reduce reliance on formal caregivers, remain at home longer, and maintain quality of life. Traditionally, family members have served as the primary caregivers for seriously ill individuals. Because HIV care involves more diversesocial networks, many HIV-positive individuals have redefined family boundaries to include lovers,friends, and other \"chosen kin.\" 12, 13 Findings from a 1997 national survey indicate that the typical caregiver devotes more than20 hours per week to caregiving tasks. 14 These tasks may include: \u007f Emotional support (e.g., comforting, empathizing, and providing encouragement) \u007f Help with activities of daily living (e.g., feeding, bathing, dressing, and toileting) \u007f Help with instrumental activities of daily living (e.g., cleaning the house, running errands, providing transportation) \u007f Management of financial and legal matters\u007f Health care advocacy (e.g., linking the care recipient with formal and informal services, communicating with health professionals) \u007f Nursing care (e.g., dispensing medications and monitoring use, administering injections, inserting catheters) Although informal caregivers increasingly are being asked to administer pain medications, man- age epidural catheters and home infusions, and provide wound care, relatively few studies haveexamined their contributions to palliative care. Informal caregivers can play an important rolein identifying and managing symptoms and side effects, yet most are thrust into these roles withlittle or no training. 15 BURDENS AND REWARDS OF CAREGIVING Psychologists use the term \"caregiver burden\" to describe the physical, emotional, financial, and social problems associated with caregiving.16 Burden can be assessed in terms of objective or subjective impact. Objective burden assesses the extent to which caregiving disrupts dailyroutines and social relationships and negatively affects resources. 17, 18 Examples include forced changes in household routines, missed days of work, family frictions, reduced social contacts,loss of income, and/or reduced energy. Subjective burden assesses the caregiver's perceptionsof and reactions to caregiving demands. 17, 19 Caregivers with high levels of subjective burden may report \"feeling trapped,\" \"feeling nervous or depressed about their relationship withthe care recipient,\" or \"resenting caregiving tasks\" even 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 41126 Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 20: Care for the Caregiver U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 412Causes of Burden for Informal Caregivers Multiple factors contribute to caregiver burden. First, caregiving usually comes as an unex- pected role, one for which people are neither socialized nor prepared.20 To assume this new role, caregivers must restructure preexisting role obligations and social activities and the waysin which they relate to the care recipient. 20, 21 Interpersonal strains may intensify as the caregiver and care recipient attempt to resolve issues of autonomy and reciprocity within thecontext of an increasingly asymmetrical relationship. 22 Progressive enlargement of the caregiver's role over the course of illness may require further adjustments in family, work, and social com-mitments. 23 The physical demands of informal caregiving also contribute to burden. Unlike formal caregivers,the relatives and friends providing in-home care often are \"on call\" 24 hours a day. 24 While working this 24-hour shift, caregivers may be required to perform multiple, and sometimes con- flicting roles.25 Those who have never cared for a seriously ill person must learn basic nursing skills, often under extremely stressful circumstances. They must also find ways to oversee com-plex medication schedules while meeting their own home and work obligations. Some have theadded burden of caring for entire families infected/affected by HIV disease. The emotional issues surrounding caregiving are a third source of burden. Because HIV is most prevalent among people under age 40, the caregivers also tend to be relatively young. 22, 24 The non-normative experience of caring for someone with a terminal illness can be a major source of stress for these young adults.8 For people of all ages, HIV/AIDS caregiving creates the emotional strain of dealing with an unpredictable and currently incurable disease.26 Some caregivers are burdened by fears of contracting HIV even when they know there is little basis for concern.27 Those who are already infected may worry that no one will be around to care for them when theybecome ill. 24 Adjusting to disease progression can be especially difficult for caregivers who have experienced multiple losses and the attenuation of social support networks.8 The financial impact of caregiving can be a major source of burden. Many families suffer severeeconomic hardships when a key wage earner is forced to reduce work hours or leave paid em- ployment to care for a sick partner or relative. 28 As bills accumulate, the family's most basic needs may go unmet. The loss of income also makes it difficult for caregivers to access formalresources, such as home health and respite care, that could make their tasks more manageable. A final source of burden is the stigma surrounding HIV disease. Community rejection of HIV- positive individuals because of their disease or the mode of transmission often extends to therelatives and friends who provide care. 28, 29 Rather than face stigmatization, some caregivers try to conceal their caregiving activities by withdrawing from social relationships. Those who doacknowledge their caregiving status may find it difficult to obtain support from familial or social networks. 8, 22 HIV-positive parents face additional challenges that increase their sense of burden.30, 31 These challenges include arranging for guardianship of the children, balancing the needs of \"sick\" and\"healthy\" family members, and helping their children cope with the disease and possible dis-crimination. 25 If a child is HIV-positive, the mother's guilt about transmitting the virus can be overwhelming.32 HIV-positive parents also may have unmet needs for social support. For ex- ample, in one multi-city study, only 30 percent of the HIV-positive mothers were aware of childcare Chpt 20 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 41226 picas Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 20: Care for the Caregiver U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 413services, and only 8 percent had used these services.33 In another study of African-American and Latino families with HIV-positive children, seropositive parents reported more isolation and fewer financial and support resources than uninfected caregivers.34 Causes of Burden for Formal Caregivers Many of the burdens experienced by formal and informal caregivers are the same. For ex- ample, fear of exposure is a major source of stress for some health professionals.35, 36 Formal caregivers may experience a lack of support from their families and professional colleagues dueto concerns about contagion or \"stigma by association.\" 25, 37 They also may share the informal caregiver's emotional distress about not being able to \"cure\" the disease. The unpredictable course of HIV disease and the wide range of potential complications can create significant burden, particularly for clinicians with limited HIV management experience.While attempting to control chronic symptoms and conditions, clinicians also must be preparedto treat episodes of acute illness and therapy-related side effects. Additional sources of burdeninclude repeated exposure to the death of young patients, ethical dilemmas, and finding thetime to counsel and support informal caregivers. 38, 39 Formal caregivers also may be burdened by workplace-related stressors, such as work overload, unrealistic expectations of what can beaccomplished, lack of decisionmaking autonomy, communication problems and role conflicts,and inadequate medical resources and referral arrangements. 35, 40, 41 Consequences of Caregiver Burden Caring for an individual with a chronic disease, such as HIV/AIDS, leaves little time or energy for self-care. The multiple tasks performed by caregivers may cause them to neglect nutrition,exercise, socialization, and sleep. 42 One study of women caring for people with physical or men- tal disabilities found that caregivers with high levels of subjective burden were less likely to eatbalanced diets, exercise, and participate in stress management and health-promoting activi-ties. 18 Another study of women caring for HIV-positive relatives and friends found that almost two-thirds had experienced at least one chronic physical symptom.27 A third study of Latinas caring for family members with HIV/AIDS documented high levels of physical health problemsand affective disorders. 43 Caregiver burden often produces high levels of chronic stress. The literature on caregivingdistinguishes between two types of stress. 20, 44 Primary stressors arise from the actual tasks of caregiving. These stressors may result from caregiving demands (i.e., number and intensity ofcaregiving activities), role overload, and/or the sense of being coerced into caregiving. Second-ary stressors are influenced by the caregiving role but arise outside that role. For example,caregiving may adversely affect outside employment, exacerbate family frictions, and/or reducesocial contacts. Caregivers under stress exhibit a wide range of signs and symptoms (Table 20-1). The extent to which caregivers experience these symptoms depends on their personalities, belief systems,health and energy levels, and coping skills. 42 Additional factors affecting caregivers' response to stress include the severity of the care recipient's illness, the duration of caregiving, and theaccessibility of social support and financial resources. 20, 27, 45 Chpt 20 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 41326 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 20: Care for the Caregiver U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 414Rewards of Caregiving Although studies of caregiving tend to focus on the \"burden\" of caring, there also are many rewards. When asked about the positive aspects of providing HIV/AIDS care, informal caregiverscite opportunities to: \u007f Bring mission and purpose to one's life 25, 46 \u007f Develop empathy and self-knowledge12, 37 \u007f Gain a sense of personal effectiveness by demonstrating competence under very difficult circumstances25, 37 \u007f Experience the positive feelings associated with loving, caring, and feeling needed24, 37 One study suggests that helping caregivers define the meaningful and valued aspects of their roles and become more attuned to \"brief human moments\" that create positive feelings can enhance both physical and psychological well-being.24Table 20-1: Common Signs of Stress Physical Psychological Behavioral \u007f Backaches \u007f Anger and frustration \u007f Emotional outbursts in eating patterns \u007f Loss of self-confidence \u007f Withdrawal from friends and self-esteem and family \u007f Diarrhea \u007f Loss of interest in and \u007f Loss of punctuality and commitment to work neglect of duty \u007f Elevated blood pressure \u007f Feelings of inadequacy, \u007f Decrease in judgmental helplessness, and guilt ability \u007f Fatigue \u007f Feelings of restlessness \u007f Inability to being over- \u007f Increased use of alcohol whelmed or overloaded or other drugs \u007f Insomnia \u007f Mood swings \u007f Difficulty getting along with people \u007f Muscle tension \u007f Sense of failure \u007f Impaired work performance \u007f Weight loss \u007f Anxiety about the future \u007f Resistance 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 picas Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 20: Care for the Caregiver U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 415CAREGIVER BURNOUT Finding rewards in caregiving does not necessarily make these activities less stressful. A high degree of involvement, whether positive or negative, can produce stress. The term\"burnout\" is used to describe the process in which everyday stressors that are not addressedgradually undermine the caregiver's mental and physical health. 28 Psychologists define burnout in terms of three components: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment.47 Emotional exhaustion represents the basic stress dimension of burnout. This condition is characterized by feelings of being emotionally overextended and lacking enough energy to face another day. Depersonalizationrepresents the interpersonal dimension of burnout. Feeling drained and \"used up,\" the caregiverdevelops an emotional buffer of detached concern and interacts with others in a negative andcallous manner. Reduced personal accomplishment represents the self-evaluation dimension ofburnout. This dimension is characterized by a growing sense of inadequacy and may result in aself-imposed verdict of failure. Factors Contributing to Caregiver Burnout The literature on caregiving suggests that both individual and situational factors increase the risk of burnout (Table 20-2). Empirical research suggests that situational factorsare more strongly predictive of burnout than individual characteristics. 47, 50, 51 Caregivers experiencing work overload and interpersonal conflict over an extended period of time areparticularly vulnerable to burnout. 47 Table 20-2: Factors Contributing to Caregiver Burnout Individual Situational \u007f Age (younger caregivers more subject to burnout) \u007f High expectations of oneself and others \u007f High levels of commitment, dedication, and idealism \u007f The need to work hard\u007f The need to prove oneself \u007f Strong goal orientation \u007f Difficulty saying no \u007f Difficulty delegating responsibility to others \u007f Propensity toward self-sacrifice \u007f Tendency to be a \"giver\" rather than a \"receiver\"\u007f Role ambiguity (i.e., lack of clarity about what the caregiver is supposed to do) \u007f Conflict between role demands \u007f Work overload \u007f Job tension \u007f Interpersonal conflict (with care recipient, family members, colleagues, or supervisors) \u007f Inadequate preparation for caregiving\u007f Insufficient resources to meet the demands of caregiving \u007f Inadequate social support \u007f Lack of recognition for the caregiving functions performed \u007f Workplace-related factors (e.g., unrealistic work targets, lack of decision-making autonomy, inadequate referralarrangements) Sources: References 25, 35, 48, 49.

Caregivers typically experience burnout in stages.48 Early warning signs may include feeling less motivated, putting in more hours with poorer results, and/or voicing complaintsabout the caregiving role. During later stages, caregivers develop many of the physical,psychological, and behavioral problems listed in Table 20-1. Because burnout occurs gradually,caregivers tend to keep working until the downward spiral goes too far and the costs inperformance and well-being become unacceptably high. 47 Care recipients suffer when burnout leads to lower-quality care. Caregivers struggling withemotional exhaustion often become less sensitive to the care recipient's feelings and needs.This \"compassion fatigue\" increases the likelihood that the care recipient will be neglected; treated in a detached, mechanical fashion; or even subjected to mental/physical abuse. 42, 52 Burnout symptoms, such as decreased judgmental ability and difficulty focusing on tasks, make it more difficult for caregivers to competently perform clinical roles. As these changes occur,care recipients may be at increased risk for disrupted care or placement in a long-term carefacility. 50, 52 The health care system is negatively affected when burnout depletes the supply of experiencedcaregivers and creates a need for continual training of replacements. Burnout among caregiverswho remain in the system may require greater commitments of resources for their physical and mental health care. 10 The health care system incurs additional costs when relatives and family members become too exhausted to provide in-home care and responsibility shifts to formal serviceproviders. PREVENTING AND MANAGING BURNOUT IN INFORMAL CAREGIVERS Health professionals historically have been trained to focus on the clinician-patient relationship, with little attention to the needs of the informal caregiver.48 Newer educational models encourage health professionals to develop \"partnerships\" with informal caregivers that include periodic assessment of the caregiver and the patient.53 By assessing the causes and levels of stress in informal caregivers, health professionals can more effectively tailor interventionsto meet their needs. Assessing Caregiver Burden Some informal caregivers accompany HIV-positive patients to medical appointments and can be easily identified. If a patient's sources of emotional and practical support are not known, this question should be asked when taking the family and social history. Once informal caregivers are identified, their level of perceived burden and the presence of affective disorders, such asdepression and anxiety, should be assessed. 52 The availability, accessibility, and appropriateness of social support resources also should be evaluated.32 Because caregiver burden tends to intensify over time, particularly among caregivers with the fewest personal and material resources, healthprofessionals should periodically reassess each caregiver's problems and needs. 45 The early detection of caregiver burden conserves resources by preventing or reducing medicalvisits for psychosomatic complaints. 54 In many cases, health professionals can assess the degree of burden by asking just a few questions. Parks and Novielli offer the following Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 20: Care for the Caregiver U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 417\u007f Do you feel you are currently under a lot of stress? \u007f What aspects of your day are the most stressful? \u007f Have you been feeling down or blue lately?\u007f Have you been feeling more anxious or irritable lately?\u007f Do your friends and family watch the care recipient for you so that you have time for yourself? \u007f Do you have any outside help? \u007f What do you do to relieve your stress and tension? Information on caregiver stress and burden also can be obtained from self-administered questionnaires. For example, the American Medical Association has developed a caregiverself-assessment questionnaire for use in physician offices. 53 This questionnaire contains 16 yes/no items and 2 global scale items designed to measure indices of emotional and physicaldistress. Health professionals can use the caregiver's total score or scores on individual questionsto assess the need for medical or counseling interventions and to recommend appropriatecommunity resources. Counseling Caregivers Information gained from the systematic assessment of caregiver burden places health professionals in a stronger position to help informal caregivers cope with stressors. Time shouldbe set aside during each medical appointment to discuss what is happening in caregivers' livesand to give them a chance to express their feelings. 32 In addition to serving as empathic listeners, clinicians may be able to offer practical suggestions for eliminating or better managing stressors.They also can help caregivers recognize and build on aspects of their lives that contribute tophysical, psychological, and social well-being. 55 Caregivers of HIV-positive children require comprehensive assessments of emotional burdenand social support. 32 One study of parents, relatives, and friends caring for HIV-positive children31 identified six psychosocial needs: 1. Need to Maintain Physical Integrity (i.e., desire to be knowledgeable about the modes of HIV transmission and ways ofprotecting the infected child from opportunistic infections) 2. Need to Learn (i.e., desire to know the different roles of the health professionals with whom they interact,to receive information on new HIV/AIDS treatments, to have their questions answeredhonestly, and to learn how to deal with stress) 3. Need to Act According to a Set of Beliefs and Values (i.e., desire to have health professionals respect them for doing what they believe is \"right\") 4. Need to Communicate (i.e., desire to be kept informed on the condition of the child and to be able to express theirfeelings. Desire for greater support from their informal social networks) 5. Need to Feel Worthwhile and Useful (i.e., desire to be supported by health professionals throughout the course of disease) Chpt 20 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 41726 picasA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 20: Care for the Caregiver U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 4186. Need for Continuity of Care (i.e., desire to develop and maintain relationships with the same group of health professionals) Caregivers experiencing guilt, hopelessness, or spiritual distress may need to be referred for religious or spiritual counseling. Discussions with clergy, hospital/hospice chaplains, or otherspiritual counselors can help caregivers find comfort and peace even in the absence of strongreligious or philosophical belief systems. 56 Caregivers with affective disorders or high levels of burden should be referred to mental health professionals for assessment and counseling. Health professionals sometimes overlook the importance of extending counseling into the bereavement period.57 If the relatives and friends providing care had a close relationship with the care recipient, grief may extend for two or more years after death.58 Bereavement counseling can help caregivers mourn appropriately, cope with the changes resulting from their loss, andplan for the future. (See Chapter 16: Grief and Bereavement.) Strategies for Counteracting Burnout and Promoting Self-Care The literature on caregiving describes a wide variety of strategies for preventing and managing burnout. Most of these strategies focus on ways of managing the caregiving situation ratherthan on eliminating or reducing stressors in the caregiving environment. 59 Caregivers are advised to reevaluate caregiving demands and resources, clarify values and priorities, and adopt copingstrategies that match the nature of the stressors. Anecdotal reports from informal caregiverssuggest that many of these strategies are effective; however, relatively few studies have beenconducted to assess actual outcomes. 47 Six approaches to counteracting burnout and promoting self-care receive frequent mention in the literature: 1. Use Problem-Focused Strategies to Cope with Stress. Research suggests that caregivers who use problem-focused strategies to cope with stressful situations are less likely to experience burnout than those who use emotion-focusedstrategies. 16, 41, 60 Problem-focused strategies include gathering information, planning, and taking direct action. Emotion-focused strategies include efforts to escape or avoid problems,emotional outbursts, and self-accusation. Health professionals often can assess informalcaregivers' risk for burnout by asking hypothetical questions about coping strategies. 52 For example, an emotion-focused response to the question, \"When something goes wrong withyour partner's care, how would you react?,\" may signal a need for further assessment and counseling. Specific examples of problem-focused approaches to stress can help caregivers move toward more active, engaged forms of coping. Books and web sites for caregivers offer the followingsuggestions: (See Table 20-3 for additional web sites.) \u007fEducate yourself about your care recipient's condition. Try to read at least one new resource on HIV/AIDS and/or caregiving each week. Understanding the disease processand caregiving issues will make it easier to deal with day-to-day problems. 61 \u007fAsk questions. When accompanying the care recipient to a medical appointment, don't be afraid to ask questions or to admit that you don't understand what the health profes-sional is saying. 61 Use a journal to note changes in the care recipient's health so that you can confidently discuss these concerns during medical appointments.62 Chpt 20 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 20: Care for the Caregiver U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 419\u007fKeep a daily journal to record the events that cause stress in your life. After several weeks, you should be better prepared to identify problems, evaluate the criticality of the situation, and weigh possible solutions.48 \u007fDiscuss your problems with someone else. In addition to learning how others deal with similar problems, you may be able to help them manage stress.63 \u007fIf your coping strategies are not working, seek professional help. A mental health counselor may be able to help you better understand your feelings and needs and suggestnew ways of managing stress. 48 2. Change Caregiving Patterns. Informal caregivers sometimes get so involved with their work that they lose all perspective and burn out quickly.28 This situation can be avoided by helping caregivers establish realistic goals based on an honest assessment of what they can and cannot do. Once goals areestablished, caregiving patterns can be changed by: \u007f Breaking down tasks into small acts of care 64 \u007f Learning how to adjust the pace of caregiving65 \u007f Asking others to help with caregiving tasks61-63, 66 \u007f Encouraging the care recipient to help with tasks and continue self-care as long as possible21 Caregivers with high levels of subjective burden should be reminded that no one expectsthem to be perfect. A \"level of care prescription\" from the physician may help them achievea better balance between caregiving responsibilities and their own physical and mental healthneeds. One guide for caregivers offers the following advice: Let go. No one person can do it all. Acknowledge that as a human you have limitations just like everyone else. Allow others to help you; delegate responsibilities. Practice asking for help and saying no once in awhile. Lower your expectations and tolerate that things might not get done perfectly. . . . Prioritize tasks and learn to manage your time. 48 3. Adopt Relaxation Techniques. Many caregivers use relaxation techniques to manage stress and prevent burnout. These techniques should fit with the individual caregiver's interests, time, and resources. Somecaregivers may wish to learn yoga or tai chi, while others may prefer to take a walk, listen tomusic, or soak in a warm bath. Armstrong describes a visualization technique in whichcaregivers close their eyes and imagine a scene of beauty and tranquility into which theyproject themselves. She also suggests reserving ten minutes each day for a \"worry break.\" 28 The idea is to consolidate all worries into this period and then to set them aside until the next day. Additional relaxation techniques recommended by caregivers include meditation, deep-breathing exercises, massage therapy, gardening, exercising, reading, and socializingwith friends.

Strive for Good Health. Healthful lifestyles play an important role in burnout prevention. By eating three balanced meals each day, engaging in regular physical activity, and sleeping 7 to 9 hours each night,caregivers can increase their capacity to manage stress. In addition to promotingcardiovascular fitness and building muscular strength, exercise programs increase energyand provide a needed outlet for pent-up emotions. These programs may involve vigorousworkouts, but significant health benefits also can be gained from just walking 20 to 30 minuteseach day. One study of informal caregivers of HIV-positive minority women suggeststhat maintaining a regular exercise regimen, along with a spiritual focus, can be an effectivecoping strategy. 67 Some caregivers react to stress by engaging in unhealthful behaviors such as smoking, drinking,and drug misuse. While these chemicals may provide a \"quick fix,\" their long-term use islikely to increase anxiety and health problems - particularly among caregivers who are noteating or sleeping properly. Caregivers should be informed of the harmful effects of thesebehaviors and encouraged to participate in counseling and/or treatment programs. Alternativeand complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, aromatherapy, acupressure, and massage,also may help to relieve stress. 5. Maintain a Life outside the Caregiving Role. Caregivers often respond to stress by becoming over-involved with caregiving duties. 28 The constant demands of the job may cause caregivers to neglect friends, interests, and activitiesthat once gave them pleasure. Health professionals should encourage caregivers to takeregular breaks and to keep up with their interests and hobbies as best they can. 62 For some caregivers, outside employment may provide relief from everyday tensions. Others may simply need to get away for a few hours. Health professionals can help caregivers \"jump-start\" theself-renewal process by linking them with social support resources. 6. Build a Support Network. Although U.S. cultural norms emphasize self-sufficiency, 68 empirical studies suggest that caregivers with higher levels of social support are less likely to experience negative outcomes.69 Social resources can provide emotional comfort and practical support; reduce social isolation; and offer humor, recognition, and encouragement.47 They also can be a valuable source of new information and insights.59 Social support resources should be explored if the caregiver's answers to screening questions suggest a need for outside assistance. Formal sources of social support include: \u007f AIDS service organizations (provide supportive services such as buddy/companion programs, case management, emergency financial support, food banks, housingassistance, nutritional counseling, and transportation assistance) \u007f Home health agencies (provide skilled nursing care, homemaker and personal care services, and rehabilitation services) \u007f Home-delivered meal programs\u007f Hospice programs (provide in-home or residential palliative and supportive care services for patients in the terminal stages of illness) \u007f Respite care programs (provide short-term, temporary nonmedical care for people with disabilities and chronic or terminal illnesses) Chpt 20 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 42026 picas Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 20: Care for the Caregiver U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 421Respite Care Respite care provides short-term, temporary, nonmedical care to people with disabilities and chronic or terminal illnesses so that their primary caregivers can rest, take a vacation, or attend to personal tasks. Some respite programs send a caregiver to the care recipient's home; others require that the individual come to a respite care facility. Services are provided for varying lengths of time, depending upon the primary caregiver's needs and available resources. Respite programs are provided by a variety of organizations, including adult day care centers, hospitals, home health agencies, nursing homes, local Red Cross chapters, schools, and faith communities. In some localities, the families of people with chronic illnesses have formed respite care exchange programs.65 The ARCH National Respite Network and Resource Center operates a national locator service (http://www.chtop.com/locator.htm) to help caregivers locate respite care providers in their states and communities. Contact information also can be obtained from AIDS service organizations, health departments , and United Way offices. Studies of the impact of respite care have documented significant improvements in caregivers' emotional well-being and perceived ability to cope, but these effects may be short-lived without repeated use.42 Many family caregivers who could benefit from respite services never request this help because of fears that they will be shirking their responsibilities, that something will go wrong during the sta y, or that they will no longer feel needed if the temporary caregiver performs well.68 Parents of HIV-positive children may be particularly reluctant to use respite services because of the guilt and stigma associated with the mode of transmission.32 Discussions with health professionals and families who have used respite care may help informal caregivers overcome these obstacles. Informal sources of social support include: \u007f Family members, other relatives, and friends \u007f Other caregivers who are willing to rotate caregiving responsibilities\u007f Faith communities\u007f Caregiver support groups Caregiver Support Groups Support groups bring caregivers together to share feelings and experiences and to learn from one another. In contrast to group therapy, their purpose is not to change participants' behaviors but to enhance decision-making capacity and coping effectiveness.70 Research suggests that support groups can significantly reduce caregiver stress; however,they cannot substitute for professional counseling or therapy when these services are needed. 42 One of the major benefits of support groups is to provide an outlet for emotions that cannot be expressed in the home.48 Support groups also provide opportunities to: \u007f Become better informed about HIV/AIDS, new treatments and community resources \u007f Share problems and brainstorm solutions \u007f Establish social contacts \u007f Lessen the sense of stigma associated with HIV care \u007f Obtain recognition for caregiving efforts \u007f Arrange respite care exchanges with other caregivers To take advantage of these opportunities, the relatives and friends of HIV-positive individuals must be willing to divulge their caregiving status - something that may be very difficult to do in small, closely knit communities. They also must find the time to attend support group meetings, locate someone who can provide care in their absence, and make arrangements for transportation. Telephone support groups may be an option for caregivers who wish to maintain anonymity or who cannot attend meetings.

After assessing the caregiver's level of knowledge about HIV/AIDSand the types of tasks performed, health professionals should offer appropriate education. The educational topics may include: \u007f Modes of HIV transmission\u007f Effects and side effects of medications\u007f Drug-taking schedules and strategies for improving adherence \u007f Basic information on nutrition \u007f Symptoms and problems to expect as the disease progresses Informal caregivers also may benefit from instruction on infection control, pain and symptom management, and simple nursing techniques (e.g., administering injections, cleaning and dressing ulcers). As new treatments are discovered and standards of care change, informal caregivers need to receive ongoing education. Topics should be introduced slowly, over an extended period, sinceindividuals under stress can process only small amounts of information at a given time. 42 To the extent possible, these topics should be explained in nonmedical terms, with ample opportunityfor caregivers to ask questions. The use of educationally and linguistically appropriate videosand written materials may help reinforce key concepts. PREVENTING AND MANAGING BURNOUT IN FORMAL CAREGIVERS Counteracting burnout among formal caregivers requires a two-pronged approach. In addi- tion to helping individual caregivers develop more effective coping strategies, interventions shouldtarget policies and practices in the workplace that create or exacerbate stress. 28 Formal caregivers can benefit from coping effectiveness training, but these techniques will be only partially effec-tive if the work environment is not supportive. 47 Situational strategies attempt to reduce the incidence of burnout by eliminating or modifyingworksite stressors. These strategies promote engagement with work (i.e., high energy, stronginvolvement, and a sense of self-efficacy) by: \u007f Establishing clear job descriptions and good referral mechanisms \u007f Setting realistic work targets\u007f Restructuring jobs to make workloads more manageable\u007f Providing training on HIV management, new approaches to pain and symptom management, and effective ways of communicating with patients and familymembers \u007f Offering on-site health promotion programs\u007f Encouraging staff to participate in policy decisions that affect their work\u007f Providing regular time off and appropriate rewards \u007f Scheduling regular memorial services for staff wishing to remember and grieve lost patients Conflict among formal caregivers can be prevented, or at least managed, by scheduling regular forums for case discussion. 40 Although these sessions reduce the time available for direct service, Chpt 20 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 42226 picas Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 20: Care for the Caregiver U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 423they help promote collegiality, information sharing, and a consensual, comprehensive approach to care.40, 42 Case forums may need to be supplemented by support groups, where caregivers can openly acknowledge the stresses of their work and discuss ways of eliminating or coping with stressors. CONCLUSION Over the past decade, improved antiretroviral regimens, concerns about the costs of inpatient care, and consumer preferences have shifted HIV care from hospitals to home and community-based settings. 9, 71 This shift has placed heavy demands on the family and friends of HIV-positive individuals, many of whom have very little knowledge of HIV management or available resources. Formal caregivers also are faced with intense pressures as they struggle to keep pace with rapidly changing standards of HIV care. Because informal caregivers experience varying types of burdens and have differential access to financial resources and social support, strategies for counteracting burnout and promoting self-care must be tailored to their individual needs. Many of the strategies recommended in thecaregiving literature assume that caregivers are middle-income, fairly well educated, andsurrounded by family and friends who are willing to help. As HIV continues to penetrate poorand marginalized communities, new or modified approaches may be needed to help caregivers manage stress and maintain good physical and mental health. These strategies are likely to require family-centered case management and integrated primary care and behavioral healthservices for patients and caregivers. Strategies for counteracting burnout among formal caregivers must address both individual and situational factors. Formal caregivers may be able to change the ways in which they dealwith stressors by developing a better understanding of their personalities, values, and copingstrategies. However, their efforts will be only partially effective if negative policies and practices in the workplace remain unchanged. Finding ways to enhance the working environment may ultimately prove more effective in preventing burnout than teaching caregivers how to managestress. Advances in HIV antiretroviral therapy are changing but not necessarily improving the conditions of caregiving. Although HIV-positive individuals are living longer, many are developing therapy-related side effects that require monitoring and management in the home. By systematicallyassessing the causes and levels of stress in informal caregivers, health professionals can offereducation and counseling that is more responsive to individual needs.

The reasons these trials have been unable to improve communication are not entirelyclear, but part of the reason is likely the complexity and difficulty of communicating aboutpalliative care and particularly about dying and death.Advances in the treatment of HIV infection have been dramatic and unprecedented with markedimprovements in survival and quality of life. 8, 9 The new antiretroviral regimens, however, are not successful for all patients; many patients find themselves facing a death from AIDS at thesame time that many others are having favorable responses to antiretroviral therapy. Patientsand clinicians have described death from AIDS as changing from fate during the early era ofAIDS to tragedy during the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. 10 In this way, caring for the patient dying of AIDS has become more similar to caring for patients dying of other chronicdiseases and some clinicians report that these changes have made it harder to talk with patientsabout dying and end-of-life care. 10 Similar to the data on patients with other chronic diseases, most patients with AIDS have notdiscussed with their primary care clinicians the kind of care they want at the end-of-life. In asurvey completed in 1985 of patients with HIV infection, although 73% wanted to discuss life-sustaining treatment with their physicians, only one-third of patients reported having had sucha discussion. 11 In a study of 1031 persons with AIDS published in 1990, 68% knew of advance directives, but only 11% had talked with their provider about advance directives.12 More recently, in a U.S. probability sample of 2864 patients representing 231,400 adults receiving care for HIV,50% of patients reported having some discussion about end-of-life care with their provider and36% of patients reported having an advance directive. 1 Although these proportions may be increasing over time, still at least half of patients with HIV infection or AIDS have not discussedend-of-life care with their primary care provider and two-thirds have not completed advancedirectives. Furthermore, many of these studies document important differences in the proportionof patients who discuss end-of-life care with their primary care clinicians according to HIV riskfactor, race, and ethnicity. Gay men are more likely to have been counseled about and executeda prior directive than injection drug users 1, 12 and whites are more likely to have discussed end- of-life care than blacks and Hispanics.1, 2 Furthermore, even when clinicians communicate about end-of-life care, injection drug users report lower quality of communication about end-of-lifecare than gay or bisexual men. 13 Therefore, many patients with HIV infection, particularlyChapter 21.

Since persons with AIDS who have discussed their preferences with their clinicians are significantly more likely to receive care in accord with their preferences,14 these studies suggest patient-clinician communication may be an important step in providing appropriate end-of-life care but that this communication occurs infrequently. Several surveys of HIV-infected individuals have examined patient preferences for life-sustaining treatment, and understanding these preferences may help clinicians discuss palliative care withtheir patients. Singer and colleagues showed that of 101 patients with HIV, 60% to 70% of patientswould want mechanical ventilation and CPR in the event of an acute potentially reversible illness. 15 Mouton and colleagues showed that patient treatment preferences were associated with patientethnicity in that whites were twice as likely to prefer a treatment approach that focused onrelieving pain as opposed to extending life and that this association persisted even after controllingfor education, income and HIV risk behavior. 16 Wenger and colleagues asked patients if they would prefer life-extending care or care focused on comfort and found that although 30% stated that they would definitely prefer to extend life, almost 25% stated they would definitely prefer tofocus on relieving discomfort even if it meant not living as long. 1 While it may be useful for clinicians to be aware of these results, there is such diversity of preferences for patients withHIV infection as to make patient-clinician communication of utmost importance. COMMUNICATING WITH PATIENTS AND SIGNIFICANT OTHERS ABOUT PALLIATIVE CARE A number of review articles and books provide clinicians with advice about how to communicate with patients and their significant others concerning the delivery of bad news17-20 and palliative medicine.21 Although these reviews provide valuable insights, they tend to focus on the delivery of bad news. Communication about end-of-life care with patients suffering a potentially life-threatening illness such as HIV infection or AIDS includes a spectrum of communication aboutprognosis, treatment options, goals of therapy, values, and treatment preferences. 22 Clinicians caring for patients with chronic and life-threatening diseases need to learn how to discuss end-of-life care with their patients. In the acute care settings, these conversations may concern patients incapable of participating in these discussions because of the severity of their illness, and often clinicians must communicatewith family members and friends of the patient. 23-25 The acute care setting frequently involves complicated, confusing, and even discordant data that can be overwhelming to patients'significant others and make them more dependent on the health care team for assistance withdecisionmaking. 26 For example, a critically ill patient may have improvement in one organ system while showing deterioration in several others. There are also more likely to be discordant viewsabout the appropriate treatment among hospital team members, consultants, and primary careproviders as well as the significant others. 26 Finally, patients with HIV infection may be at higher risk of having estranged family members who are unaware of their HIV infection, let alone theirtreatment preferences. Injection drug users commonly have fractured social situations and poor social support that can also complicate these discussions. Therefore, clinicians practicing in these settings and caring for patients with HIV infection must be skilled at communicatingwith patients, extended family members, and significant others in the lives of their patients. Chpt 21 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 43226 picas Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 21: Patient-Clinician Communication U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 433ADVANCE DIRECTIVES In the 1980s, many prominent investigators believed that advance directives would allow patients to inform their health care providers what kind of care they would want if they becametoo sick to speak for themselves. 27-29 Advance directives, including the living will and durable power of attorney for health care, were promoted as a way to improve end-of-life care. (SeeChapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues.) A logical extension of this argument is that advancedirectives could diminish the need for clinicians to discuss end-of-life care with patients andtheir significant others. However, numerous studies have suggested that advance directives donot significantly affect the aggressiveness or costs of subsequent care 5, 7, 30 and do not change end-of-life decisionmaking in hospital settings.31-33 These studies have led many to lose faith in advance directives.34-36 However, despite a general disillusionment with the documents, they can play an important role in some circumstances. For example, patients who would want theirsurrogate decisionmaker to be a same-sex partner or friend rather than their legal next of kin should complete a durable power of attorney for health care. However, it is important that clinicians inform patients that completion of the document is only the first step; patients mustalso discuss their values and their treatment preferences with this person. Furthermore, recentevidence shows that the most important factor associated with whether patients with HIVinfection have an advance directive is whether their primary care provider has discussed advancedirectives with them. 1 These data suggest that providers play an important role in increasing advance directive completion. Advance care planning, defined more broadly as an ongoing discussion among patients, surrogate decisionmakers, and providers, may be a more effective means of allowing patients' wishes to be followed if they become too ill to speak for themselves. Although to date there are no datademonstrating the effectiveness of advance care planning, such communication is an importantpart of good quality medical care. Advance care planning incorporates a broad set of goals andinvolves having the communication discussed in this chapter. CURRENT QUALITY OF COMMUNICATION ABOUT PALLIATIVE CARE There are limited data examining the quality of communication about palliative care with patients with HIV infection or AIDS. One study assessing the quality of communication suggeststhat patients are relatively satisfied with this communication, 13 but this may be due, in part, to patients' low expectations. Furthermore, in this study 25% of patients and their primary careclinicians did not agree about whether they had discussed end-of-life care, suggesting the qualityof communication may be limited. Previous researchers have assessed the quality of patient-clinician communication with general hospitalized patients about \"Do Not Resuscitate\" orders. 37 These studies found substantial short- comings in the communication skills of clinicians, noting that physicians spent 75% of the time talking and missed important opportunities to allow patients to discuss their personal valuesand goals of therapy. These investigators also showed that the majority of these physicians feltthat they did a good job discussing \"Do Not Resuscitate\" orders, but that they had very littletraining about how to hold these types of discussions with patients. 38 In a more recent study, these same investigators examined communication between primary care physicians andoutpatients about advance directives. 39, 40 In this study, investigators again found that physicians Chpt 21 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 43326 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 21: P atient-Clinician Communication U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 434rarely elicited information about patient goals and values, avoided discussing uncertainty, and rarely asked patients to explain why they had specific treatment preferences or what was important to them about their quality of life after treatment. There is also some data to suggest that non-physician primary care providers such as nurse practitioners or physicians' assistantsare no better than physicians at communication about end-of-life care. 13 In summary, these data suggest that the quality of patient-clinician communication about end-of-life care is poorand unlikely to improve under our current system of health care delivery and medical education.These studies challenge us to develop better ways to teach end-of-life communication skills toclinicians in training and in practice. 26 THE ROLE OF THE PATIENT'S SIGNIFICANT OTHERS IN COMMUNICATION ABOUT PALLIATIVE CARE The western ethical principle of patient autonomy dictates that patients should be involved in decisions about their medical care and that communication about a patient's care shouldoccur with the patient. However, it is important to recognize that many patients would like theirsignificant others to be directly involved in discussions and even decisions about their care. Infact, when patients are asked for their preference in a circumstance where they could notcommunicate and where their advance directives differed from what their loved ones would likedone, most patients stated they would rather that the wishes of their loved ones be followed. 41 This study shows the importance of involving patients' significant others in end-of-lifedecisionmaking. The importance of including the patients' significant others becomes evenmore important when patients are from cultures that focus on the family as the decisionmaking unit. Clinicians working with patients from cultures that focus decisionmaking on the family unit must develop the skills and expertise in communicating with the entire family. 42 (See Chapter 14: Culture and Care.) If a patient can no longer communicate his or her wishes for medical care, the legal surrogate decisionmaker is usually identified in a hierarchical fashion. First priority usually goes to anindividual named in a durable power of attorney for health care and then to family members. Inmost States and countries, the family members primarily responsible for decisionmaking are, in order, legal spouse, parent, adult children, and siblings. If there is more than one individual at a given level in the hierarchy, such as occurs in the family with several siblings, many States andcountries require that the decision be based on group consensus. Although the law may specifya legal decisionmaker, in most cases the actual decisionmaking process occurs in a series ofconferences and individual meetings with all individuals who have strong ties to the patient. 43 Decisionmaking is usually facilitated if all interested individuals are involved early and completely. THE ROLE OF THE HEALTH CARE TEAM IN COMMUNICATION ABOUT PALLIATIVE CARE The health care team is made up of a number of health care professionals, including physicians, nurses, social workers, and others. Different team members may play varying roles in differentsettings. It is important that all team members who are directly involved in communicationwith patients and their significant others be aware of all communication about end-of-life care.Consensus within the team is an important step in the process of making decisions aboutwithholding or withdrawing life-sustaining therapy regardless of whether the setting is anintensive care unit, hospital ward, or outpatient setting. Of the few legal cases brought against Chpt 21 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 43426 picas Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 21: Patient-Clinician Communication U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 435health care providers for end-of-life decisions, most have been initiated by disgruntled colleagues. In addition, it is important that all team members are informed about the medical situation and plan of therapy so that patients and their significant others do not receive conflicting messages from different staff members. Acute care nurses play a pivotal role in clinician-significant other communication in the acute care settings.44-46 Significant others rate the nurses' skill at this communication as one of the most important clinical skills of nurses.47-50 In a meta-analysis of studies assessing the needs of significant others who have a loved one in intensive care, 8 of the 10 needs identified relate tocommunication with clinicians, and the majority of these communication needs are primarilyaddressed by the nurses. 47 In the outpatient setting, nurses, nurse practitioners, and physicians' assistants also may play an important role. However, there are data to suggest that nurses are not better at communication about end-of-life care than physicians 51 and, in fact, in the outpatient setting nurse practitioners and physicians' assistant may actually not do as well as physicians incommunication about end-of-life. 13 Consequently, it is likely that nurses, nurse practitioners, and physicians' assistants could also benefit from efforts to improve the quality of thiscommunication. In acute care settings, social workers often play an important role in identifying and contacting significant others, coordinating and scheduling family conferences, and keeping in contact with significant others during the hospital stay. This is a very important role in providing sensitive care and in communicating with patients' significant others. The person filling this role shouldbe aware of the medical prognosis and plans and be an active part of the health care team. Inthe outpatient setting, social workers may be the ones primarily responsible for many of thesediscussions with patients and consequently need to develop the same skills and expertise in thiscommunication. THE ROLE OF CULTURE AND ETHNICITY IN COMMUNICATION ABOUT PALLIATIVE CARE Culture and ethnicity are important factors to consider in patient-clinician communication, and cross-cultural dynamics may be especially important in discussing palliative care for patientswith HIV infection. Black and Hispanic persons, women, and injection drug users aredisproportionately affected by HIV infection 52 and are at increased risk for receiving lower quality medical care.53, 54 They are also less likely to communicate with their primary care clinicians about end-of-life care than white homosexual or bisexual men with AIDS.1, 2, 55 Consequently, they represent important populations to target for improvements in the quality of communication.If this is to be done, it will be important to identify the barriers to communication unique tothese patient groups and individuals. Nonwhite patients with AIDS are more likely to reportthat they don't like to talk about end-of-life care and are more likely to worry that talking about death could bring death closer than white patients with AIDS. 56 Similarly, injection drug users and women with high-risk sexual partners are also more likely to worry that if they talked aboutdeath it could bring death closer. 56 Clinicians should be aware of the diversity of barriers that may exist for patients from different cultures and be open to discussing these barriers openlywith patients. 56, 57 Chpt 21 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 43526 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 21: P atient-Clinician Communication U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 436WHEN TO TALK ABOUT PALLIATIVE CARE It is impossible to be prescriptive about the \"right\" time to discuss palliative and end-of-life care, except to say that we should talk about it earlier than we usually do. Oftentimes, clinicians,particularly physicians, wait until they have decided that life-sustaining treatments are no longerindicated before they initiate communication about palliative and end-of-life care with patientsor their significant others. Patients and significant others may be just beginning to think aboutwithdrawing life-sustaining treatments while clinicians are feeling increasingly frustrated atproviding care they believe is no longer indicated. Alternatively, the patients and significantothers may be considering withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments well before the health careteam. The team members may also vary in the timing with which they believe that life-sustainingtherapy should be withheld or withdrawn. In the acute care setting, nurses often come to thisconclusion earlier than physicians, which can lead to extreme frustration for some nurses 58, 59 and interdisciplinary conflict for physicians and nurses. A potential solution to this difficulty is to begin discussions with the health care team, patients, and significant others early in the course of a chronic illness. However, early in the course ofcare these discussions may focus on prognosis, goals of therapy, and the patients' values andattitudes toward medical therapy. These early discussions may foreshadow or set the stage forsubsequent discussions about transitioning to palliative care goals or about withdrawing orwithholding life-sustaining treatments. These discussions can also be a way for clinicians to letpatients and their significant others know that palliative care and end-of-life care are importanttopics that the clinician is willing to discuss. HOW TO TALK ABOUT PALLIATIVE CARE Because discussing palliative care with patients and their significant others is an important part of providing high quality care for patients with life-threatening diseases, these discussionsshould be approached with the same care and planning that are given to other important medicalprocedures. For example, 1) time and thought should be put into the preparations needed priorto holding this discussion, 2) the location of the discussion should be planned, 3) if possible, a preliminary discussion should be held with the patient about who should be present and what will be covered during the discussion, and 4) what is likely to happen after the discussion shouldbe anticipated. These four issues address the processes that ideally should occur before, during,and after the discussion. Table 21-1 outlines some of the steps that may facilitate goodcommunication about palliative care and these are described in more detail below.

Clinicians should review what is known about the patient's disease process includingthe diagnosis, prognosis, treatment options, and likely outcomes with different treatments.Clinicians should identify gaps in their knowledge by systematically reviewing this informationand seek out the information they need before they find themselves in a discussion with patientsor their significant others. Clinicians should also be aware of the communication that hasoccurred with other team members and of the plans for care established or agreed upon by anyother care provider responsible for the patient's care. It is also important for clinicians to review what they know about the patient and their family and social support network including their relationships with one another, their attitudes toward illness, treatment, and death, and their prior reactions to information about illness and death.If, for example, there are significant others who have had strong emotional reactions to badnews, it may be helpful to mobilize the aid of a family member, friend, or staff member, such asa social worker or chaplain, who can support them through and after the discussion with theclinician. Finally, it is useful for clinicians to consider their own feelings of grief, anxiety, or guilt before holding a discussion about palliative care with patients or significant others. This may be especially important when the clinician has known the patient or significant others for a long time, when the clinician and patient or significant other have been through a lot together, orwhen the clinician has some feelings of inadequacy about the patient's condition or treatment.Acknowledging these feelings explicitly can help the clinician avoid projecting his or her ownfeelings or biases onto the patient or the significant others. In addition, the clinician's ownfeelings of guilt or inadequacy can lead him or her to avoid the patient or significant others or toavoid talking with them about death. Reviewing these feelings by oneself or with another cliniciancan be the first step to becoming more comfortable discussing dying and death with a patient orsignificant other. 60, 61 An additional step in preparing for an end-of-life discussion is to plan where the discussion willtake place and who will be there. Ideally, these discussions should take place in a quiet andprivate room where there is some assurance that people, phones, or pagers will not interrupt thediscussion. It should be a room that is comfortable for all the participants without a lot ofmedical machinery or other distractions such as medical diagrams. All parties should be sittingat the same level around a table or chairs in a circle. It is best to avoid having a clinician sittingbehind a desk with the patient and significant others in front of the desk. If the patient canparticipate in the discussion but is too ill to leave their hospital bed, efforts should be made tomake the room comfortable for everyone present. Before the scheduled conference about palliative care, the clinician, patient, and significant others should discuss who should be present for the conference. In addition, the clinician shouldmake certain that all appropriate members of the staff are consulted about whether they shouldbe present, including the medical staff, nursing staff, chaplains, and trainees who have beeninvolved with the patient or significant others. Ideally, someone should take responsibility forscheduling the conference at a time when as many as possible can be present. It may be helpfulto suggest that patients and their significant others write down any questions they havebeforehand to be sure their questions are answered.

For example, some staff memberspresent for the discussion may not have met all family members or significant others. Take thetime to go around the room to be sure everyone has met everyone else and knows their roleeither on the staff or in the patient's life. Introducing the issue of palliative or end-of-life care can be a crucial and difficult part of these discussions. Often, by the time these discussions occur, everyone involved knows that thediscussion will focus on how to help the patient transition to palliative care goals or even to diein comfort and with dignity. But sometimes patients or their significant others may not beaware that this is a part of the clinician's agenda. In those situations, the clinician should make the patient or significant others as comfortable as possible talking about dying and death. In these latter situations, it may be helpful to frame the discussion by saying that these arediscussions that are held with all patients with HIV infection or, if appropriate, with AIDS. Not everyone present will have the same level of understanding of the patient's condition; thus it is often helpful to first find out what the patient and significant others understand of thepatient's situation. This can be a useful way for the clinician to determine how much informationcan be given, the level of detail that will be understood, and the amount of technical languagethat can be used. It can also be useful in some settings to ask the patient or significant others how much they want to hear on this day as a way to gauge how much information and detail to give. Clinicians should avoid unnecessary technical jargon and should be cautious about usingtechnical jargon rather than saying words like \"dying\" or \"death.\" Clinicians should also becautious about using medical detail to cover the uncomfortable message about the patient'sprognosis. However, some patients will be very familiar with technical details and will wantsophisticated explanations of their condition. Therefore, it is important to assess the patient'sknowledge and desire for information. During these discussions, it is important to discuss prognosis in an honest way that is meaningful to patients and their significant others. For example, the term \"median survival\" is not very meaningful to most people. In discussing prognosis, clinicians should also be honest about thedegree of uncertainty in the prognosis. Finally, it is important to provide honest informationabout the prognosis without completely discouraging hope from those patients or families whowould like to maintain their hope. This can be a difficult balancing act for clinicians, but it is apart of the art of holding these discussions. There are several specific ways that clinicians canallow patients or their significant others to maintain their hope in the face of a poor prognosis.First, the clinician can allow the patient or significant other some time to get used to a poorprognosis. In the acute care setting, sometimes this can take days; in the outpatient setting thiscan take weeks, months, or even years. Regardless of how much time it takes, it can be helpfulto patients or significant others if they are allowed to make this transition at their own pace.Second, the clinician can help the patient or significant other redirect their hope and move them from a hope for recovery to hope for other things such as quality of life in the time that remains, some quality time together, achieving a particular goal, or a comfortable death withoutpain or discomfort and with as much dignity and meaning as possible.

The discussions about palliative care that are most difficult are ones in which the patient's or significant others' views and the clinicians' views are dramatically different. Making the effort to discover these differences andworking to minimize them can be time-consuming, but it is usually time well spent as it cangreatly facilitate decisions about palliative care. This does not mean that clinicians shouldconvince the patient or significant other of the clinicians' views, but rather identify the sourceof the differences and work toward compromise. It is extremely important in a discussion about palliative care that the patient and/or their significant others understand that if the decision is made to withhold or withdraw a particular treatment, the clinicians themselves are not withdrawing from caring for the patient. While this may seem obvious to some clinicians, it should be stated explicitly to patients and familiesto avoid any misunderstanding. After discussing prognosis and treatment options and the patient's or significant other's level of understanding, it is important to spend some time exploring and listening to the patient's and/or significant others' reactions to what was discussed. Clinicians should understand that patientsand significant others will react to their perception of what was said and that they may not reactin the way the clinician expects. There are several useful techniques that clinicians can use to explore patients' or significant others' reactions. First, it can be helpful to repeat what patients or significant others have said as a way to show that the clinician has heard them and test theclinician's understanding. This can be particularly useful when the clinician and the patient orsignificant other have different views of what is happening or what should happen. Second, it isimportant to acknowledge emotions that come up in these discussions. Whether the emotion isanger, anxiety, guilt, or sadness, it is useful for the clinician to acknowledge the emotion in a way that allows the person with the emotion to talk about their feelings. In acknowledging suchemotions, it can be useful for the clinician to use reflection to show empathy and to encouragediscussion about the emotion. For example, a clinician can say \"it seems to me that you are veryangry about the care you have received, can you tell me why that is?\" In this way, the cliniciancan show empathy for a patient and allow that patient to talk about their feelings. Finally,another technique clinicians can use in these discussions is to tolerate silences. Sometimes, it is after what seems like a long silence that patients or significant others will ask a particularly difficult question or express a difficult emotion. Important Issues in Discussions About Palliative and End-of-Life Care in HIV/AIDS There are some unique features about HIV/AIDS that warrant additional mention. First, the demographics of the HIV epidemic requires that clinicians caring for these patients have skills and experience in discussing palliative care with young patients, in cross-cultural circumstances, and with patients who do not have intact social support systems. If clinicians see a large propor-tion of patients from a specific culture, ethnicity, or religion, it behooves them to understandsome of the cross-cultural issues that may arise around palliative care and end-of-life care forthose patients. It is also important not to assume that a patients' race, ethnicity, or religionnecessarily defines their attitudes toward death or the disclosure of prognostic information. Inaddition, it may not be possible for clinicians to be aware of the cultural attitudes concerningdeath for all cultures from which their patients may come. Therefore, a series of open-ended Chpt 21 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 21: Patient-Clinician Communication U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 441questions may help clinicians explore these attitudes in order to provide culturally-appropriate care. An example of some of questions that might be helpful are listed in Table 21-2 from a recent review article65 and adapted from an article by Kleinman and colleagues.64 If patients lack social support, social services and social workers may be a vital component of the palliativecare team. Finally, as noted above, the durable power of attorney may be of particular impor-tance for patients with AIDS who may be more likely to wish to have a same sex partner or afriend make decisions for them if they are unable rather than have this task be the responsibilityof their legal next of kin.

Second, the dramatic improvements in survival due to advances in anti-retroviral therapy over the 1990's requires clinicians to address palliative care with patients who may have varied anddiverse experiences of the AIDS epidemic. Some patients may have confronted having a termi-nal disease only to respond to anti-retroviral therapy and come to believe their disease could becured or controlled and then have to readdress the terminal nature of their disease. Otherpatients may have always viewed HIV/AIDS as a curable or controllable illness and may havedisillusionment with the medical system if their disease progresses or may blame themselves forlapses in adherence with their treatments. Some patients may have friends and family who areresponding well to anti-retroviral therapy at the same time that their own anti-retroviral therapy is failing them. These variations may each require different approaches on the part of the clini- cian caring for these patients. Many patients will benefit from open and direct communicationabout their concerns and worries. Finally, many patients with HIV/AIDS have a history of drug addiction and this history may cause them great concern regarding the adequacy of pain assessment and management as they approachthe end-of-life. 66 A drug addiction history may complicate pain management in these patients, but in general patients should be reassured that their history of drug addiction will not prevent ad-equate treatment of pain and other sympt oms during the terminal ph ase of their illness. (See Chapter 11: Substance Use Problems.) Finishing a Discussion about Palliative and End-of-Life Care Before finishing a discussion about end-of-life care, there are several steps that clinicians should make. First, it is important that clinicians make recommendations during the discussion.With the increasing emphasis on patient autonomy and surrogate decisionmaking, there may bea tendency for some clinicians to describe the treatment options to a patient or significant otherbut to then feel like they should not make a recommendation. On the contrary, it is importantthat clinicians offer their expertise to patients and their significant others, and part of offeringtheir expertise is making a recommendation. 62 This is especially important in discussions with Chpt 21 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 44126 picasA Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 21: P atient-Clinician Communication U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 442significant others concerning withholding or withdrawing life support. It is a disservice to leave a significant other feeling like they were alone in making the decision to \"pull the plug\" on a loved one in situations where ongoing life support therapy is unlikely to provide significant benefit. Clinicians should summarize the major points and ask patients and significant others if there are any questions. This is a good time to tolerate silence, as it may take some time for theuncomfortable questions to surface. Finally, before completing a discussion about end-of-life care, clinicians should ensure that there is an adequate follow-up plan. This often means a plan for when the clinician will meet with thepatient or significant other again and a way for the patient or significant others to reach the clinician if questions arise before the next meeting. UNDERSTANDING OUR OWN DISCOMFORT DISCUSSING DEATH Discomfort discussing death is universal. This is not a problem unique to physicians, nurses, social workers, or other health care providers, but has its roots in our society's denial of dyingand death. Medical schools and nursing schools have only recently begun to teach students howto help patients and families through the dying process and still do so in a limited way. 63 Major medical textbooks have had scant information about end-of-life care.42 For all these reasons, it is not surprising that many clinicians have difficulty talking with their patients and others aboutpalliative or end-of-life care. Furthermore, the medical culture is one of using technology tosave lives, and for many clinicians discussing dying and death is even more difficult in thistechnologic, aggressive care era. To compound this difficulty, clinicians can also feel that apatient's death will reflect poorly on their skills as a clinician and represents a failure on theirpart to save or extend the patient's life. It is important for clinicians to recognize the difficulty they have discussing dying and death. If clinicians acknowledge this difficulty, they can work to minimize some of the common effects that such discomfort can cause. For example, discomfort discussing death may cause cliniciansto give mixed messages about a patient's prognosis or to use euphemisms for dying and death ormay even cause clinicians to avoid speaking with a patient or their significant others. Recognizingthis discomfort and being willing to confront it is the first step in overcoming these barriers toeffective communication about dying and death with patients and their significant others.Resources exist to help clinicians address these issues. 60, 61 CONCLUSION Discussing palliative care, dying, and death with patients and their significant others is an extremely important part of providing good quality care for patients with a chronic, life-threatening disease such as HIV infection or AIDS. While there is little empiric research toguide clinicians in determining the right time or the most effective way to have theseconversations, there is a developing experience and an increasing emphasis on making this animportant part of the care we provide and an important part of training for students. Much likeother clinical skills, providing sensitive and effective communication about palliative care requirestraining and practice as well as planning and preparation. While different clinicians may havevarying approaches and should change their approaches to match the needs of patients andtheir families, this chapter reviews some of the fundamental components of discussing palliative care and end-of-life care that should be part of the care of most patients with potentially life- threatening illnesses.

INTRODUCTION The focus of this chapter is planning for and facilitating the transition from curative to pallia- tive care, with emphasis on the initiation of either home-based support services or institutionalcare. The interdisciplinary team approach is described. Strategies for promoting patient, family,and staff education and support will be identified and institutional issues that facilitate or hinderprovision of effective palliative care are explored.The primary goals of palliative care are to maximize the patient's sense of control, strengthenrelationships with loved ones and limit care burdens. 1,2,3 The importance of access to appropri- ate services in the successful delivery of palliative care to the chronically or terminally ill personwith HIV cannot be overestimated. Knowledge of community resources such as government as-sistance programs, housing, personal finance, disability benefits, transportation, procurementof durable medical equipment, case management, food and shelter and emergency assistance isessential for helping the patient and family deal with the social sequelae of illness, disability,and death.HIV is not just another terminal illness. If the same \"too young\" person presented with an equallylife-threatening diagnosis of leukemia, health care teams would probably call family and friendsfor support. In contrast, people with HIV often choose to keep their diagnosis a secret. 4 As long as fear and discrimination exist, agencies may be reluctant to accept people living with HIV/AIDS. Stigma associated with HIV and, hence, disclosure of HIV status continue to be significantproblems complicating care. THE INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM Palliative care, by definition, is provided by an interdisciplinary team that, in addition to the physician, nurse (including nurse practitioners and nurses), social worker, nutritionist, chap-lain, and other professionals, includes the patient, family, caregivers and other individuals im-portant to the patient. The interdisciplinary team is a group of individuals working togetherwith a common purpose for the greater good of the patient with advanced disease and his or herfamily. 5 The goal of the interdisciplinary team is to provide the patient and family with a frame- work of emotional, physical, spiritual, and social support during the time of advanced disease.6 In the United States, the nurse, social worker or case manager often has the primary responsi-bility for the practical issues discussed in this chapter. It is important, however, that all indi-viduals involved in the care of a person with advanced HIV disease be aware of these issues andbe prepared to take the necessary steps to address patient and family needs related to facilitat-ing the transition to palliative care.While each member of the team has particular expertise, all share responsibility for advocacy,enabling, support, truthfulness, and mediation such that crises are prevented, priorities of theHarlee S Kutzen, MN, ACRNFacilitating the 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM picas U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 448A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition patient and family remain paramount, and overall suffering is minimized. Team members share information and work interdependently to develop goals with the patient and family. Informa- tion is shared among team members on a regular, organized basis. In 1999, Cummings described the interdisciplinary team as a group of individuals working to- gether with a common purpose for the greater good of the patient with advanced disease andfamily. Interdisciplinary team members should include the combined efforts of competent, skilledpractitioners who offer confidential, nondiscriminatory, nonjudgmental and culturally sensitivecare. Each individual has particular expertise and training and is responsible for making deci-sions and contributions within the area of their experience and knowledge. The following sections describe the various roles and functions of HIV palliative care interdisci- plinary team members. Patient and Family Caregivers The primary member of the interdisciplinary team is the person living with HIV , along with his or her family. Patients and their caregivers need to be active partners in developing and implementing the plan of care in order for the other members of the palliative care team tounderstand the complex care of families affected by HIV, their advanced care needs, patient andfamily caregiver concerns regarding approaching death, and HIV-specific bereavement needs. 8 Far too often, health care teams see themselves as the \"providers\" and the patient and family assimply the \"recipients\" of their care. Advanced HIV disease care planning cannot be conceptu-alized in this manner: patients, family members and the interdisciplinary team members mustaddress care planning and support on a mutual, interactive and fluid basis. Medical Providers Medical providers include physicians, residents, interns, fellows, nurse practitioners, and physician's assistants. Responsibilities of these team members include the following: \u007f Diagnosis \u007f Prognosis\u007f Symptom prevention\u007f Design of treatment plan\u007f Education and communication with staff, patient, and family regarding status and response to treatment. Medical providers' decisions should be sensitive to cues of advancing condition related and unrelated to lab test values and diagnostic procedures. Consulting physicians are responsible to primary medical providers, and should work as part of the team, not as separate specialists. Specialists may include psychiatrists, ophthalmologists, neurologists, dermatologists,oncologists, gynecologists, orthopedists, or providers of any other specialty service. Nurses Nurses include staff nurses, nurse practitioners, and clinical specialists in HIV, adult health, case management, palliative care, mental health, and home and community health. Nursingresponsibilities include assessment of patients' physical and mental capacity iden- Chpt 22 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 448U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 449A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition XXIItification of ongoing care needs, and ongoing education of patients and families. Hospital nurses teach the patient and family throughout the hospital stay and confirm patient and family knowl- edge prior to discharge in order to enhance comfort, safety, and competence in care at home. Nurses often have the most frequent contact with the patient and family in the inpatient setting, outpatient clinic or at home. It is the nurse's responsibility to assist the patient in coping withthe effects of advancing HIV disease. This includes attention to some of the most personal andintimate aspects of physical care: pain and symptom assessment and management, personalcare such as bathing, control of odor, care of pressure areas, mouth care, bowel and bladdercare, as well as patient and family education on anticipated care needs. Nurses also assess thepatient's and family's level of knowledge of disease, symptom management, comfort care, andability to differentiate emergencies from normally anticipated events, and develop a plan forchanges in patient status and emergencies. As patient advocates, nurses help ensure, in collaboration with social workers, that the wishes of the patient are met, enabling the dying person and the family to remain involved in keydecisions. Clinical Liaison Nurses Clinical liaison nurses promote up-to-date communication between providers in the outpa- tient setting and those in the inpatient unit, particularly for patients who are homebound andrequire home-based care services. Generally, the nurse's role is to supervise and monitor con-current censuses of active patients receiving home care and hospice care services. Specificresponsibilities may include the following: \u007f Monitoring for timely response from home care and hospice agencies for patient care coordination \u007f Tracking home care and hospice agency paperwork and medical orders to make sure the medical provider has access to the most current orders \u007f Making sure the agency has appropriate medical signatures A clinical liaison nurse's activities also may include daily contact with home-based care supervi- sors and field staff regarding changes in patient status, streamlining of medication refills, veri-fication of minor orders, and facilitation of urgent appointments. Because the care needs canchange quickly, the liaison nurse provides troubleshooting for equipment approvals, special ser-vice approvals with HIV/AIDS programs, and contact of care providers. Updating interdiscipli-nary team members on the complex issues at home for each patient is an important role ofclinical liaison nurses in support of the continuum of palliative care. Social Workers The goal of social work in palliative care is to help the patient and family deal with the personal and social problems of illness, disability, and impending death, and to provide survivor skill-building and support. Social workers assess many important areas of need for both patient andfamily, and help the family develop realistic plans for the present as well as the future. Thestrengths and challenges of each family unit are assessed and referrals made to availableresources.

Ifthere are no HIV-specific resources in the community, the social worker should locate people ororganizations that may be willing to provide assistance for the patient and family. Social workers also assess cultural and sociocultural factors unique to the patient and family, such as use of folk medicine or alternative healing practices in the home, and the family's abilityand desire to care for the patient in a specific setting. The family culture may be unable toaccept a death at home and therefore not even the best hospice and personal care attendant support in the home will foster a peaceful death at home. In these circumstances, death in the emergency room or during a return admission to the hospital may be exactly what the familyconsiders the \"best death possible.\" Social workers can be particularly helpful when there is dysfunction within the family. Issues of substance and alcohol abuse are increasingly common within HIV care. Social workers can as-sist with screening for use and abuse, assessment of desire and need for rehabilitation services,and gaining access to such services. One of the most important roles of social workers is advocacy on behalf of the patient and family. Social workers promote continuity of care transitions between hospital and home by arrangingresidential placement, making referrals to experienced home care and hospice agencies, andarranging for durable medical equipment and supplies. Often social workers play a key role innaming the actual needs of the patient and family. Nutritionist Nutritionists and dieticians work with patients in all stages of HIV disease, but are most needed as a patient's condition begins to deteriorate. Nutritional intake and hydration are veryemotional issues for family members and interdisciplinary teams. Both weight loss and malnu-trition increase as HIV disease progresses. Changes in body composition, body image percep-tion, digestion, tolerance of food, and side effects from therapies contribute to a reduced qualityof life for persons living with advanced HIV disease. Even when patients have adequate food,nutritional knowledge, resources, and support, they may be unable to maintain weight. Dieti-cians can assist with early detection of factors related to impaired nutritional status that accel-erate physical decline. Integration of anabolic therapies, nutritional supplements, appetite stimu- lants, and nutritional counseling are important for comprehensive HIV palliative care. In advanced stages of HIV disease, reduced intake may not be a primary concern for the patient. Identification of the point when the nutritional interventions are failing is pivotal for the pa-tient, family, and interdisciplinary team members. Nutritional goals are different for the chroni-cally ill and terminally ill patient. Registered dieticians can discuss body composition testing asrelated to the prediction of the end-of-life. They are trained to understand and address uniquesocial factors, monitor the effects of HIV on body composition and the effects of medications onmetabolism, and address the role of changes in body shape in end-of-life discussions with pa-tients and families. Complex nutritional concerns are mediated by active substance use, pov-erty, dementia, homelessness, adolescent motherhood, and complex medication regimens. Nu-tritionists can be valuable in discussions of the pros and cons of end-of-life nutrition and hydra- tion options.

They assist medical providers with dose adjust-ments to reduce side effects and increase the efficacy of medications, bring new information tothe team, educate patients and families about medication plans, and remain available to assist,evaluate and consult complex care situations. Chaplains Chaplains are available to assist the patient and his or her family in processing the meaning of illness in their lives as well as their fears, desires, and unfinished tasks. Responsibilities ofchaplains include being a nonjudgmental resource for referrals for additional community sup- port as desired by patient and family. Sympathetic chaplains are skilled listeners and able to meet patients and families without judgment. They are key team members in addressing thecomplex fears, stigma, chronic pain, symptoms and losses related to HIV. Chaplains provide aspecial presence with a focus and a stimulus for airing questions of meaning that are invariablypresent for patients and families with advanced disease. Issues of guilt for past events, feelingsof meaninglessness, and the need to be listened to are important concerns for patient and fam-ily. Ideally chaplains offer a spiritual presence, not religious. Because so many of the otherdisciplines of the palliative care interdisciplinary team have many concrete as well as supporttasks, chaplains are able to visit without any task agenda and follow the lead of the patient andfamily on a deep and existential level. Facilitating life review, dealing with regrets, giving thanksfor what has brought love and meaning, naming life closure tasks, and preparing for what liesahead are important responsibilities of this role. Physical Therapists Physical therapists provide physical assessment, education for patients and caregivers, and resources to enable patients to transfer safely, stabilize gait, and be mobile. They also assess theneed for durable medical equipment. As patients are living longer with HIV, more patients areliving with neuromuscular deficits for longer periods of time. Home safety and independenceare ongoing goals for the patient and family. In the palliative care setting, a revised physicaltherapy goal may be to maximize patients' changing and often diminishing physical resourcesrather than to improve function. Community Case Manager The community case manager collects information about physical and psychosocial function- ing and patients' social environments, develops care plans based on home assessment informa-tion and availability of resources, and links patients and families to community services, finan-cial assistance, and medical and social services. In addition, a community case manager moni-tors patients on an ongoing basis, holds case conferences with other members of the outpatientteam to evaluate the appropriateness of linked services for patient and family needs, and advo-cates to reduce barriers to services or generate needed services for individual families. 9 Chpt 22 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 45126 picas U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 452A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition THE TRANSITION OF FOCUS FROM CURATIVE TO PALLIATIVE CARE Attention to alleviation of suffering, be it physical, emotional, or spiritual, is consistent with the highest aspirations of all health care professions. The integration, therefore, of palliativecare with its broad clinical, social, and spiritual support into the care of someone living withHIV/AIDS can promote quality of life and realistic life planning at any time in the course of theillness. There is, however, often a time in the course of care when a formal transition fromcurative to palliative care is made. In the U.S., because of the peculiarities of financing pallia-tive care services, most often this involves a transition from traditional medical care to hospicecare. Traditionally, palliative care was 'saved' for hospice care. With the advent of highly activeantiretroviral therapy (HAART), new theories of resistance, and re-sensitizing clinical trials, allcategories of patients can be considered equally eligible for palliative care as well as more dis-ease-specific care. Integrating palliative care, clinical, social, and spiritual support servicespromotes quality of life and realistic life planning. Discussions with patients and families about palliative and hospice care can be difficult for even the most experienced providers. Provider communication issues are discussed in depth in Chap-ter 21. Some providers find it useful to keep in mind a sequence of facilitating questions thatlead into a discussion of palliative care, first blending discussion of disease specific therapieswith palliative care, moving toward exclusive focus on palliative care, and eventually introduc-ing hospice care (see Table 22-1). It is also helpful to give patients and families a description ofhospice that explains how the care addresses their stated wishes and concerns before the term\"hospice\" is used, to reduce risk of rejection (see Table 22-2). Planning for the transition into palliative care must begin with an understanding of the patient and family's desires, expectations, and understanding of the patient's illness. In our society, manybelieve that hospice care means giving up all medications and getting ready to die. Therefore, it isoften a mistake to jump directly into a discussion of hospice per se because patients and families unfamiliar with contemporary hospice approaches may attach negative connotations to the term.If the health care provider begins a conversation about hospice care or palliative care without firstlearning the patient's perception of his or her status, there is a great chance of the patient refusing such care. It is important that providers assess immediate needs and priorities as stated by the patient and family rather than assume that a problem that is obvious to the providers is of immedi-ate concern to the recipients of care. 10 The most important goal of intervention at this point is to facilitate discussion so that the patient and family's responses are as honest and realistic as pos-sible. (See Chapter 21: Patient-Clinician Communication.) Advanced End-of-Life Planning Discussions Each member of the interdisciplinary team must be able to initiate and discuss palliative care, end-of-life care, and hospice services. Understanding the patient and family's perspective on their current and future needs and desires will help guide this planning and referral process.The following questions provide a guide for initiating a discussion about end-of-life-related ex-periences, desires and planning. Begin by sitting close to the patient (preferably at eye level). Explain that you know he or she has been living with HIV for some time and that you would like to learn more about how he or sheis doing. Explain that understanding more about his or her needs will help you advocate for the Chpt 22 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 452U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 453A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition XXIImost appropriate services. Focus on the patient's perspective on his or her condition, and make sure that you allow the patient to answer the questions rather than giving directive information as you begin this assessment conversation. The following questions are also listed in Table 22-1. Question 1 What has your medical team told you about your condition? What does this informa- tion mean to you? This question is essential to assessing the accuracy of the patient and family's understanding of the current medical status and prognostic factors. Often a patient may state that he or she isgetting worse, or not getting better, but that the medical team is telling him or her that he or sheis going to get stronger. If the patient responds with little emotion or simply restates the medicalteam's words, ask, What is your body telling you about how you are doing? This question prompts a more introspective response that is always revealing of inner concerns and feelings. Question 2 Tell me about your good days...What are you able to do on those days? The response to this question is equally revealing. The responses of the patient and family will let you know what gives them pleasure. By hearing about unique points of enjoyment andmeaning, the team can learn whether and what pleasure activities are available to the patientand family. It is also a way for them to face the realities of how long it has been since they havehad several of \"those\" good days in a week. Such information helps provide a perspective on thespeed of loss of strength and other changes. Question 3 When is the last time you had a day like that in the past two months? This assesses the degree of changes in physical strength, independence, and endurance. The most recent holiday is often a period of time that stands out memorably for families. They canrecall where they were, what they wore and ate, and how they felt at the end of their activities.Because shortened prognosis is often connected to increasing weakness, assisting the patient and family to answer this question aloud helps them state in their own words how and in what ways things may be different now. This begins the patient and family's personal process of self-disclosure about important changes in current energy and needs in the present tense, whichenhances realistic planning. Question 4 Have you had any bad days lately? What makes them bad? Health care providers so often are concerned with a patient's viral load, adherence to medi- cations, and weight stability that we forget to ask the patient what defines his or her hard times.Listening carefully to the patient's response, we learn about not only the patient and family'spriority concerns but under-managed symptoms impairing the patient's quality of life that wemay have been unaware of before. Patient and family responses also help to identify areas inwhich the family may need outside assistance, such as on-call nursing support, child care andrespite assistance. Chpt 22 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 45326 picas U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 454A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition Question 5 What kind of assistance do you need on days when you do not feel well? In general most individuals and families do not like to depend on other people for care and assistance. They often are concerned about being a burden, inconveniencing others, and fearingthey will use up their \"personal favors\" too soon. Give the patient and family permission tofantasize about what kinds of things may be helpful. Question 6 If your condition worsens, do you wish to go back to the hospital? Traditionally, we tell patients, \"If you get worse, go to the Emergency Room.\" This is fine if there is an acute infection or event that will respond well to emergency attention. But the per-son with advanced HIV who has been hospitalized a number of times may already have consid-ered not wanting to come back to the hospital. The patient's response to this question also helpsto guide home-based care options such as referring the patient to home care or hospice. Thepatient who is sure he or she wants to return to the hospital is a better candidate for home care where the on-call service is designed for emergency intervention. Question 7 What are your most meaningful goals at this time in your life? Is there anything we can do to help you achieve them? Adults and children all have meaningful life goals. Some people are very open to discussing their goals, others have barely whispered them to their closest confidant if at all. By gaining an understanding of the patient's goals, team members learn how to plan treatments and caresupports. For example, a woman who needs to complete guardianship arrangements for herchildren may benefit from the support of blood transfusions for temporary strength, whereas aperson who has settled his or her affairs might not consider it a benefit. Question 8 In the event of your death, is there anyone or anything that you are worried about? When people think of the possibility of their own deaths, sometimes it is easier for them to think of the needs of others rather than themselves. This pertains to their children and otherloved ones as well as cherished pets, plants, or any other living things that would suffer during ahospitalization, long-term placement or death. A hospital stay can provide a trial run for futurecustody or referral information. Sometimes, discussing these concerns provides a way for pa-tients to express their anticipatory grief for meaningful aspects of their lives and their need toknow that these will be cared for. Discussing such worries can facilitate people's acceptance ofhospice services so that their loved ones can benefit from the social work services and bereave-ment follow-up. Question 9 Have you ever heard of a medical power of attorney or a health care proxy? Assignment of a health care proxy to make medical decisions on their behalf is an important safeguard for patients to know that their end-of-life wishes will be honored. Patients shouldselect a person who knows and understands their personal desires for quality of life decisions that will affect the direction of their care. Providers should inform both the patient and his or Chpt 22 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 454U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 455A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition XXIIher health care proxy of the patient's condition and options for care so they can make decisions from the most informed perspective possible. Question 10 Do you have a living will? Who in your family is aware of it and has a copy? A living will demonstrates a clear and deliberate desire not to have life prolonged beyond its natural limits, and most frequently denotes withholding invasive life-sustaining interventions. Atrue copy of this document should be placed in the patient's chart in the hospital, group residen- tial facility, extended care, and home-based care settings. Patients should be informed whether their state honors this document as a legal determinant of care planning or merely as a guidethat can be overruled by their primary provider. Question 11 Are you having any chronic pain or distressing symptoms? At an advanced stage of any disease, chronic symptoms not only serve as a reminder of ad- vancing illness and provide a negative distraction from enjoying the limited length of life avail-able, but also become internalized as an intense task of spiritual coping. It becomes impossiblefor a person to relish quality time with loved ones or complete important tasks if he or she isconstantly struggling with nausea, pain, diarrhea, itching, or other uncontrolled symptoms. Thepatient whose symptoms have been very difficult to control may benefit from the palliative symp-tom management of the hospice team, and such information can be stated in the explanation ofhospice care. Question 12 What can we do to make your life more comfortable / manageable? Listening to the patient and family's responses, repeating back their words, and letting them know that you have heard them provide powerful validation for patients and families when clear,reasonable requests have been stated. It is most important to respond to their requests as quicklyas possible. A response may be as simple as letting the patient go home before the weekend to bewith family and completing future tests on an outpatient basis. Or, it may be as complex asarranging for minor age visitors to visit their loved one in a room with contact isolation. Table 22-1: Initiating Advanced Disease Planning Discussions 1.

Have you ever heard of a medical power of attorney or a health care proxy? 10. Do you have a living will? Who in your family is aware of it and has a copy? 11. Are you having chronic pain or other distressing symptoms? 12. What can we do to make your life more comfortable/manageable? Only after these questions have been asked and answered is it time to explain hospice and other options for advanced disease care. From the content of this prompted conversation, care plan-ners should have learned about the patient and family's concerns about the burden of care andapproaching death, the presence of distressing symptoms, and after-hour, on-call needs. By lis-tening to the patient and family recall the frequency of good days versus bad, the pace of pro-gression to death can also be estimated. Any ambivalence about returning to the hospital whenthe patient's condition worsens should also have been clarified. Finally, the patient and family's own words, their personal examples of concerns, and their identification of life priorities will guide the wording to be used in explaining palliative care, hospice, home care and long-termcare planning. Table 22-2: Sample Explanation of Hospice Knowing that you wish to stay home and not return to the hospital, we would like to refer you and your family to a program of care designed specifically for patientsand families in your condition, with your exact same desires. This program is designed especially for people who are living with advanced illness, wish to stay home, and may need after-hour, on-call assistance to stay comfortable. Nurses are available 24 hours a day for support and guidance. They are special- ists, knowing how to help individuals and families be as comfortable and as strongas possible at home. This service offers a nurse who is an expert in pain and symp-tom management, and knows how to prevent symptoms from getting out of control.The nurse will help educate you and your family on what to expect with time.Sometimes learning what is natural and expected can be very calming. They also have a social worker who specializes in care of people who have been living with HIV for a long time. They provide support and referrals to community resources as you need and desire. Home health aides are also trained to work with people withweakness and advanced disease. They can assist with bathing, changing of bed lin-ens and other personal care several times a week if you desire. All of the care servicesare designed to support your comfort and confidence at home. Additional servicesinclude spiritual support, volunteer help, and bereavement support. This special program is called hospice. We believe this program is just right for your needs at this time. If your needs change, and you no longer need this specialsupport, you may be discharged. If you receive services, and you decide this is notthe type of care you want, you may be discharged at any time. Sometimes, patients and families refuse hospice care at the time it is offered. This is often frustrating for the referrers because they may want the patient to benefit from the clinicalTable 22-1: Initiating Advanced Disease Planning Discussions (continued) Chpt 22 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 456U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 457A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition XXIIexpertise, on-call availability, support services and anticipatory grief work prior to active phases of dying. In these cases we must evaluate the degree to which we have given the patient and family the freedom to choose between home care and hospice with their full understanding of the differences. Because of the terminal nature of hospice care, young people are often comforted by knowing that if hospice care does not feel right for them, they can go back to standard care. We mustremind patients and family that HIV is an unpredictable disease, and that at this time we believehospice care is best to meet their needs, but if in the future they get stronger, or they no longerneed or wish the hospice's services, they may be discharged. Giving patients and caregivers thepermission to think of hospice as a specialized care for their current condition and advanced care needs provides great relief since they may have only known hospice as a \"last stop before you die,\" and with HIV that is not always true. A gentle personalized explanation of hospice as acare option can often improve acceptance of such services. Care providers must recognize thatacceptance of hospice is not the absolute goal of care planning. Assuring patients and familiesof viable care options that match their values, resources, and desires remain our main priority. HOSPITAL DISCHARGE PLANNING The decision to formally engage home care and hospice care services often occurs during the course of a hospitalization. Although eligibility for palliative care can be determined across any stage in the spectrum of HIV disease, HIV-related inpatient hospital admissions are frequentlyone of the clinical markers of advancing disease. Prior to each hospital stay, the patient hasdeveloped chronic disabling symptoms or new onset symptoms that indicate advancing HIVdisease. Increasing fatigue, changing social support, and complex home-based care needs re-quire reassessment during each hospital stay. Comprehensive discharge planning is an essentialtask for promoting the continuum of care. Integration of HIV palliative care services need not bepostponed until patients are in the most terminal phase of life. Elements of comprehensive discharge planning from the hospital setting require an array of assessment, education, support, and community referrals. Some of these care elements includeunderstanding the patient and family's adjustment to illness; understanding the unpredictablenature of HIV; sensitivity for the patient witnessing other patients' declining status; sick and co-infected partners; sudden acute, life threatening illnesses; fear of the unknown; dependence onothers; and uncontrolled pain or other symptoms. Interdisciplinary participation in the educa-tion of patients and caregivers on important aspects of the patient's condition, disease trajec-tory, prognosis and direct care are predictors of improved patient and family satisfaction. 11 Patients' resources may have drastically changed since their most recent hospital admission.The patient may no longer be able to care for himself and live independently. He or she may haveexperienced a loss of housing, income, insurance benefits, and/or family support. Caregiversawaiting the patient's discharge may need increased assistance at home for extensive care. Thisis why it is important to make a comprehensive assessment of new needs and any adjustments tothe plan of care prior to discharge. The revised discharge plan must be communicated to outpa-tient primary care providers and case managers so that they can reassess patient and caregiverneeds once the patient is home. Families need to understand the seriousness of advancing disease and the implications of lim- ited life span for their loved one. One of the major discharge planning problems for families isthat it is not always clear when someone is dying. Sometimes, even if a loved one has been in Chpt 22 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 45726 picas U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 458A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition serious and steady decline with wasting, disorientation and a cascade of other symptoms and infections, it can be hard for the closest caregivers to see or admit what is going on.12 It can make a tremendous difference for physicians, nurses, therapists, social workers, and/or friends and loved ones to acknowledge the approach of death gently, but clearly. For a smooth transition to home-based care services, discharge planning should begin as early as possible. Evenings and holidays are inappropriate times to discharge a person to home-basedcare unless thorough arrangements have been made regarding access to ordered medications,equipment, supplies and agency personnel. Referrals to home nursing and palliative care ser-vices should be made with much advance notice because it may require several days to secureall services for inpatient teaching and home equipment. ASSESSMENT FOR HOME CARE One of the most important practical questions facing the patient and team (whether the team is inpatient staff, outpatient staff, or both) is \"Can this patient and family live safely athome?\" An assessment of the physical and emotional condition of the patient is necessary tounderstand what needs must be met. This is most often the responsibility of the nurse and/orphysician. However, a comprehensive assessment for home care must take an interdisciplinaryapproach in addressing several important issues (see Table 22-3): \u007f The patient's mental capacity to make decisions \u007f The patient's physical capacity to carry out activities of daily living and participate in care \u007f The caregiver capacity to provide support in the home Table 22-3: Assessment of the Home Environment 1. Who in the home can assume primary responsibility as caregiver? 2. What is the patient's level of ability in activities of daily living? 3. Are family members or caregiver able to read and understand medication labels? 4. What is the family and patient's understanding of, and adjustment to, the illness? 5. What is the potential impact of disclosure by the patient of HIV status to family members and other people? 6. Are there physical and mental health issues among other family members and caregivers? (i.e., Is this patient's partner or spouse also HIV-infected, addicted todrugs or alcohol, or physically or psychologically unable to meet the demands thatwill be placed upon him/her?) 7. Are medications, especially pain medications, safe from theft or abuse by others in the home? 8. Do the family and caregiver have the capacity to maintain a stable home environment? 9. Will the patient be able to access outpatient care from home? Will the patient and family be able to obtain medications and supplies at home?

If the patient is bedridden, is someone available to answer the door, or can a key be provided to the home care providers? 11. How safe is the home for patient, caregiver, and visiting health personnel? 12. Is durable medical equipment such as hospital bed, commode chair, wheelchair, or oxygen needed in the home, and should they be in place prior to discharge? 13. Is the home setting appropriate for the patient's stage of illness? (See also Table 22-5.) 14. What are the financial resources of the patient and family, and have those resources changed dramatically since prior hospitalizations? 15. Have legal issues such as guardianship, living wills, health care proxies been addressed and are they current? (See Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues.) 16. What care options are there for children during illness and after death of the parent? Having someone in the role of primary care provider in the home is necessary for patient safety and assistance as well as to coordinate care with the home care or hospice agency, and assessand deal with changing aspects of patient care. Ideally, the primary care provider must be wellenough physically and mentally to provide personal care, food preparation, safety supervision, errand running, and household management, as well as be the primary contact for health care providers. Additional considerations arise when planning for home care for infants or children who require palliative care; see Table 22-4. Table 22-4: Considerations in Planning Home Care for a Child 1. Parents may lose social support from other parents of hospitalized children when their child is discharged. 2. Parents may experience significant guilt for transmission of the virus to their child. 3. When parents are infected themselves, questions of guardianship, custody, and financial planning are more difficult. 4. Parenting skills may need to be refined. Often, for example, parents experiencing anticipatory grief need help in learning how to discipline their children. 5 There is reduced cost of care at home. 6 Pain is the most common symptom across the spectrum of pediatric HIV disease. 7 There are forms of suffering other than pain in the dying child such as other uncontrolled physical symptoms, guilt for making loved ones sad when they get sicker, and lack of ability to mirror the activities of healthy peers. 8 Care of the dying young is often complex and requires an interdisciplinary approach to care.6Table 22-3: Assessment of the Home Chpt 22 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 45926 picas U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 460A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition Unanticipated barriers to home care, such as inadequate or unstable housing, substance abuse or lack of insurance, may require that discharge from the hospital be postponed. Somehome situations are inappropriate for palliative care supported by home care or hospice ser- vices (see Table 22-5). Table 22-5: Persons for Whom Home Care May Be Inappropriate 1. Persons with diarrhea who are housed in single-room occupancy hotels lacking a private bathroom or running water in the room. 2. Persons with significant weight loss living in places lacking cooking and food storage facilities. 3. Persons requiring intravenous therapy who have neither a telephone nor refrigeration. 4. Persons who are non-ambulatory patients but live in buildings with stairs or broken elevators. 5. Persons living in high crime buildings or in homes where overt drug use and trafficking takes place in the presence of home care staff.13 6. Persons living in housing that is unstable, transient, or a \"double up\" situation. 7. Persons with previously stable housing that is jeopardized by hospitalization and disclosure of HIV status. 8. Persons living in homes in which confused or intoxicated individuals have access to weapons. If family members have unrealistic expectations of the course of the illness, they may expect that the patient should not be discharged from the hospital until their health is improved. Con-versely, the patient, family members and caregivers may be reluctant to have the patient returnhome from the hospital at all. Often this is due to specific fears that can be addressed in thetransition planning process (see Table 22-6). Some of these fears are real. Others can be amelio-rated with education and support. Table 22-6: Common Caregiver Fears 1. That the health of the family or caregiver will suffer. 2. That the patient will be readmitted to the hospital and thereby create a negative perception of the family's ability to provide care. 3. That a crisis will occur at home when no trained professional is on site. 4. That incontinence, sickness, or confusion will cause embarrassment. 5. That the patient will be left out of discussions/decisions regarding care. 6. That the loved one will die at home. 7. That the illness will have negative impact on the family, especially children, yet the patient's desire to see them may be particularly strong at this time.14 8. That a diagnosis of HIV/AIDS will be disclosed to others.

INSTITUTIONAL CARE Once palliative modes of care are accepted, patients and families need to consider the type of care that matches their needs, as well as begin development of a plan for the place of care andthe anticipated location of the patient's death. Most Americans prefer to die at home. 15 An indi- vidual can be surrounded by familiar and cherished family, pets, and belongings if care is pro-vided in the home. However, there are times when a patient's need for safety and comfort exceedthe capacity of his or her home. The patient may live alone and not have a caregiver; caregiversmay be overwhelmed; some people may not have a home to go to; and, some home environmentsmay be difficult or impossible for providers to access. The best outcomes in home-based care are attained when care is provided with the support of others. Even under the best of circumstances, a caregiver needs a solid foundation of support tocall on when needed. Although some families manage to mobilize last-minute support networks,the end-of-life is not a good time to make new personal connections or start support groups. 12 In these instances, professional staff should plan for and assume an even more important role. In North America, one of the primary goals of palliative care is to support people to die in the comfort of their own homes, and palliative care practitioners hold death in the home as the\"gold standard.\" 16 However, there are many issues to consider in discharge planning. We must consider the physical dependent care needs, and whether or not the patient and caregivers desire a home death. The physical and emotional devastation of advanced HIV illness makesextraordinary demands upon families and our health care system in relation to the type andlevel of service required to support end-of-life care at home. 17 Home Care Home care is primarily rehabilitation focused. Skilled nurses provide intermittent, time-lim- ited visits in the home, to monitor, instruct in care, and perform specific nursing interventions under the direction of the primary physician (activities might include changing dressings, teachingand administering intravenous treatments, monitoring medication adherence, and obtainingblood and specimens for laboratory analysis). Home health aides are available for assistancewith bathing and personal care (generally two-hour intervals several times a week). Physicaltherapists are is available for gait training, instructing strengthening exercises, and safe trans-fer instruction to patient and caregiver. Social workers may be available for limited visits forassessment and referral for community services, benefits, financial assistance and/or transfer ofpatient to extended care or residential assisted living. It is important that families, patients, and providers have some criteria for selecting a home hospice agency. One of the greatest predictors of successful care is experience. Ideally, families need to know that the chosen agency can address anticipated, predictable symptoms of HIVdisease, and will have knowledgeable responses to the unpredictable events. 6 At a minimum, caregivers should know the number of years an agency has been in operation, the status of theagency's license, the agency's membership in the state's home care or hospice organization, andaccreditations held by Chpt 22 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 46126 picas U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 462A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition Hospice Care and Services Hospice care is designed for patients living with advanced disease conditions and their fami- lies. Education, symptom management, on-call support, care focused on the end-of-life, andbereavement are the cornerstones of hospice care. Symptom management includes ongoingassessments, intervention and follow-up, education, and promoting optimal comfort. Hospice teamwork assists the patient and family to design a personalized plan for disease pro- gression. This plan will address preventing anticipated symptoms, clarifying desires for place ofdeath, and related concerns. The focus on symptom control, education and support is to makethe patient and his or her significant others as self-reliant and comfortable as possible at homeas they plan for approaching death. Care includes skilled nursing (provided by RNs), personalcare (by home health aides), social work services, volunteer support, pastoral care and bereave-ment support for one year after the patient expires. Comprehensive support is key to hospice design. Assessment of and support for physical, emotional, social, financial, and spiritual as- pects of the patient and family's lives are the priority concerns and focus of care delivery. Traditionally, only clients who were no longer interested in measures to prolong their lives were eligible for this program. The unique challenges in predicting prognosis and symptom manage-ment with advancing HIV disease have pressured some changes in the definitions of HIV hospicecare. Specifically, the severity, complexity, and unpredictable trajectory of the disease have blurredthe distinction between what was previously understood as curative care and what was consid-ered supportive palliative care. 18,19,20 At one time, patients were asked to give up all treatment medications, IVs, hospitalizations, diagnostic tests, and hopes for recovery. Today with patients responding unexpectedly to starting and withdrawing of aggressive antiretroviral therapies, pro-longed disease soliloquies, changing prognoses, and new hopes, hospice referrals are changingto include more blended care. Medicare Skilled Nursing Benefit versus Hospice Medicare Benefit For patients who have Medicare or Medicaid in States with the Medicaid Hospice Benefit, choosing hospice can be very complicated. (See Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues for more informa- tion about these sources of care financing.) Terminally ill Medicare or Medicaid recipients canchoose the Skilled Nursing benefit or the Hospice Medicare Benefit. By electing the HospiceMedicare Benefit, the patient designates the hospice to assume the financial responsibility forall care related to the terminal illness. This obligation provides all the core services of hospicecare as well as durable medical equipment, palliative medications, respite care and 24-hournursing care if needed. There continues to be ongoing debate regarding the hospice agency's obligation to continue expensive viral suppressive therapies. Although many of these therapies may provide symptom relief, their cost would exhaust more than the per diem rate of hospice reimbursement. Ideally, every hospice could benefit from dual licensure as a home care and a hospice agency. An agency licensed for both home care and hospice has more flexibility in care delivery strategiesfor patients who are continuing to blend palliative care and support with final treatment strategies.This allows the hospice to bill as home care skilled intermittent visits by the hospice nurse andhome health aides, as well as other therapies as ordered. Social services can be billed at the maximumnumber of visits allowed. Additional visits will not be billable, unless allowable through other sources of funding such as end-of-life care within Ryan White CARE Act Titles I or II.

The patient has failed all available antiretroviral therapies, or can no longer tolerate them, or is continuing treatments despite high viral level because they help the patient feel lesssymptomatic. 2. The patient is on expanded-access medications, has chronic distressing symptoms, or is experiencing end-of-life distress (patient or family), impaired quality of life secondary to advanced HIV, and/or a life-limiting AIDS-related condition such as CNS lymphomas, re- current/resistant opportunistic infections, co-infections with other life-threatening condi-tions such as Hepatitis C, and/or end-stage organ failure. 3. The patient has become tired of years of complex medication and treatment regimens and failing strategies, and wants a simpler and higher quality of life. 4. The patient is living with advanced disease and the after-hour call needs exceed those that can be met in the outpatient setting. This may be for symptom management or support.The patient who has come repeatedly to the emergency room may also benefit from thehome assessment, education, and support that the hospice offers to reduce use of emer-gency services to address anticipated changes. Alternative Placements When patients do not have a home to return to, or the necessary support is not available, transfer to a residential facility can be a welcome option. Sometimes the home environment isnot a safe place for the patient to live alone. There are several alternatives to home discharge.Depending on the available resources in each healthcare provider's region, assisted and inde-pendent living residential facilities may be available. Skilled nursing homes and extended carefacilities may also be available depending on the patient's location, physical care needs andbenefit coverage. Residential Care Residential housing designed for people with HIV is often a welcome alternative to institutional-ized care facilities. A variety of housing models have developed over the years for people withHIV. Although there are several common types of residential models, care should be taken toevaluate support resources available to the patient in each type of home prior to any referral.Scattered-site apartment programs for individuals and HIV-infected families are operated inmany locations throughout the U.S. These residences are best suited for those patients who arestill able to maintain a high level of independent functioning. 21 Long-term Care The most common reasons patients are admitted to long-term care facilities are completionof medical therapy; prevention of unnecessary hospitalizations when home care is notavailable; continuous care needs including dementia-related cognitive and/or functional dis-ability; terminal care when home settings are not available; 22 and, institutional care reimburse- ment bias since long-term care is less expensive than acute inpatient care. Chpt 22 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 46326 picas U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 464A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition Skilled Nursing Care Sometimes a patient with advancing HIV wishes comfort care only, but is referred to a skilled nursing facility rather than a long-term care facility because of the reimbursement incentivesrelated to restorative care versus long-term care. Medicare skilled nursing facilities cover thecosts of skilled nursing and therapies, and many facilities attempt to maximize the number ofresident days with this coverage because it is the most lucrative for the skilled care facility. 23 This may offer patients more care therapies such as hydrating IVs, parenteral nutritional andphysical therapy. The skilled nursing facility, the subacute long-term care option, was designed primarily for geri- atric populations, to serve patients who required skilled nursing care before going home from an acute hospitalization. 24 Skilled nursing care may be more accessible for HIV-infected clients in need of physically supportive care. The increasing chronicity of HIV disease with newer thera-peutic agents and neuropsychiatric co-morbidities will most probably increase the need for long-term care. This level of care may be increasingly important not only in reducing acute hospitallength of stays but in creating a bridge to community-based residential options in the emergingchronic disease phase of the AIDS epidemic. 24 Child and Adolescent Care Children and/or adolescents who require a transitional phase of stabilization before going homefrom the hospital have intensive medical, familial, and social needs. (See Chapter 12: The Careof Children and Adolescents.) Chronic care for pediatric AIDS patients requires flexible goalorientation within each treatment phase of care including long-term care and skilled nursingfacilities. An overarching problem is that the U.S. lacks a national care policy to insure childrenand adolescents needing such care. 24 Helpful Placement Strategies Interdisciplinary team social workers will generally be the best resource for placement advice.A well-informed social worker will know about admission criteria and policies of each facility. Athorough assessment of the patient's social history should reveal any information that may influ-ence housing placement, such as how well the patient handles conflict, anger, frustration andgrief. Equally important, providers should be knowledgeable about the patient's dietary restric-tions, mental health, substance use, and anti-social behaviors such as confused wandering, sexualrelations, public masturbation, stealing, or personality disorders causing team and social split-ting and chaos. 25 Regular providers of HIV care would greatly benefit from visits to their local facilities to learnabout the physical settings and support services. Recent consumers of residential housing ser-vices can also be reliable informants. Encourage the family to visit potential settings and determine which facility feels most suitable in terms of location, attitude of care providers and culture sensitivity. PLANNING FOR DYING Planning for death and dying is an important part of caring for the HIV/AIDS patient and his or her family. Conversations on this topic can be particularly challenging because of the sub-stance of the issues that must be addressed as well as the difficulties inherent in communica- Chpt 22 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 464U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 465A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition XXIItion between provider and patient at such a difficult time. Provider communication issues and legal issues are discussed elsewhere in this guide. (See Chapter 21: Patient-Clinician Communi- cation and Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues.) It is particularly important that people with HIV and their families understand that even in some of the most confining situations they have choices. Does the patient want to die at homeor in an institutional setting? Who does he or she want as a health care proxy? Who does thepatient want to act as guardian for his or her children? Who will care for pets? Who do patientswant to be with them at the end-of-life? One of the greatest losses humans suffer near the end-of-life is the loss of autonomy. When it is possible, therefore, to give a patient a choice, even inseemingly trivial matters, it is important to do so. Developing a realistic understanding of the possible ways in which dying may occur improves the likelihood of families making choices consistent with their stated desires. Health care pro-viders can support families by assisting them in visualizing the dying and death of a loved one inbroad ways that are meaningful to the patient. 26 It is particularly important that family members have a clear understanding of what they needto do, whom they can call, and where they can turn when death is imminent. Often, if a plan isnot clearly understood, caregivers may yield to the impulse to call an ambulance or bring thepatient to an emergency room. This risk is increased if home health aids or other visiting profes-sionals do not clearly know the patient's wishes. It is, therefore, a good idea to keep a briefwritten summary of the patient's desires, along with copies of pertinent legal documents, in aprominent place near the bedside (see Table 22-7). Caregivers should be encouraged to discuss with their doctors and nurses the symptoms and signs they can expect and what to do when these occur. A clear plan of action to address these symptoms and signs should be developed in consultation with the interdisciplinary team wellahead of the time it may be needed. It is most helpful to make sure that medications needed tomanage these symptoms are handy and that a list of all medications is kept up to date. Similarly,an easy-to-access list of important phone numbers (doctor, hospice, nurse, family members etc.)should be maintained so that, in the event of clinical deterioration, confusion is minimized. Table 22-7: Important Documents to Keep Updated and Readily Available 1. Living will 2. Durable power of attorney or health proxy documents 3. A simple, clear statement of what the patient desires to be done in case of an emergency or crisis (i.e., do or do not call 911) 4.

In addition to understanding the anticipated changes, the caregivermust also know how to promote the patient's comfort in simple and successful ways. All membersof the interdisciplinary team should assist with teaching caregivers, normalizing their careexpectations, preparing them for anticipated physical changes, and supporting their care delivery.(See Chapter 20: Care for the Caregiver.) Ideally, the education of caregivers should begin during clinic or hospital visits before the caregiver assumes full-time responsibility for care. The education of caregivers and family members should include establishing and agreeing on the overall goals of care, the likelihood of symptoms, and the role caregivers play in end-of-life care. Families need to know general principles of pain andsymptom management. This includes learning to take symptoms seriously, understanding howthe patient expresses discomfort, being knowledgeable of treatment options, and understandingwhether interventions have provided relief. Family members also need guidelines for handlingthemselves appropriately and knowing what sorts of situations require them to contact theirhealth care provider (see Table 22-8). A patient with advancing HIV can experience numerous symptoms related to the HIV disease, medications, HIV-related infections and conditions, and pre-existing conditions. Symptoms as-sociated with advanced HIV disease include, but are not limited to, the following: 8,27,28 \u007f Symptoms associated with acute retroviral syndrome \u007f Oral changes\u007f Neuromuscular and neurological changes\u007f Pain in multiple sites from different sources\u007f Increasing fatigue\u007f Fevers and night sweats\u007f Changes in sleep patterns including insomnia\u007f Anorexia and involuntary weight loss\u007f Diarrhea\u007f Skin changes including rashes, itching and edema (see Chapter 25: Prevention of Skin Breakdown) \u007f Shortness of breath, cough and congestion General symptom control at the end-of-life should focus on comfort issues, pain, noisy and moist breathing, dyspnea, and restlessness. 29 Chpt 22 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 466U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 467A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition XXIITable 22-8: Caregiver/Patient Information Sheet: Common Symptoms Requiring Referral to Health Care Provider Emergency conditions indicating need to contact primary care provider (either homecare or hospice nurse or primary clinic) im-mediately if this change in condition was notanticipated.

This enables caregivers to make appropriate comfort choices such as when to ad- minister \"as needed\" medications and when to increase a dose of long-acting medication, as well as to monitor for new needs. Pain assessment and management strategies are exploredelsewhere in this guide. (See Chapter 4: Pain.) Education of lay caregivers in these skills is animportant component of successful discharge planning. Increased caregiver competence in ad-dressing anticipated symptoms can ease caregiver burden and increase the home comfort ofboth the patient and the caregiver. As someone approaches the living-dying phase, families acquire additional care tasks and must reorganize the family in order to overcome role strain. 30 This includes a significant change in the household/family leadership order. For example, the caregiver must manage his or her own life as well as become the patient's bill-payer, personal shopper, and child care provider, and actas the patient's primary social contact and health care coordinator, all of which may not be apracticed or comfortable role for the caregiver. All the while, family caregivers are dealing withthe imminent separation from the dying person, and possibly their own HIV infection. Most importantly, caregivers need to maintain a sense of competence. Although caregivers cannot be rescued from feeling helpless in the quest to keep a loved one alive, others can assistthem in feeling that what they can do is helpful and meaningful. 12 This includes providing assis- tance with developing meaningful tasks and integrating palliative care team services as care needs advance, and referring patients and families to hospice care (see Table 22-9). Table 22-9: Important Comfort Strategies to Teach Lay Caregivers at Home Lay caregivers must be as confident and as competent as possible with care and comfort strate- gies, because in the home setting they will be alone with the patient the majority of the time. These end-of-life-related comfort strategies should be demonstrated for, taught to, and under- stood by lay caregivers before they take on their care responsibilities: Give pain and other symptom control medications Caregivers must be instructed in proper administration and dosing of pain and other symp- tom management medications at scheduled times to keep their loved one as comfortable aspossible. Caregivers should also be instructed in administering rescue medications to be givenbetween long-acting medications. When current regimens are not meeting the needs of ongoing comfort control, caregivers should notify their home or hospice nurse to arrange changes in dose or medication(s) topromote patient comfort at all times. Caregivers should be informed of the benefits of regular dosing; health care practitioners should dispel caretakers' myths or concerns about addiction, tolerance, and dependence on medications that could inhibit their interest in or ability to adhere to a comfort plan. Keep clean and dry Keeping bed linens, pillows, and clothing dry and clean helps promote a patient's comfort and dignity as well as preventing decubitus ulcers. Freshening linens with scented powder or light perfume can enhance the olfactory and tactile sense of cleanliness as well.

Instructions such as keeping patients'private body parts covered and asking guests to leave the room when patients are urinating orreceiving bath care will enhance the patient's dignity and emotional comfort. Care for mouth and lips When weak or short of breath, patients will breathe through their mouths, which are often relaxed and open. Because this tends to dry out the oral mucosa and lips, caregivers need tobrush the patient's teeth and/or rinse their mouth and rub a cool moist cloth over their teethand apply moisturizer to their lips regularly. Moisten dry eyes When the body weakens, eyelids become more relaxed and people will sleep with their eyes open and rarely blink. This is very drying and sensitive to eye tissue. Caregivers should be instructed to avoid directing the breeze of fans, heat, and air condition- ing toward the patient's open eyes. Application of 2 to 4 drops of artificial tears every one ortwo hours will add gentle comfort. Reposition and turn As disease advances and bodies weaken, it becomes more difficult for patients to move and turn themselves. Caregivers can be taught to use a draw sheet for ease and comfort with repositioning. Monitor bowel movements Even though individuals may eat little as they get closer to the end-of-life, it is still important to remember that bodies continue to make waste. Keeping track of the frequency of bowel movements and notifying the visiting nurse if a patient has not had a bowel movement in atleast 3 days is important for the person's overall comfort. We must remember that the intimate memories of direct caregiving by family members become everlasting for the survivors. Informing family caregivers of the natural, expected events andcomfort strategies will improve caregivers' satisfaction with their assistance to the patient. Theresponsibility for caregiver instruction is shared throughout all settings of HIV care delivery. APPROACHING DEATH Certain active signs and symptoms of approaching death may be seen in the last several days and hours prior to a natural and expected death. (See Chapter 24: Medical Care at the End of Life.) Specifically, pulmonary aspects of the dying process call for caregiver management of thepatient's distress and discomfort. (See Chapter 6: Pulmonary Symptoms.) Caregivers shouldknow that the natural changes as their loved one gets sicker and approaches death may includethe following: \u007f Reduced intake and interest in food and fluids \u007f Decreased interest and attention Chpt 22 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 46926 picas U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 470A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition \u007f Reduced strength and ability to move \u007f Changing sleep and rest patterns \u007f Loss of control of bladder and bowels \u007f Described \"supernatural\" experiences\u007f An energy surge Reduced Intake and Interest in Food and Fluids Caregivers should be taught not to force food or drink into the patient's mouth nor try to use guilt to manipulate the patient into eating or drinking. Small chips of ice or frozen juices may berefreshing so long as the patient can swallow without difficulty. If the patient does want to eat,small frequent feedings of desired foods and fluids may be more manageable and appealing thanlarge meals. The team nutritionist can be very helpful in teaching techniques that may enhancecomfort, nutritional quality, and feeding assistance with swallowing changes. Most important,families and caregivers need to know that these changes do not cause pain and that if pain occurs medical attention is required. Decreased Interest and Attention As the body weakens, a person's involvement with other people, pets, hobbies and other inter- ests may decrease. Individuals may lose interest in favorite activities or topics of conversation.They may want to be alone or with just one person at a time or ask that visits be shorter thanusual. Caregivers need to be reminded that the patient is easily tired and weak. Although it ishard for caregivers when they feel shut out, they can be helped to understand that withdrawalfrom life is a natural part of preparation for death. Reduced Strength and Ability to Move Families and caregivers need to know that it is natural for a patient to become weak and require increasing amounts of rest to perform even simple tasks. It is important to assist andsupervise all of the patient's activities to promote safety. Changing Sleep and Rest Patterns As an individual gets closer to the end-of-life, it is normal for day and night sleeping patterns to reverse. Rest is important for everyone. If the patient is unable to sleep for several nights, pain should be assessed and health care providers should be notified. When fatigue is profound,patients may sleep with their eyes and mouth open and appear unresponsive. Caregivers shouldunderstand that this is expected and that, at these times, their role should shift from \"doing for\"to \"being with.\" This means that families should sit or rest near their loved ones, hold theirhands, apply lotion to their skin, soothe their faces with a warm moist cloth, play music, orconverse as the patient would expect them to do. Most importantly, caregivers should not attempt to awaken the patient by shaking or speaking loudly to them. They should reintroduce themselves to the patient upon every contact and avoidasking \"do you know who I am?\" Loved ones experience great pain when they are not recognizedand patients may withdraw from interactions if they fear they are causing pain. As the patient responds less, families should continue to speak directly and normally and assume that the patient can hear them, as hearing is the last of the senses to be lost.

The patient may lose control of his or her bladder and/or bowels as the muscles in thatarea begin to relax. The home care or hospice nurse can determine if there is a need to insert orapply an external or internal catheter for comfort. Protective measures such as layering the bedor resting area with pads will prevent frequent linen changes and soiling of furniture. Wearinggloves when handling soiled clothing and linens, and washing hands with soap and water beforeand after personal care, should be demonstrated and instructed. Care should be taken to keepthe patient clean and comfortable. The home care or hospice nurse should teach techniques forcleanliness, universal body fluid precautions, skin care, and monitoring of bowel patterns. Described \"Supernatural\" Experiences It is common for many people who are getting closer to dying to describe experiences of feeling that they have been in contact with people who have died before. Generally, these expe-riences are described as \"So and so came to see me\" or \"I just saw so and so.\" Although thesemay not seem believable to many people, they feel very real to the person experiencing them.For people who have significant anxiety about their approaching death, this is often a time whenthey may express feeling less frightened. Often people are reported to be resting better andfeeling calmer with less emotional strain or struggle after describing this type of experience. Energy Surge It is very common for caregivers to witness a predictable, significant increase in energy and restlessness at the very end-of-life. This may occur after a period of extreme weakness and deepsleeping, then suddenly the patient becomes VERY alert. The patient may want to stand, walk,or sit upright in a chair, when they have not done so for days or weeks. Patients may start takingtheir clothes off and on when they normally were quite modest. They may be found standingnaked at the end of the bed. Agitated \"picking\" at their clothes, bed linens, or the air may also bea sign of this stage. Other times the patient may request specific food, and eat the entire amountwhen they have not eaten more than a spoonful of anything for days. Often this surge of energy confuses and sometimes frightens the individuals closest to the pa- tient. When not educated about the possibility of it occurring, loved ones can interpret this surge of energy as renewed strength and an answer to prayers for recovery. It is important for families to be educated about this possibility, because it is a potential sign that death may occurwithin the next 24 hours. PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS Women The greatest percentage of HIV-infected women are mothers of young children under the age of ten years. Often women learn of their HIV infection during their prenatal care, which means they immediately have pregnancy needs as well as needs regarding their HIV status, preventionof HIV transmission to their unborn child, risk reduction education, and the possibility of theirother children being HIV-infected.

With HIV advanced disease, arrangements must be made to care for children on an emergency basis if her condition worsens as well as for long-term guardianship or custody. Women who have been infected by a male partner often are caring for that person aswell as their children, or struggling with the loss of that person in their lives. Clinically, a mothermay push her own physical, emotional and spiritual limits for the sake of her children and main-taining her primary parental role. Her own impending death critically affects a woman's caregiver role. When a mother leaves children behind, she may be leaving them in the custody of a sick partner or an aging sickparent, or deciding to separate them among family members. She may experience a very intense sense of responsibility, fear of rejection, guilt about transmission of HIV to her children, and guilt about leaving her family at a young age. There often may be great denial that her own careneeds have increased. The needs for women to have supportive housing and to be able to live with their children as long as possible are increasing. When women are unable to handle the care of their children,unlimited visitation by their children needs to be assured. Fear of losing touch with their chil-dren frequently causes women to delay acceptance of hospice services until the very terminalstages of life. (See A Clinical Guide to the Care of Women with HIV for more on caring for women.) Children Children continue to be born infected or to contract HIV at early ages. (See Chapter 12: The Care of Children and Adolescents.) Children at the end-of-life have special needs. When plan-ning care across the spectrum of inpatient and outpatient services, a formal assessment of thefamily at home helps determine suitability of the home setting as well as the willingness of family to participate in care. 10 Before discharging a child to home, health care providers must assess the family's understanding of HIV infection and the child's illness trajectory, and identifythe invidivuals in the family who are aware of the diagnosis. Also, planning must occur for thehome needs of uninfected siblings including privacy, attention, role changes and anticipatorygrief. Surrogate caregivers are needed for infected children when their parent(s) is ill, unavailable, or already has died. Whenever possible, family surrogates are ideal caregivers: they can help nor-malize the child's life to the greatest degree, facilitate visits of their parent when possible, andhelp the child keep fond memories of parent(s). However, extended families cannot always as-sume such child care responsibilities, because of problems such as living in too small a space orunfit housing, or caring for other dependents or relatives. Often the medical staff has come to accept the child's impending death while the parents still favor heroic lifesaving measures. Conversely, families may accept impending death before themedical team. When families and health care providers are in conflict over care strategies for achild in advanced stages of HIV, it can help to consult a facilitator who is not involved directly inthe patient's care, to help family and team reach a consensus. 10 For children with advancing HIV, the goals of case management are to reduce the length ofhospital stays, prevent future hospitalizations, promote alternative resources and settings and Chpt 22 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 472U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 473A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition XXIIidentify children who would benefit from a coordinated continuum of care.31 Pediatric case management should be considered whenever patient and family must interact with several groups of care providers, such as outpatient clinic staff, clinical trials staff, and home care infusion staff. Families need to have one central phone number to call for the majority of their assistanceand care guidance. Family-oriented case management is the optimal support. This includes assessment and inter- ventions for the entire family as a unit. Family case management, similar to hospice case man-agement, includes the multifaceted layers of practical assistance with support for the emotionaland social adjustments, and crisis intervention. Rural Families Families living with advanced HIV disease in rural communities have unique problems, in- cluding geographic isolation and added caregiving responsibilities. When HIV advances to thepoint of disability, the entire family structure feels the strain of increased responsibilities. Re-sources that are taken for granted in urban settings are scarce in rural settings. Professionalcaregivers as well as patients and their families are often isolated from the resources needed tohelp care for themselves. 32 The barriers to advanced and palliative HIV care in rural communities are numerous, and in-clude the following: \u007f Scarce home health and hospice agencies, with fewer staff than urban agencies to provide home health, social work or respite services \u007f Scarce resources resulting in fragmentation of care\u007f Lack of professional emergency assistance due to geographic remoteness\u007f Shortage of mental health professionals \u007f Long distances to medical facilities such as clinics, hospitals and nursing homes \u007f Lack of health care professionals with advanced HIV care expertise\u007f Fewer HIV-related services\u007f Community social stigma toward those living with HIV\u007f Home care and hospice agency reluctance to become known as the HIV provider, fearing loss of other clients, staff, or community funders \u007f Lack of transportation to needed services such as food, case management, counseling, group support, day care and respite services 33 \u007f Family financial strain due to limited work resources or land-dependent income Poor rural families can live with extraordinarily limited resources. Some families still live in homes without running water, telephones, electricity, indoor plumbing, or adequate clean food. Homes may have dirt floors or be overcrowded single-room houses or sheds that are not protec-tive for severe weather conditions. Incest, substance abuse and alcohol abuse can be additionalstressors in remote communities. Cultural sensitivity must be developed in working with fami- Chpt 22 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 47326 picas U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 474A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition lies with such severely limited resources. Care must be taken not to shame families for condi- tions under which they live. Palliative care goals must be adapted to the expectations and needs as defined by the family. In rural areas, people with HIV and their families often have very strong disclosure fears. When needs increase and HIV-positive people become more symptomatic, they may require the ser-vices of the local hospice and the HIV agencies. The more remote the area, the greater the fearof disclosure within the surrounding community. Even if only one person in the family has HIV,the stigma can remain with that family long after that person's death. Agencies must guard theconfidentiality of their clients with the utmost vigilance for these reasons. Families living in remote rural areas often grieve in isolation. It is important whenever possible to refer the family to hospice care (prior to their family member's death) to facilitate access tobereavement support. Strategies to improve access to HIV palliative care in rural areas include the following: \u007f Develop a community assessment of local resources and a needs assessment through the closest university. \u007f Advocate for increased services to meet the unique needs of the rural communities. For example: Arrange respite care or volunteer participation in\"care for the caregiver\" activities, using church groups or senior citizencenters. \u007f Educate family members and caregivers on the basics of HIV, risk reduction, and advanced care needs and respect for confidentiality. 34 \u007f Develop regionally specific cultural orientation for care providers who are not familiar with subcultural traditions. \u007f Develop strategic rural care plans with other experienced rural providers. Urban Poor Similar to the rural poor, individuals and families living in urban poverty also can live in extreme situations of despair. Common stressors include small living spaces that are overcrowdedand lack privacy, including lacking individual sleeping space. Many families live without tele-phone, electricity, running water, and shelter from extreme climate conditions. Crime is a daily occurrence in impoverished urban communities. Theft of medications, clothing, vehicles, furniture, entertainment items, and food can occur at any time. Individuals and fami- lies often fear that flying bullets or stabbing will take their lives before HIV has a chance to advance. For many people, HIV is not \"the\" significant concern until it interferes with theirability to survive within these poor conditions. Determination of suitable housing is difficult for many very poor families. Sometimes the mere fact that they have a roof over their heads, running water, and intermittent electricity may be agreat improvement over previous conditions. It is critical to remember that many families havehad their children removed from their homes due to determinations of unfit housing. For par-ents with advancing HIV, holding onto their home with their children may be their highest priority. At the same time it is also the responsibility of the palliative care team to notify protec- tive services if there is a concern about abuse or neglect of any family members in the home.

This may cause a rejection of any care provider entering their home. Families have been known to refuse visits from case managers, home care and hospice nurses, home health aides, pastoral workers and volunteers. Crowded living situations also increase the transmission rate of TB within the household. Pa- tients identified to have TB need to be linked with appropriate surveillance teams and have allmembers of their households tested or evaluated. We need also to be mindful of further barriers to care that exist for the impoverished population, such as the following: \u007f Transportation may be limited in areas of high crime. \u007f Only a limited number of home-based care agencies may serve the patient's home setting, and agencies may need protective services to accompany healthcare providers on every visit. \u007f After-hour call services may be limited to phone assistance, whereas clients in safer areas may receive a home visit at any time. SUMMARY Patients and families need reassurance that their interdisciplinary team members are inter- ested in their quality of life , not quantity of life without quality . We must acknowledge a good quality of life as being free of distressing symptoms, and offer patients the ability to remain asindependent in their lives and care as possible. With comprehensive assessment, we can pro-mote patients' ability to achieve meaningful goals and take care of personal priorities before theend of their lives. Deliberate, informed, and conscientious practical actions should be based on understanding the interdisciplinary team role and function, hospital discharge planning, patient and familyassessment, and home care and hospice planning. These components are paramount to promot-ing a continuum of care and support for people with HIV and their families at the end-of-life.

INTRODUCTION Well-informed patients can optimize their quality of life through partnership with their physician in clinical decisionmaking. This collaborative process is particularly important for patients withadvanced AIDS and their families. This chapter assists the clinician in striking the appropriatebalance between disease-directed therapy and comfort-centered care in caring for people withadvanced disease.Specific clinical events, presented in Table 23-1, should, at a minimum, prompt an explicit discussionof the goals of care, and may trigger a shift in emphasis from cure or disease management to pallia-tion. Acknowledging and discussing with the patient these transitions in illness and the inherentimplications is integral to quality patient care. Failure to do so adversely affects patient quality of lifeand often leads to hopelessness, depression and amplification of physical symptoms.These discussions with patients are extremely important interventions and require sophisticatedcommunication skills. (See Chapter 21: Patient-Clinician Communication.) QUALITY-OF-LIFE-BASED DECISIONMAKING FOR PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED AIDS Many patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) experience marked im- provement in their clinical condition. Others are not as fortunate. Some have irreversible deficits(usually neurologic, cognitive and/or motor) and live at a level of considerable disability or incapac-ity. 1, 2, 3 Others experience persistent treatment toxicities that make remaining on HAART difficult or impossible. Moreover, even for those who do experience improvements in clinical status, there isnot necessarily an improved quality of life in areas other than depression. 1 Over time, therefore, the burden of treatment may begin to outweigh its benefits. New therapies increase the chances of livinglonger, but often with diminished physical or cognitive capacity and onerous treatment-related symp-toms. 3, 4 This is particularly true with second-line and salvage therapy. For some patients, living longer in this diminished state is less desirable than a shorter life.Providers must, therefore, elicit the patient's view on the key physical, medical, emotional and spiritualelements that define a good quality life, the life worth living. Providers must recognize, moreover, thatpatients' perspectives may differ sharply from their own, and understand the ethical implications in-herent in these differences. (See Chapter 20: Care for the Caregiver and Chapter 17: Ethical Issues.) Sentinel Events Triggering Discussion About the Advanced AIDS State The occurrence of the events presented in Table 23-1 often indicates that death is likely in the foreseeable future and should cause the provider to explicitly review prognosis, goals, quality-of-lifeperspective and expectations with the patient and family. Chapter 23 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 47926 picasA Clinical Guide Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 23: Medical Care in Advanced AIDS U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 480Relative and Absolute Antiviral Drug Resistance Antiviral drug resistance is more likely in patients with CD4 less than 200, in patients who are less adherent to the initial drug regimen, and in patients on second and third line drug regimens.5 In a group of 70 protease na\u00efve patients with advanced AIDS started on HAART, the treatment failurerate was 40% and mortality rate was 16% in three months. Brechtl's study shows mortality was not associated with nonadherence and, while depression and weight improved, other aspects of quality of life did not. 1 Freedberg developed a statistical model of AIDS survival which showed significant improvement inoverall survival and quality-adjusted years of life with adherent HAART therapy but also revealed arelatively short survival for patients with advanced AIDS. A graphic representation of two hypotheti-cal patients is shown in Figure 23-1. Estimated survivals are shown in Table 23-2. 6Table 23-1: Sentinel Clinical Events \u007f Immunologic failure, as indicated by low and falling CD4 count, rising viral load in the face of good adherence to primary HAART, or other indicators of failed immunesystem reconstitution despite therapy \u007f Relative and absolute antiviral drug resistance to HAART, salvage therapy, or investigational trials \u007f Poor adherence to HAART \u007f Progressive cachexia multifocal leukoencephalopathy\u007f Advanced liver disease\u007f Intensive care mechanical / Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia \u007f Drug-resistant TB Table 23-2: Survival without HAART Survival without Survival with CD4 cells/mm3Therapy (yr) Therapy (yr) 50 1.39 2.84 200 3.33 5.32 500 7.05 9.13 Source: Freedberg KA, et al.

In a group of patients for whom short survival can be an expected outcome, therefore, disease-directed therapy and palliative care can and should be provided simultaneously, with palliative care playingan increasingly important role in the care of these patients over time. Second Line, Salvage, and Investigational Therapy There are data in a study by Durant, et al., suggesting that second line therapy, particularly whenguided by genotype testing, is valuable in increasing longevity. 7 Indeed, for some patients viral sup- pression on second line therapy may last for years. This same study, however, also indicated that a substantial number of patients progressed despite therapy or were intolerant of therapy. An AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) study of response to second line treatment further reinforces that sec-ond line treatment is a marker for advanced disease. 8 Institution of second line therapy should therefore prompt recognition that, while another remission is possible, treatment failure may beimmediate and is probably inevitable. 9 Thus, conversations about the end-of-life and the role of palliative care are indicated when second line therapy is considered or initiated. This is even morerelevant as patients undertake third and fourth line therapy after multiple treatment failures. The outlook for patients on salvage therapy or those participating in clinical trials following exhaus- tion of all conventional regimens is very poor. Initiation\u2014indeed, consideration\u2014of salvage orinvestigational therapy under these circumstances carries with it the imperative to reassess the goals and burdens of treatment with patients and to explore the benefits and risks of intensive pal- liative care. These discussions may inform decisions about stopping or declining further antiretroviraltherapy or prophylaxis against or suppression of opportunistic infections, depending on the definedgoals of treatment and the perceived effects of continued disease-directed therapy. \u007f Clinical Ethics and Practice in Salvage and Investigational Therapy The decision to continue second line, salvage or investigational therapy has several ethical and psychological implications which can complicate discussions about palliative and disease-di- rected care. Although cancer and AIDS differ in many ways, the experience with cancer can inform AIDS clini- cian-investigators. Patients who enter investigational cancer trials participate in part because of protocol eligibility, such as disease and functional criteria. Many advanced stage cancer patients who make decisionsto participate in cancer clinical trials are highly motivated and feel that \"active\" treatment is the best course for them. Patients are also influenced by their physicians and their own sense of altruism. 10, 11, 12 These patients often expect a response to therapy, a reduction in symptoms and improved and in-creased quality communication with their physician. 11 They equate therapeutic efforts with superior quality of life and do not consider any other options or quality of life ramifications. Palliative care,therefore, is not a consciously considered option for many patients with advanced cancer who areenrolled in cancer clinical trials, and is not consistently offered. Cancer patients who enroll inclinical trials overestimate their survival, making these patients more likely to choose putative life- extending therapy over palliative care. 13 Chapter 23 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 48226 picasA Clinical Guide Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 23: Medical Care in Advanced AIDS XXIII U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 483Phase I and Phase II trials are not trials for the patients' benefit. Rather, their goals are to define toxicity patterns, establish maximum tolerated dose, and complete trials in selected tumor types that could, if responses are seen, lead to advanced Phase II and Phase III trials. Responses measured in Phase I and early Phase II trials rarely convert into prolonged survival for patients enrolled in thosetrials. 14 Furthermore, systemic barriers obstruct palliative care program participation by these patients.Impediments dissuade programs from informing prospective patients, thereby restricting access.The added regulatory barrier that de facto prevents patients receiving disease-directed therapy from even being referred for hospice care 15 exacerbates dissonance between disease-directed and pallia- tive approaches. Non-viable financial requirements argue against simultaneous care and are detri- mental to clinical research, to informed consent, and to best patient care. For example, hospice programs are required to absorb costs associated with disease-directed therapy (like HAART) andthe cost of treating patients' side effects from investigational therapy. Consequently, when investigational therapy is completed, patients are often close to death. Both patient and loved ones have little opportunity to address end-of-life tasks. The physician and thepatient and family have focused often on the disease-directed therapies to the exclusion of end-of-life issues and palliative care. 16 The perceived dissonance between the goals of disease-directed therapy and palliative care leads topatient and physician reluctance to discuss concurrent application of both investigational therapyand palliative care. For the patient with advanced AIDS, participation in clinical trials should not be a barrier to effective symptom management or intensive emotional support. A desire for optimalquality of life should not preclude clinical trials participation. Adherence Another sentinel event that appropriately triggers a patient/provider reassessment of the goals oftreatment is non-adherence to therapy. Current HAART regimens are complex. Patients are rou-tinely expected to ingest between 6 and 20 pills a day, often on bid or tid dosing schedules with significant dietary restrictions. Patients experiencing virologic and clinical failure despite protease inhibitor therapy seem to fall into two categories: those treated over an extended period of time with a variety of antiretroviralagents, and those whose adherence to a HAART regimen is inadequate to sustain viral suppression. 5 Adherence research in other diseases with significantly less demanding regimens has documentedlevels of fully adherent behavior as low as seven percent. 17, 18 Furthermore, \"....rates of compliance with different long-term medication regimens for different illnesses in different settings tend toconverge to approximately 50%.\" 19 However, it should be noted that adherence rates vary greatly depending on measurement method- ology. Moreover, adherence distribution curves are often U-shaped (not bell-shaped), suggesting that close to one third of patients are highly adherent, roughly one third are functionally non-adherentand the remainder fall in the 20%-to-80%-adherent range. This renders meaningless the \"approxi-mately 50%\" figure cited above. Adherence rates with chronic conditions also decline over time when reinforcement is absent. An 80% rate of adherence, often adequate though not ideal in managing other diseases, is inadequatefor effective HAART. 20, 21 Several investigators have demonstrated a precipitous decline in HIV sup- pression with each 5% Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 23: Medical Care in Advanced AIDS U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 484Many factors have been examined as potential influences on adherence. These include the patient's age, education, income, gender, active or prior alcohol or substance use, depression, relationship to the health care provider, interactions with others, primary language, race and ethnicity, involvement with AIDS service organizations, use of reminders and cues, use of me-chanical devices (a pill box, for instance), location of care delivery, routine, treatment side effectsexperienced, beliefs about treatment, access to care, venue of treatment, costs associated withmedications and others. 5, 26, 27 Several of these factors, while intuitively associated with greater or lesser adherence, do not bear out empirically. Furthermore, physician ability to predict adher-ence success or failure is demonstrably poor. Current or prior substance use, poverty, illiteracy and alcohol or drug addiction, commonly thought to predict poor adherence, are not in fact, significantly associated with adherence. 2, 25, 28 As Wright concluded in a 2000 study, \"not adhering to treatment regimes is so widespread that no combinationof sociodemographic variables is reliably predictive of patients' not following doctors' orders.\" 23 Depression and active alcohol abuse are the only two factors consistently demonstrated to have adeleterious effect on adherence. Scrutiny of most other characteristics yields equivocal results andargues convincingly for approaching the issue of adherence with care and on a patient-by-patientbasis. Several strategies to improve adherence have been studied and can be helpful in the clinicalsetting. 24, 26, 29, 30 Cachexia AIDS-associated cachexia syndrome reflects the uncontrolled inflammatory state induced by thevirus. 31 Oversecretion of inflammatory cytokines produces pathologic changes including protein catabolism and weight loss. Pharmacologic appetite stimulants can lead to weight gain and mayenhance the patient's sense of well-being, but survival time is not lengthened. 32, 33 In advanced AIDS, symptoms of hunger and thirst are reduced or absent. Patients report anorexiaand even dysgeusia (\"food tastes bad\"). Caregivers frequently respond by forcing foods and, some-times in concert with physicians, advocating for enteral or intravenous alimentation. Such supple-mental feedings are toxic, do not prolong life and are not consistent with biomedical ethical guide- lines or high quality of life. Some reasons not to artificially feed a patient with advanced AIDS are presented in Table 23-3. 34 Table 23-3: Arguments against Artificial Feeding in Advanced AIDS \u007f Does not increase survival\u007f Promotes suffering due to aspiration, diarrhea and abdominal pain (NG, PEG tubes) \u007f Can be withheld, as can hydration, according to U.S. Supreme Court decisions \u007f Is inconsistent with some religious and secular values\u007f Distracts family from issues of emotional support, completion of relationships and other end-of-life tasks Source: Gillick MR. Rethinking the role of tube feeding in patients with advanced dementia. N Engl J Med 342:206-10, 2000. Eating is often equated to fundamental caregiving, and offers opportunities for communication and sharing. Health care providers can help caregivers and patients identify alternative activities such as life review, storytelling, family outings, cards and games, reading. Time is often better spent pro- Chapter 23 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 48426 picasA Clinical Guide Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 23: Medical Care in Advanced AIDS XXIII U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 485moting communication and demonstrating caring than preparing unwanted or discomfiting meals. Explicit reassurance to the caregiver that the patient will not starve to death, and that suffering is not increased, is critical both for patient comfort and the reduction of caregiver anxiety. AIDS-Associated Malignancies Several cancers Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and invasive cervical carcinoma in women. The diagnosis and staging of these malig-nancies are identical to diagnosis and staging in the HIV-negative patient. The prognosis, however,is worse. \u007f Kaposi's Sarcoma often responds well treatment, whereas visceral KS, including the lung and GItract, is not curable. Although some patients may obtain short-term control with HAART and systemicchemotherapy such as a doxorubicin-containing regimen, in general palliation is the primary goal.Absent regulatory and financial barriers, addressed in Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues, allpatients with incurable KS should be referred to hospice. \u007f Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL) The incidence of NHL is estimated at up to 2% per year in HIV-infected patients and 20% over threeyears in AIDS patients. In the HIV-positive patient, NHL is always high grade B cell histology, isalways disseminated (Stage III or IV), and presents as either systemic, CNS or body cavity disease.Diagnosis of CNS lymphoma should prompt hospice referral as average survival is only 2 to 4 months.Radiation does not prolong survival and provides minimal palliation. Systemic lymphoma has beentreated with modified regimens with an average survival of eight months. At the end of therapy,however, and certainly at relapse, patients should be referred to hospice or otherwise be allowed to benefit from intensive palliative care. 35 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is thought to caused by reactivation of the JCvirus, a human papovavirus. The sudden deterioration of intellectual and physical function of PMLheralds a median survival of 2 to 4 months. Recent trials have demonstrated no improvement withnovel interventions. 36, 37 While clinical investigation should continue, and some clinicians recently have opted to use empiric cidofovir even though this is of unproven efficacy, active PML marks theneed for intensified palliative care. Anecdotally, a number of patients described as presenting with PML have experienced greatly im- proved scans and significantly improved longevity following the initiation of HAART. However, pa-tients with PML who do not experience immune reconstitution with antiretroviral therapy have verylimited life expectancy. Advanced Liver Disease Advanced liver disease due to viral hepatitis is becoming a leading cause of death in patients infectedwith HIV. While treatment guidelines for the management of HIV-infected patients co-infected withhepatitis B and/or C continue to advance, not even the emerging new treatments will be effective inpreventing mortality for patients with advanced cirrhosis and liver failure. Chapter 23 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 48526 picasA Clinical Guide Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 23: Medical Care in Advanced AIDS U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 486Past efforts at prognosis using the Child-Turcotte-Pugh classification have not been consistent be- cause of the subjective nature of several indicators. A recent report used objective laboratory param- eters to assign prognosis in advanced liver disease: the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD).38 A revised scoring system uses three laboratory tests (INR, total bilirubin, and creatinine) to assign a prognosis in chronic liver disease. This revised scoring system has been utilized to stratify patients for liver transplantation, which has recently been recognized in many centers as a feasible option for people with AIDS. The scoring system may also prove useful in determining which patients deserve a greater emphasis on palliativeor hospice care. In fact, any individual with a high MELD score and on the waiting list for an organis also a candidate for hospice. 39 If the patient receives a liver, then the hospice benefit can be revoked. Most patients awaiting transplantation, however, will not receive a liver, will die, and would benefit greatly from aggressive palliative care. Large hepatocellular carcinoma is an additional complication of chronic hepatitis and an absolute indication for palliative or hospice care. Intensive Care Unit / Mechanical Ventilation / PCP Merely being in an intensive care unit is an indication for palliative care regardless of diagno-sis. 40, 41 AIDS is no exception. Effective palliative care can be provided in an ICU with proper training.41 Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is still the most common AIDS-defining illness.42, 43 Acute respiratory failure occurs in 5% to 30% of patients. Intubated AIDS patients with PCP expe- rience mortality approaching 50%.44 The attitude of patients with advanced AIDS toward mechanical ventilation at end-of-life has beenreported. 45 Eighty-seven percent of 57 patients responded that withholding mechanical ventilation in the setting of \"futility\" was acceptable. Therefore, while mechanical ventilation may be very appropriate for the patient with the initial diagnosis of AIDS and PCP , the patient with advanced AIDS and drug resistant virus may be quite comfortable discussing alternatives to hospitalization andventilation. Thus palliative care and even an end-of-life style of support for the patient and family in these circum- stances should be considered routinely and provided aggressively. QUALITY OF LIFE IN ADVANCED AIDS A study has demonstrated that while asymptomatic patients with HIV had physical functioning equivalent to the U.S. general population, patients with symptomatic AIDS were impaired much likepatients with other chronic illness (gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), prostate disease,depression, diabetes) and those with advanced AIDS scored similar to patients with end-stage renaldisease (ESRD). 46 One difference worth noting is that all three groups of people with HIV in the study scored lower on the Emotional Well-Being Scale than all comparison chronic illness groups exceptpatients with primary depression. Symptom Management and Quality of Life Patients with advanced HIV disease often face a vexing array of symptoms: nausea, fatigue, weight loss, pain of various origins and presentations, headaches, neuropathies, diarrhea, fevers, shortnessof breath, confusion, loss of memory, AIDS-related dementia, and others. Symptoms also arise as aresult of therapy. Many of the drugs used in HAART can cause substantial side effects. HAART's com- Chapter 23 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 48626 picasA Guide Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 23: Medical Care in Advanced AIDS XXIII U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 487plicated drug regimens, opportunistic infection prophylaxis and treatment of other conditions at times give rise to complex and confounding drug interactions. Control of pain and other symptoms is discussed in Part II of this guide and the related ethical considerations are addressed in Chapter 17: Ethical Issues. Emotional and Interpersonal Quality of Life Some patients will ask their physicians for help in hastening death. When this occurs, it is impera- tive for the physician to understand why such a request is being made and to respond accordingly(Table 23-4). 47 For some patients the desire to hasten death can be reduced by good pain and symptom management. Others may need treatment for depression, anxiety or other psychiatric conditions.Interest in quickening death is often a response to factors that are degrading the patient's quality oflife and can be mitigated. The quality of communication between physician and patient is of para- mount importance. (See Chapter 21: Patient-Clinician Communication and Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition to Home-Based and Hospice Care.)

Ongoing communication between clinician and patient yields benefits beyond mitigating requests for assistance with dying. Patients who have regular conversations with their physicians about qual-ity of life and preferences for care are more likely to complete advance medical directives, and theirphysicians are more likely to know their patients' relative preferences regarding pain control, symp-tom relief, and prolongation of life. 3 Table 23-5 offers some examples of questions intended to deepen the dialogue between the patientand his or her health care providers. 48 These questions focus on particular domains in the psycho- social and spiritual arenas.

(See Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition to Home-Based and HospiceCare and Chapter 18: Legal and Financial Issues). Because of the difficulty in determining prognosisin advanced AIDS and because of the benefits of hospice care, it is not unusual for a critically ill AIDSpatient who is seemingly at death's door to regain function and health while in hospice care, indeedin many circumstances because of hospice's intense, home-based interventions. With marked im- provement, the patient no longer meets hospice criteria, and so begins a cycle of repeated gradua-tion, deterioration, readmission to hospice (often following hospitalization), re-stabilization and re-graduation. This paradigm is highly suggestive of a salutary relationship between the quality-of-lifefocus coupled with individualized care by hospice's highly-skilled team of providers resulting inperiods of enhanced quality and perhaps quantity of life. Medicare regulations can make it difficult or impossible to provide concurrent HAART and hospice services. Because the hospice benefit includes expenditures for medications out of daily patient perdiem reimbursement, HAART can quickly bankrupt a hospice program. These issues must be consid-ered along with the risks and benefits of HAART when contemplating referral to hospice care. CONCLUSION Patients with advanced AIDS benefit from competent and conscientious palliative care interven- tions. Routine discussions with the patient and regular reassessment of the goals and burdens of treatment enhance high quality care and well informed treatment choices. Careful attention tosentinel occurrences as triggers for additional discussion and reassessment further enhances care. Delivering disease-directed therapies and palliative care simultaneously, shifting the mix as the HIV disease biology unfolds, and attending to patient choice, comfort and quality of life are the corner-stones and the future of excellent care for patients with advanced AIDS.

INTRODUCTION This chapter discusses medical care at the end-of-life, and is organized into four sections, as follows: \u007f Dying in the Era of HAART\u007f Preparing Patients and Families for Imminent Death\u007f Clinical Management of Imminently Dying Patients\u007f After-Death Care DYING IN THE ERA OF HAART Trajectory of Dying In the early days of the HIV epidemic, hospice referrals tended to follow a typical disease trajec- tory. A patient's clinical decline was most often marked by multiple hospitalizations, extensive musclewasting and weight loss, desire to stop restorative therapies, and/or fatigue and resulting inability tocope with activities of daily living and problem-solving. Now, depending upon the patient'scomorbidities and ability to adhere to combination therapies, there are multiple trajectories for end-stage HIV disease. Patients with active illicit substance use who are unable to adhere to treatment,for example, may have the course of illness complicated by recurrent skin abscesses, multiple epi-sodes of endocarditis, and lack of medical follow-up resulting in antibiotic resistance and death fromsepsis. These patients may also experience infections such as mycobactierium avium complex (MAC), cryptococcal meningitis and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) as causes of death. For other patients, newer treatments may prolong survival time without much illness. In these cases, thecause of death has shifted from opportunistic infections to end-stage organ failure or other medicalcomplications found with any chronic disease. Prognostic Indicators Prognostication based upon a combination of signs and symptoms is crucial in determining the most appropriate clinical management strategy to alleviate suffering in persons near the end-of-life.In the U.S., for hospice programs to accept reimbursement from Medicare, patients must have aprognosis of six months or less if the disease were to run its normal course. Decisions to withdrawchronic therapies and introduce other treatments that might have been avoided earlier in the courseof illness, such as steroids, must be based upon a reasonable assessment of the patient's life expect-ancy and goals.Prognostication of time until death in HIV/AIDS is difficult. This is particularly true in young peoplebecause their basic cardiovascular health can sustain life longer than is possible in an older personwith the same symptoms. Physicians tend to make overoptimistic prognostic predictions, particu-larly if they have had a long relationship with the patient. 1,2 Prior to the use of HAART, the National Chapter 24 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 49326 picasA Clinical Guide Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 24: Medical Care at the End of Life U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 494Hospice Organization developed guidelines for physicians desiring to refer AIDS patients for hos- pice services.3 These are listed in Table 24-1. With widespread use of HAART, predicting life expectancy is now more complex. Recent studies of patients with access to triple drug therapy suggest that disease progression to AIDS or death may beassociated with timing of initial antiretroviral therapy. 4, 5, 6 A recent Canadian study found that those starting therapy with a CD4 cell count lower than 200 cells/mm3 were three times more likely to die than those treated earlier in their course. The crude mortality rate for patients with access to HAARTearly in their trajectory (after 1997) is 6.7% at 28 months, much different from the statistic in the earlyepidemic. 7 Viral load as a prognostic factor does not seem as important when patients have access to treatment. Previous studies may simply reflect that these patients were not treated soon enough to rescue a failing immune system. Table 24-1: Factors Associated with Shortened Life Expectancy Symptom or Sign Comment CD4 persistently low Advanced disease: < 50 cells/mm3 Viral burden remains > 100,000 copies/ml despite combination therapy Functional Status < 50 Spending > 50% of day in bed (Karnofsky Performance Status) Failure of optimized therapy e.g., multi-drug resistance or failure Desire to forego more therapy May occur after multiple hospitalizations Significant wasting Loss of > 30% lean body mass Progressive hepatitis C despite therapy Hepatic failure; drug intolerance Progressive multifocal Progressive dependencies; dementia leukoencephalopathy (PML) Unresponsive Kaposi's sarcoma involving Progression despite therapy an organ End-stage organ disease Renal, hepatic, or cardiac failure Persistent diarrhea > 1 mo. No response to treatment Unresponsive lymphoma/ other malignancy Progression despite therapy Desire of patient for death Acknowledgment by patient & family of poor prognosis Adapted from Moore8, NHO9 Despite the development of multiple resistant strains, patients who are able to adhere to therapy seem to be living longer. Providers caring for people with long treatment histories often becomefrustrated with the lack of drug choices, but good supportive care can allow a patient to live until thenext therapy is released. Liver failure, malignancies, and cardiovascular events are the issues facingpatients with advanced disease; providers now need to be familiar with the palliative aspects ofmanaging these problems. Chapter 24 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 49426 picas XXIVA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 24: Medical Care at the End of Life U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 495In addition, providers must continually address the risks and benefits of continued antiretroviral therapy as patients approach the end-of-life. Just as patients may benefit from ongoing HAART therapy even in the face of resistant virus and declining immune function, there also may come a point where continued therapy will yield little benefit and the patient's quality of life may suffer due to medicationtoxicities. Providers need to be as familiar with the issues involved in stopping HAART as they arewith the criteria for initiating HAART in treatment-eligible patients. HAART is also by definitionfuture-oriented therapy, since the results are not expected in the short term but rather are seen inlonger-term survival. This may confuse decisionmaking related to end-of-life care planning. There-fore, it is important for clinicians to work closely with patients through the complex decisionmakingthat now surrounds HIV treatment in late-stage disease. These issues have made end-stage HIV/AIDS more similar to other chronic diseases. Research must be pursued regarding what \"end-stage\" actually looks like to document the prognostic indicators andsymptom management that can be useful. Without concrete knowledge, it is difficult to emotionallysupport patients near the end-of-life and providers run the risk of again not recognizing this diseasestage. Early recognition is absolutely critical for the kind of planning and closure patients needbefore death. Setting Reasonable Goals and Maintaining Hope Patients and providers in the era of HAART may be lulled into thinking that HIV/AIDS has been cured, without noting the larger picture that HIV/AIDS remains a fatal illness. If this perspective islost there is danger of reacting to every decline as something that can and must be \"fixed.\" When aperson becomes acutely ill, curative interventions such as ventilatory support and cardiac pressorsare appropriate. But for those who are in poor nutritional condition or who have underlying liver orrenal disease, what initially presents as a curable illness may turn into serial organ failure. The provider must recognize how fear of death impacts management decisions (both by family and by provider). For some cultures it is imperative to continue what may even appear to be futile therapy(See Chapter 14: Culture and Care). Although it is difficult and time-consuming to have repetitiousconversations with loved ones about a realistic interpretation of the clinical picture, it is as much a part of medical management as writing orders for intravenous fluids. A patient's family may be friends, other residents of a shelter, or even health/social workers. Having talked with patients and their support persons at a less emotional time certainly facilitates the pro-cess for health care providers, but confronting a possible death is not easy even when the events thatattend it have been anticipated. Another complication, particularly in homeless or disenfranchisedpopulations, is underlying mental illness which requires additional communication and clinicaleffort. (See Chapter 21: Patient-Clinician Communication and Chapter 10: Psychiatric Problems.) In the face of even the bleakest situation it is important to not insinuate that there is nothing more to be done. The patient and family should, at these times, be helped to redefine hopes or goals. Hopeis an intangible quality that allows us to overlook current discomforts to achieve a desired endpoint.As people near the end-of-life they turn from 'doing' to 'being' and may even experience a surge ofpositive feeling for family, self, or others. 10 When people are known to be dying, goals can be adjusted to fit the time they have left. For example, thenew goal may be to live until an anniversary such as a birthday (within weeks) or a specific holiday. Thiscould mean celebrating that event sooner to include the dying person (for example, holding a birthdayparty this week rather than trying to make it to the next month). Nature, poetry, and music may take onnew meaning and can sustain one near the end-of-life as long as symptoms are controlled.

It may be necessary to precede this discussion with a check on patient and/orfamily member understanding of the clinical situation. (See Chapter 21: Patient-Clinician Commu-nication and Chapter 22: Facilitating the Transition to Home-Based and Hospice Care.) Askingpatients and family members for their assessment of the clinical situation can be useful in startinga discussion about care for imminent death. Straightforward, open-ended questions are helpful, suchas \"What are your biggest concerns now?\" In addition, it is often useful to specifically probe thefollowing important domains: 11 \u007f Optimizing physical comfort \u007f Maintaining a sense of continuity with one's self \u007f Maintaining and enhancing relationships\u007f Making meaning of one's life and death\u007f Achieving a sense of control\u007f Confronting and preparing for death Table 24-2 offers useful questions to help health care providers discuss these domains with patients and their family members. Table 24-2: Useful Questions for Exploring Patient and/or Family Concerns Domain Question Physical comfort Tell me about your pain. Can you rate it on a 10-point scale? How much do you suffer from physical symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, or bowel problems? Continuity with one's self What makes life most worth living for you at this time? If you were to die sooner rather than later, what would be left undone? Maintaining and enhancing How are your family (or loved ones) handling your illness? relationships Have you had a chance to tell your family (or loved ones) how they are important to you? Making meaning What kind of legacy do you want to leave behind? of life and death What would allow you to feel that going through this illness has a purpose? Do you have spiritual beliefs that are important in how you deal with this illness? Achieving a sense of control How would you like your death to go? Confronting and preparing How much are you thinking about dying now? for death What are you thinking about it? Neglect of problems in these domains can lead to depression and difficulty adjusting to the situation for both the patient and family members. The empirical demonstration of the importance of payingattention to these domains is just beginning. 12 Chapter 24 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 49626 picas XXIVA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 24: Medical Care at the End of Life U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 497Negotiating a Plan for Care and Contingency Plans for Complications In addition to assessing the clinical situation, the clinician must also become familiar with pa- tient and family concerns in order to discuss goals of care and develop a plan to meet them. Thediscussion of goals of care is an important step that should precede discussion of \"Do Not Resuscitate\"orders, and this discussion should address the following issues: \u007f Physical symptoms, such as pain or dyspnea \u007f Psychological issues, such as depression or anxiety\u007f Social issues, such as family coping \u007f Practical logistics, including expected place of death \u007f Spiritual or existential issues, such as chaplain support or sense of accomplishment in life\u007f Special goals for life closure, such as family quarrels to resolve It is important to understand how patients and family members balance quality of life with length of life. Patients and family members should be informed that a peaceful death can often be achievedwith medical care that is not intrusive. Family members should further understand that their involve- ment in care is critical and that there are specific roles that they may play (e.g. physical care and medication administration; helping a patient with leaving a legacy; orchestrating visits from friends;helping with goodbye telephone calls; or, simply being present). Table 24-3 presents information to help health care providers address some of the common concerns for family members of imminently dying patients. Table 24-3: Common Family Concerns for Family Members of Imminently Dying Patients Concern Fact Dying will be painful. Most pain can be controlled to a degree that the patient finds acceptable with noninvasive pain medications. Everything possible must Some invasive treatments aimed at sustaining life, such be done. as CPR, are painful and ineffective for imminently dying patients. Do Not Resuscitate orders will DNR orders can actually allow medical staff and family to mean that medical care will be focus on issues that are more important for patients, limited in important ways. including legacy-building and time for closure with important people. More medical care will be Spending one's last hours at home has a powerful available in the hospital than importance for many patients, and most medical issues at home. for dying patients can be handled at home. If complica- tions arise, hospitalization or placement at a hospicefacility may be possible. End-of-life care with home Contact with important clinicians can still occur with hospice will mean losing phone calls. Home hospice is directed by the primary contact with primary HIV physician; it does not mean that they have to lose contact. clinicians.

Once patient and family understand what medical care will provide, and how they can contrib- ute to care, DNR orders are much less likely to become the focal point for a struggle around how to ensure that a patient is being cared for. Encouraging Life Closure Making sense of a life is not something that a clinician can do for a patient, but clinicians can facilitate or encourage life review activities for patients and their families. These activities can include the following: \u007f Telling and sharing stories\u2014events that were important, funny, worth remembering; storytelling can be audiotaped or videotaped for a more permanent kind of legacy. \u007f Deciding what to do with one's things\u2014giving a favorite sweater to a friend, or a treasured stamp collection to a nephew. \u007f Planning the patient's memorial service\u2014music, readings, people who will speak, some- one to preside over the service, whether to have a religious service or non-denominationalservice. Some clinicians use a mnemonic of five important conversations to complete for a peaceful death. These five items themselves lack the context and richness of a life, but they are helpful as brief remind-ers of the kinds of issues that patients may want to talk about with important people before death. \u007f most patients recognize some transcendent dimension to life, and addressing spiritual is- sues can be critical near death. It is helpful to remember that spirituality differs from religion; spiri-tuality refers to an individual's relationship with the transcendent, whereas religion is a set of be-liefs, practices, and language that characterize a community searching for transcendent meaningin a particular way. Even though many patients will feel alienated from particular religions, they mayyet have a spirituality that can help them make sense of their life and their death. Psychosocial clinicians and chaplains with experience in end-of-life care can be particularly helpful if they are available. CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF IMMINENTLY DYING PATIENTS Clinical Recognition of Imminent Death It is important that the family and patient understand normal landmarks in the dying process and overcome common misperceptions regarding imminent death. One such misperception is the beliefthat lack of appetite and diminished oral intake are causing profound disability and that fluid and nutrition are required. The normal dying process includes the following changes: \u007f Loss of appetite \u007f Decreased oral fluid intake, and decreased thirst\u007f Increasing weakness and/or fatigue Chapter 24 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 49826 picas XXIVA Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 24: Medical Care at the End of Life U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 499\u007f Decreasing blood perfusion, including decreased urine output, peripheral cyanosis and cool extremities \u007f Neurologic dysfunction, including delirium, lethargy, and coma, and changes in respira- tory patterns \u007f Loss of ability to close eyes\u007f Noisy breathing as pharyngeal muscles relax In particular, neurologic dysfunction can sometimes result in terminal delirium which can include a mounting syndrome of confusion, hallucinations, delirium, myoclonic jerks, and seizures prior to death. Recognized early, this can be treated with neuroleptics such as haloperidol or chlorprom- azine. For more information see Chapter 10: Psychiatric Problems. When death occurs, the clinical signs include the following: \u007f Absence of heartbeat and respirations \u007f Fixed pupils \u007f Skin color turns to a waxen pallor and extremities may darken \u007f Body temperature drops\u007f Muscles and sphincters relax, sometimes resulting in release of stool or urine Preparation, which can involve the family, should include the following: \u007f Creating a peaceful environment to the patient's liking \u007f Preparing instructions about whom to call (usually not 911) when death occurs\u007f Taking time to witness what is happening\u007f Creating or using rituals that can help mark the occasion in a respectful way When death occurs, families should be encouraged to take whatever time they need to feel what has happened, and say their goodbyes. There is no need to rush the body to a funeral home, and somefamilies want to stay with the body for a period of time after death. Symptom Management in the Last Hours of Life Certain symptoms, some of which are covered elsewhere in this book, are especially common at the very end-of-life. Table 24-4 presents common symptoms and ways to manage them, to make pa-tients more comfortable in their last hours of life. Considering Withdrawal of Nutrition and Hydration In every culture, giving nourishment is seen as an act of caring as well as a method for improving health. As a person approaches death, eating and drinking become more difficult as one must haveadequate strength to chew and to maintain an upright position. The palliative care team must findother ways for the family to offer support and care without forcing a dying person to take in moresubstance than they can handle. As the energy requirements diminish, forcing fluids in particularmay cause more difficulty than withholding liquids might. Excess fluid tends to localize in the pharynx causing a gurgling sound or \"death rattle,\" which can be distressing to families. Fluids also accumulate in the lungs, the abdominal cavity, and the lowerextremities. As the activity level of the patient decreases, this excess fluid will be reabsorbed by thepatient, making oral intake of fluids less crucial.

It recog-nizes that clinical judgement and skill are necessary to determine when interventions regardinghydration and nutrition might be appropriate. The statement reads, in part, as follows: Hydration and nutrition are traditionally considered useful and necessary components of good medical care. They are provided with the primary intention of benefiting the patient. However, when a person is approaching death, the provision of artificial hydration and nutrition is potentially harmful and mayprovide little or no benefit to the patient and at times may make the period ofdying more uncomfortable for both patient and family. For this reason, theAAHPM believes that the withholding of artificial hydration and nutrition nearthe end-of-life may be appropriate and beneficial medical care. 13 Ventilator Withdrawal for Intubated Patients In instances like fatal pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, mechanical ventilation may be withdrawn in order to discontinue futile and invasive medical treatment. (See Chapter 6: PulmonarySymptoms.) These decisions are complex and involve ethical principles of withdrawing life-sustainingtreatments that are well established. 14,15 (See Chapter 17: Ethical Issues.) In particular, it is important that clinicians establish with the family and, if possible, the patient, that the goal of withdrawingTable 24-4: Symptom Management at the End of Life Symptom Management Fatigue and weakness Turn patient from side to side, protecting bony prominences with hydrocolloid dressing to prevent formation of pressure ulcers. Loss of thirst Explain normal dying process; intravenous fluids can actually increase secretions, edema, and discomfort. Dry mouth Moisten oral mucosa with baking soda mouthwash (1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1 quart tepid water) or artificial saliva. Coat lips with petroleum jelly. Pain Watch for delirium or muscular fasciculations related to opioid metabolite accumulation as renal function declines; dosinginterval may need to be decreased just before death. Myoclonic jerks Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam 1-2 mg tablet dissolved in 1 ml water and administered to oral mucosa; may need hourlydosing. Delirium Haloperidol q6 is more sedating; both may need titration. Loss of ability Stop oral intake to prevent aspiration; scopolamine to swallow 1-3 transdermal patches as frequently as needed or glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg sq, will reduce saliva.

Clinicians need to work to develop a consensus among the health care team in order to withdraw ventilatory support; it is seldom an emergency decision, and time should be taken to resolve disagreements and concerns among the team and family. This procedure requires informed consentdiscussions, especially to inform family members that patients may not die immediately afterventilation is withdrawn. A protocol developed by experienced critical care physicians appears in Table 24-5.

Ventilator alarms must be disabled so they are not triggered by terminal hypoventilation. Extubate or leave on Offer the family the possibility of private time with the patient humidified air by T-piece if feasible, or support from any staff members they wish to have present. Rituals devised by the family or performed by clergy may have an important role.

Although 60% of people die ininstitutions in the U.S., most surveys show that most people prefer death in familiar surroundings.Every attempt should be made to allow the person to die where they feel most comfortable. Even ina clinical setting, being able to be with the person who is dying is very comforting to most familymembers. Every attempt should be made to remove unnecessary monitors such as pulse oximetryreaders, intravenous lines, cardiac monitors, and even ventilators when possible; see guidelinesabove for removing ventilatory support. Those in attendance may appreciate a pastoral care provider who can lead them in prayer, or they may want to sing and to wait for the 'spirit' to leave the room. Ritual cleansing, bathing with oils, or other cultural practices should be encouraged. Even after the family has gone and the body has beenremoved, it is advisable to leave a silk or plastic flower on the bed to allow hospital workers theopportunity to say goodbye and to grieve this death before they must go on to the care of anotherpatient. Creating a memorial section in the intensive care unit or a busy ward gives health careworkers permission to gain closure, especially when they are in an area where there are multipledeaths. (See Chapter 20: Care for the Caregiver.) Memorial Rituals The AIDS Quilt is a visible remembrance of the lives of individuals who have died with AIDS and serves as a permanent record of lives lost to HIV/AIDS. The making of each panel is, in itself, aconcrete way for loved ones and family to resolve their own grief. Scrapbooks, video tapes, poetry andother creative efforts can also help those who mourn to express these feelings and to link childrenor other family members who want a tangible means of remembering the deceased. Other traditionsof remembrance include planting a tree, building a shrine, or placing a tomb marker. Syndrome of Multiple Losses Mourning one death is complex and can extend for months or years. (See Chapter 16: Grief and Bereavement.) During the AIDS epidemic, many gay men have suffered the deaths of ten or morefriends, minority mothers may have lost several children, and inner-city dwellers have often lostloved ones to violence and disease. 16 When there are multiple losses to grieve soon after one another, the individual does not have adequate time to complete the usual bereavement tasks. People candevelop a protective response that may cause them to shut down emotionally and to be unable toexperience significant feelings of either a positive or negative nature. 17,18,19 Clinically, this may look like a post-traumatic stress disorder and usually requires professional help for resolution.

Because of the nature of HIV, it can be difficult, if not impossible,to heal open wounds or ulcers once they appear. It is for this reason that clinicians must workclosely with patients and their caregivers in instructing them in principles of skin care. Theclinician should teach symptomatic relief of some of the more common skin problems and alsoaddress basic assessment of skin so that the caregiver can report problems as soon as theyoccur. Vigilant caregivers in the home are the patient's best defense against the long-term com-plications of pressure or decubitus ulcer formation. (See Tables 25-1 and 25-2)While assessing and treating skin disorders is clinically important throughout the course of HIVinfection, the challenges of maintaining skin integrity are greatest for patients with advanceddisease. Prevention and treatment of late-stage dermatologic complications is a critical aspectof comprehensive palliative care for patients with HIV disease, and can also be an importantmeans of involvement and empowerment for family caregivers in the care of their loved oneswith AIDS. Because there are many dermatologic conditions associated with HIV it is essential that the patient have a thorough medical evaluation for diagnosis and treatment of these skin problemsonce they occur (see Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems). Equally important is the nursing as-sessment of the individual to determine not only the presence of any open areas but to deter-mine the patient's risk for skin breakdown at any time during the continuum of the illness.Jean Tuthill RN, MSN, CWOCN of Skin BreakdownChapter 25.

DETERMINING RISK OF BREAKDOWN To determine risk of skin breakdown, a thorough nursing history should be obtained that includes a history of any dermatologic conditions. A validated, reliable risk assessment toolshould be used to determine risk of breakdown based on mobility, nutrition, sensory perception,degree to which skin is exposed to moisture (incontinence, diaphoresis), and external forcessuch as shear and friction in the bedbound individual. Visual inspection of the skin is critical to determine presence of lesions, ulcers, or rashes. Dry, flaky, and/or itchy skin should also be noted. Full-body skin checks should be an integral part of the initial exam and should be continued on a regular basis for all individuals who are deemed to be at risk, however minimal.

In dark-skinned individuals this may present as discoloration of the skin, warmth, edema, induration or hardness. The skin is always intact with a stage I pressure ulcer. Stage II Partial-thickness skin loss involving epidermis, dermis, or both. The ulcer is superficial with a pale pink wound bed and serous (never serosanguinous) drainage. May present as an abrasion or blister. Stage III Full-thickness skin loss involving damage to or necrosis of subcutaneous tissue. Wound bed is beefy pink but may have some necrotic tissue. There may beundermining of peri-wound skin or tunneling. Drainage may be serosanguinous. Underlying support structures are not visible. Stage IV Full-thickness tissue loss with extensive destruction, tissue necrosis or damage to muscle, bone or supporting structures. Support structures are visible (tendon, joint capsule, bone, fascia, muscle). Pressure ulcers must be staged accurately for documentation, reimbursement, and standard of care issues. Pressure ulcers are never downstaged: a stage IV ulcer does not become a stage II, stage II does not become a stage I, etc. as it heals. It would be classified as a granulating stage IV orepithelializing stage IV or finally a healed stage IV. Pressure ulcers cannot be accurately staged until the deepest viable tissue layer is visible. Ulcers covered with eschar or necrotic tissue cannot be staged until they are debrided. They can be documented as \"full-thickness pressure ulcer unable to stage secondary to the presence of necrotic tissue.\"ment should be done at regular intervals and any time a change in condition warrants (e.g., acute episodes requiring hospitalization, a period of immobility no matter how brief, a change in medication with new onset of side effects, etc.). PRURITIS Perhaps the most common manifestation of HIV-related skin disorders is that of dry and itchy skin. A host of dermatologic as well as systemic illnesses contribute to this condition, and it isessential that these skin disorders be evaluated and diagnosed by appropriate medical person-nel. Table 25-2 provides a list of nursing measures that can provide symptomatic relief once theappropriate medical regimen has been instituted. PRESSURE ULCERS One of the most common, yet often overlooked threats to skin integrity in the chronically ill or immunocompromised patient is that of pressure ulcer or decubitus ulcer development. Pres-sure ulcers are commonly seen as long-term complications of completely immobile patients;however, these ulcers can occur in relatively short periods of time in individuals who are acutely ill. See Color Plates 25-1 through 25-5 for the four stages of pressure ulcers. The definitions ofpressure ulcer staging can be found in Table 25-3. Several tools are available to health care practitioners that are reliable and easy to use. Thetools, referred to as the Braden scale or the Norton scale, measure functional and cognitivestatus and assign a score that correlates with risk for breakdown. 2 A sample of the Braden scale can be seen in Table 25-4 with a sample decision tree in Figure 25-1. Guidelines for caregiverteaching on skin care can be found in Table 25-1.

Excellent: Eats most of every meal. Never refuses a meal. Usually eats a total of 4 or more servings ofmeat and dairy products. Occasionally eats between meals. Does not requiresupplementation.2. Probably inadequate: Rarely eats a complete meal and generally eats only about \u00bd of any food offered. Protein intake includes only 3 servings of meator dairy products per day. Occa- sionally will take a dietary supplement OR receives lessthan optimum amount of liquid diet or tube feeding. 2. Potential problem: Moves feebly or requires minimum assistance. During a move skin probably slides tosome extent against sheets, chair, restraints, or other devices. Maintains relativelygood position in chair or bed most of the time, but occasionally slides down.3. Adequate: Eats over half of most meals.Eats a total of 4 servings ofprotein (meat, dairy products) each day. Occasionally will refuse a meal, but will usuallytake a supplement if offered OR is on a tube feeding or TPN regimen which probably meetsmost of nutritional needs. 3. No apparent problem: Moves in bed and in chairindependently and has sufficient muscle strength to lift up completely during move.Maintains good position in bed or chair at all times.1. Very poor: Never eats a complete meal. Rarely eats more than 1/3 of any food offered. Eats 2servings or less of protein (meat or dairy products) per day. Takes fluids poorly. Doesnot take a liquid dietary supplement OR is NPO and/or maintained on clear liquids orIV's for more than 5 days. 1. Problem: Requires moderate to maximum assistance inmoving. Complete lifting without sliding against sheets is impossible. Frequentlyslides down in bed or chair, requiring frequent repositioning with maximumassistance. Spasticity, contractures or agitation lead to almost constant friction.Nutrition Usual food intakepattern Friction and Shear Note: Patients with a total score of 16 or less are considered to be at risk of developing pressure ulcers.

That is, ulcers may be assigned a diagnosis of pressure ulcers when infact pressure may not be the root cause. One commonly misdiagnosed condition is herpes simplex ulcer infections, especially perianal herpes. Because of their location these ulcers can be mistaken for stage II or III pressure ulcers.Although continued unrelieved pressure to the lesions will certainly lead to wound deteriora-tion regardless of etiology, treatment of herpes must include pharmaceutical management. Be-cause medication is critical to healing it is of paramount importance to quickly recognize and treat herpes. (See Chapter 9: Dermatologic Problems.) To distinguish perianal herpes from pressure ulcers, clinicians should remember that with herpes, there is generally more than onelesion and these lesions are usually distributed bilaterally. Also, herpes ulcers are more painfulthan pressure ulcers of similar depth, and aggressive pain management is often required. (SeeChapter 4: Pain.) Finally, herpes ulcers will not respond to conventional treatment for pressureulcers. CONCLUSION Skin care for people with HIV is a critical component of palliative care. Because of the many factors contributing to these sometimes debilitating skin disorders it is essential to approachskin care as a team. Physicians, nurses, patients, and caregivers must all work together to pro-vide medical management as well as symptomatic relief.

It is estimated that at any point, up to 50% of patients in palliative care may still berecipients of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) which often comprises protease in-hibitors (PIs) along with other antiretroviral agents, namely the nucleoside reverse transcriptaseinhibitors (NRTIs, or nukes) and the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs,or non-nukes). All protease inhibitors as well as NNRTIs are metabolizedby the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes and are therefore expected to be involved in a largenumber and variety of drug-drug interactions.As providers attempt to palliate advancing HIV disease, they may need to administer to pa-tients\u2014along with antiretroviral agents\u2014medications for pain; insomnia; anorexia/weight loss;fatigue/weakness; of other symptoms. All of these medications may need to be administered in the presence ofother co-morbid conditions such as and HIV-associated nephropathies; andthe opportunistic infections that are the hallmark of advanced HIV disease. It is therefore nei-ther surprising that drug-drug as well as drug-disease interactions become paramount consider-ations as patients advance into palliative care, nor that optimizing therapy in these situationscan become exceedingly complex and overwhelming.Providers who care for people with HIV/AIDS must constantly keep abreast of new develop-ments in antiretroviral drug treatment. The HIV/AIDS treatment guidelines are frequently up-dated and the most current guidelines can be found at the AIDS info website, funded by theDepartment of Health and Human Services, at: www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/Chapter 27.

The chapter also highlights the clinical significance of these interactions and offers strategies to avoid or circumvent many of them.

Pharmacologi-cally, there are two broad classes of drug interactions: \u007f Pharmacokinetic interactions \u007f Pharmacodynamic interactions Interactions are described as pharmacokinetic when the action of one drug alters the serum concentration of another drug by altering any of the following processes: drug Liberation, Ab- sorption , Distribution , Metabolism and Excretion (the LADME system). Pharmacokinetics is the study of the processes of drug action through these various processes.

For instance, any circumstance that alters gastric pH can affect the absorption of many drugs. This is particularly important for patients receiving palliative care, many of whom may have hypochlorhydria which is common in advanced HIV disease and can lead to suboptimal absorp-tion of independent of gastricpH, it is often the azole of choice when an azole antifungal is indicated for the treatment ofseveral opportunistic infections. Pharmacodynamic interactions are those interactions that may alter the overall clinical re- sponse expected from use of the drugs, by altering the efficacy and often toxicity of the drugs. The interaction could be synergistic and mostly positive (e.g., the positive antiretroviral re- sponse seen when zidovudine is combined with lamivudine). Conversely, it can be antagonisticand mostly negative (e.g., the additive bone marrow suppression caused by combining zidovudineand ganciclovir; nephrotoxicity caused by combining cidofovir combined with didanosine (Videx,Videx-EC). DRUG-DISEASE INTERACTIONS Drug interactions can arise as a result of changes due to HIV disease itself. As persons with HIV disease advance in their illness, oral absorption of foods and drugs is often compromiseddue to changes in gastric pH that accompany HIV enteropathy, a syndrome that describes theeffect of advanced HIV disease on the gastrointestinal (GI) system. Diarrhea tends to be com-mon in HIV disease and may result from a variety of causes: GI disturbance following side effectsof several of the most commonly used antiretroviral agents; presence of concurrent opportunis-tic organisms; and bacterial, protozoal and viral infections that tend to be more common as thedisease advances and the immune system weakens. The occurrence of diarrhea\u2014especially iffrequent and poorly controlled, as in patients with cryptosporidiosis\u2014can jeopardize absorp-tion of all drugs because of the decreased transit time and may cause drug regimens to be lessefficacious. This will lead subsequently to less than optimal clinical outcomes, and in some instance may predispose the patient to subtherapeutic drug levels that may herald the emer- gence of resistant strains of the virus in patients still taking antiretroviral agents. People with HIV in palliative care are more likely to be susceptible to adverse events than people in the early stages of HIV disease. For example, patients in palliative care are more likely to haveallergic reactions to sulfonamides and other drugs. Another physiological component of advanc-ing HIV disease is malabsorption, which is the hallmark of enteropathy and predisposes thepatient to changes in body weight that often reflect changes in the volume as well as distribu-tion of both fat and muscle tissue. This in turn may affect the efficacy of drugs with dose-related efficacy, for example, the agents used in the treatment of tuberculosis and mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Also frequently reported at this stage of illness are decreases in serum albumin, which in turn may alter the efficacy of drugs such as phenytoin when used in themanagement of patients with toxoplasmosis or sulfamethoxazole when used both as treatmentand in the prophylaxis of patients with pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Other changes also occur in drug metabolism with advancing disease. These include changes due to HIV-related biliary disease or to hepatitis\u2014frequently a concomitant infection in thispopulation, especially patients who were injection drug users (IDUs). These conditions may Chpt 27 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 551U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 552A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 27: Pharmacologic Interactions of Clinical Significance make it necessary to adjust both the doses and the dosing intervals of drugs that are mostly metabolized through the liver, such as rifampin, isoniazid and ketoconazole, and to be selective in the choice of such medications. Changes in the renal elimination of drugs also occur with advancing disease and can be especially important for renally cleared antiretrovirals such aszidovudine, lamivudine, antifungal agents such as amphotericin B, and antibacterial agents such as theaminoglycosides. Changes in immune status that may affect drug responses to antimycobacterial medications (such as the tuberculostatics) or management of opportunistic infections such as MAC havefrequently been reported in patients with advanced disease. As a general rule, there is an in- creased incidence of drug toxicity as well as drug sensitivity in patients with HIV\u2014for example, with use of the neuroleptics (chlorpromazine and prochlorperazine)\u2014 which may necessitate adecrease from usually recommended doses in order to avoid toxicity. Signs of Drug-Drug Interaction in a Patient with HIV Disease As a general rule, patients experiencing exaggerated toxicities on usual doses of medications or manifesting treatment failure in the absence of factors such as resistance or poor adherence/compliance may be suffering from an unidentified drug-drug interaction. A careful review of the patient's medication profile is necessary in order to monitor for such drug interactions. Clini- cians should become familiar with the agents most often associated with significant drug-druginteractions and with the measures to circumvent these interactions when necessary. Regimens with enzyme inducers such as rifampin or enzyme inhibitors such as ritonavir should be noted and checked against a list of other agents metabolized by those same enzyme pathways(see Table 27-14, Advice to Patients: Red Flag Medications, at the end of this chapter). Fortu-nately, the majority of drug-drug interactions are minor in nature and do not require extensivechanges to the patient's drug regimen. However, the minority of drug interactions that can beclinically important can offset treatment goals and outcomes in patients if unrecognized orunaddressed, leading to patients receiving suboptimal levels of various drugs and so to treat- ments failing, often due to emergence of drug-resistant strains of the virus. Drug-Food Interactions of Clinical Significance It is well established that the presence or absence of food or certain beverages can signifi- cantly affect the bioavailability of a number of medications. A variety of mechanisms includingchanges in pH, formation of unabsorbable cation complexes, increased solubility of drugs andinterference with gut metabolism as well as a decrease in the motility of the gut may be at play. Table 27-1 lists some of the more common food-drug interactions with antiretroviral agents. 1 Chpt 27 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 55226 picas U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 553A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 27: Significance XXVIIInteractions Involving Azole Antifungals, Didanosine and Other Drugs Interactions of significance with azole antifungals, didanosine and other drugs used to allevi- ate HIV-related disorders are presented in this section, along with strategies to circumvent theinteractions. For more detailed guidance, consult the most recent package inserts of ketoconazoleand the various drugs. Ketaconazole (Nizoral) and itraconazole (Sporonox) with gastric acid-reducing agents: In- crease in gastric pH (due to agents such as antacids, H 2 antagonists, proton-pump inhibitors and non-enteric-coated formulations of didanosine) impairs absorption of ketoconazole, whose ab-sorption is optimal when gastric pH is low. When prescribed together, didanosine and ketoconazole must be taken two hours apart or an alternative antifungal agent should be used. 2Table 27-1: Effects of Food on Antiretroviral Agents Antiretroviral agents Zidovudine (AZT, Retrovir) that can Lamivudine (3TC, Epivir) be taken (hard gel capsule) taken with ritonavir.

Antiretroviral agents Didanosine (ddI, Videx) Take on an empty whose blood levels stomach a half hour are decreased by food before or two hours after a meal. Levels decrease by 55% when taken with food. Indinavir (Crixivan) Levels decrease 77% with food. Take 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals; may take with skim milk or a low fat meal.

When hypochlorhydria is severe, each 200 mg of ketoconazole should be dis-solved in 4 ml of 0.2N hydrochloric acid. A straw should be used to avoid contact with teeth. PIs and NNRTIs with azoles: As a general rule, use of ketoconazole with PIs and NNRTIs is not advised due to a large number of potentially significant drug-drug interactions. Fluconazole(Diflucan) is preferred. (See Tables 27-2 and 27-3.) \u007fIndinavir : Levels are increased 68%; reduce indinavir dose to 600 mg q 8 h; SQV levels increasedthree-fold, no dose change required. \u007fRitonavir : Levels are increased more than three-fold; use less than 200 mg ketoconazole/day. \u007fAmprenavir : Levels are increased 31% and ketoconazole levels increased 44%; dose implications notclear. \u007fNelfinavir : No dosage change. \u007fNevirapine : Levels are increased 15% to 30% and ketoconazole levels decreased by 60%; combinationis not recommended. \u007fEfavirenz : Interactions between ketoconazole and efavirenz have not been studied; no recommen- dations can be made at present. Ketoconazole and other drugs : Rifampin decreases activity of both drugs; INH decreases effect of ketoconazole; terfenadine and cisapride (both now removed from the market) lead to ven-tricular arrhythmias and concurrent use should be avoided. Didanosine : Didanosine buffered formulations usually cause problems of absorption for medi- cations whose absorption are pH-sensitive. Didanosine can decrease absorption of itraconazole,ketoconazole, dapsone and delavirdine (Rescriptor) because of increased gastric pH. It can alsodecrease absorption of the quinolones and tetracyclines by chelation of these antibiotics withthe calcium and magnesium ions contained in the buffer. Oral fluoroquinolones : With oral fluoroquinolones, patients should avoid dairy products, el- emental minerals and heavy nutritional supplements; take fluoroquinolones two hours before or six hours after these items.

These eight enzymes aredesignated they are somehow related and share many general features, each is unique in the sub-strates for which it is specific and so metabolizes only specific drugs and substances. 3 The P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism are found not only in the liver, but also in the kidneys,lungs, brain, small intestine and placenta. Enzymes of the CYP450 system are responsible for the oxidative metabolism of a large and var- ied number of compounds including, most importantly, the antiretroviral agents (PIs and NNRTIs),several drugs used in the management of opportunistic infections in advancing HIV disease,many of the newer serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other psychotropic agents,endogenous substances such as steroids and prostaglandins, environmental toxins, and dietarycomponents. The primary role of the isoenzymes in drug metabolism is to make the drugs morewater-soluble and less fat-soluble, so that biliary excretion will take place. As a result of this,actions of these enzymes can affect the amount of active drug in the body at any given time. Suchchanges can be positive, enhancing efficacy, or negative, enhancing toxicity and adverse events. 4 Role of the Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) CYP3A is both the most abundant and clinically significant family of cytochrome P450 en- zymes. The CYP3A consists of three major enzymes, CYP3A4 being the one most commonly asso-ciated with drug interactions. The most notable grapefruit others. Ritonavir (Norvir) is the most potent inhibitor of the CYP3A4 system when compared to all the other PIs and indeed to all other drugs, generally. Indinavir and nelfinavir exhibit the same levelof inhibition while saquinavir and amprenavir appear to be the least likely to inhibit CYP3A4.Among the NNRTIs, delavirdine is a potent irreversible inhibitor of this enzyme and is presentlythe only drug that has been shown to affect levels of ritonavir, increasing its Area Under theCurve (AUC) by 60% in patients maintained on a regimen of ritonavir 600 mg twice daily. 5 Recent studies have shown that both ritonavir and nelfinavir can act as inducers as well asinhibitors. Though this feature is not completely understood, affinity studies show that thesetwo compounds bind with such high affinity that it becomes impossible for other agents to attachto the enzyme; hence inhibiting access to the enzymes while inducing their own metabolism. Drug Interactions with Ritonavir and Other Substrates of the CYP3A4 System In relation to CYP3A4, there are a number of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with which providers must become conversant. For the past several years, ritonavir (Norvir), the powerful inhibitor of enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, has been used to boost levelsof Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 556A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 27: Pharmacologic Interactions of Clinical Significance More recently, another PI, lopinavir, was added to this list of boosted PIs. Ritonavir and lopinavir were combined together into a powerful boosted PI combination (Kaletra) that takes advantage of ritonavir's inhibition of the CYP3A enzyme system to increase levels of lopinavir up to ten times its normal AUC. This combination can eradicate with a ten-fold increase in potency, forthe most part overcoming PI resistance in heavily experienced patients. Results from the fewstudies so far completed indicate that the profile of drug-drug interactions and drugs that shouldbe avoided for ritonavir are mostly the same for the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir(Kaletra). 1 There have been reports of excessive drops in blood pressure following introduction of ritonavirinto the therapy of a hypertensive subject stabilized on a calcium channel blocker such asverapamil. Other drugs to watch out for include the proarrhythmic agents that undergo exten-sive first-pass metabolism such and cisapride. Others include theHMG-C0A reductase inhibitors\u2014drugs that are frequently prescribed for patients on antiretroviral therapy who develop lipid abnormalities\u2014as well as triazolam and midazolam, often used to alleviate anxiety or to treat insomnia. Drug-Drug Interactions between Psychotropics and Antiretroviral Agents Several of the medications used to treat mood and anxiety disorders are substrates of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and as such are prone to interact with protease inhibitors andother drugs used for the treatment of opportunistic infections or the several degenerating neu- rological disorders that may accompany advancing HIV disease. Some of these psychotropic medications may be either substrates, inducers or inhibitors of this same system. For patientsreceiving these medications concomitantly, the need for awareness and closer monitoring re-garding drug-drug as well as drug-disease interactions of significance has been heightened. Re-cently, these concerns, though not limited to people with HIV, have been exacerbated by thereports of sudden cardiac deaths due to unexpected ventricular arrhythmias ( torsades des pointes ) in patients on some antipsychotic medications, who were concomitantly receiving some of the newer antihistamines (terfenadine, astemizole), some of The purpose of this section of the discussion is to clarify some of theissues associated with drug-drug interactions of clinical significance between the antiretroviralagents and drugs used in psychiatry. Specific Interactions between Some Antidepressants, Antipsychotics and Antiretroviral Agents Why do interactions occur among some antidepressants, antipsychotic agents and antiretroviral agents? Clinicians prescribing drugs for patients with HIV must be aware of the important po-tential for interactions that exists between some of the PIs (especially ritonavir) and non-nucleo-side antiretroviral agents (especially efavirenz) and psychotropic drugs. degrees of inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system responsible for most of theoxidative metabolism that occurs in the liver.

Patients on PIs who are re- ceiving tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) should have their dosages reduced by 50% to 66% ini- tially, with close monitoring of blood levels to establish a safe and effective dose.6 Chpt 27 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 557U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 558A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 27: Pharmacologic Interactions of As a class, the SSRIs have varying inhibitory effects on CYP450 isoenzymes, with far-reaching implications. Most of the research is still ongoing and interactions reported between an indi-vidual SSRI and the P450 system may differ from one source to the other. Fluoxetine (Prozac,Serafem) and its metabolite appear while paroxetine inhibitsCYP2D6. Fluvoxamine (Luvox) inhibits all of the major isoenzymes and possibly also CYP2C9; asa result of this, it appears to have the greatest propensity for drug-drug interactions theoreti-cally and most probably clinically, as well. Despite its potent inhibition of the cytochrome P450CYP2D6 isoenzyme, paroxetine (Paxil) may be regarded as the least problematic with regard tointeraction potential from a clinical standpoint in comparison to fluoxetine (Prozac) orfluvoxamine (Luvox). 7 The SSRIs have a wide therapeutic window, without the danger of overdosing that exists withthe TCAs. Nonetheless, as a general rule with the SSRIs and TCAs, doses are started low andbuilt up gradually; initial doses should be decreased 50% to 66% and then increased graduallyuntil the desired response is obtained. 8 SSRIs and nefazodone have been reported to increase serum levels of protease inhibitors, par-ticularly through inhibition of CYP3A4; the clinical significance of this interaction needs furtherclarification. Before starting ritonavir, doses of most neuroleptics should be decreased and such patients monitored closely; this is in anticipation of ritonavir-induced CYP inhibition that may increase levels of such neuroleptics. The other protease inhibitors\u2014indinavir, nelfinavir,saquinavir and nevirapine and delavirdine\u2014havemuch fewer effects on isoenzymes. triazolam 1 All SSRIs can cause additive serotonergic effects 10:21 AM 55826 picas U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 559A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 27: Pharmacologic SSRIs coadministered with opiate drugs such as codeine and hydrocodone results in lack of conversion to active form and a significant decrease in narcotic efficacy, and should be avoided.4 As a general rule, two underlying mechanisms cause clinically significant drug interactions among these groups. One involves the alteration of the hepatic metabolism of some psychotropic agents,leading to an increase or decrease of their therapeutic effect or causing an increase in theiradverse effects. The other involves psychotropic agents that increase the adverse effects or limitthe efficacy of protease inhibitors. Most of the currently available, newer antidepressant agentsare substrates for cytochrome P450 enzyme system isoenzymes. Substrates can simply be described as substances that are amenable to the action of enzymes in this cytochrome P450 enzyme system of the liver. A drug or chemical substance can have any oneof three relationships to the CYP450 enzyme system; it can be a substrate, an inducer, or aninhibitor. Inhibitors of the CYP system are medications or chemical substances, including herbalremedies, which may cause a decrease in the volume of enzymes produced by this system reduc-ing the metabolism of such drugs and thereby increasing their levels. This is the basis for the use of ritonavir as a PI enhancer in dual protease regimens. The SSRIs, for instance, and nefazodone are inhibitors of many CYP450 isoenzymes. When such agents areadministered concomitantly with other agents\u2014such as the PIs, the NNRTIs, or othernonantiretroviral agents which may also be substrates, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes\u2014drug accumulation can occur, leading to potentially dangerous and sometimes unpredictabletoxicities. Inhibitors of the CYP450 enzymes such as the azole antifungals, namely ketoconazole,itraconazole and to a much lesser extent fluconazole (hence making it the most desirable in HIVdisease) and erythromycin will cause a decrease in the clearance of such drugs as citalopram(Celexa), terfenadine, midazolam (Versed), and triazolam (Halcion) (specifically mentioned inthe February 2001 DHHS Guidelines for Treatment of HIV in Adults and Adolescents), leading tocardiac arrhythmias and sudden and unexplained deaths.

Interactions between HAART Drugs and Other Drugs Used by Patients with Advancing HIV Disease Clinicians should become familiar with these interactions of clinical significance between antiretroviral drugs and ancillary drugs needed to manage the many complications of advancingHIV disease. Providers should avoid drug combinations likely to result in potentially seriousinteractions. Table 27-5 provides a detailed list of the drug interaction studies in the presence of ritonavir, the most potent CYP-modifying protease inhibitor, while Tables 27-6a and 27-6b offer clinical monitoring highlights and counseling tips for patients using drugs that may prolong theQTC interval. Drug Interactions Involving Amprenavir (Agenerase) and Vitamin E One capsule of amprenavir (Agenerase) contains 109 international units (IUs) of vitamin E. The daily dose of eight capsules of amprenavir, taken twice daily which adds up to 1,200 IUs, hasbeen established as the minimum toxic dose (MTD); this is the smallest dose that has beenfound to be harmful when taken over a period of time. The manufacturer, Glaxo-Wellcome, notesin the package insert that people taking amprenavir should not take any extra vitamin E. High doses of vitamin E can create problems because vitamin E is a blood thinner and so can cause problems with other blood thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin), vitamin K or clotting factors.One woman on long-term warfarin experienced intracranial bleeding less than a week afterstarting amprenavir. People taking low-dose aspirin daily to prevent heart attacks as well aspeople on herbal blood thinners like ginger, garlic, feverfew, ginseng and ginkgo biloba shouldalso be careful with the extra vitamin E in amprenavir. Symptoms of vitamin E toxicity (which isordinarily rare) include spontaneous nosebleeds, cuts that will not stop bleeding and bruisesacquired easily. 9 Chpt 27 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 561U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 562A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 27: Pharmacologic Interactions of Clinical Significance Table 27-7: HIV-related Drugs with Overlapping Toxicities* Drugs that cause Cidofovir that cause nephrotoxicity Adefovir removed from that of Concomitant Medications on QTC Prolongation Torsades des pointes is a serious form of cardiac arrhythmias which has been associated with reports of sudden death within the last several years.

It should be noted that ritonavir is both an inducer and inhibitor of the CYP system; it is pres- ently one of the most potent inhibitors known; it also induces CYP1A2, the enzyme system re-sponsible for the metabolism of theophylline and caffeine. which means that they will in-duce enzymes that hasten their own metabolism as well. As a result of this, manufacturers ofthese agents suggest that treatment be initiated with doses that are slowly escalated within thefirst two weeks of treatment (always consult the manufacturers' most recent package inserts for additional information, updated drug-drug interactions listings and other drug information). Selected Enzyme Inhibitors of the CYP System Table 27-3 lists agents that are inhibitors of the CYP system, which are discussed here in greater detail. As a potent inhibitor of CYP3A both in vitro and in vivo , ritonavir significantly increases the area under the curve (or, serum concentrations) of drugs that are eliminated primarily through this enzyme system, especially the other protease inhibitors such as saquinavir, indinavir,amprenavir and lopinavir. These increases range from 77% to twenty-fold in humans and consti-tute the basis for the boosted PI regimens that have been shown to increase plasma levels and inmany instances are able to improve efficacy of salvage regimens in advancing disease. Administering reduced dosages of both PIs reduces pill burden and improves tolerability, while food and hydration requirements as well as the incidence of crystalluria due to indinavir aresignificantly reduced. By the same mechanism, enzyme inhibition causes levels of drugs such as clarithromycin, ketoconazole and rifabutin to be greatly increased, leading to unexpected tox- icities and adverse events; concomitant administration of these agents should therefore beavoided. Other Ritonavir Drug-Drug Interactions of Clinical Significance Since ritonavir is also an inducer of several other metabolizing enzymes such as CYP1A4, glucoronyl transferase and CYP2C19, the magnitude of ritonavir interac- tions is difficult to predict especially for drugs metabolized by multiple enzyme systems or drugs that have a low intrinsic clearance by CYP3A, such as methadone. Enzyme induction, first rec-ognized in the 1940s, occurs when hepatic blood flow is increased or the synthesis of moreCYP450 enzymes is stimulated. In early animal models of enzyme induction, phenobarbital wasfound to increase liver weight in a dose-dependent manner. Liver biopsies in human patientstaking anticonvulsants on a chronic basis showed up to a 52% increase in liver size. Enzymeinduction is influenced by age and liver disease. As a general rule, subjects older than 60 yearsof age tend to have decreased capacity for enzyme induction, as shown by reports of differentialinduction of drug metabolism in such elderly, compared to younger subjects, following exposureto polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke. 3 Chpt 27 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 565U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 566A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 27: Pharmacologic Interactions of Clinical Significance OTHER DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug Interactions with Herbal Products Use of herbal remedies, multiple vitamins, and mineral and dietary supplements is extremely common among all patient populations surveyed. In one U.S. survey of adults who regularly takeprescription medications, 18.4% reported concurrent use of at least one herbal product or highdose vitamin. In another study, 61.5% of patients who used conventional therapies did not dis-close use of other remedies to their health care provider. 11 Anecdotal experience from questions asked of people with HIV at our busy outpatient clinicsuggests that the use of such remedies is reasonably high among this population, particularly aspatients advance in their illness and shift into palliative care. In a survey of 515 users of herbalremedies in the U.K., 26% of patients would consult their general practitioner for a serious adverse reaction associated with a conventional over-the-counter medicine, but not for a similar reaction from an herbal remedy. It seems that most patients still do not quite regard herbalremedies as medications. Another reason patients may not disclose their use of herbal remedies, even if the remedies cause severe adverse effects, is that patients are afraid of censure. 12 Health providers must there- fore ask patients about their use of herbs in a relaxed manner that is nonjudgmental; it has beenshown in several studies that disapproval will ensure that patients conceal any such use in thefuture. Such patients should be involved in a partnership in which providers share whatever information is available about the herbal product, including the lack of information on drug interactions and the need for open communication on both sides about the use of all such rem-edies. All such formulations, the reasons for their use, dosages, brand and manufacturer shouldbe documented in patient charts and updated from time to time. Interactions with St. John's Wort This commonly used, over-the-counter antidepressant herbal product induces cytochrome P450 3A enzymes and as a result has been shown in several studies to decrease significantly levels of all of the protease inhibitors and, most probably also, the NNRTIs currently available inthe market. In one study, indinavir trough levels decreased 81% when concomitantly given withSt. John's wort. 13 The DHHS guidelines of February 2002 recommend that St. John's wort not be taken by patients on PI antiretroviral medications.1 An increased risk of serotonin syndrome has also been reported in patients who mix St. John'swort with been made of decreased serum concentrations of drugs such as digoxin, theo-phylline, cyclosporine and phenprocoumon when combined with St. John's wort. 11 At the present time, many reports of herb-drug interactions are sketchy and lack proper pharmacokineticstudies to substantiate them; nonetheless, health care providers should counsel patients on theneed always to form a partnership in the use of these remedies and if possible to avoid unneces-sary herbal and unproven remedies that can lead to undesirable interactions.

In a comprehensive in-hospital drugsurveillance program comparing 2274 nonsmokers, light smokers and heavy smokers receivingbenzodiazepines, smokers generally required larger doses of benzodiazepines to achieve a seda-tive and/or anxiolytic effect. 15 Rifampin is one of the most powerful inducers of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and canimpair the efficacy of some benzodiazepines based on this activity. When co-administered withrifampin to ten healthy volunteers in a double-blind cross-over study, the AUC of midazolam wasdecreased 96% while the hypnotic effects were nonexistent in all ten subjects. Similar studies with triazolam and rifampin gave similar results, with markedly decreased effects of triazolam in the presence of rifampin based on standardized psychomotor tests. It is also well known that rifampin, like benzodiazepines, increases the rate of metabolism of many opioids and may induce withdrawal symptoms in patients. 16 Drug Interactions of Clinical Significance Involving Warfarin The anticoagulant effects of warfarin, as measured by increases in prothrombin time, have been reported to be increased two-fold by the presence of fluconazole (Diflucan) and three-foldby ketoconazole (Nizoral). Clearances of both isomers of warfarin were reduced even by doses offluconazole as low as 100mg/day for seven days. 17 Numerous other reports tend to substantiate the effects of erythromycin in enhancing thehypoprothrombinemic effects of warfarin when given in combination. Two-fold increases inprothrombin time were reported after seven days but there have been few reports of bleedingcomplications.The clinical relevance of this interaction depends on a number of factors such as age of patient, concurrent drug therapy, rate of clearance of warfarin and ability to transfer drug metabolism to other non-inhibited pathways. This interaction has not been observed withazithromycin; as with erythromycin, caution is advised with clarithromycin therapy in this setting. Omeprazole, another drug commonly used by patients for palliative care, has been shown to inhibit the metabolism for warfarin, an interaction that is most likely mediated by CYP3A4. Thisinteraction is usually observed after several days of taking omeprazole, is dose-related, and maynot necessarily abate upon discontinuation of the agent. Lansoprazole (Prevacid) appears notto have this interaction and offers a comparable alternative treatment. 18 As a general rule, patients with clotting disorders, those awaiting surgical procedures, and thoseon anticoagulant therapy should be cautioned against the use of herbs such as garlic, papaya,ginseng 11 Where patients insist on continuing with these medications along with their herbal remedies, their bleeding times shouldbe more closely monitored. Since most of these herbs interfere with platelet aggregation, notthe coagulation cascade, they will neither affect prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin (PTT)nor the international normalized ration (INR). It is also worthy to note that since many herbal substances contain anticoagulant substances, patients on warfarin should as a precautionary measure, have their INRs measured within seven days of starting any herbal remedy.

Clinically significantdrug interactions occur with the statins when these agents, all of which are substrates to theCYP450 enzyme system and so are amenable to the action of these enzymes, are combined withother drugs that cause muscle damage or drugs that interact to give rise to increased statinplasma levels resulting from inhibition of statin metabolism. Numerous interactions between statins metabolized by CYP3A and several CYP3A inhibitors, including the protease inhibitors, the azole antifungals, grapefruit juice, and kaolin/pectin (es- pecially lovastatin) have been reported. 4 DHHS guidelines specifically suggest avoiding combi- nations of protease inhibitors with fluvastatin(Lescol) and atorvastatin (Lipitor) as alternatives that must be used with caution. 1 Fibrates such as gemfibrizol may cause myopathy when used alone and also in combination with most ofthe statins, with the exception of fluvastatin (Lescol). An increased incidence of myopathy hasbeen reported when niacin is combined with lovastatin but not with fluvastatin, pravastatin orsimvastatin. 19 Despite the increased risk of adverse events, providers are sometimes compelled to continuestatin therapy in order to ward off serious cardiovascular sequalae. In such circumstances, pa-tients should be counseled to report immediately any signs or symptoms of myopathy such asmuscle pain, calf tenderness or muscle weakness. Significant Interactions: Estrogens and cytochrome P450 enzyme system, hence remain susceptible to the action of these enzymes and can be changed or metabolized by them or by substances that act as inducers or inhibitors on CYP450 enzymes. Protease inhibitors suchas nelfinavir or ritonavir, which can act both as inducers and inhibitors of the CYP450 enzymesystem, have been shown to increase the degradation of ethinyl estradiol, a major component oforal contraceptive pills. 20 Women with HIV taking these PIs should receive additional or alterna- tive contraceptive methods in order to ensure full protection. As a result of the recent decreases in the estrogen and progestin concentrations of oral contra- ceptives, reports of unintended pregnancies and episodes of breakthrough bleeding seem to beon the rise. 16 Reports of clinically significant drug interactions secondary to enzyme for gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate and valproate. When such interactions are suspected, a higher dose oral contraceptive containing 50 mg ethinyl estradiol, medroxyprogesterone or a non-hormonal alternative method of contra-ception is usually recommended. Corticosteroids, which often remain the mainstay of management of diseases that occur in pal- liative care of advanced HIV infection, have their clearances increased in a similar fashion tothe estrogens by the same agents, when administered concomitantly. Patients receiving ste-roids for chronic diseases should be monitored for exacerbation of symptoms in these situationsand the necessary dosage adjustments made. 24 Chpt 27 1-17-03.p65 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 56826 picas U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 569A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 27: Pharmacologic Interactions of Clinical Significance XXVIIDRUG INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ILLICIT DRUGS AND ANTIRETROVIRAL AGENTS Interactions between drugs of abuse and other treatment modalities that may be offered in palliative care, including antiretroviral agents, occur against a background of related eventsand conditions that vary by individual patient. Though patients differ, most patients with long-standing substance use will suffer from comorbid conditions that will significantly affect theirresponse to the therapies offered to them at all stages of their HIV disease. It is well establishedthat the abuse of psychoactive substances not only causes a significant number of accidents, butoften is associated with other medical problems and comorbid conditions as shown in Table 27-9. 25 For example, excessive alcohol intake places a patient at risk for various adverse events and conditions including peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis, cirrhosis, malignancies and psy-chiatric disorders. Any of these events and conditions can exacerbate the occurrence as well asthe severity of drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, especially as HIV disease advances and patients begin to receive palliative care.

Most Commonly Used Illicit Substances and Their Interaction with Antiretroviral Agents Recent reports in the literature have brought more attention to the life-threatening interac- tions, including deaths, that occurred when protease inhibitors were combined with illicit drugssuch as ecstasy (MDMA) and GHB (gamma hydroxy butyrate). 26 Although PIs have dramatically improved the prognosis for many people living with HIV, PIs areassociated with numerous adverse effects including increases in serum glucose, triglycerides,lipodystrophy, hepatitis, nephrolithiasis and a large variety of GI side effects. 27 In addition to the drug interactions previously discussed, protease inhibitors can cause serious adverse reactionsand interactions when administered in combination with other substances, including illicit drugs,whose metabolism may be altered as a result of the inhibitory effects of the PIs on the cyto- Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 570A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 27: Pharmacologic Interactions of Clinical Significance Illicit substances most commonly abused include cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine, ec- stacy (MDMA, or and GHB (gamma hydroxy butyrate). As a result of the myriad side effects that can follow use of these substances (see Table 27-10), combining any of these substances with PIs especially in-creases the likelihood of an overdose due to one of these agents, particularly ecstasy. Cocaine has been reported to increase the speed at which HIV replicates, while combination of the protease inhibitors with marijuana increases levels of tetrahydrocannabinoids in the blood.Because combination of methamphetamine with ritonavir (Norvir) an increase in thepotency of three-fold, the likelihood of overdose with methamphetamine isincreased. Concomitant use of ketamine in the presence of the protease inhibitors causes hepa- titis. Ritonavir decreases plasma levels of heroin by 50%. The potency of methadone is decreased in the presence of ritonavir, (Crixivan) nevirapine (Viramune), ritonavir by 50%. Nevirapinewas demonstrated to reduce plasma methadone levels and to precipitate opiate withdrawal inpatients who were maintained on methadone for narcotics addiction. 28 More recent studies have reported decreases in the amount of stavudine (Zerit) and didanosine (Videx) absorbed fromthe digestive tract into bloodstream in the presence of methadone. Table 27-10 provideshighlights of the side effects that may be exacerbated by the use of ecstasy (MDMA), a powerful street drug recently associated with fatal drug interactions when administered concomitantly with ritonavir. 29 Table 27-10: Side Effects of Ecstasy (MDMA) That May Be Exacerbated When Used with Conventional Drugs with Similar Side Effects Urinary retention \u007f Visual disturbances Sources: Adapted from multiple sources, mainly Pham JV, Puzantian T.

Patients should be monitoredfor over-sedation and initial dosages should be decreased by 50%. Patients abusing opiate drugsare at risk of toxicity if they concomitantly take these agents, and should be counseled appropri-ately. 30 Table 27-11 lists metabolic pathways of frequently abused drugs potentially affected co-administration with the protease inhibitors.26 Table 27-11: Metabolic Pathways of Frequently Abused Drugs Potentially Affected by slidenafil (Viagra) is increased twofold to elevenfold in the presence of all protease inhibitors; patients should not exceed 25mg in a 48-hour period. ** Cocaine increases the speed at which HIV-1 virus replicates and so worsens overall prognosis by abolishing gains made by ant iretroviral therapy. Metabolism of cocaine should not be affected by protease inhibitors. Source: Adapted from Harrington RD, Woodward JA, Hooton TM, Horn JR.

Table 27-13 presents a list of red-flag medications that should be discussed in counseling pa- tients before prescribing. With the increasing complexity of HIV therapy, the potential for druginteractions for patients in both active and palliative care is exceedingly high. Health careproviders must be committed to constantly monitoring their patients and applying strategies tominimize and/or circumvent harmful drug-drug interactions. With more than 30 new medications approved by the FDA each year for use in our therapeutic armamentarium, the recognition and management of drug interactions has become an ongoingchallenge. While some pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions can be favorableand clinically useful, many have the potential to be detrimental or to even lead to life-threaten-ing toxicities and/or therapeutic failures. Providers must, therefore, become familiar with thefundamental issues involved in drug-drug interactions, especially with the red-flag medications\u2014usually the drugs in the patient's regimen that are enzyme inducers or inhibitors, have a narrowtherapeutic index, or have specific absorption requirements\u2014as well as with other medicationsthat require close patient monitoring and avoidance of certain groups of drugs. It is equally important that patients become active partners in their own care. Patients must understand that many potential drug-drug interactions can be circumvented, as long as provid-ers are made aware of all the medications and herbal remedies a patient is taking. Providersmay want to photocopy Table 27-14, Advice to Patients: Red Flag Medications, for discussionwith patients receiving active and/or palliative care therapies for HIV disease.

Always carry a standard list of these as you go for your clinic visits. Remember to mention to your providers any new or unusual dietary supple-ments, over-the-counter remedies, or vitamins you may be taking. Whennecessary, take a description of such products along with you on your providervisits or on refill visits to your pharmacy. \u007f Fill all of your prescriptions at the same pharmacy, as much as possible. This way, your pharmacist has access to your entire medication profile. He or she will be better able to resolve any problems that may occur as newmedications are added to your regimen or if you change your diet or lifestyle. \u007f Share ALL information about your health care regimen with your providers and pharmacist. Be frank with your health care providers. Keep them informed of such actions as stopping a drug regimen on your own, taking medications from a friend, or using street drugs, even if you feel they may not approve. Significantdrug interactions which can arise that can harm your therapy can probably becircumvented by your provider's knowledge and intervention. \u007f Whenever you anticipate changing your health care routine, be sure to check with your provider, especially if you are taking one of the red flag medications. Ask your pharmacist if any of your medications belong to this red flag list. If so, always consult your provider or pharmacist before making any changes toyour usual health routine, including your intake of vitamins, supplements,herbal remedies, and antacids. Though all of the red flag medications arehighly efficacious, they are prone to significant drug-drug interactions andmust be administered under close monitoring by an experienced provider.Consider wearing a \"Medic-Alert\" bracelet especially when taking drugs suchas abacavir (Ziagen), in case of 1/28/2003, 10:21 AM 58426 picas U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u007f Health Resources and Services Administration \u007f HIV/AIDS Bureau 585A Clinical Guide to Supportive and Palliative Care for HIV/AIDS \u007f Chapter 27: Pharmacologic Interactions of Clinical Significance XXVII1.
