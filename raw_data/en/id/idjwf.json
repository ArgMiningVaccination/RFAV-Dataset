Enter with a mindset for conversation, not debate. The typical finding in modern medicine is Thimerosal (organic mercury) and several other harsh chemicals that cause neuronal damage and toxicity. On the other hand, herbal treatment is completely natural and has been tested for many years and shown to cause little if no bodily harm. Herbal treatment has also been becoming more widely available for people to use so almost all symptoms can be suppressed if one is using mere herbs to treat oneself. Similarly, acupuncture, which has been tested for over 3000 years, has been shown to actually deactivate the pain centers of the brain without using the placebo affect (as several studies have shown), while not causing any further neuronal toxicity compared to Pain Relievers. For these reasons, I support that natural, herbal treatment and acupuncture, once combined, is of much higher worth than the large majority of modern medicine (that is not herbal or acupunctural). EDIT: I am waiting for existing sources that break my arguments down. EDIT[1]: By modern medicine, I mean as in the areas of modern. Surgery is ancient, as far as we know, shown from ancient Chinese, Sumerian, and Egyptian texts. EDIT[2]: I do not see a point in this debate where any of us will change our minds. The main thing I am talking about is the untested side effects of modern medicine, in general, and their documented ingredients, which have been tested to cause occasional (and sometimes frequent) highly-problematic side effects. Since no one can prove that herbs, in general, and acupuncture, as it is, are worse than modern medicine, even when there is complete proof of the ingredients of these substances on government (United States) websites with experiments documenting their effects, I will stop responding to the responses. You are just attacking a form of Mercury which only one of the many controversial ingredients of these vaccines and drugs, while saying that it is documented 'with the scientific method'. If one ingredient is tested that causes the intended effect works, there is no meaning of the rest of the ingredients being alright. Those ingredients are not tested or, more widely, tested and seen to cause a list of potential highly-negative side effects (mental deterioration, literal intoxication of the brain, hormonal imbalances, cancers, kidney problems, and much more). Please, if you are unwilling to attack it at its source, don't attack at all. \"Taking the short road to lose weight doesn't bring success; it brings a cheat to not "}
