REPORT OF THE HOUSE OF DELEGATES COMMITTEE ON THE COMPENSATION OF THE OFFICERS Report A -19 Subject: Report of the House of Delegates Committee on Compensation of the Officers Presented by: Marta J. Van Beek , MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee F (Greg Tarasidis, MD, Chair) This report by the Committee at the 2019 Annual Meeti ng presents one recommendation. 1 2 BACKGROUND 3 4 At the 1998 Interim Meeting, the House of Delegates (HOD) established a House Committee on 5 Trustee Compensation, currently named the Committee on Compensation of the Officers, (\"the 6 Committee\"). The Officers are defined in the American Medical Association's (AMA) Constitution 7 and Bylaws. (Note: under changes to the Constitution previously approved by the HOD, Article V 8 refers simply to \"Officer,\" which includes all 21 members of the Board among whom are President, 9 President -Elect, Immediate Past President, Secretary, Speaker of the HOD and Vice Speaker of the 10 HOD, collectively referred to in this report as Officers). The composition, appointment, tenure, 11 vacancy process and reporting requirements for the Committee are covered under the AMA 12 Bylaws. Bylaws 2.13.4.5 provides: 13 14 The Committee shall present an annual report to the House of Delegates recommending the 15 level of total compensation for the Officers for the following year. The recommendations of the 16 report may be adopted, not adopted or referred back to the Committee, and may be amended 17 for clarification only with the concurrence of the Committee. 18 19 At A- 00, the Com mittee and the Board jointly adopted the American Compensation Ass ociation's 20 definition of total compensation in which was added to the Glossary of the AMA Constitution 21 Bylaws. Total compensation is defined as the complete reward/recognition package awarded to an 22 individual or work performance including: (a) all forms of money or cash compensation; 23 (b) benefits; (c) perquisites; (d) services; and (e) in -kind payments. 24 25 Since the inception of this Committee, its reports document the process the Committee fol lows to 26 ensure that current or recommended Officer compensation is based on sound, fair, cost -effective 27 compensation practices as derived from research and use of independent external consultants, 28 expert in Board Compensation. Reports beginning in December 2002 documented the principles 29 the Committee followed in creating its recommenda tions for Officer compensation. 30 31 At A- 08, the HOD approved changes that simplified compensation practices with increased 32 transparency and consistency. At A -10, Reference Committee F requested that this Committee 33 recommend that the HOD affirm a codification of the current compensation principle, which 34 occurred at I -10. At that time, the HOD affirmed that this Committee has and will continue to base 35 its recommendations for O fficer compensation on the principle of the value of the work performed, 36 consistent with IRS guidance and best practices as recommended by the Committee's external 37 independent consultant, who is expert in Board compensation. 38 Compensation Committee Rep. A-19 -- page 2 of 5 At A- 11, the HOD approved the alignment of Medical Student and Resident Officer compensation 1 with that of all other Officers (excluding Presidents and Chair) because these positions perform 2 comparable work. 3 4 Immediately following A -11, the Committee retained Mr. Don Delves, founder of the Delves 5 Group, to update his 2007 research by providing the Committee with comprehensive advice and 6 counsel on Officer compensation. The updated compensation structure was presented and approved 7 by the HOD at I -11 with an effective date of July 1, 2012. 8 9 The Committee's I -13 report recommended and the HOD approved the Committee's 10 recommendation to provide a travel allowance for each President to be used for upgrades because 11 of the significant volume of travel in representing our AMA. 12 13 At I-16, based on t he result of a comprehensive compensation review conducted by Ms. Becky 14 Glantz Huddleston, an expert in Board Compensation with Willis Towers Watson, the Committee 15 recommended and the HOD approved modest increased to the Governance Honorarium and Per 16 Diems for Officer Compensation, excluding the Presidents and Chair, effective July 1, 2017. A - 17 17's report, approved by the HOD, modified the Governance Honorarium and Per Diem definition 18 so that Internal Representation, in excess of eleven days, receives a per diem. 19 20 At A- 18, based on a compensation review focused on the Presidents ' and Chairs ' compensation, 21 the Committee recommended and the House approved a modest increase to their Honor aria, the 22 first increase in ten years. 23 24 METHODOLOGY 25 26 At I-18, this Committe e recommended and the House approved an Annual Health Insurance 27 Stipend (Stipend) for the President, President -Elect and the Immediate Past President when 28 replacement health insurance is needed because he/she loses health insurance coverage at their 29 practi ce, university or hospita l (collectively referred to as \"Employer\") when they reduce their 30 work schedule to fulfill their responsibilities as President, President- Elect or Immediate Past 31 President. 32 33 The amount of the Stipend was based on 70% of the then cu rrent Gold Plan premium in the 34 President(s) state of residence for each covered family member. The Stipend ended when a 35 President, President -Elect or Immediate Past President became Medicare eligible during their term 36 in office because the Stipend was based on the President's need for health insurance which was met 37 via Medicare. 38 39 The Committee heard testimony at Reference Committee F in support of the Stipend, however 40 there were questions about the Stipend ending for the President's covered family members w hen 41 the President became Medicare eligible while in office. The Committee completed additional 42 research and concluded that revisions to the definitions were warranted because the President(s) 43 covered family members also needed replacement health insurance when the President(s) lost 44 insurance from his/her Employer upon reducing their work schedule to fulfill AMA 45 responsibilities . 46 47 The Committee also noted that for clarity, the definition of the Stipend replaces \"age 65\" with 48 \"Medicare eligibility .\" 49 Compensation Committee Rep. A-19 -- page 3 of 5 FINDINGS 1 2 The Committee notes that the President -Elect, President and Immediate Past President 3 responsibilities require a significant time commitment in supporting our AMA in governance and 4 representation functions. Our A -18 report noted that this level of respons ibility results in a time 5 commitment well above that required by other not -for-profit boards. The level of commitment 6 needed in supporting our AMA may necessitate a President reduce his/her work schedule with 7 his/her Employer to a part -time status which ma y result in a President and his/her covered family 8 members losing their eligibility for Employer's health insurance coverage. 9 10 This Committee considers health insurance a necessity. At I-18 the Committee recommended and 11 the House approved a Stipend for the President and his/her family when they lose their Employer's 12 health insurance. This Committee recommends amending the definition of eligibility so that 13 President (s) who already have health insurance coverage through Medicare when elected will not 14 be eligi ble for the Stipend for themselves or family members. Additionally, this Committee 15 recommends amending the eligibility definition so that if a President becomes Medicare eligible 16 while in office, the President will be expected to enroll in Medicare and the Stipend will continue 17 to cover family members who are not Medicare eligible. The amount of the Stipend will be 18 adjusted accordingly. The Stipend would be reported as taxable income to the President(s). 19 20 RECOMMENDATIONS 21 22 The Committee on Compensation of the Officers recommends the following recommendations be 23 adopted and the remainder of this report filed: 24 25 1. That Policy D -605.990 be appended by a new section XXIII as follows: 26 27 Annual Health Insurance Stipend (\"Stipend\" ) 28 The purpose of this payment is to pr ovide a Health Insurance Stipend (Stipend) to compensate 29 the President, P resident -Elect, and Immediate Past President when the President(s) lose(s) 30 his/her Employer provided medical insurance coverage. President(s) who lose his/her 31 Employer insurance will substantiate his/her eligibility for the Stipend by written notice to the 32 Board Chair detailing the effective date of the loss of coverage and listing covered family 33 members. The President receiving the Stipend will have the sole discretion to determine th e 34 appropriate health insurance for himself /herself and the family members; however , the Stipend 35 will be calculated based on 70% of the then current Gold Plan p remium for his /her state/county 36 of residence. 37 38 Should a President become Medicare eligible during his/her term(s), the Stipend will end for 39 the President the month Medicare coverage begins. If the President has covered family 40 members who are not Medicare eligible, the amount of the Stipend will be adjusted to cover 41 only those family members until they become Medicare eligible. As family members become 42 Medicare eligible, the President is expected to provide written notice of the event to the Board 43 Chair and the Stipend will be adjusted accordingly the month Medicare coverage begins. 44 45 In any case, the St ipend will end the sooner the President(s) obtains other health insurance 46 coverage or the month following the end of his/her term as Immediate Past President. 47 48 Should a President have health insurance coverage through Medicare when elected , he/she will 49 not be eligible for the Stipend for themselves or family members. 50 Compensation Committee Rep. A-19 -- page 4 of 5 The amount of the Stipend will be 70% of the then current Gold P lan premium in the 1 President(s) state/county of residence for each covered family member. If there are multiple 2 Gold Plans in the state/county, the Stipend will be based on the average of the then current 3 Gold Plan premiums. The amount of the Stipend will be updated January 1 of each Plan year 4 based on then Gold Plan premiums and covered family members. 5 6 The Stipend will be paid monthly. The amount of the Stipend will be reported as taxable 7 income for the President each calendar year and will be included in this Committee's annual 8 report to the House which documents compensation paid to Officers and the IRS reported 9 taxable value of benefits, perquisites, services, and in -kind payments. 10 11 2. Except as noted above, there will be no other changes to the Officers compensation for the 12 period beginning July 1, 2019. (Directive to Take Action) 13 Fiscal Note: The maximum annual stipend is estimated at $87,000. This is based on 70% of the highest 2018 Gold Plan Premium based on current Board demographics and assumes all 3 Presidents and spouses/partners would receive the stipend in the same year.

AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 008 (A-19) Introduced by: Minority Affairs Section GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ Equality Subject: Preventing Anti -Transgender Violence Referred to: Reference Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws (William Reha, MD, MBA, Chair) Whereas, A recent event has increased attention on violent crimes reported by the Lesbian, 1 Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning (LGBTQ) or gender non -conforming communities 2 yet most media outlets have failed to accurately educate the public regarding the reality of the 3 discrimination and physical dangers faced by members of the LGBTQ community,1-7 especially 4 Black transgender people and other transgender people of color; and 5 6 Whereas, Transgender individuals are people whose gender identity or gender expression 7 differs from their sex assigned at birth;8 and 8 9 Whereas, Transgender people who are People of Color, disabled, female identified, or a 10 member of another oppressed gr oup may struggle with discrimination on multiple levels;9,10 and 11 12 Whereas, Violence against transgender people is often underreported due to transphobia and 13 mistrust of law enforcement;11 and 14 15 Whereas, In 2013, the Human Rights Campaign published its first report that tracked fatal 16 violence against transgender people in the US and published its most recent report in 2018; and 17 18 Whereas, In the past six years of reporting by the Human Rights Campaign, 80% of all known 19 transgender homicide victims were transgender women of color, 69% were Black transgender 20 women; and 21 22 Whereas, Since 2013, at least 128 transgender women, transgender men, and non -binary 23 people (people whose gender is not male or female) have been killed across 32 states and 87 24 cities in the US;11 and 25 26 Whereas, In 2017, there were 29 homicides of transgender people in the US reported in the 27 media, the highest number ever recorded, in addition to many more that were not publicly 28 known; and 29 30 Whereas, In 2018, advocates tracked at least 226 deaths of transgender people in the US due 31 to fatal violence, 82% of whom were transgender women of color and 73% of whom were Black 32 transgender women;11 and 33 34 Whereas, In the summer of 2018, violent attacks claimed the lives of nine Black transgender 35 women in the span of only 10 weeks; and 36 Resolution: 008 (A-19) Page 2 of 3 Whereas, The Federal Bureau of Investigation reported a 17% increase in hate crime r eports in 1 2017 compared to 2016 data, a rise for the third consecutive year;12 and 2 3 Whereas, Of the more than 7,100 hate crimes reported in 2017, the Federal Bureau of 4 Investigation concluded nearly three out of five were motivated by race and ethnicity; and 5 6 Whereas, Numerous studies have found that transgender people, especially transgender people 7 of color, face high rates of sexual assault, intimate partner violence, and other non- fatal 8 violence; and 9 10 Whereas, The largest survey to date of transgender individuals in the United States, the 2015 11 US Transgender Survey, found that 13% of all respondents reported being physically assaulted 12 in the previous year; 47% reported ever experiencing sexual assault, including 10% in the 13 previous year; and 35% reported ever experiencing phys ical violence from an intimate partner;13 14 and 15 16 Whereas, The physical risks faced by transgender individuals can have long and short -term 17 negative impacts on the physical and mental health of these individuals, survivors , their 18 communities, and the nation as a whole; therefore be it 19 20 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association partner with other medical organizations 21 and stakeholders to immediately increase efforts to educate the general public, legislators, and 22 members of law enforcement using verified data related to the hate crimes against transgender 23 individuals highlighting the disproportionate number of Black transgender women who have 24 succumbed to violent deaths (Directive to Take Action) ; and be it further 25 26 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate for federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to 27 consistently collect and report data on hate crimes, including victim demographics, to the FBI;

and be it further 33 34 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate for a central law enforcement database to collect data 35 about reported hate crimes that correctly identifies an individual's birth sex and gender identity, 36 in order to quickly identi fy positive and negative trends so resources may be appropriately 37 disseminated (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 38 39 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate for stronger law enforcement policies regarding 40 interactions with transgender individuals to prevent bias and mistreatment and increase 41 community trust (Directive to Take Action) ;

(Directive to Take 30 Action) 31 Fiscal Note: Minimal - less than $1,000. Received: 05/09/19 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 011 (A-19) Introduced by: Michigan Subject: Mature Minor Consent to Vaccinations Referred to: Reference Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws (William Reha, MD, MBA, Chair) Whereas, Vaccines have been one of the most effective methods of infectious disease control in 1 the past century, preventing 732,000 premature deaths in children born in the United States 2 between 1994 and 2013; and 3 4 Whereas, One of the goals of Healthy People 2020 is to increase immunization rates, targeting 5 a reduct ion in the incidence of 17 vaccine- preventable diseases in the United States; and 6 7 Whereas, There have been several recent well -publicized outbreaks of vaccine- preventable 8 illnesses such as measles, mumps, and pertussis in the United States, including the 2018 9 Michigan measles outbreak; and 10 11 Whereas, The prevalence of unvaccinated pediatric patients is rising in the United States, and 12 many children are unvaccinated due to parental distrust of vaccines; and 13 14 Whereas, Despite legislative efforts to regulate opt -out waivers for vaccinations, the Michigan 15 immunization waiver rate remains higher than three percent for both kindergarten and eighth 16 grade students, with greater than 70 percent of those waivers for philosophical rather than 17 religious or medical reasons; and 18 19 Whereas, A 2018 study found that three of the nation's 14 metropolitan \"hotspots\" for non- 20 medical exemption from vaccination are located in Michigan-- Troy, Warren, and Detroit -- 21 demonstrating a high risk of vaccine- preventable disease outbreaks; and 22 23 Whereas, Declining vaccination rates increase the probability of outbreaks of vaccine- 24 preventable diseases, and states with more opportunities for vaccination exemption have more 25 measles outbreaks; and 26 27 Whereas, Unvaccinated adolescents report interest in receiving vaccines to prevent against 28 common childhood illnesses; and 29 30 Whereas, Federal law does not require parental consent for vaccinations and many states, 31 including Michigan, do not have comprehensive statutes surrounding vaccination policy; and 32 33 Whereas, Minors in the majority of states, including Michigan, are able to consent to some 34 mental health services, sexually transmitted disease testing and treatment, birth control, and 35 pregnancy related care; and 36 Resolution: 011 (A-19) Page 2 of 5 Whereas, Adolescents in 21 states do not re quire parental consent for treatment of reportable 1 diseases, which include hepatitis B, measles, mumps, and pertussis; and 2 3 Whereas, The inability for minors to provide consent to vaccinations has been cited as a barrier 4 to vaccination rates; and 5 6 Whereas, An American Academy of Pediatrics' article proposed minor consent to vaccination 7 via the mature minor doctrine, a widely accepted legal concept allowing \"certain older minors 8 who have the capacity to give informed consent to do so for care that is within the mainstream 9 of medical practice, not high risk, and provided in a non- negligent manner;\" and 10 11 Whereas, Vaccinations are safe, effective, low -risk, and necessary for a multi -faceted, 12 comprehensive approach to public health and it is thus in the interest of the medical community 13 and concerned citizens to promote access to vaccination; and 14 15 Whereas, Allowing mature minors an avenue to provide for their own personal health, when 16 they have no medical contraindications to the vaccinations and are given the sam e 17 comprehensive vaccine information as consenting adults, abides by the same ethical standards 18 as other procedures allowed for in Michigan without parental consent; therefore be it 19 20 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association amend the policy H -440.830, \"Education 21 and Public Awareness on Vaccine Safety and Efficacy,\" by addition and deletion as follows: 22 23 Our AMA (a) encourages the development and dissemination of evidence- based 24 public awareness campaigns aimed at increasing vaccination rates; (b) encourages 25 the development of educational materials that can be distributed to patients and their 26 families clearly articulating the benefits of immunizations and highlighting the 27 exemplary safety record of vaccines; (c) supports the development and evaluation, in 28 collaboration with health care providers, of evidence- based educational resources to 29 assist parents in educating and encouraging other parents who may be reluctant to 30 vaccinate their children; (d) encourages physicians and state and local medical 31 associations to work with public health officials to inform those who object to 32 immunizations about the benefits of vaccinations and the risks to their own health and 33 that of the general public if they refuse to accept them; (e) will promote the safety and 34 efficacy of vaccines while rejecting claims that have no foundation in science; and 35 (f) supports state policies allowing adolescents to provide their own consent for 36 vaccination and encourages state legislatures to establish comprehensive vacc ine and 37 minor consent policies; and (g) will continue its ongoing efforts with other immunization 38 advocacy organizations to assist physicians and other health care professionals in 39 effectively communicating to patients, parents, policy makers, and the medi a that 40 vaccines do not cause autism and that decreasing immunization rates have resulted in 41 a resurgence of vaccine- preventable diseases and deaths.

When, in the opinion of the physician, parental involvement would not be beneficial, par ental consent or notification should not be a barrier to care; (4) urges physicians to discuss their policies about confidentiality with parents and the adolescent patient, as well as conditions under which confidentiality would be abrogated. This discussion should include possible arrangements for the adolescent to have independent access to health care (including financial arrangements); (5) encourages physicians to offer adolescents an opportunity for examination and counseling apart from parents. The same confidentiality will be preserved between the adolescent patient and physician as between the parent (or responsible adult) and the physician; (6) encourages state and county medical societies to become aware of the nature and effect of laws and regulations regarding confidential health services for adolescents in their respective Resolution: 011 (A-19) Page 5 of 5 jurisdictions. State medical societies should provide this information to physicians to clarify services that may be legally provided on a confidential basis; (7) urges undergraduate and graduate medical education programs and continuing education programs to inform physicians about issues surrounding minors' consent and confidential care, including relevant law and implementation into practice; (8) encourages health care payers to develop a method of listing of services which preserves confidentiality for adolescents; and (9) encourages medical societies to evaluate laws on consent and confidential care for adolescents and to help eliminate laws which restrict the availability of confidential care.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY E-6.1.3 Studying Financial Incentives for Cadaveric Organ Donation Physicians' ethical obligations to contribute to the health of the public and to support access to medical care extend to participating in efforts to increase the supply of organs for transplantation. However, offering financial incentives for donation raises ethical concerns about potential coercion, the voluntar iness of decisions to donate, and possible adverse consequences, including reducing the rate of altruistic organ donation and unduly encouraging perception of the human body as a source of profit. These concerns merit further study to determine whether, ov erall, the benefits of financial incentives for organ donation outweigh their potential harms. It would be appropriate to carry out pilot studies among limited populations to investigate the effects of such financial incentives for the purpose of examining and possibly revising current policies in the light of scientific evidence. Physicians who develop or participate in pilot studies of financial incentives to increase donation of cadaveric organs should ensure that the study: (a) Is strictly limited to circumstances of voluntary cadaveric donation with an explicit prohibition of the selling of organs. (b) Is scientifically well designed and clearly defines measurable outcomes and time frames in a written protocol. (c) Has been developed in consultation wit h the population among whom it is to be carried out. (d) Has been reviewed and approved by an appropriate oversight body, such as an institutional review board, and is carried out in keeping with guidelines for ethical research. (e) Offers incentives of only modest value and at the lowest level that can reasonably be expected to increase organ donation.

Models for financing and organizing the delivery of health care services often aim to promote patient safety and to improve quality and efficiency. However, they can also pose ethical challenges for physicians that could undermine the trust essential to patient -physician relationships. Payment m odels and financial incentives can create conflicts of interest among patients, health care organizations, and physicians. They can encourage undertreatment and overtreatment, as well as dictate goals that are not individualized for the particular patient. Structures that influence where and by whom care is deliveredsuch as accountable care organizations, group practices, health maintenance organizations, and other entities that may emerge in the futurecan affect patientschoices, the patient -physician relat ionship, and physiciansrelationships with fellow health care professionals. Formularies, clinical practice guidelines, and other tools intended to influence decision making, may impinge on physiciansexercise of professional judgment and ability to advocate effectively for their patients, depending on how they are designed and implemented. Physicians in leadership positions within health care organizations should ensure that practices for financing and organizing the delivery of care: (a) Are transparent. (b) Reflect input from key stakeholders, including physicians and patients. (c) Recognize that over reliance on financial incentives may undermine physician professionalism. (d) Ensure ethically acceptable incentives that: (i) are designed in keeping with sound principles and solid scientific evidence. Financial incentives should be based on appropriate comparison groups and cost data and adjusted to reflect complexity, case mix, and other factors that affect physician practice profiles. Practice guidelines , formularies, and other tools should be based on best available evidence and developed in keeping with ethics guidance; Resolution: 014 (A-19) Page 3 of 6 (ii) are implemented fairly and do not disadvantage identifiable populations of patients or physicians or exacerbate health care dispar ities; (iii) are implemented in conjunction with the infrastructure and resources needed to support high- value care and physician professionalism; (iv) mitigate possible conflicts between physiciansfinancial interests and patient interests by minimizing the financial impact of patient care decisions and the overall financial risk for individual physicians. (e) Encourage, rather than discourage, physicians (and others) to: (i) provide care for patients with difficult to manage medical conditions; (ii) practi ce at their full capacity, but not beyond. (f) Recognize physiciansprimary obligation to their patients by enabling physicians to respond to the unique needs of individual patients and providing avenues for meaningful appeal and advocacy on behalf of patie nts. (g) Are routinely monitored to: (i) identify and address adverse consequences; (ii) identify and encourage dissemination of positive outcomes. All physicians should: (h) Hold physician- leaders accountable to meeting conditions for professionalism in health care systems. (i) Advocate for changes in health care payment and delivery models to promote access to high- quality care for all patients. AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: I,II III,V The Opinions in this chapter are offered as ethics guidance for physicians and are not intended to establish standards of clinical practice or rules of law. Issued: 2016 E-11.2.4 Transparency in Health Care Respect for patients' autonomy is a cornerstone of medical ethics. Patients must rely on their physicians to provide information that patients would reasonably want to know to make informed, well -considered decisions about their health care. Thus, physicians ha ve an obligation to inform patients about all appropriate treatment options, the risks and benefits of alternatives, and other information that may be pertinent, including the existence of payment models, financial incentives; and formularies, guidelines or other tools that influence treatment recommendations and care. Restrictions on disclosure can impede communication between patient and physician and undermine trust, patient choice, and quality of care. Although health plans and other entities may have primary responsibility to inform patient -members about plan provisions that will affect the availability of care, physicians share in this responsibility. Individually, physicians should: (a) Disclose any financial and other factors that could affect the patient's care. (b) Disclose relevant treatment alternatives, including those that may not be covered under the patient's health plan. (c) Encourage patients to be aware of the provisions of their health plan. Collectively, physicians should advocate that health plans with which they contract disclose to patient - members: (d) Plan provisions that limit care, such as formularies or constraints on referrals. (e) Plan provisions for obtaining desired care that would otherwise not be provided, such as provision for off-formulary prescribing. (f) Plan relationships with pharmacy benefit management organizations and other commercial entities that have an interest in physicianstreatment recommendations.

Issued: 2016 9.6.2 Gifts to Physicians from Industry Relationships among physicians and professional medical organizations and pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device companies help drive innovation in patient care and contribute to the economic well -being of the community to the ultimate benefit of patients and the public. However, an increasingly urgent challenge for both medicine and industry is to devise ways to preserve strong, productive collaborations at the same time that they take clear effec tive action to prevent relationships that damage public trust and tarnish the reputation of both parties. Resolution: 014 (A-19) Page 4 of 6 Gifts to physicians from industry create conditions that carry the risk of subtly biasingor being perceived to bias - professional judgment in the car e of patients. To preserve the trust that is fundamental to the patient -physician relationship and public confidence in the profession, physicians should: (a) Decline cash gifts in any amount from an entity that has a direct interest in physicianstreatment recommendations. (b) Decline any gifts for which reciprocity is expected or implied. (c) Accept an in- kind gift for the physician's practice only when the gift: (i) will directly benefit patients, including patient education; and (ii) is of minimal value . (d) Academic institutions and residency and fellowship programs may accept special funding on behalf of trainees to support medical students', residents', and fellows' participation in professional meetings, including educational meetings, provided: (i) the program identifies recipients based on independent institutional criteria; and (ii) funds are distributed to recipients without specific attribution to sponsors. AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: II The Opinions in this chapter are offered as ethics guidance for physicians and are not intended to establish standards of clinical practice or rules of law. Issued: 2016 Principles on Corporate Relationships G -630.040 The House of Delegates adopts the following revised principles on Corporate Relationships. The Board will review them annually and, if necessary, make recommendations for revisions to be presented to the House of Delegates. (1) GUIDELINE S FOR AMA CORPORATE RELATIONSHIPS. Principles to guide AMA's relationships with corporate America were adopted by our AMA House of Delegates at its December 1997 meeting and slightly modified at the June 1998 meeting. Subsequently, they have been edited to reflect the recommendations from the Task Force on Association/Corporate Relations, including among its members experts external to our AMA. Minor edits were also adopted in 2002. The following principles are based on the premise that in certain circumstances, our AMA should participate in corporate arrangements when guidelines are met, which can further our AMA's core strategic focus, retain AMA's independence, avoid conflicts of interest, and guard our professional values. (2) OVERVIEW OF PRINCIPLES. The AMA's principles to guide corporate relationships have been organized into the following categories: General Principles that apply to most situations; Special Guidelines that deal with specific issues and concerns; Organizational Review that outlines the roles and responsibilities of the Board of Trustees, AMA Management and other staff units. These guidelines should be reviewed over time to assure their continued relevance to the policies and operations of our AMA and to our business environment. The principles should serve as a starting point for anyone reviewing or developing AMA's relationships with outside groups. (3) GENERAL PRINCIPLES. Our AMA's vision and values statement and strategic focus should provide guidance for externally funded relationships. Relations that are not motivated by the association's mission threaten our AMA's ability to provide representation and leadership for the profession. (a) Our AMA's vision and values and strategic focus ultimately must determine whether a proposed relati onship is appropriate for our AMA. Our AMA should not have relationships with organizations or industries whose principles, policies or actions obviously conflict with our AMA's vision and values. For example, relationships with producers of products that harm the public health (e.g., tobacco) are not appropriate for our AMA. Our AMA will proactively choose its priorities for external relationships and collaborate in those that fulfill these priorities. (b) The relationship must preserve or promote trust in our AMA and the medical profession. To be effective, medical professionalism requires the public's trust. Corporate relationships that could undermine the public's trust in our AMA or the profession are not acceptable. For example, no relationship should raise questions about the scientific content of our AMA's health information publications, AMA's advocacy on public health issues, or the truthfulness of its public statements. (c) The relationship must maintain our AMA's objectivity with respect to health issues. Our AMA accepts funds or royalties from external organizations only if acceptance does not pose a conflict of interest and in no way impacts the objectivity of the association, its members, activities, programs, or employees. For example, exclusive relationships with manufacturers of health- related products marketed to the public could impair our AMA's objectivity in promoting the health of America. Our AMA's objectivity with respect to health issues should not be biased by external relationships. (d) The activity must provide benefit to the public's Resolution: 014 (A-19) Page 5 of 6 health, patients' care, or physicians' practice. Public education campaigns and programs for AMA or Federation members are potentially of significant benefit. Corporate- supported programs that provide financial benefits to our AMA but no significant benefit to the public or direct professional benefits to AMA or Federation members are not acceptable. In the case of member benefits, external relations must not detract from AMA's professionalism. (4) SPECI AL GUIDELINES. The following guidelines address a number of special situations where our AMA cannot utilize external funding. There are specific guidelines already in place regarding advertising in publications. (a) Our AMA will provide health and medical information, but should not involve itself in the production, sale, or marketing to consumers of products that claim a health benefit. Marketing health- related products (e.g., pharmaceuticals, home health care products) undermines our AMA's objectivity and diminishes its role in representing healthcare values and educating the public about their health and healthcare. (b) Activities should be funded from multiple sources whenever possible. Activities funded from a single external source are at greater risk for inappropriate influence from the supporter or the perception of it, which may be equally damaging. For example, funding for a patient education brochure should be done with multiple sponsors if possible. For the purposes of this guideline, funding from several companies, but each from a different and non- competing industry category (e.g., one pharmaceutical manufacturer and one health insurance provider), does not constitute multiple- source funding. Our AMA recognizes that for some activities the benefi ts may be so great, the harms so minimal, and the prospects for developing multiple sources of funding so unlikely that single- source funding is a reasonable option. Even so, funding exclusivity must be limited to program only (e.g., asthma conference) and shall not extend to a therapeutic category (e.g., asthma). The Board should review single- sponsored activities prior to implementation to ensure that: (i) reasonable attempts have been made to locate additional sources of funds (for example, issuing an open request for proposals to companies in the category); and (ii) the expected benefits of the project merit the additional risk to our AMA of accepting single- source funding. In all cases of single- source funding, our AMA will guard against conflict of int erest. (c) The relationship must preserve AMA's control over any projects and products bearing our AMA name or logo. Our AMA retains editorial control over any information produced as part of a corporate/externally funded arrangement. When an AMA program r eceives external financial support, our AMA must remain in control of its name, logo, and AMA content, and must approve all marketing materials to ensure that the message is congruent with our AMA's vision and values. A statement regarding AMA editorial co ntrol as well as the name(s) of the program's supporter(s) must appear in all public materials describing the program and in all educational materials produced by the program. (This principle is intended to apply only to those situations where an outside entity requests our AMA to put its name on products produced by the outside entity, and not to those situations where our AMA only licenses its own products for use in conjunction with another entity's products.) (d) Relationships must not permit or encourage influence by the corporate partner on our AMA. An AMA corporate relationship must not permit influence by the corporate partner on AMA policies, priorities, and actions. For example, agreements stipulating access by corporate partners to the House of De legates or access to AMA leadership would be of concern. Additionally, relationships that appear to be acceptable when viewed alone may become unacceptable when viewed in light of other existing or proposed activities. (e) Participation in a sponsorship pr ogram does not imply AMA's endorsement of an entity or its policies. Participation in sponsorship of an AMA program does not imply AMA approval of that corporation's general policies, nor does it imply that our AMA will exert any influence to advance the c orporation's interests outside the substance of the arrangement itself. Our AMA's name and logo should not be used in a manner that would express or imply an AMA endorsement of the corporation, its policies and/or its products. (f) To remove any appearance of undue influence on the affairs of our AMA, our AMA should not depend on funding from corporate relationships for core governance activities. Funding core governance activities from corporate sponsors, i.e., the financial support for conduct of the House of Delegates, the Board of Trustees and Council meetings could make our AMA become dependent on external funding for its existence or could allow a supporter, or group of supporters, to have undue influence on the affairs of our AMA. (g) Funds from corporate relationships must not be used to support political advocacy activities. A full and effective separation should exist, as it currently does, between political activities and corporate funding. Our AMA should not advocate for a particular issue becaus e it has received funding from an interested corporation. Public concern would be heightened if it appeared that our AMA's advocacy agenda was influenced by corporate funding. (5) ORGANIZATIONAL REVIEW. Every proposal for an AMA corporate relationship must be thoroughly screened prior to staff implementation. AMA activities that meet certain criteria requiring further review are forwarded to a committee of the Board of Trustees for a heightened level of scrutiny. (a) As part of its Resolution: 014 (A-19) Page 6 of 6 annual report on the AMA? s performance, activities, and status, the Board of Trustees will present a summary of the AMA?s corporate arrangements to the House of Delegates at each Annual Meeting. (b) Every new AMA Corporate relationship must be approved by the Board of Trustees, or through a procedure adopted by the Board. Specific procedures and policies regarding Board review are as follows: (i) The Board routinely should be informed of all AMA corporate relationships; (ii) Upon request of two dissenting members of the CRT, any di ssenting votes within the CRT, and instances when the CRT and the Board committee differ in the disposition of a proposal, are brought to the attention of the full Board; (iii) All externally supported corporate activities directed to the public should rec eive Board review and approval; (iv) All activities that have support from only one corporation except patient materials linked to CME, within an industry should either be in compliance with ACCME guidelines or receive Board review; and (f) All relationshi ps where our AMA takes on a risk of substantial financial penalties for cancellation should receive Board review prior to enactment. (c) The Executive Vice President is responsible for the review and implementation of each specific arrangement according to the previously described principles. The Executive Vice President is responsible for obtaining the Board of Trustees authorization for externally funded arrangements that have an economic and/or policy impact on our AMA. (d) The Corporate Review Team revi ews corporate arrangements to ensure consistency with the principles and guidelines. (i) The Corporate Review Team is the internal, cross -organizational group that is charged with the review of all activities that associate the AMA's name and logo with that of another entity and/or with external funding. (ii) The Review process is structured to specifically address issues pertaining to AMA's policy, ethics, business practices, corporate identity, reputation and due diligence. Written procedures formalize the committee's process for review of corporate arrangements. (iii) All activities placed on the Corporate Review Team agenda have had the senior manager's review and consent, and following CRT approval will continue to require the routine approvals of the O ffice of Finance and Office of the General Counsel. (iv) The Corporate Review Team reports its findings and recommendations directly to a committee of the Board. (e) Our AMA's Office of Risk Management in consultation with the Office of the General Counsel will review and approve all marketing materials that are prepared by others for use in the U.S. and that bear our AMA's name and/or corporate identity. All marketing materials will be reviewed for appropriate use of AMA's logos and trademarks, perception of implied endorsement of the external entity's policies or products, unsubstantiated claims, misleading, exaggerated or false claims, and reference to appropriate documentation when claims are made. In the instance of international publishing of JAMA and the Archives, our AMA will require review and approval of representative marketing materials by the editor of each international edition in compliance with these principles and guidelines. (6) ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE AND ITS INFLUENCE ON EXTERNALLY FUNDED P ROGRAMS. (a) Organizational culture has a profound impact on whether and how AMA corporate relationships are pursued. AMA activities reflect on all physicians. Moreover, all physicians are represented to some extent by AMA actions. Thus, our AMA must act as the professional representative for all physicians, and not merely as an advocacy group or club for AMA members. (b) As a professional organization, our AMA operates with a higher level of purpose representing the ideals of medicine. Nevertheless, non- profit associations today do require the generation of non- dues revenues. Our AMA should set goals that do not create an undue expectation to raise increasing amounts of money. Such financial pressures can provide an incentive to evade, minimize, or overlook guidelines for fundraising through external sources. (c) Every staff member in the association must be accountable to explicit ethical standards that are derived from the vision, values, and focus areas of the Association. In turn, leaders of our AMA must recognize the critical role the organization plays as the sole nationally representative professional association for medicine in America.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY 2.2.2 Confidential Health Care for Minors Physicians who treat minors have an ethical duty to promote the developing autonomy of minor patients by involving children in making decisions about their health care to a degree commensurate with the child's abilities. A minor's decision -making capacity depends on many factors, including not only chronological age, but also emotional maturity and the individual's medical experience. Physicians also have a responsibility to protect the confidentiality of minor patients, within certain limits. In some jurisdictions, the law permits minors who are not emancipated to request and receive confidential services relating to contraception, or to pregnancy testing, prenatal care, and Resolution: 015 (A-19) Page 3 of 7 delivery services. S imilarly, jurisdictions may permit unemancipated minors to request and receive confidential care to prevent, diagnose, or treat sexually transmitted disease, substance use disorders, or mental illness. When an unemancipated minor requests confidential care and the law does not grant the minor decision- making authority for that care, physicians should: (a) Inform the patient (and parent or guardian, if present) about circumstances in which the physician is obligated to inform the minor's parent/guardian, inc luding situations when: (i) involving the patient's parent/guardian is necessary to avert life- or health- threatening harm to the patient; (ii) involving the patient's parent/guardian is necessary to avert serious harm to others; (iii) the threat to the patient's health is significant and the physician has no reason to believe that parental involvement will be detrimental to the patient's well - being. (b) Explore the minor patient's reasons for not involving his or her parents (or guardian) and try to corr ect misconceptions that may be motivating the patient's reluctance to involve parents. (c) Encourage the minor patient to involve his or her parents and offer to facilitate conversation between the patient and the parents. (d) Inform the patient that despi te the physician's respect for confidentiality the minor patient's parents/guardians may learn about the request for treatment or testing through other means (e.g., insurance statements). (e) Protect the confidentiality of information disclosed by the pati ent during an exam or interview or in counseling unless the patient consents to disclosure or disclosure is required to protect the interests of others, in keeping with ethical and legal guidelines. (f) Take steps to facilitate a minor patient's decision about health care services when the patient remains unwilling to involve parents or guardians, so long as the patient has appropriate decision- making capacity in the specific circumstances and the physician believes the decision is in the patient's best int erest. Physicians should be aware that states provide mechanisms for unemancipated minors to receive care without parental involvement under conditions that vary from state to state. (g) Consult experts when the patient's decision- making capacity is uncert ain. (h) Inform or refer the patient to alternative confidential services when available if the physician is unwilling to provide services without parental involvement. AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: IV The Opinions in this chapter are offered as ethics guidance for physicians and are not intended to establish standards of clinical practice or rules of law. Issued: 2016 3.1.1 Privacy in Health Care Protecting information gathered in association with the care of the patient is a core value in health care. However, respecting patient privacy in other forms is also f undamental, as an expression of respect for patient autonomy and a prerequisite for trust. Patient privacy encompasses a number of aspects, including personal space (physical privacy), personal data (informational privacy), personal choices including cultural and religious affiliations (decisional privacy), and personal relationships with family members and other intimates (associational privacy). Physicians must seek to protect patient privacy in all settings to the greatest extent possible and should: (a)...Minimize intrusion on privacy when the patients privacy must be balanced against other factors. (b)...Inform the patient when there has been a significant infringement on privacy of which the patient would otherwise not be aware. (c)...Be mindful that individual patients may have special concerns about privacy in any or all of these areas. Resolution: 015 (A-19) Page 4 of 7 AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: I,IV The Opinions in this chapt er are offered as ethics guidance for physicians and are not intended Issued: 2016 Support of Human Rights and Freedom H -65.965 Our AMA: (1) continues to support the dignity of the individual, human rights and the sanctity of human life, (2) reaffirms its long -standing policy that there is no basis for the denial to any human being of equal rights, privileges, and responsibilities commensurate with his or her individual capabilities and ethical character because of an individual's sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or transgender status, race, religion, disability, ethnic origin, national origin, or age; (3) opposes any discrimination based on an individual's sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, religion, disability, ethnic orig in, national origin or age and any other such reprehensible policies; (4) recognizes that hate crimes pose a significant threat to the public health and social welfare of the citizens of the United States, urges expedient passage of appropriate hate crimes prevention legislation in accordance with our AMA's policy through letters to members of Congress; and registers support for hate crimes prevention legislation, via letter, to the President of the United States.

Citation: Res. 05, A -16 Patient Privacy and Confidentiality H -315.983 1. Our AMA affirms the following key principles that should be consistently implemented to evaluate any proposal regarding patient privacy and the confidentiality of medical information: (a) That there exists a basic right of patients to privacy of their medical information and records, and that this right should be explicitly acknowledged; (b) That patients' privacy should be honored unless waived by the patient in a meaningful way or in r are instances when strong countervailing interests in public health or safety justify invasions of patient privacy or breaches of confidentiality, and then only when such invasions or breaches are subject to stringent safeguards enforced by appropriate standards of accountability; (c) That patients' privacy should be honored in the context of gathering and disclosing information for clinical research and quality improvement activities, and that any necessary departures from the preferred practices of obtaining patients' informed consent and of de- identifying all data be strictly controlled; (d) That any information disclosed should be limited to that information, portion of the medical record, or abstract necessary to fulfill the immediate and specific purpose of disclosure; and (e) That the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) be the minimal standard for protecting clinician- patient privilege, regardless of where care is received. 2. Our AMA affirms: (a) that physicians and medical students who are patients are entitled to the same right to privacy and confidentiality of personal medical information and medical records as other patients, (b) that when patients exercise their right to keep their personal medical histories confidential, such action should not be regarded as fraudulent or inappropriate concealment, and (c) that physicians and medical students should not be required to report any aspects of their patients' medical history to governmental agencies or other entities, beyond that which would be required by law. 3. Employers and insurers should be barred from unconsented access to identifiable medical information lest knowledge of sensitive facts form the basis of adverse decisions against Resolution: 015 (A-19) Page 5 of 7 individuals. (a) Release forms t hat authorize access should be explicit about to whom access is being granted and for what purpose, and should be as narrowly tailored as possible. (b) Patients, physicians, and medical students should be educated about the consequences of signing overly -broad consent forms. (c) Employers and insurers should adopt explicit and public policies to assure the security and confidentiality of patients' medical information. (d) A patient's ability to join or a physician's participation in an insurance plan should not be contingent on signing a broad and indefinite consent for release and disclosure. 4. Whenever possible, medical records should be de- identified for purposes of use in connection with utilization review, panel credentialing, quality assurance, and peer review. 5. The fundamental values and duties that guide the safekeeping of medical information should remain constant in this era of computerization. Whether they are in computerized or paper form, it is critical that medical information be accurate, secure, and free from unauthorized access and improper use. 6. Our AMA recommends that the confidentiality of data collected by race and ethnicity as part of the medical record, be maintained. 7. Genetic information should be kept confidential and should not be disclosed to third parties without the explicit informed consent of the tested individual. 8. When breaches of confidentiality are compelled by concerns for public health and safety, those breaches must be as narrow in scope and content as possible, must contain the least identifiable and sensitive information possible, and must be disclosed to the fewest possible to achieve the necessary end. 9. Law enforcement agencies requesting private medical information should be given access to such information only through a court order. This court order for disclosure should be granted only if the law enforcement entity has shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that the information sought is necessary to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry; that the needs of the law enforcement authority cannot be satisfied by non- identifiable health information or by any other information; and that the law enforcement need for the information outweighs the privacy interest of the individual to whom the information pertains. These records should be subject to stringent security measures. 10. Our AMA must guard against the imposition of unduly restrictive barriers to patient records that would impede or prevent access to data needed for medical or public health research or quality improvement and accreditation activities. Whenever possible, de -identified data should be used for these purposes. In those contexts where personal identification is essential for the collation of data, review of identifiable data should not take place without an institutional review board (IRB) approved justification for the retention of identifiers and the consent of the patient. In those cases where obtaining patient consent for disclosure is impracticable, our AMA endorses the oversight and accounta bility provided by an IRB. 11. Marketing and commercial uses of identifiable patients' medical information may violate principles of informed consent and patient confidentiality. Patients divulge information to their physicians only for purposes of diagnos is and treatment. If other uses are to be made of the information, patients must first give their uncoerced permission after being fully informed about the purpose of such disclosures 12. Our AMA, in collaboration with other professional organizations, pat ient advocacy groups and the public health community, should continue its advocacy for privacy and confidentiality regulations, including: (a) The establishment of rules allocating liability for disclosure of identifiable patient medical information between physicians and the health plans of which they are a part, and securing appropriate physicians' control over the disposition of information from their patients' medical records. (b) The establishment of rules to prevent disclosure of identifiable patient medical information for commercial and marketing purposes; and (c) The establishment of penalties for negligent or deliberate breach of confidentiality or violation of patient privacy rights. 13. Our AMA will pursue an aggressive agenda to educate patients , the public, physicians and Resolution: 015 (A-19) Page 6 of 7 policymakers at all levels of government about concerns and complexities of patient privacy and confidentiality in the variety of contexts mentioned. 14. Disclosure of personally identifiable patient information to public healt h physicians and departments is appropriate for the purpose of addressing public health emergencies or to comply with laws regarding public health reporting for the purpose of disease surveillance. 15. In the event of the sale or discontinuation of a medic al practice, patients should be notified whenever possible and asked for authorization to transfer the medical record to a new physician or care provider. Only de- identified and/or aggregate data should be used for \"business decisions,\" including sales, mergers, and similar business transactions when ownership or control of medical records changes hands. 16. The most appropriate jurisdiction for considering physician breaches of patient confidentiality is the relevant state medical practice act. Knowing and intentional breaches of patient confidentiality, particularly under false pretenses, for malicious harm, or for monetary gain, represents a violation of the professional practice of medicine. 17. Our AMA Board of Trustees will actively monitor and support legislation at the federal level that will afford patients protection against discrimination on the basis of genetic testing. 18. Our AMA supports privacy standards that would require pharmacies to obtain a prior written and signed consent from patients t o use their personal data for marketing purposes. 19. Our AMA supports privacy standards that require pharmacies and drug store chains to disclose the source of financial support for drug mailings or phone calls. 20. Our AMA supports privacy standards that would prohibit pharmacies from using prescription refill reminders or disease management programs as an opportunity for marketing purposes. 21.Our AMA will draft model state legislation requiring consent of all parties to the recording of a physician- patient conversation.

When, in the opinion of the physician, parental involvement would not be beneficial, parental consent or notification should not be a barrier to care; (4) urges physicians to discuss their policies about confidentiality with parents and the adolescent patient, as well as conditions under which confidentiality would be abrogated. This Resolution: 015 (A-19) Page 7 of 7 discussion should include possible arrangements for the adolescent to have independent access to health care (including financial arrangements); (5) encourages physicians to offer adolescents an opportunity for examination and counseling apart from parents. The same confidentiality will be preserved between the adolescent patient and physician as between the parent (or responsible adult) and the physician; (6) encourages state and county medical societies to become aware of the nature and effect of laws and regulations regarding confidential health services for adolescents in their respective jurisdictions. State medical societies should provide this information to physicians to clarify services that may be legally provided on a confidential basis; (7) urges undergraduate and graduate medical education programs and continuing education programs to inform physicians about issues surrounding minors' consent and confidential care, including relevant law and implementation into practice; (8) encourages health care payers to develop a method of listing of services which preserves confidentiality for adolescents; and (9) encourages medical societies to evaluate laws on consent and confidential care for adolescents and to help eliminate laws which restrict the availability of confidential care.

Our AMA: (a) believes that the physician's nonjudgmental recognition of patients' sexual orientations, sexual behaviors, and gender identities enhances the ability to render optimal patient care in health as well as in illness. In the case of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, and other (LGBTQ) patients, this recognition is especially important to address the specific health care needs of people who are or may be LGBTQ; (b) is committed to taking a leadership role in: (i) educating physicians on the current state of research in and knowledge of LGBTQ Health and the need to elicit relevant gender and sexuality information from our patients; these efforts should start in medical school, but must also be a part of continuing medical education; (ii) educating physicians to recognize the physical and psychological needs of LGBTQ patients; (iii) encouraging the development of educat ional programs in LGBTQ Health; (iv) encouraging physicians to seek out local or national experts in the health care needs of LGBTQ people so that all physicians will achieve a better understanding of the medical needs of these populations; and (v) working with LGBTQ communities to offer physicians the opportunity to better understand the medical needs of LGBTQ patients; and (c) opposes, the use of \"reparative\" or \"conversion\" therapy for sexual orientation or gender identity. 2. Our AMA will collaborate wi th our partner organizations to educate physicians regarding: (i) the need for sexual and gender minority individuals to undergo regular cancer and sexually transmitted infection screenings based on anatomy due to their comparable or elevated risk for these conditions; and (ii) the need for comprehensive screening for sexually transmitted diseases in men who have sex with men; (iii) appropriate safe sex techniques to avoid the risk for sexually transmitted diseases; and (iv) that individuals who identify as a sexual and/or gender minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning individuals) experience intimate partner violence, and how sexual and gender minorities present with intimate partner violence differs from their cisgender, heterosexual peers and may have unique complicating factors. 3. Our AMA will continue to work alongside our partner organizations, including GLMA, to increase physician competency on LGBTQ health issues. 4. Our AMA will continue to explore opportunities to collabora te with other organizations, focusing on issues of mutual concern in order to provide the most comprehensive and up- to- date education and information to enable the provision of high quality and culturally competent care to LGBTQ people.

Citation: (Res. 512, A -11 Comparative Effectiveness Research H -460.909 The following Principles for Creating a Centralized Comparative Effectiveness Research Entity are the official policy of our AMA: PRINCIPLES FOR CREATING A CENTRALIZED COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH ENTITY: A. Value. Value can be thought of as the best balance between benefits and costs, and better value as improved clinical outcomes, quality, and/or patient satisfaction per dollar spent. Improving value in the US health care system will require both clinical and cost information. Quality comparative clinical effectiveness research (CER) will improve health care value by enhancing physician clinical judgment and fostering the delivery of patient -centered care. B. Independence. A federally sponsored CER entity should be an objective, independent authority that produces valid, scientifically rigorous research. C. Stable Funding. The entity should have secure and sufficient funding in order to maintain the necessary infrastructure and resources to produce quality CER. Funding source(s) must safeguard the independence of a federally sponsored C ER entity. D. Rigorous Scientifically Sound Methodology. CER should be conducted using rigorous scientific methods to ensure that conclusions from such research are evidence- based and valid for the population studied. The primary responsibility for the conduct of CER and selection of CER methodologies must rest with physicians and researchers. E. Transparent Process. The processes for setting research priorities, establishing accepted methodologies, selecting researchers or research organizations, and disse minating findings must be transparent and provide physicians and researchers a central and significant role. F. Significant Patient and Physician Oversight Role. The oversight body of the CER entity must provide patients, physicians (MD, DO), including cli nical practice physicians, and independent scientific researchers with substantial representation and a central decision- making role(s). Both physicians and patients are uniquely motivated to provide/receive quality care while maximizing value. G. Conflict s of Interest Disclosed and Minimized. All conflicts of interest must be disclosed and safeguards developed to minimize actual, potential and perceived conflicts of interest to ensure that stakeholders with such conflicts of interest do not undermine the i ntegrity and legitimacy of the research findings and conclusions. H. Scope of Research. CER should include long term and short term assessments of diagnostic and treatment modalities for a given disease or condition in a defined population of patients. Diagnostic and treatment modalities should include drugs, biologics, imaging and laboratory tests, medical devices, health services, or combinations. It should not be limited to new treatments. In addition, the findings should be re- evaluated periodically, as needed, based on the development of new alternatives and the emergence of new safety or efficacy data. The priority areas of CER should be on high volume, high cost diagnosis, treatment, and health services for which there is significant variation in prac tice. Research priorities and methodology should factor in any systematic variations in disease prevalence or response across groups by race, ethnicity, gender, age, geography, and economic status. I. Dissemination of Research. The CER entity must work wit h health care professionals and health care professional organizations to effectively disseminate the results in a timely manner by significantly expanding dissemination capacity and intensifying efforts to communicate to Resolution: 016 (A-19) Page 5 of 5 physicians utilizing a variety of strategies and methods. All research findings must be readily and easily accessible to physicians as well as the public without limits imposed by the federally supported CER entity. The highest priority should be placed on targeting health care professionals and their organizations to ensure rapid dissemination to those who develop diagnostic and treatment plans. J. Coverage and Payment. The CER entity must not have a role in making or recommending coverage or payment decisions for payers. K. Patient Variat ion and Physician Discretion. Physician discretion in the treatment of individual patients remains central to the practice of medicine. CER evidence cannot adequately address the wide array of patients with their unique clinical characteristics, co- morbidi ties and certain genetic characteristics. In addition, patient autonomy and choice may play a significant role in both CER findings and diagnostic/treatment planning in the clinical setting. As a result, sufficient information should be made available on t he limitations and exceptions of CER studies so that physicians who are making individualized treatment plans will be able to differentiate patients to whom the study findings apply from those for whom the study is not representative.

Encourages all physicians caring for the elderly to becom e more proactive in recognizing and treating vulnerable elders who may be victims of mistreatment through prevention and early identification of risk factors in all care settings. Encourage physicians to participate in medical case management and APS teams and assume greater roles as medical advisors to APS services. 2. Promotes collaboration with the Liaison Committee on Medical Education and the Association of American Medical Colleges, as well as the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation and American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, in establishing training in elder mistreatment for all medical students; such training could be accomplished by local arrangements with the state APS teams to provide student rotations on their teams. Physician responsibility in cases of elder mistreatment could be part of the educational curriculum on professionalism and incorporated into questions on the US Medical Licensing Examination and Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination. 3. Encourages the development of curricula at the residency level and collaboration with residency review committees, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, specialty boards, and Maintenance of Certification programs on the recognition of elder mistreatment and appropriate referrals and treatment. 4. Encourages substantially more research in the area of elder mistreatment. 5. Encourages the US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protections, which provides over sight for institutional review boards, and the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs to collaborate on establishing guidelines and protocols to address the issue of vulnerable subjects and research subject surrogates, so t hat research in the area of elder mistreatment can proceed. 6. Encourages a national effort to reach consensus on elder mistreatment definitions and rigorous objective measurements so that interventions and outcomes of treatment can be evaluated. 7. Encourages adoption of legislation, such as the Elder Justice Act, that promotes clinical, research, and educational programs in the prevention, detection, treatment, and intervention of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Citation: (CSAPH Rep. 7, A -08; Re affirmed: CMS Rep. 8, I -13 Elder Mistreatment H -515.961 Our AMA recognizes: (1) elder mistreatment as a serious and pervasive public health problem that requires an organized effort from physicians and all medical professionals to improve the timely recognition and provision of clinical care in vulnerable elders who experience mistreatment; and (2) the importance of an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to this issue, and encourage states to bring together teams with representatives from medicine, nursing, social work, adult protective services (APS), criminal and civil law, and law enforcement to develop appropriate interventions and evaluate their effectiveness. Citation: CSAPH Rep. 7, A -08; Reaffirmed: CSAPH Rep. 01, A -18 Health Care Costs of Violence and Abuse Across the Lifespan D -515.984 1. Our AMA urges the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to continue to study the impact and health care costs of violence and abuse across the lifespan. 2. Our AMA encourages the National Institutes of Health, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research on the cost savings resulting from health interventions on violence and abuse. 3. Our AMA encourages the appropriate federal agencies to increase funding for research on the impact and health care costs of elder mistreatment. Citation: Res. 431, A -08; Modified: CSAPH Rep. 01, A -18 Family and Intimate Partner Violence H -515.965 (1) Our AMA believes that all forms of family and intimate partner violence are major public health issues and urges the profession, both individually and collectively, to work with other interested parties to prevent such violence and to address the needs of victims. Physicians have a major role in lessening the prevalence, scope and severity of child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and elder abuse, all of which fall under the rubric of family violence. To support physicians in practice, our AMA will continue to Resolution: 017 (A-19) Page 4 of 6 campaign against fami ly violence and remains open to working with all interested parties to address violence in US society. Our AMA's efforts will be guided, in part, by its Advisory Council on Family Violence. (2) Our AMA believes that all physicians should be trained in issues of family and intimate partner violence through undergraduate and graduate medical education as well as continuing professional development. The AMA, working with state, county and specialty medical societies as well as academic medical centers and other appropriate groups such as the Association of American Medical Colleges, should develop and disseminate model curricula on violence for incorporation into undergraduate and graduate medical education, and all parties should work for the rapid distribution and adoption of such curricula when developed. These curricula should include coverage of the diagnosis, treatment, and reporting of child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and elder abuse and provide training on interviewing techniques, risk assessment, safety planning, and procedures for linking with resources to assist victims. Our AMA supports the inclusion of questions on family violence issues on licensure and certification tests. (3) The prevalence of family violence is sufficiently high and its ongoing character is such that physicians, particularly physicians providing primary care, will encounter victims on a regular basis. Persons in clinical settings are more likely to have experienced intimate partner and family violence than non- clinic al populations. Thus, to improve clinical services as well as the public health, our AMA encourages physicians to: (a) Routinely inquire about the family violence histories of their patients as this knowledge is essential for effective diagnosis and care; (b) Upon identifying patients currently experiencing abuse or threats from intimates, assess and discuss safety issues with the patient before he or she leaves the office, working with the patient to develop a safety or exit plan for use in an emergency si tuation and making appropriate referrals to address intervention and safety needs as a matter of course; (c) After diagnosing a violence- related problem, refer patients to appropriate medical or health care professionals and/or community -based trauma- speci fic resources as soon as possible; (d) Have written lists of resources available for victims of violence, providing information on such matters as emergency shelter, medical assistance, mental health services, protective services and legal aid; (e) Screen patients for psychiatric sequelae of violence and make appropriate referrals for these conditions upon identifying a history of family or other interpersonal violence; (f) Become aware of local resources and referral sources that have expertise in dealing with trauma from victimization; (g) Be alert to men presenting with injuries suffered as a result of intimate violence because these men may require intervention as either victims or abusers themselves; (h) Give due validation to the experience of victimiz ation and of observed symptomatology as possible sequelae; (i) Record a patient's victimization history, observed traumata potentially linked to the victimization, and referrals made; (j) Become involved in appropriate local programs designed to prevent vi olence and its effects at the community level; (4) Within the larger community, our AMA: (a) Urges hospitals, community mental health agencies, and other helping professions to develop appropriate interventions for all victims of intimate violence. Such interventions might include individual and group counseling efforts, support groups, and shelters. (b) Believes it is critically important that programs be available for victims and perpetrators of intimate violence. (c) Believes that state and county medical societies should convene or join state and local health departments, criminal justice and social service agencies, and local school boards to collaborate in the development and support of violence control and prevention activities. (5) With respect to is sues of reporting, our AMA strongly supports mandatory reporting of suspected or actual child maltreatment and urges state societies to support legislation mandating physician reporting of elderly abuse in states where such legislation does not currently exist. At the same time, our AMA opposes the adoption of mandatory reporting laws for physicians treating competent, non- elderly adult victims of intimate partner violence if the required reports identify victims. Such laws violate basic tenets of medical ethics. If and where mandatory reporting statutes dealing with competent adults are adopted, the AMA believes the laws must incorporate provisions that: (a) do not require the inclusion of victims' identities; (b) allow competent adult victims to opt out of the reporting system if identifiers are required; Resolution: 017 (A-19) Page 5 of 6 (c) provide that reports be made to public health agencies for surveillance purposes only; (d) contain a sunset mechanism; and (e) evaluate the efficacy of those laws. State societies are encouraged to ens ure that all mandatory reporting laws contain adequate protections for the reporting physician and to educate physicians on the particulars of the laws in their states. (6) Substance abuse and family violence are clearly connected. For this reason, our AMA believes that: (a) Given the association between alcohol and family violence, physicians should be alert for the presence of one behavior given a diagnosis of the other. Thus, a physician with patients with alcohol problems should screen for family violence, while physicians with patients presenting with problems of physical or sexual abuse should screen for alcohol use. (b) Physicians should avoid the assumption that if they treat the problem of alcohol or substance use and abuse they also will be treating and possibly preventing family violence. (c) Physicians should be alert to the association, especially among female patients, between current alcohol or drug problems and a history of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse. The association is strong enough to warrant complete screening for past or present physical, emotional, or sexual abuse among patients who present with alcohol or drug problems. (d) Physicians should be informed about the possible pharmacological link between amphetamine use and human vi olent behavior. The suggestive evidence about barbiturates and amphetamines and violence should be followed up with more research on the possible causal connection between these drugs and violent behavior. (e) The notion that alcohol and controlled drugs c ause violent behavior is pervasive among physicians and other health care providers. Training programs for physicians should be developed that are based on empirical data and sound theoretical formulations about the relationships among alcohol, drug use, a nd violence. Citation: (CSA Rep. 7, I -00; Reaffirmed: CSAPH Rep. 2, I -09 E-8.10 Preventing, Identifying and Treating Violence and Abuse All patients may be at risk for interpersonal violence and abuse, which may adversely affect their health or ability to adhere to medical recommendations. In light of their obligation to promote the well -being of patients, physicians have an ethical obligation to take appropriate action to avert the harms caused by violence and abuse. To protect patientswell -being, physici ans individually should: (a) Become familiar with: (i) how to detect violence or abuse, including cultural variations in response to abuse; (ii) community and health resources available to abused or vulnerable persons; (iii) public health measures that are effective in preventing violence and abuse; (iv) legal requirements for reporting violence or abuse. (b) Consider abuse as a possible factor in the presentation of medical complaints. (c) Routinely inquire about physical, sexual, and psychological abuse as part of the medical history. (d) Not allow diagnosis or treatment to be influenced by misconceptions about abuse, including beliefs that abuse is rare, does not occur in normalfamilies, is a private matter best resolved without outside interference, or i s caused by victimsown actions. (e) Treat the immediate symptoms and sequelae of violence and abuse and provide ongoing care for patients to address long- term consequences that may arise from being exposed to violence and abuse. (f) Discuss any suspicion o f abuse sensitively with the patient, whether or not reporting is legally mandated, and direct the patient to appropriate community resources. (g) Report suspected violence and abuse in keeping with applicable requirements. Before doing so, physicians should: (i) inform patients about requirements to report; (ii) obtain the patients informed consent when reporting is not required by law. Exceptions can be made if a physician reasonably believes that a patients refusal to authorize reporting is coerced and t herefore does not constitute a valid informed treatment decision. (h) Protect patient privacy when reporting by disclosing only the minimum necessary information. Collectively, physicians should: (i) Advocate for comprehensive training in matters pertaining to violence and abuse across the continuum of professional education. Resolution: 017 (A-19) Page 6 of 6 (j) Provide leadership in raising awareness about the need to assess and identify signs of abuse, including advocating for guidelines and policies to reduce the volume of unidentified cases and help ensure that all patients are appropriately assessed. (k) Advocate for mechanisms to direct physicians to community or private resources that might be available to aid their patients. (l) Support research in the prevention of violence and abuse and collaborate with public health and community organizations to reduce violence and abuse. (m) Advocate for change in mandatory reporting laws if evidence indicates that such reporting is not in the best interests of patients. AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: I,III The Opinions in this chapter are offered as ethics guidance for physicians and are not intended to establish standards of clinical practice or rules of law. Issued: 2016 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 018 (A-19) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Support for Requiring Investigations into Deaths of Children in Foster Care Referred to: Reference Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws (William Reha, MD, MBA , Chair) Whereas, Around 670,000 children in the U.S will spend time in foster care in any given year, 1 and the number of children in foster care has been increasing since 2012 1-4; and 2 3 Whereas, Children in foster care are one of the most vulnerable populations, oft en suffering 4 from a higher likelihood of early adverse childhood experiences and disproportionately affected 5 by lack of appropriate housing, behavioral problems, and the disparities associated with minority 6 populations2,8-10; 7 8 Whereas, A series of highly -publicized episodes of abuse, neglect, and child deaths in the for - 9 profit foster care system prompted the Senate Finance Committee to conduct an investigation 10 into the privatization of foster care services, and the Committee published a report of their 11 findings in 20173,5,6; and 12 13 Whereas, The Senate Finance Committee report found that children in the foster care system 14 die at an alarmingly high rate that is 42% higher than the national death rate for children with 15 similar health conditions and risk factors , and 70% of these deaths were unexpected3,7; and 16 17 Whereas, These deaths were often found to have occurred in cases in which children had been 18 placed with foster parents who had a record of abuse;3,5 and 19 20 Whereas, In some cases children were placed in homes with individuals convicted of kidnapping 21 and other serious crimes, with individual s who had substance abuse problems, and in the care 22 of caretakers who had previously failed foster care placements;3,5,6,7 and 23 24 Whereas, Investigations were conducted in only 15% of deaths with no subsequent action or 25 autopsy performed in all other deaths3,7; and 26 27 Whereas, The report found that policies and procedures meant to monitor child welfare and 28 providers' performance and outcomes were not consistently followed3; and 29 30 Whereas, AMA policy H -515.960 exhorts \"physicians [to] act as advocates for children, and as 31 such, have a responsibility legally and otherwise, to protect children when there is a suspicion of 32 abuse\"; therefore be it 33 34 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support legislation requiring investigations 35 into the deaths of children in the foster care system that occur while the child is in the foster 36 care system.

Citation: Res. 907, I -17 Identifying and Reporting Suspected Child Abuse H -515.960 1. Our American Medical Association recognizes that suspected child abuse is being underrepor ted by physicians. 2. Our AMA supports development of a comprehensive educational strategy across the continuum of professional development that is designed to improve the detection, reporting, and treatment of child maltreatment. Training should include s pecific knowledge about child protective services policies, services, impact on families, and outcomes of intervention. 3. Our AMA supports the concept that physicians act as advocates for children, and as such, have a responsibility legally and otherwise, to protect children when there is a suspicion of abuse. 4. Our AMA recognizes the need for ongoing studies to better understand physicians failure to recognize and report suspected child abuse. 5. Our AMA acknowledges that conflicts often exist between physicians and child protective services, and that physicians and child protective services should work more collaboratively, including the joint development of didactic programs designed to foster increased interaction and to minimize conflicts or distrust. 6. Our AMA supports efforts to develop multidisciplinary centers of excellence and adequately trained clinical response teams to foster the appropriate evaluation, reporting, management, and support of child abuse victims. 7. Our AMA encourages all state departments of protective services to have a medical director or other liaison who communicates with physicians and other health care providers. 8. Our AMA will support state and federal -run child protective services in reporting child abuse and neglect in the military to the Family Advocacy Program within the Department of Defense. Citation: CSAPH Rep. 2, I -09; Appended: Res. 411, A -18 Family Violence -Adolescents as Victims and Perpetrators H -515.981 The AMA (1) (a) encourages physicians to screen adolesc ents about a current or prior history of maltreatment. Special attention should be paid to screening adolescents with a history of alcohol and drug misuse, irresponsible sexual behavior, eating disorders, running away, suicidal behaviors, conduct disorders , or psychiatric disorders for prior occurrences of maltreatment; and (b) urges physicians to consider issues unique to adolescents when screening youths for abuse or neglect. (2) encourages state medical society violence prevention committees to work with child protective service agencies to develop specialized services for maltreated adolescents, including better access to health services, improved foster care, expanded shelter and independent living facilities, and treatment programs. (3) will investigat e research and resources on effective parenting of adolescents to identify ways in which physicians can promote parenting styles that reduce stress Resolution: 018 (A-19) Page 3 of 3 and promote optimal development. (4) will alert the national school organizations to the increasing incidenc e of adolescent maltreatment and the need for training of school staff to identify and refer victims of maltreatment. (5) urges youth correctional facilities to screen incarcerated youth for a current or prior history of abuse or neglect and to refer maltr eated youth to appropriate medical or mental health treatment programs. (6) encourages the National Institutes of Health and other organizations to expand continued research on adolescent initiation of violence and abuse to promote understanding of how to prevent future maltreatment and family violence. Citation: (CSA Rep. I, CSA Rep. 8, A -03; Modified: CSAPH Rep. 1, A -13 Importance of Autopsies H -85.954 1. Our AMA supports seeking the cooperation of the National Advisory Council on Aging of the National Institutes of Health in recommending to physicians, hospitals, institutes of scientific learning, universities, and most importantly the American people t he necessity of autopsy for pathological correlation of the results of the immeasurable scientific advancements which have occurred in recent years. Our AMA believes that the information garnered from such stringent scientific advancements and correlation, as well as coalitions, should be used in the most advantageous fashion; and that the conclusions obtained from such investigations should be widely shared with the medical and research community and should be interpreted by these groups with the utmost sc rutiny and objectivity. 2. Our AMA: (a) supports the efforts of the Institute of Medicine and other national organizations in formulating national policies to modernize and promote the use of autopsy to meet present and future needs of society; (b) promot es the use of updated autopsy protocols for medical research, particularly in the areas of cancer, cardiovascular, occupational, and infectious diseases; (c) promotes the revision of standards of accreditation for medical undergraduate and graduate educati on programs to more fully integrate autopsy into the curriculum and require postmortems as part of medical educational programs; (d) encourages the use of a national computerized autopsy data bank to validate technological methods of diagnosis for medical research and to validate death certificates for public health and the benefit of the nation; (e) requests The Joint Commission to consider amending the Accreditation Manual for Hospitals to require that the complete autopsy report be made part of the medic al record within 30 days after the postmortem; (f) supports the formalization of methods of reimbursement for autopsy in order to identify postmortem examinations as medical prerogatives and necessary medical procedures; (g) promotes programs of education for physicians to inform them of the value of autopsy for medical legal purposes and claims processing, to learn the likelihood of effects of disease on other family members, to establish the cause of death when death is unexplained or poorly understood, t o establish the protective action of necropsy in litigation, and to inform the bereaved families of the benefits of autopsy; and (h) promotes the incorporation of updated postmortem examinations into risk management and quality assurance programs in hospit als. 3. Our AMA reaffirms the fundamental importance of the autopsy in any effective hospital quality assurance program, and urges physicians and hospitals to increase the utilization of the autopsy so as to further advance the cause of medical education, research and quality assurance. 4. Our AMA representatives to the Liaison Committee on Medical Education ask that autopsy rates and student participation in autopsies continue to be monitored periodically and that the reasons that schools do or do not require attendance be collected. Our AMA will continue to work with other interested groups to increase the rate of autopsy attendance. 5. Our AMA requests that the National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA) and other accrediting bodies encourage the per formance of autopsies to yield benchmark information for all managed care entities seeking accreditation. 6. Our AMA calls upon all third party payers, including CMS, to provide adequate payment directly for autopsies, and encourages adequate reimbursement by all third party payers for autopsies. 7. It is the policy of our AMA: (a) that the performance of autopsies constitutes the practice of medicine; and (b) in conjunction with the pathology associations represented in the AMA House, to continue to implement all the recommendations regarding the effects of decreased utilization of autopsy on medical education and research, quality assurance programs, insurance claims processing, and cost containment. 8. Our AMA affirms the importance of autopsies and oppo ses the use of any financial incentives for physicians who acquire autopsy clearance.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Blood Doping H -470.978 The AMA believes that a physician who participates in blood doping is deviating from his professional responsibility and that blood doping must be considered in the category of unnecessary medical services.

Our AMA supports policies that allow for a change of sex designation on birth certificates for transgender individuals based upon verification by a physician (MD or DO) that the individual has undergone gender transition according to applicable medical standar ds of care. 2. Our AMA: (a) supports elimination of any requirement that individuals undergo gender affirmation surgery in order to change their sex designation on birth certificates and supports modernizing state vital statistics statutes to ensure accurate gender markers on birth certificates; and (b) supports that any change of sex designation on an individual's birth certificate not hinder access to medically appropriate preventive care. Citation: (Res. 4, A -13; Appended: BOT Rep. 26, A -14 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 020 (A-19) Introduced by: New Mexico Subject: Request to the AMA Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs (CEJA) to Consider Specific Changes to the Code of Medical Ethics Opinion E -5.7, \"Physician -Assisted Suicide\", in Order to R emove Inherent Conflicts Within the Code, to Delete Pejorative, Stigmatizing Language, and to A dopt an Ethical Position of Engaged Neutrality Referred to: Refer ence Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws (William Reha, MD, MBA, Chair) Whereas, Our American Medical Association House of Delegates at the 2018 Interim Meeting 1 rejected the recommendation in CEJA Report 2-I-18 that the Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 2 E-5.7 \"Physician -Assisted Suicide\" (PAS) not be amended, and therefore did not adopt CEJA 3 Report 2-I-18; and 4 5 Whereas, 6 The Code of Medical Ethics Opinion E-5.7 1 states, 'Physician -assisted suicide is 7 fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer, would be difficult or 8 impossible to control, and would pose serious societal risks\" - a characterization that 9 clearly expresses the opinion that PAS is unethical; yet, 10 The Code of Medical Ethics Opinion E-1.1.7 2 \"Physician Exercise of Conscience\" creates 11 the clear understanding, not disputed by CEJA, that physicians participating in PAS are 12 acting based on a thoughtful moral basis that is not outside the boundaries of ethical 13 behavior; thereby, 14 Creating an inherent contradiction within the Code of Medical Ethics: that physicians may 15 ethically participate in something that is described as unethical; and 16 17 Whereas, It is important to recognize that ethical physicians can disagree, but that all 18 perspectives be respected and none disparaged; and 19 20 Whereas, In addition to the inherent contradiction noted above, the decision that \"the Code of 21 Medical Ethics not be amended\" is not consistent with the tenor of CEJA Report 2, and does not 22 adequately address concerns about the implications of existing language in Opinion E-5.7; and 23 24 Whereas, The terms that stakeholders use to refer to the practice of physicians prescribing 25 lethal medication to be self-administered by terminally ill patients reflect differing ethical 26 perspectives, for the purposes of this resolution where existing language is not being cited, we 27 have chosen to use \"Physician -Assisted Dying\" (PAD) as adopted by the American Academy of 28 Hospice and Palliative Medicine3 as being much more consistent with the goal of being 29 respectful and non-disparaging; and 30 31 Whereas, CEJA Report 2 cites a specific example of irreconcilable differences in principled core 32 beliefs, but neglects to note that CEJA in that instanc e had very wisely adopted a non- 33 judgmental and non-stigmatizing approach that has served the profession well; and 34 Resolution: 020 (A-19) Page 2 of 3 Whereas, PAD is a decision made by a competent adult about how, when, where and with 1 whom to end life in the face of an irreversible terminal illness where continued living is not an 2 option, and therefore is not equivalent to or appropriately described as \"suicide\", which can be 3 most accurately defined as a decision by a person to take his or her own life rather than to 4 continue living; and 5 6 Whereas, The American Association of Suicidology, in a treatise cited by CEJA12, clearly states 7 that, \"Suicide and physician aid in dying are conceptually, medically, and legally different 8 phenomena... the term 'physician- assisted suicide' in itself constitutes a critical reason why 9 these distinct death categories are so often conflated, and should be deleted from use.\"; and 10 11 Whereas , Eight states and a federal district currently authorize PAD as an end-of-life option, 12 making PAD available to 21% of Americans, and sixteen additional states have introduced 13 legislation to enact it; and 14 15 Whereas , As determined by numerous polls and surveys, the overwhelming majority of the 16 public, consistently over 70% 4, supports PAD; and 17 18 Whereas, National surveys5,6,7,8,11 of physicians demonstrate increasing support for PAD (from 19 46% in 2010 to 57% in 2016) and decreasing opposition to PAD (from 41% in 2010 to 29% in 20 2016); and 21 22 Whereas, Surveys of physicians conducted by the Colorado Medical Society 6, the Maryland 23 State Medical Society 7, and the Massachusetts Medical Society8 found majorities in support of 24 PAD (56%, 54%, and 60% respectively); and 25 26 Whereas, There is no empirical evidence to substantiate the current description of PAD in 27 Opinion E-5.7 as a form of abandonment \"of a patient once it is determined that cure is 28 impossible\", and in fact CEJA acknowledges that PAD is also considered to be \"an expression 29 of care and compassion\"; and 30 31 Whereas, Claims in the Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 5-7 that characterize PAD as \"difficult or 32 impossible to control\", causing \"more harm than good,\" and posing \"serious societal risks\", are 33 unsubstantiated and speculative based on data reviews 9 cited in CEJA Report -2 that find 34 conflicting interpretations but no definitive evidence to justify concerns for potential abuse; and 35 36 Whereas, It is widely acknowledged by patients, physicians and ethicists that suffering is not 37 limited to physical pain, but equally includes emotional suffering due to loss of autonomy, and a 38 loss of control over one's destiny while an opportunity for such control clearly exists, as 39 evidenced by overwhelming attestations on the part of patients who have chosen the option of 40 PAD as having a sense of enormous relief and comfort, even by patients who in the end never 41 take the cocktail they've been prescribed; and 42 43 Whereas , \"Engaged Neutrality\"10 is a position that is neither \"pro\" nor \"con\", but allows for the 44 expression of diverse views while ensuring safeguards and appropriate standards, educating 45 the public, care givers and physicians, and protecting physicians' freedom to participate in or opt 46 out of PAD according to their own personal values; therefore be it 47 Resolution: 020 (A-19) Page 3 of 3 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association Council on Judicial and Ethical Affairs be 1 strongly encouraged to remove from the Code of Medical Ethics Opinion E-5.7 \"Physician - 2 Assisted Suicide\" judgmental, stigmatizing language that is not evidence based, is at odds with 3 the conclusions of CEJA Report 2 in recognizing shared values of care, compassion, respect 4 and dignity, and creates an ethical conflict with the Code of Medical Ethics Opinion E-1.1.7 5 \"Physician Exercise of Conscience\"; specifically by: 6 7 (a) Deleting all references to \"suicide\", including \"Physician -assisted suicide\" and replacing 8 such language by referring to \"Physician -assisted dying (PAD)\"; 9 (b) Deleting language that suggests that PAD is a form of doing harm and is therefore 10 antithetical to the admonition to \"do no harm\", such as \"assisted suicide would ultimately 11 cause more harm than good\"; 12 (c) Deleting language that characterizes PAD as a choice by a patient \"that death is preferable 13 to life\" and replacing that language with a description of PAD as giving a terminally ill patient 14 the option of being in control of the manner of his or her death, without assigning a value 15 judgment to that option; 16 (d) Deleting language that characterizes PAD as \"fundamentally incompatible with the 17 physician's role as healer\", and instead recognizing that a physician who participates in PAD 18 is doing so as an act of compassion and caring for patients who have no prospect of healing 19 their fatal illness; 20 (e) Delete language that suggests that PAD is not compatible with \"respondi ng to the needs of 21 patients at the end of life\" or that PAD is \"abandonment\" (Directive to Take Action) ; and be it 22 further 23 24 RESOLVED , In recognition of the fact that highly ethical physicians may have differing opinions 25 on Physician Assi sted Dying (PAD), but also in recognition of our respect for patient autonomy 26 and the growing numbers of patients who wish to exercise choice over the manner of imminent 27 death, that our American Medical Association's Council on Judicial and Ethical Affairs (CEJA) 28 be strongly encouraged to modify Code of Medical Ethics Opinion E -5.7 \"Physicians -Assisted 29 Suicide\" to follow the lead of a number of state and national medical societies by adopting the 30 ethical position of \"Engaged Neutrality\", defined as neither in favor of nor or in opposition to 31 PAD, while providing reassurance that our AMA will be a resource to lawmakers, physicians and 32 the public to ensure compliance with standards of lawful medical practice, and to protect 33 physicians' freedom to participate or not participate in PAD in accordance with their personal 34 beliefs and our AMA's Opinion E -1.1.7 \"Physician Exercise of Conscience\".

This renders hospital emergency services 19 as the only option for care; and 20 21 Whereas, While emergency departments are mandated to provide coverage through the 1986 22 Emer gency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) for emergent dialysis, they can 23 only provide one to two sessions per week (rather than the recommended three sessions per 24 week) and even then, high demand compromises the availability of dialysis chairs ; and 25 26 Whereas, With a lack of consistent access to dialysis, many patients have experienced multiple 27 cardiac arrests and resuscitations and severe psychosocial distress leading to significant, 28 debilitating, and long -term health consequences that add further cost and burden to the health 29 care system; and 30 31 Whereas, Emergency -only hemodialysis patients experienced a five- year mortality rate greater 32 than 14 -fold higher than patients undergoing scheduled maintenance dialysis, more ICU 33 admissions, and an almost 10 -fold greater use of acute- care days; and 34 35 Whereas, Emergency -only dialysis annually costs approximately $285,000 per patient versus 36 $77,000 per patient for scheduled maintenance dialysis; and 37 Resolution: 121 (A-19) Page 2 of 3 Whereas, H.R.2644, the Chronic Kidney Disease Improvement in Research and Treatment Act 1 of 2017, was proposed \"to understand the progression of kidney disease and the treatment of 2 kidney failure in minority populations and improve access to kidney disease treatment for those 3 in underserved rural and urban areas;\" and 4 5 Whereas, Eleven states and the District of Columbia are currently using state funding to provide 6 undocumented persons with some maintenance dialysis coverage, including California which 7 has changed its Medicaid policy to include \"acute, ongoing, and mai ntenance renal 8 hemodialysis\" in its coverage of emergency services; and 9 10 Whereas, The Renal Physicians Association's position on dialysis of undocumented individuals 11 is as follows: \"The federal government has a responsibility to provide care for all patients within 12 the borders of the United States, and the financial burden of care provided to citizens and 13 noncitizens is both a federal and state responsibility...difficult access to or denial of dialysis 14 services will invariably hasten the patient's demise and ultimate death;\" therefore be it 15 16 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association work with the Centers for Medicare and 17 Medicaid Services and other relevant stakeholders to identify and advocate for equitable health 18 care options to prov ide scheduled maintenance hemodialysis to undocumented persons. 19 (Directive to Take Action) 20 Fiscal Note: Modest - between $1,000 - $5,000.

BOT A ction in response to referred for decision: Res. 219, A -18 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 122 (A-19) Introduced by: Michigan Subject: Reimbursement for Telemedicine Visits Referred to: Reference Committee A (John Montgomery, MD, Chair) Whereas, Telemedicine can encompass a range of services from health monitoring and patient 1 consultation to the transmission of medical records, but may be more broadly defined as any 2 electronic exchange of health information (per the American Telemedicine Association), 3 including the use of remote monitoring devices; and 4 5 Whereas, Telemedicine visits are increasing in frequency and have been shown to increase 6 access, reduce 30- day hospital readmission rates, and reduce total cost of care; and 7 8 Whereas, Telemedicine services are also helping to fill gaps in health ca re faced by patients 9 who struggle with mobility challenges, especially in rural communities; and 10 11 Whereas, Telemedicine services are also providing easy access for patients who appreciate 12 receiving care in a more convenient manner, often with a lower cost to the patient than an in - 13 office visit; and 14 15 Whereas, Primary care physicians are providing both synchronous (electronic exchange of 16 health information with a real -time video component) and asynchronous (electronic exchange of 17 health information without a real -time video component) telemedicine services for the benefit of 18 patients with a concurrent liability risk for these services; and 19 20 Whereas, Reimbursement for telemedicine services is currently allowed only for synchronous 21 telemedicine services (rural and non -rural settings) even though the expertise shared, and the 22 liability risk incurred have similar value and associated risk with a synchronous or an 23 asynchronous telemedicine visit; therefore be it 24 25 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association work with third- party payers and the 26 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services at the national level to provide reimbursement for 27 both synchronous and asynchronous telemedicine services to encourage increased access and 28 use of these servi ces by patients and physicians.

Received: 05/09/19 Resolution: 122 (A-19) Page 2 of 3 RELEVANT AMA POLICY Coverage of and Payment for Telemedicine H -480.946 1. Our AMA believes that telemedicine services should be covered and paid for if they abide by the following principles: a) A valid patient -physician relationship must be established before the provision of telemedicine services, through: - A face- to-face examination, if a face- to-face encounter would otherwi se be required in the provision of the same service not delivered via telemedicine; or - A consultation with another physician who has an ongoing patient -physician relationship with the patient. The physician who has established a valid physician- patient r elationship must agree to supervise the patient's care; or - Meeting standards of establishing a patient -physician relationship included as part of evidence- based clinical practice guidelines on telemedicine developed by major medical specialty societies, such as those of radiology and pathology. Exceptions to the foregoing include on- call, cross coverage situations; emergency medical treatment; and other exceptions that become recognized as meeting or improving the standard of care. If a medical home does not exist, telemedicine providers should facilitate the identification of medical homes and treating physicians where in-person services can be delivered in coordination with the telemedicine services. b) Physicians and other health practitioners delivering telemedicine services must abide by state licensure laws and state medical practice laws and requirements in the state in which the patient receives services. c) Physicians and other health practitioners delivering telemedicine services must be licensed in the state where the patient receives services, or be providing these services as otherwise authorized by that state's medical board. d) Patients seeking care delivered via telemedicine must have a choice of provider, as required for all medical services. e) The delivery of telemedicine services must be consistent with state scope of practice laws. f) Patients receiving telemedicine services must have access to the licensure and board certification qualifications of the health care practitioners who are providing the care in advance of their visit. g) The standards and scope of telemedicine services should be consistent with related in- person services. h) The delivery of telemedicine services must follow evidence- based practice guidelines, to the degree they are available, to ensure patient safety, quality of care and positive health outcomes. i) The telemedicine service must be delivered in a transparent manner, to include but not be limited to, the identification of the patient and physician in advance of the delivery of the service, as well as patient cost - sharing responsibilities and any limitations in drugs that can be prescribed via telemedicine. j) The patient's medical history must be collected as part of the provision of any telemedicine service. k) The provision of telemedicine services must be properly documented and should include providing a visit summary to the patient. l) The provision of telemedicine services must include care coordination with the patient's medical home and/or existing treati ng physicians, which includes at a minimum identifying the patient's existing medical home and treating physicians and providing to the latter a copy of the medical record. m) Physicians, health professionals and entities that deliver telemedicine services must establish protocols for referrals for emergency services. 2. Our AMA believes that delivery of telemedicine services must abide by laws addressing the privacy and security of patients' medical information. 3. Our AMA encourages additional research to develop a stronger evidence base for telemedicine. 4. Our AMA supports additional pilot programs in the Medicare program to enable coverage of telemedicine services, including, but not limited to store- and-forward telemedicine. 5. Our AMA supports demonst ration projects under the auspices of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to address how telemedicine can be integrated into new payment and delivery models. 6. Our AMA encourages physicians to verify that their medical liability insurance poli cy covers telemedicine services, including telemedicine services provided across state lines if applicable, prior to the delivery of any telemedicine service. 7. Our AMA encourages national medical specialty societies to leverage and potentially collaborat e in the work of national telemedicine organizations, such as the American Telemedicine Association, in the area of telemedicine technical standards, to the extent practicable, and to take the lead in the development of telemedicine clinical practice guidelines.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Early Intervention for Individuals with Developmental Delay H -90.969 (1) Our AMA will continue to work with appropriate medical specialty societies to educate and enable physicians to identify children with developmental delay, autism and other developmental disabilities, and to urge physicians to assist parents in obtaining access to appropriate individualized early intervention services. (2) Our AMA supports a simplified process across appropriate government agencies to designate individuals with intellectual disabilities as a medically underserved population. Citation: CCB/CLRPD Rep. 3, A -14; Reaffirmed: Res. 315, A -17 Resolution: 123 (A-19) Page 3 of 4 Medical Care of Persons with Developmental Disabilities H -90.968 1. Our AMA encourages: (a) clinicians to learn and appreciate variable presentations of complex functioning profiles in all persons with developmental disabilities; (b) medical schools and graduate medical education programs to acknowledge the benefits of education on how aspects in the social model of disability (e.g. ableism) can impact the physical and mental health of persons with Developmental Disabilities; (c) medical schools and graduate medical education programs to acknowledge the benefits of teaching about the nuances of uneven skill sets, often found in the functioning profiles of persons with developmental disabiliti es, to improve quality in clinical care; (d) the education of physicians on how to provide and/or advocate for quality, developmentally appropriate medical, social and living supports for patients with developmental disabilities so as to improve health out comes; (e) medical schools and residency programs to encourage faculty and trainees to appreciate the opportunities for exploring diagnostic and therapeutic challenges while also accruing significant personal rewards when delivering care with professionali sm to persons with profound developmental disabilities and multiple co -morbid medical conditions in any setting; (f) medical schools and graduate medical education programs to establish and encourage enrollment in elective rotations for medical students and residents at health care facilities specializing in care for the developmentally disabled; and (g) cooperation among physicians, health & human services professionals, and a wide variety of adults with developmental disabilities to implement priorities and quality improvements for the care of persons with developmental disabilities. 2. Our AMA seeks: (a) legislation to increase the funds available for training physicians in the care of individuals with intellectual disabilities/developmentally disabled individuals, and to increase the reimbursement for the health care of these individuals; and (b) insurance industry and government reimbursement that reflects the true cost of health care of individuals with intellectual disabilities/developmentally disabled individuals. 3. Our AMA entreats health care professionals, parents and others participating in decision- making to be guided by the following principles: (a) All people with developmental disabilities, regardless of the degree of their disability, should have access to appropriate and affordable medical and dental care throughout their lives; and (b) An individual's medical condition and welfare must be the basis of any medical decision. Our AMA advocates for the highest quality medical care for persons wi th profound developmental disabilities; encourages support for health care facilities whose primary mission is to meet the health care needs of persons with profound developmental disabilities; and informs physicians that when they are presented with an opportunity to care for patients with profound developmental disabilities, that there are resources available to them. 4. Our AMA will continue to work with medical schools and their accrediting/licensing bodies to encourage disability related competencies/o bjectives in medical school curricula so that medical professionals are able to effectively communicate with patients and colleagues with disabilities, and are able to provide the most clinically competent and compassionate care for patients with disabilit ies. 5. Our AMA recognizes the importance of managing the health of children and adults with developmental disabilities as a part of overall patient care for the entire community. 6. Our AMA supports efforts to educate physicians on health management of children and adults with developmental disabilities, as well as the consequences of poor health management on mental and physical health for people with developmental disabilities. 7. Our AMA encourages the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation, and allopathic and osteopathic medical schools to develop and implement curriculum on the care and treatment of people with developmental disabilities. 8. Our AMA encourages the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medic al Education and graduate medical education programs to develop and implement curriculum on providing appropriate and comprehensive health care to people with developmental disabilities. Resolution: 123 (A-19) Page 4 of 4 9. Our AMA encourages the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education, specialty boards, and other continuing medical education providers to develop and implement continuing education programs that focus on the care and treatment of people with developmental disabilities. 10.Our AMA will advocate that the Health Resources and Services Administration include persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) as a medically underserved population.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Health Insurance Market Regulation H -165.856 Our AMA supports the following principles for health insurance market regulation: (1) There should be greater national uniformity of market regulation across health insurance markets, regardless of type of sub- market (e.g., large group, small group, individual), geographic location, or type of health plan. (2) State variation in market regu lation is permissible so long as states demonstrate that departures from national regulations would not drive up the number of uninsured, and so long as variations do not unduly hamper the development of multi -state group purchasing alliances, or create ad verse selection. (3) Risk -related subsidies such as subsidies for high- risk pools, reinsurance, and risk adjustment should be financed through general tax revenues rather than through strict community rating or premium surcharges. (4) Strict community rati ng should be replaced with modified community rating, risk bands, or risk corridors. Although some degree of age rating is acceptable, an individual's genetic information should not be used to determine his or her premium. (5) Insured individuals should be protected by guaranteed renewability. (6) Guaranteed renewability regulations and multi -year contracts may include provisions allowing insurers to single out individuals for rate changes or other incentives related to changes in controllable lifestyle choices. (7) Guaranteed issue regulations should be rescinded. (8) Health insurance coverage of pre- existing conditions with guaranteed issue within the context of an individual mandate, in addition to guaranteed renewability. (9) Insured individuals wishing to switch plans should be subject to a lesser degree of risk rating and pre- existing conditions limitations than individuals who are newly seeking coverage. (10) The regulatory environment should enable rather than impede private market innovation in product development and purchasing arrangements. Specifically: (a) legislative and regulatory barriers to the formation and operation of group purchasing alliances should, in general, be removed; (b) benefit mandates should be minimized to allow markets to determine benefit packages and permit a wide choice of coverage options; and (c) any legislative and regulatory barriers to the development of multi -year insurance contracts should be identified and removed.

Our AMA supports public and private health i nsurance coverage that provides all hearing- impaired infants and children access to appropriate physician- led teams and hearing services and devices, including digital hearing aids. 2. Our AMA supports hearing aid coverage for children that, at minimum, r ecognizes the need for replacement of hearing aids due to maturation, change in hearing ability and normal wear and tear. 3. Our AMA encourages private health plans to offer optional riders that allow their members to add hearing benefits to existing poli cies to offset the costs of hearing aid purchases, hearing- related exams and related services. 4. Our AMA supports coverage of hearing tests administered by a physician or physician- led team as part of Medicare's Benefit. Resolution: 124 (A-19) Page 4 of 4 Citation: (CMS Rep. 6, I -15 Early Hearing Detection and Intervention H -245.970 Our AMA: 1) supports early hearing detection and intervention to ensure that every infant receives proper hearing screening, diagnostic evaluation, intervention, and follow -up in a timely manner; and 2) supports federal legislation that provides for the development and monitoring of statewide programs and systems for hearing screening of newborns and infants, prompt evaluation and diagnosis of children referred from screening programs, and appropriate medic al, educational, and audiological interventions and follow -up for children identified with hearing loss. Citation: (Res. 514, A -11; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 6, I -15 Adequacy of Health Insurance Coverage Options H -165.846 1. Our AMA supports the following principles to guide in the evaluation of the adequacy of health insurance coverage options: A. Any insurance pool or similar structure designed to enable access to age- appropriate health insurance coverage must include a wide variety of coverage options from w hich to choose. B. Existing federal guidelines regarding types of health insurance coverage (e.g., Title 26 of the US Tax Code and Federal Employees Health Benefits Program [FEHBP] regulations) should be used as a reference when considering if a given plan would provide meaningful coverage. C. Provisions must be made to assist individuals with low -incomes or unusually high medical costs in obtaining health insurance coverage and meeting cost -sharing obligations. D. Mechanisms must be in place to educate pat ients and assist them in making informed choices, including ensuring transparency among all health plans regarding covered services, cost -sharing obligations, out -of-pocket limits and lifetime benefit caps, and excluded services. 2.

While physicians are able to collect 20 copayments at the time of the visit, we are not able to charge for a deductible until a claim for 21 the visit has been submitted to the insurer, and the i nsurer has responded to the claim; and 22 23 Whereas, In the experience of many, physicians are usually not able to ascertain, at the time of 24 service, how much of the patient's deductible has been met; even if a patient will eventually be 25 found to be responsibl e for payment for the visit, the physician is unable to ask for payment at 26 the time of the visit; and 27 28 Whereas, This delay in submitting the claim to the patient inexorably leads to a decrease in the 29 collection rate for this portion of the fee. It is well known among private practice physicians that 30 there is a steady decrease in collection rate as time goes on after the visit; and 31 32 Whereas, In summary, high -deductible plans have a negative impact on patient health, may 33 increase total health care costs, and pose a threat to the economic viability of physician 34 practices; and 35 36 Whereas, One change that would provide significant relief to both patients and physicians would 37 be to exempt outpatient physician evaluation and management codes (99201- 05 and 38 99211- 15) from the deductible, for primary care and specialty practices; and 39 Resolution: 125 (A-19) Page 2 of 2 Whereas, There is precedent for this policy, in that the ACA requires that insurance plans 1 exempt preventive services recommended by the USPSTF from deductible payments; and 2 3 Whereas, Exempting these codes from payment of the deductible would improve patient access 4 to needed care, would likely reduce utilization of emergency room and in- patient services, and 5 would help to stabilize the economic viability of physician practices; therefore be it 6 7 RESOLVED , That our American Medical Association advocate for legislation or regulation 8 specifying that codes for outpatient evaluation and management services, including initial and 9 established patient office visits, be ex empt from deductible payments.

It includes emphysema, chronic 2 bronchitis, and in some cases, asthma; and 3 4 Whereas, COPD is the fo urth-leading cause of death in the US ; and 5 6 Whereas, CDC reports that 15.7 million Americans (6.4%) reported that they have been 7 diagnosed with COPD ; and 8 9 Whereas, CDC report that more than 50% of adults with low pulmonary function were not aware 10 that they had COPD so the actual number of patients with COPD may be higher ; and 11 12 Whereas, The following groups are more likely to have COPD: 13 14 - People aged 65 years and older . 15 - American Indian/Alaska Natives and multiracial non- Hispanics. 16 - Women. 17 - Individuals who were unemployed, retired, or unable to work. 18 - Individuals with less than a high school education. 19 - Individuals who were divorced, widowed, or separated. 20 - Current or former smokers. 21 - People with a history of asthma ; and 22 23 Whereas, Congress was concerned about COPD in the U.S. and directed the National Institutes 24 of Health (NIH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to craft a 25 comprehensive federal plan to tackle the disease ; and 26 27 Whereas, In response to the Congressional request, the NIH's National Heart, Lung, and Blood 28 Institute (N HLBI) collaborated with the CDC, other federal agencies, patient and provider 29 organizations to develop a COPD National Action Plan; and 30 31 Whereas, NHLBI has publicly released the COPD National Action Plan that call for programs in 32 five areas, including: 33 34 1. Empower people with COPD, their families, and caregivers to recognize and reduce the 35 burden of COPD. 36 2.

According to the Georgia Physician 2 Workforce, Georgia was ranked 39th in the nation for the number of practicing physicians per 3 100,000 people in 20162. According to a report by the AAMC, Georgia would need to add nearly 4 1,500 new residency slots to match the national rate2; and 5 6 Whereas, New Graduate Medical Education teaching hospitals are allotted a five- year \"cap 7 window\" allowing programs to increase the amount of residents i n a program within that time 8 frame, with the final amount of residents present in the fifth (and final) year of the\" cap -building 9 window\" permanently determining the amount of funding from Medicare the program will 10 receive, essentially \"capping\" Medicare f unding, set by the Balanced Budget Act of 19973; and 11 12 Whereas, Targeting support for GME programs by extending the cap- building window for new 13 and existing teaching hospitals in rural, underserved, under - resourced communities and/or 14 areas currently lackin g medical training infrastructure will benefit our national GME system in 15 many ways, including, but not limited to: 16 (a) Providing lifesaving opportunities for new teaching institutions to further develop residency 17 programs and secure the resources necessar y to launch and/or scale- up training capabilities. 18 The additional time is vital to ensuring that teaching institutions in under resourced areas will be 19 able to build- up to a level necessary to meet regional needs 20 (b) Alleviating regional physician shortag es by providing time for institutions to add primary care 21 and/or specialty and sub -specialty residencies in shortage; 22 (c) Boosting the return on investment for Medicare, local communities, states, medical schools, 23 and the hosting teaching hospital. 24 (d) H elping address the disproportionate maldistribution of physicians and GME resources 25 across the country3; and 26 27 Whereas, As residents tend to practice where they train, adding, developing, and incentivizing 28 the establishment of programs at teaching instituti ons located in underserved, under -resourced, 29 and rural areas will help address the current maldistribution of physicians across the country3; 30 therefore be it 31 1 Association of American Medical Colleges.

Our AMA will actively collaborate with appropriate stakeholder organizations, (including Association of American Medical Colleges, American Hospital Association, state medical societies, medical specialty societies/a ssociations) to advocate for the preservation, stability and expansion of full funding for the direct and indirect costs of graduate medical education (GME) positions from all existing sources (e.g. Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration, CDC and others). 2. Our AMA will actively advocate for the stable provision of matching federal funds for state Medicaid programs that fund GME positions. 3. Our AMA will actively seek congressional action to remove the caps on Medicare funding of GME positions for re sident physicians that were imposed by the Balanced Budget Amendment of 1997 (BBA -1997). 4. Our AMA will strenuously advocate for increasing the number of GME positions to address the future physician workforce needs of the nation. 5. Our AMA will oppose e fforts to move federal funding of GME positions to the annual appropriations process that is subject to instability and uncertainty. 6. Our AMA will oppose regulatory and legislative efforts that reduce funding for GME from the full scope of resident educational activities that are designated by residency programs for accreditation and the board certification of their graduates (e.g. didactic teaching, community service, off -site ambulatory rotations, etc.). 7. Our AMA will actively explore additional sourc es of GME funding and their potential impact on the quality of residency training and on patient care. 8. Our AMA will vigorously advocate for the continued and expanded contribution by all payers for health care (including the federal government, the stat es, and local and private sources) to fund both the direct and indirect costs of GME. Resolution: 233 (A-19) Page 3 of 4 9. Our AMA will work, in collaboration with other stakeholders, to improve the awareness of the general public that GME is a public good that provides essential services as part of the training process and serves as a necessary component of physician preparation to provide patient care that is safe, effective and of high quality. 10. Our AMA staff and governance will continuously monitor federal, state and private proposal s for health care reform for their potential impact on the preservation, stability and expansion of full funding for the direct and indirect costs of GME. 11. Our AMA: (a) recognizes that funding for and distribution of positions for GME are in crisis in t he United States and that meaningful and comprehensive reform is urgently needed; (b) will immediately work with Congress to expand medical residencies in a balanced fashion based on expected specialty needs throughout our nation to produce a geographicall y distributed and appropriately sized physician workforce; and to make increasing support and funding for GME programs and residencies a top priority of the AMA in its national political agenda; and (c) will continue to work closely with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, Association of American Medical Colleges, American Osteopathic Association, and other key stakeholders to raise awareness among policymakers and the public about the importance of expanded GME funding to meet the nat ion's current and anticipated medical workforce needs. 12. Our AMA will collaborate with other organizations to explore evidence- based approaches to quality and accountability in residency education to support enhanced funding of GME. 13. Our AMA will cont inue to strongly advocate that Congress fund additional graduate medical education (GME) positions for the most critical workforce needs, especially considering the current and worsening maldistribution of physicians. 14. Our AMA will advocate that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services allow for rural and other underserved rotations in Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) -accredited residency programs, in disciplines of particular local/regional need, to occur in the offices of physicians who meet the qualifications for adjunct faculty of the residency program's sponsoring institution. 15. Our AMA encourages the ACGME to reduce barriers to rural and other underserved community experiences for graduate medical education programs that choose to provide such training, by adjusting as needed its program requirements, such as continuity requirements or limitations on time spent away from the primary residency site. 16. Our AMA encourages the ACGME and the American Osteopathic Assoc iation (AOA) to continue to develop and disseminate innovative methods of training physicians efficiently that foster the skills and inclinations to practice in a health care system that rewards team -based care and social accountability. 17. Our AMA will w ork with interested state and national medical specialty societies and other appropriate stakeholders to share and support legislation to increase GME funding, enabling a state to accomplish one or more of the following: (a) train more physicians to meet s tate and regional workforce needs; (b) train physicians who will practice in physician shortage/underserved areas; or (c) train physicians in undersupplied specialties and subspecialties in the state/region. 18. Our AMA supports the ongoing efforts by stat es to identify and address changing physician workforce needs within the GME landscape and continue to broadly advocate for innovative pilot programs that will increase the number of positions and create enhanced accountability of GME programs for quality outcomes. 19. Our AMA will continue to work with stakeholders such as Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), ACGME, AOA, American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Physicians, and other specialty organizations to analyze the changing landscape of future physician workforce needs as well as the number and variety of GME positions necessary to provide that workforce. 20. Our AMA will explore innovative funding models for incremental increases in funded residency positions related to quality of resident education and provision of patient care as evaluated by appropriate medical education organizations such as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. 21. Our AMA will utilize its resources to share its content expertise with policymakers and the public to ensure greater awareness of the significant societal value of graduate medical education (GME) in terms of patient care, particularly for underserved and at -risk populations, as well as global health, research and educat ion. 22. Our AMA will advocate for the appropriation of Congressional funding in support of the National Healthcare Workforce Commission, established under section 5101 of the Affordable Care Act, to provide data and healthcare workforce policy and advice to the nation and provide data that support the value of GME to the nation. 23. Our AMA supports recommendations to increase the accountability for and transparency of GME funding and continue to monitor data and peer -reviewed studies that contribute to further assess the value of GME. 24. Our AMA will explore various models of all -payer funding for GME, especially as the Institute of Medicine (now a program unit of the National Academy of Medicine) did not examine those options in its 2014 report on GME go vernance and financing. 25. Our AMA encourages organizations with successful existing models to publicize and share strategies, outcomes and costs. Resolution: 233 (A-19) Page 4 of 4 26. Our AMA encourages insurance payers and foundations to enter into partnerships with state and local agencies as well as academic medical centers and community hospitals seeking to expand GME. 27. Our AMA will develop, along with other interested stakeholders, a national campaign to educate the public on the definition and importance of graduate medical education, student debt and the state of the medical profession today and in the future. 28. Our AMA will collaborate with other stakeholder organizations to evaluate and work to establish consensus regarding the appropriate economic value of resident and fellow services. 29. Our AMA will monitor ongoing pilots and demonstration projects, and explore the feasibility of broader implementation of proposals that show promise as alternative means for funding physician education and training while providing appr opriate compensation for residents and fellows. 30. Our AMA will monitor the status of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's response to public comments solicited regarding the 2014 IOM report, Graduate Medical Education That Meets the Nation's Health Needs, as well as results of ongoing studies, including that requested of the GAO, in order to formulate new advocacy strategy for GME funding, and will report back to the House of Delegates regularly on important changes in the landscape of GME funding. 31. Our AMA will advocate to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for flexibility beyond the current maximum of five years for the Medicare graduate medical education cap- setting deadline for new residency programs in underserved areas and/or econom ically depressed areas. 32. Our AMA will: (a) encourage all existing and planned allopathic and osteopathic medical schools to thoroughly research match statistics and other career placement metrics when developing career guidance plans; (b) strongly advoc ate for and work with legislators, private sector partnerships, and existing and planned osteopathic and allopathic medical schools to create and fund graduate medical education (GME) programs that can accommodate the equivalent number of additional medical school graduates consistent with the workforce needs of our nation; and (c) encourage the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA), and other accrediting bodies, as part of accreditation of allopathic and osteopathic medical schools, to prospectively and retrospectively monitor medical school graduates' rates of placement into GME as well as GME completion. 33. Our AMA will investigate the status of implementation of AMA Policies D -305.973, \"Proposed Revisions to AMA Policy on the Financing of Medical Education Programs\" and D -305.967, \"The Preservation, Stability and Expansion of Full Funding for Graduate Medical Education\" and report back to the House of Delegates with proposed measures to resolve the problems of underfunding, inadequate number of residencies and geographic maldistribution of 314, A -07; -07; CME Rep. 4, -08; Reaffirmed: Sub.

and 3 4 Whereas, According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) more than 68% of the 70,200 5 drug overdose deaths in 2017 involved an opioid (2); and 6 7 Whereas, Significant initiatives by the CDC and state medical boards to curb the prescription of 8 opioids has so far not resulted in a decrease in opioid related deaths (3); and 9 10 Whereas, The decreased availability of prescription opioids has contributed to an increase in the 11 use of illicit opioids including heroin, and heroin laced with fentanyl, causing an inc reased 12 number of unintentional deaths (4); and 13 14 Whereas, The marked decrease in the utilization of interventional pain procedures from 2009- 15 2017 secondary to an increase in regulations and requirements regarding these procedures, 16 has directly correlated wi th the increase in opioid related deaths during the same duration, and 17 this is an ongoing public health crisis (5); and 18 19 Whereas, Current AMA policy supports quality care for patients with pain including patient 20 access to non -opioid and interventional pain management treatments (H -185.931); supports 21 timely and appropriate access to non -opioid and non- pharmacologic treatments for pain, 22 including removing barriers to such treatments when they inhibit a patient's access to care (D - 23 450.956); is committed to bet ter access and delivery of quality pain care including through 24 clinical practice (D -160.931); and opposes legislative or other policies that arbitrarily restrict a 25 patient's ability to receive effective, patient -specific, evidence- based, comprehensive pai n care 26 (H-95.930); and 27 28 Whereas, There are multiple evidence based guidelines and studies regarding the effectiveness 29 of interventional pain procedures based on prospective cohort and/or randomized controlled 30 trials including but not limited to: sacroiliac joint blocks and radiofrequency ablation (6- 12), 31 medial branch blocks and radio frequency ablation (for cervical, thoracic and lumbar facet 32 arthritis) (13 -17), genicular nerve blocks and radiofrequency ablation (for non- operable knee 33 arthritis or pain) (18 -22), femoral and obturator nerve blocks and radiofrequency ablation (for 34 non-operable hip arthritis or pain) (23, 24), suprascapular nerve blocks and radiofrequency 35 ablation (for non - operable shoulder arthritis or pain), spinal cord and peripheral nerve 36 stimulation; yet limitations and noncoverage decisions for these as well as many other 37 interventional pain management procedures by multiple private insurance carriers, third party 38 Resolution: 238 (A-19) Page 2 of 4 review companies , Medicare and Medicaid contractors, and Medicare Advantag e Plans exist, 1 which have no regard to the basis and variability in severity of patient spine, nerve, and joint 2 pathology or patient presentation (6- 10); and 3 4 Whereas, There is non- inclusion of many diagnoses and conditions which have been to shown 5 to be of benefit with regards to spinal cord stimulation and peripheral nerve stimulation that 6 multiple private insurance carriers, third party review companies , Medicare and Medicaid 7 contractors, and Medicare Advantage Plans are omitting from their coverage policies; therefore 8 be it 9 10 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support coverage of sacroiliac joint blocks 11 and radiofrequency ablation, facet (spine joint) medial branch blocks genicular blocks and radiofr equency ablation for -operable knee arthritis or pain, 13 femoral and obturator nerve blocks and radiofrequency ablations for non -operable hip arthritis or 14 pain, suprascapular nerve blocks and radiofrequency ablations for non -operable shoulder 15 arthritis or pain, and other arbitrarily limited non- covered interventional pain management 16 procedures, by all private insurance carriers, third party review companies , Medicare and 17 Medicaid contractors, and Medicare Advantage Plans (Directive to Take Action), and be it 18 further 19 20 RESOLVED, That our AMA support coverage of spinal cord stimulation trials and implantation, 21 and peripheral nerve stimulation trials and implantation by all private insurance carriers, third 22 party review companies , Medicare and Medicaid contractors, and Medicare Advantage Plans by 23 ICD-10 codes that have been linked to the respective Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) 24 code set as outlined in the AMA CPT Manual .

Our patients require a sufficient, well -trained supply of primary care physicians --family physicians, general internists, general pediatricians, and obstetricians/gynecologists --to meet the nation's current and projected demand for health care services. 2. To help accomplish this critical goal, our American Medical Association (AMA) will work with a variety of key stakeholders, to include federal and state legislators and regulatory bodies; national and state specialty societies and medical associations, including those representing primary care fields; and accreditation, certification, licensing, and regulatory bodies from across the continuum of medical education (undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education). 3. Through its work with these stakeholders, our AMA will encourage development and dissemination of innovative models to recruit medical students interested in primary care, train primary care physicians, and enhance both the perception and the reality of primary care practice, to encompass the following components: a) Changes to medical school admissions and recruitment of medical students to primary care specialties, including counseling of medical students as they develop their career plans; b) Curriculum changes throughout the medical education continuum; c) Expanded financial aid and debt relief options; d) Financial and logistical support for primary care practice, including adequate reimbursement, and enhancements to the practice environment to ensure professional satisfaction and practice sustainability; and e) Support for research and advocacy related to primary care. 4. Admissions and recruitment: The medical school admissions process should reflect the specif ic institution's mission. Those schools with missions that include primary care should consider those predictor variables among applicants that are associated with choice of these specialties. 5. Medical schools, through continued and expanded recruitment and outreach activities into secondary schools, colleges, and universities, should develop and increase the pool of applicants likely to practice primary care by seeking out those students whose profiles indicate a likelihood of practicing in primary care and underserved areas, while establishing strict guidelines to preclude discrimination. 6. Career counseling and exposure to primary care: Medical schools should provide to students career counseling related to the choice of a primary care specialty, and ensure that primary care physicians are well - represented as teachers, mentors, and role models to future physicians. 7. Financial assistance programs should be created to provide students with primary care experiences in ambulatory settings, especially in underserved areas. These could include funded preceptorships or summer work/study opportunities. 8. Curriculum: Voluntary efforts to develop and expand both undergraduate and graduate medical education programs to educate primary care physicians in increasi ng numbers should be continued. The establishment of appropriate administrative units for all primary care specialties should be encouraged. 9. Medical schools with an explicit commitment to primary care should structure the curriculum to support this objective. At the same time, all medical schools should be encouraged to continue to change their curriculum to put more emphasis on primary care. 10. All four years of the curriculum in every medical school should provide primary care experiences for all students, to feature increasing levels of student responsibility and use of ambulatory and community -based settings. 11. Federal funding, without coercive terms, should be available to institutions needing financial support to expand resources for both undergraduate and graduate medical education programs designed to increase the number of primary care physicians. Our AMA will advocate for public (federal and state) and private payers to a) develop enhanced funding and related incentives from all sources to provide education for medical students and resident/fellow physicians, respectively, in progressive, community -based models of integrated care focused on quality and outcomes (such as the patient -centered medical home and the chronic care model) to enhanc e primary care as a career choice; b) fund and foster innovative pilot programs that change the current approaches to primary care in undergraduate and graduate medical education, especially in urban and rural underserved areas; and c) evaluate these effor ts for their effectiveness in increasing the number of students choosing primary care careers and helping facilitate the elimination of geographic, racial, and other health care disparities. 12. Medical schools and teaching hospitals in underserved areas s hould promote medical student and resident/fellow physician rotations through local family health clinics for the underserved, with financial assistance to the clinics to compensate their teaching efforts. Resolution: 239 (A-19) Page 3 of 3 13. The curriculum in primary care residency progr ams and training sites should be consistent with the objective of training generalist physicians. Our AMA will encourage the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to (a) support primary care residency programs, including community hospital -based programs, and (b) develop an accreditation environment and novel pathways that promote innovations in graduate medical education, using progressive, community -based models of integrated care focused on quality and outcomes (such as the patient -centered medical home and the chronic care model). 14. The visibility of primary care faculty members should be enhanced within the medical school, and positive attitudes toward primary care among all faculty members should be encouraged. 15. Support for practici ng primary care physicians: Administrative support mechanisms should be developed to assist primary care physicians in the logistics of their practices, along with enhanced efforts to reduce administrative activities unrelated to patient care, to help ensure professional satisfaction and practice sustainability. 16. There should be increased financial incentives for physicians practicing primary care, especially those in rural and urban underserved areas, to include scholarship or loan repayment programs, r elief of professional liability burdens, and Medicaid case management programs, among others. Our AMA will advocate to state and federal legislative and regulatory bodies, among others, for development of public and/or private incentive programs, and expansion and increased funding for existing programs, to further encourage practice in underserved areas and decrease the debt load of primary care physicians. The imposition of specific outcome targets should be resisted, especially in the absence of additional support to the schools. 17. Our AMA will continue to advocate, in collaboration with relevant specialty societies, for the recommendations from the AMA/Specialty Society RVS Update Committee (RUC) related to reimbursement for E&M services and coverage of services related to care coordination, including patient education, counseling, team meetings and other functions; and work to ensure that private payers fully recognize the value of E&M services, incorporating the RUC -recommended increases adopted for t he most current Medicare RBRVS. 18. Our AMA will advocate for public (federal and state) and private payers to develop physician reimbursement systems to promote primary care and specialty practices in progressive, community -based models of integrated care focused on quality and outcomes such as the patient -centered medical home and the chronic care model consistent with current AMA Policies H -160.918 and H -160.919. 19. There should be educational support systems for primary care physicians, especially thos e practicing in underserved areas. 20. Our AMA will urge urban hospitals, medical centers, state medical associations, and specialty societies to consider the expanded use of mobile health care capabilities. 21. Our AMA will encourage the Centers for Medic are & Medicaid Services to explore the use of telemedicine to improve access to and support for urban primary care practices in underserved settings. 22. Accredited continuing medical education providers should promote and establish continuing medical educ ation courses in performing, prescribing, interpreting and reinforcing primary care services. 23. Practicing physicians in other specialties --particularly those practicing in underserved urban or rural areas -- should be provided the opportunity to gain spec ific primary care competencies through short -term preceptorships or postgraduate fellowships offered by departments of family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, etc., at medical schools or teaching hospitals. In addition, part -time training should be encouraged, to allow physicians in these programs to practice concurrently, and further research into these concepts should be encouraged. 24. Our AMA supports continued funding of Public Health Service Act, Title VII, Section 747, and encourages advocacy in this regard by AMA members and the public. 25. Research: Analysis of state and federal financial assistance programs should be undertaken, to determine if these programs are having the desired workforce effects, particularly for students from disadvant aged groups and those that are underrepresented in medicine, and to gauge the impact of these programs on elimination of geographic, racial, and other health care disparities. Additional research should identify the factors that deter students and physicians from choosing and remaining in primary care disciplines. Further, our AMA should continue to monitor trends in the choice of a primary care specialty and the availability of primary care graduate medical education positions. The results of these and rel ated research endeavors should support and further refine AMA policy to enhance primary care as a career choice.

Education and instruction of physicians is a critical need. The AMA supports taking a leadership role in this process through an expanded program of assistance to independent and employed physicians. (2) Our AMA supports continued intervention in the courts and meetings with the Justice Department and FTC to enhance their understanding of the unique nature of medical practice and to seek interpretations of the antitrust laws which reflect that unique nature. (3) Our AMA supports continued advocacy for changes in the application of federal labor laws to expand the number of physicians who can bargain collectively. (4) Our AMA vigorously opposes any legislation that would further restrict the freedom of physicians to independently contract with Medicare patients. (5) Our AMA supports obtaining for the profession the ability to fully negotiate with the government about important issues involving reimbursement and patient care. Citation: (BOT Rep.

Our AMA will: (a) work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other payers to participate in discussions and identify viable options for bundled payment plans, gain- sharing plans, accountable care organizations, and any other evolving health care delivery programs; (b) develop guidelines for health care delivery payment systems that protect the patient -physician relationship; (c) make available to members access to legal, financial, and ethical information, tools and other resources to enable physicians to play a meaningf ul role in the governance and clinical decision- making of evolving health care delivery systems; and (d) work with Congre ss and the appropriate governmental agencies to change existing laws and regulations (eg, antitrust and anti -kickback) to facilitate t he participation of physicians in new delivery models via a range of affiliations with other physicians and health care providers (not limited to employment) without penalty or hardship to those physicians. 2. Our AMA will: (a) work with third party payers to assure that payment of physicians/healthcare systems includes enough money to assure that patients and their families have access to the care coordination support that they need to assure optimal outcomes; and (b) will work with federal authorities to assure that funding is available to allow the CMMI grant -funded projects that have proven successful in meeting the Triple Aim to continue to provide the information we need to guide decisions that third party payers make in their funding of care coordinat ion services. 3. Our AMA advises physicians to make informed decisions before starting, joining, or affiliating with an ACO. Our AMA will provide information to members regarding AMA vetted legal and financial advisors and will seek discount fees for such services. 4. Our AMA will develop a toolkit that provides physicians best practices for starting and operating an ACO, such as governance structures, organizational relationships, and quality reporting and payment distribution mechanisms. The toolkit will include legal governance models and financial business models to assist physicians in making decisions about potential physician- hospital alignment strategies. The toolkit will also include model contract language for indemnifying physicians from legal and financial liabilities. 5. Our AMA will continue to work with the Federation to identify, publicize and promote physician- led payment and delivery reform programs that can serve as models for others working to improve patient care and lower costs. 6. Our A MA will continue to monitor health care delivery and physician payment reform activities and provide resources to help physicians understand and participate in these initiatives. 7. Our AMA will work with states to: (a) ensure that current state medical li ability reform laws apply to ACOs and physicians participating in ACOs; and (b) address any new liability exposure for physicians participating in ACOs or other delivery reform models. 8. Our AMA recommends that state and local medical societies encourage the new Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) to work with the state health officer and local health officials as they develop the electronic medical records and medical data reporting systems to assure that data needed by Public Health to protect the comm unity against disease are available. 9. Our AMA recommends that ACO leadership, in concert with the state and local directors of public health, work to assure that health risk reduction remains a primary goal of both clinical practice and the efforts of public health. 10. Our AMA encourages state and local medical societies to invite ACO and health department leadership to report annually on the population health status improvement, community health problems, recent successes and continuing problems relating to health risk reduction, and measures of health care quality in the state.

Speakers Rep., I -15; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 09, A -16 Resolution: 241 (A-19) Page 4 of 5 Accountable Care Organization Principles H -160.915 Our AMA adopts the following Accountable Care Organization (ACO) principles: 1. Guiding Principle - The goal of an ACO is to increase access to care, improve the quality of care and ensure the efficient delivery of care. Within an ACO, a physician's primary ethical and professional obligation is the well -being and safety of the patien t. 2. ACO Governance - ACOs must be physician- led and encourage an environment of collaboration among physicians. ACOs must be physician- led to ensure that a physician's medical decisions are not based on commercial interests but rather on professional medical judgment that puts patients' interests first. A. Medical decisions should be made by physicians. ACOs must be operationally structured and governed by an appropriate number of physicians to ensure that medical decisions are made by physicians (rather than lay entities) and place patients' interests first. Physicians are the medical professionals best qualified by training, education, and experience to provide diagnosis and treatment of patients. Clinical decisions must be made by the physician or physi cian-controlled entity. The AMA supports true collaborative efforts between physicians, hospitals and other qualified providers to form ACOs as long as the governance of those arrangements ensure that physicians control medical issues. B. The ACO should be governed by a board of directors that is elected by the ACO professionals. Any physician -entity [e.g., Independent Physician Association (IPA), Medical Group, etc.] that contracts with, or is otherwise part of, the ACO should be physician- controlled and g overned by an elected board of directors. C. The ACO's physician leaders should be licensed in the state in which the ACO operates and in the active practice of medicine in the ACO's service area. D. Where a hospital is part of an ACO, the governing board of the ACO should be separate, and independent from the hospital governing board. 3. Physician and patient participation in an ACO should be voluntary. Patient participation in an ACO should be voluntary rather than a mandatory assignment to an ACO by Medi care. Any physician organization (including an organization that bills on behalf of physicians under a single tax identification number) or any other entity that creates an ACO must obtain the written affirmative consent of each physician to participate in the ACO. Physicians should not be required to join an ACO as a condition of contracting with Medicare, Medicaid or a private payer or being admitted to a hospital medical staff. 4. The savings and revenues of an ACO should be retained for patient care ser vices and distributed to the ACO participants. 5. Flexibility in patient referral and antitrust laws. The federal and state anti -kickback and self -referral laws and the federal Civil Monetary Penalties (CMP) statute (which prohibits payments by hospitals t o physicians to reduce or limit care) should be sufficiently flexible to allow physicians to collaborate with hospitals in forming ACOs without being employed by the hospitals or ACOs. This is particularly important for physicians in small - and medium -sized practices who may want to remain independent but otherwise integrate and collaborate with other physicians (i.e., so- called virtual integration) for purposes of participating in the ACO. The ACA explicitly authorizes the Secretary to waive requirements under the Civil Monetary Penalties statute, the Anti -Kickback statute, and the Ethics in Patient Referrals (Stark) law. The Secretary should establish a full range of waivers and safe harbors that will enable independent physicians to use existing or new or ganizational structures to participate as ACOs. In addition, the Secretary should work with the Federal Trade Commission to provide explicit exceptions to the antitrust laws for ACO participants. Physicians cannot completely transform their practices only for their Medicare patients, and antitrust enforcement could prevent them from creating clinical integration structures involving their privately insured patients. These waivers and safe harbors should be allowed where appropriate to exist beyond the end of the initial agreement between the ACO and CMS so that any new organizational structures that are created to participate in the program do not suddenly become illegal simply because the shared savings program does not continue. 6. Additional resources sho uld be provided up- front in order to encourage ACO development. CMS's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMI) should provide grants to physicians in order to finance up- front costs of creating an ACO. ACO incentives must be aligned with the physi cian or physician group's risks (e.g., start -up costs, systems investments, culture changes, and financial uncertainty). Developing this capacity for physicians practicing in rural communities and solo- small group practices requires time and resources and the outcome is unknown. Providing additional resources for the up-front costs will encourage the development of ACOs since the 'shared savings' model only provides for potential savings at the back -end, which may discourage the creation of ACOs (particular ly among independent physicians and in rural communities). Resolution: 241 (A-19) Page 5 of 5 7. The ACO spending benchmark should be adjusted for differences in geographic practice costs and risk adjusted for individual patient risk factors. A. The ACO spending benchmark, which will be based on historical spending patterns in the ACO's service area and negotiated between Medicare and the ACO, must be risk -adjusted in order to incentivize physicians with sicker patients to participate in ACOs and incentivize ACOs to accept and treat sicker patients, such as the chronically ill. B. The ACO benchmark should be risk -adjusted for the socioeconomic and health status of the patients that are assigned to each ACO, such as income/poverty level, insurance status prior to Medicare enrollment, race, and ethnicity and health status. Studies show that patients with these factors have experienced barriers to care and are more costly and difficult to treat once they reach Medicare eligibility. C. The ACO benchmark must be adjusted for differences in geogra phic practice costs, such as physician office expenses related to rent, wages paid to office staff and nurses, hospital operating cost factors (i.e., hospital wage index) and physician HIT costs. D. The ACO benchmark should include a reasonable spending growth rate based on the growth in physician and hospital practice expenses as well as the patient socioeconomic and health status factors. E. In addition to the shared savings earned by ACOs, ACOs that spend less than the national average per Medicare beneficiary should be provided an additional bonus payment. Many physicians and physician groups have worked hard over the years to establish systems and practices to lower their costs below the national per Medicare beneficiary expenditures. Accordingly, these practices may not be able to achieve significant additional shared savings to incentivize them to create or join ACOs. A bonus payment for spending below the national average would encourage these practices to create ACOs and continue to use resources appropriately and efficiently. 8. The quality performance standards required to be established by the Secretary must be consistent with AMA policy regarding quality. The ACO quality reporting program must meet the AMA principles for quality reporting, incl uding the use of nationally -accepted, physician specialty -validated clinical measures developed by the AMA -specialty society quality consortium; the inclusion of a sufficient number of patients to produce statistically valid quality information; appropriat e attribution methodology; risk adjustment; and the right for physicians to appeal inaccurate quality reports and have them corrected. There must also be timely notification and feedback provided to physicians regarding the quality measures and results. 9. An ACO must be afforded procedural due process with respect to the Secretary's discretion to terminate an agreement with an ACO for failure to meet the quality performance standards. 10. ACOs should be allowed to use different payment models. While the A CO shared- savings program is limited to the traditional Medicare fee- for-service reimbursement methodology, the Secretary has discretion to establish ACO demonstration projects. ACOs must be given a variety of payment options and allowed to simultaneously employ different payment methods, including fee- for-service, capitation, partial capitation, medical homes, care management fees, and shared savings. Any capitation payments must be risk -adjusted. 11. The Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Sys tems (CAHPS) Patient Satisfaction Survey should be used as a tool to determine patient satisfaction and whether an ACO meets the patient - centeredness criteria required by the ACO law. 12. Interoperable Health Information Technology and Electronic Health R ecord Systems are key to the success of ACOs. Medicare must ensure systems are interoperable to allow physicians and institutions to effectively communicate and coordinate care and report on quality. 13. If an ACO bears risk like a risk bearing organizati on, the ACO must abide by the financial solvency standards pertaining to risk -bearing organizations.

Our AMA, independently and in collaboration with other groups such as the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), will actively work and advocate for funding at the federal and state levels and in the private sector to support the following: a. Pipeline programs to prepare and motivate members of underrepresented groups to enter medical school; b. Diversity or minority affairs offices at medical schools; c. Fi nancial aid programs for students from groups that are underrepresented in medicine; and d. Financial support programs to recruit and develop faculty members from underrepresented groups. 2. Our AMA will work to obtain full restoration and protection of federal Title VII funding, and similar state funding programs, for the Centers of Excellence Program, Health Careers Opportunity Program, Area Health Education Centers, and other programs that support physician training, recruitment, and retention in geographically -underserved areas. 3. Our AMA will take a leadership role in efforts to enhance diversity in the physician workforce, including engaging in broad- based efforts that involve partners within and beyond the medical profession and medical education com munity. 4. Our AMA will encourage the Liaison Committee on Medical Education to assure that medical schools demonstrate compliance with its requirements for a diverse student body and faculty. 5. Our AMA will develop an internal education program for its m embers on the issues and possibilities involved in creating a diverse physician population. 6. Our AMA will provide on- line educational materials for its membership that address diversity issues in patient care including, but not limited to, culture, relig ion, race and ethnicity. 7. Our AMA will create and support programs that introduce elementary through high school students, especially those from groups that are underrepresented in medicine (URM), to healthcare careers. 8. Our AMA will create and support pipeline programs and encourage support services for URM college students that will support them as they move through college, medical school and residency programs. 9. Our AMA will recommend that medical school admissions committees use holistic assessments of admission applicants that take into account the diversity of preparation and the variety of talents that applicants bring to their education. 10. Our AMA will advocate for the tracking and reporting to interested stakeholders of demographic informat ion pertaining to URM status collected from Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) applications through the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP). 11. Our AMA will continue the research, advocacy, collaborative partnerships and other work that was initiated by the Commission to End Health Care Disparities. 12. Our AMA opposes legislation that would undermine institutions' ability to properly employ affirmative action to promote a diverse student population.

Citation: BOT Rep. 33, A -18 8.5 Disparities in Health Care Stereotypes, prejudice, or bias based on gender expectations and other arbitrary evaluations of any individual can manifest in a variety of subtle ways. Differences in treatment that are not directly related to differences in ind ividual patients clinical needs or preferences constitute inappropriate variations in health care. Such variations may contribute to health outcomes that are considerably worse in members of some populations than those of members of majority populations. This represents a significant challenge for physicians, who ethically are called on to provide the same quality of care to all patients without regard to medically irrelevant personal characteristics. To fulfill this professional obligation in their individ ual practices physicians should: (a) Provide care that meets patient needs and respects patient preferences. (b) Avoid stereotyping patients. (c) Examine their own practices to ensure that inappropriate considerations about race, gender identify, sexual or ientation, sociodemographic factors, or other nonclinical factors, do not affect clinical judgment. (d) Work to eliminate biased behavior toward patients by other health care professionals and staff who come into contact with patients. (e) Encourage shared decision making. (f) Cultivate effective communication and trust by seeking to better understand factors that can influence patients health care decisions, such as cultural traditions, health beliefs and health literacy, language or other barriers to comm unication and fears or misperceptions about the health care system. The medical profession has an ethical responsibility to: (g) Help increase awareness of health care disparities. (h) Strive to increase the diversity of the physician workforce as a step t oward reducing health care disparities. (i) Support research that examines health care disparities, including research on the unique health needs of all genders, ethnic groups, and medically disadvantaged populations, and the development of quality measures and resources to help reduce disparities.

AMA Policy H -295.895 Progress in Medical Education: Structuring the Fourth Year of Medical School RELEVANT AMA POLICY Progress in Medical Education: Structuring the Fourth Year of Medical School H -295.895 It is the policy of the AMA that: (1) Trends toward increasing structure in the fourth year of medical school should be balanced by the need to preserve opportunities for students to engage in elective clinical and other educationally appropriate experiences. (2) The third and fourth years as a continuum should provide students with a broad clinical education that prepares them for entry into residency training. (3) There should be a comprehensive assessment of cli nical skills administered at a time when the results can be used to plan each student's fourth- year program, so as to remedy deficiencies and broaden clinical knowledge. (4) Medical schools should develop policies and procedures to ensure that medical stu dents receive counseling to assist them in their choice of electives. (5) Adequate and timely career counseling should be available at all medical schools. (6) The ability of medical students to choose electives based on interest or perceived academic need should not be compromised by the residency selection process. The American Medical Association should work with the Association of American Medical Colleges, medical schools, and residency program directors groups to discourage the practice of excessive audition electives. (7) Our AMA should continue to work with relevant groups to study the transition from the third and fourth years of medical school to residency training, with the goal of ensuring that a continuum exists in the acquisition of clinical knowledge and skills. Citation: CME Rep. 1, I -98; Reaffirmed: CME Rep. 9, A -07; Reaffirmed: CME Rep. 01, A -17 For-Profit Medical Schools or Colleges D -305.954 Our AMA will study issues related to medical education programs offered at for -profit versus not -for-profit medical schools, to include the: (a) attrition rate of students; (b) financial burden of non- graduates versus graduates; (c) success of graduates in obtaining a residency position; and (d) level of support for graduate medical education; and report back at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Citation: Res. 302, A -18 The Preservation, Stability and Expansion of Full Funding for Graduate Medical Education D - 305.967 1. Our AMA will actively collaborate with appropriate stakeholder organizations, (including A ssociation of American Medical Colleges, American Hospital Association, state medical societies, medical specialty societies/associations) to advocate for the preservation, stability and expansion of full funding for the direct and indirect costs of graduate medical education (GME) positions from all existing sources (e.g. Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration, CDC and others). 2. Our AMA will actively advocate for the stable provision of matching federal funds for state Medicaid programs that fund GM E positions. Resolution: 322 (A-19) Page 3 of 7 3. Our AMA will actively seek congressional action to remove the caps on Medicare funding of GME positions for resident physicians that were imposed by the Balanced Budget Amendment of 1997 (BBA - 1997). 4. Our AMA will strenuously advocate for increasing the number of GME positions to address the future physician workforce needs of the nation. 5. Our AMA will oppose efforts to move federal funding of GME positions to the annual appropriations process that is subject to instability and uncertaint y. 6. Our AMA will oppose regulatory and legislative efforts that reduce funding for GME from the full scope of resident educational activities that are designated by residency programs for accreditation and the board certification of their graduates (e.g. didactic teaching, community service, off -site ambulatory rotations, etc.). 7. Our AMA will actively explore additional sources of GME funding and their potential impact on the quality of residency training and on patient care. 8. Our AMA will vigorously advocate for the continued and expanded contribution by all payers for health care (including the federal government, the states, and local and private sources) to fund both the direct and indirect costs of GME. 9. Our AMA will work, in collaboration with other stakeholders, to improve the awareness of the general public that GME is a public good that provides essential services as part of the training process and serves as a necessary component of physician preparation to provide patient care that is safe, effective and of high quality. 10. Our AMA staff and governance will continuously monitor federal, state and private proposals for health care reform for their potential impact on the preservation, stability and expansion of full funding for the direct and indirect costs of GME. 11. Our AMA: (a) recognizes that funding for and distribution of positions for GME are in crisis in the United States and that meaningful and comprehensive reform is urgently needed; (b) will immediately work with Congress to expand medical residencies in a balanced fashion based on expected specialty needs throughout our nation to produce a geographically distributed and appropriately sized physician workforce; and to make increasing support and funding for GME programs and residencies a top priority of the AMA in its national political agenda; and (c) will continue to work closely with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, Association of American Medical Colleges, American Osteopathic Association, and other key stakeholders to raise awareness among policymakers and the public about the importance of expanded GME funding to meet the nation's current and anticipated medical workforce needs. 12. Our AMA will collaborate with other organizations to explore evidence- based approaches to quality and accountability in residency education to support enhanced funding of GME. 13. Our AMA will continue to strongly advocate that Congress fund additional graduate medical education (GME) positions for the most critical workforce needs, especially considering the current and worsening maldistribution of physicians. 14. Our AMA will advocate that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services allow for rural and other underserved rotations in Accreditation Council for Graduate Medi cal Education (ACGME) -accredited residency programs, in disciplines of particular local/regional need, to occur in the offices of physicians who meet the qualifications for adjunct faculty of the residency program's sponsoring institution. 15. Our AMA encourages the ACGME to reduce barriers to rural and other underserved community experiences for graduate medical education programs that choose to provide such training, by adjusting as needed its program requirements, such as continuity requirements or limit ations on time spent away from the primary residency site. 16. Our AMA encourages the ACGME and the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) to continue to develop and disseminate innovative methods of training physicians efficiently that foster the skills and inclinations to practice in a health care system that rewards team -based care and social accountability. 17. Our AMA will work with interested state and national medical specialty societies and other appropriate stakeholders to share and support legisla tion to increase GME funding, enabling a state to accomplish one or more of the following: (a) train more physicians to meet state and regional workforce needs; (b) train physicians who will practice in physician shortage/underserved areas; or (c) train ph ysicians in undersupplied specialties and subspecialties in the state/region. 18. Our AMA supports the ongoing efforts by states to identify and address changing physician workforce needs within the GME landscape and continue to broadly advocate for innovative pilot programs that will increase the number of positions and create enhanced accountability of GME programs for quality outcomes. Resolution: 322 (A-19) Page 4 of 7 19. Our AMA will continue to work with stakeholders such as Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), ACGME, AOA, American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Physicians, and other specialty organizations to analyze the changing landscape of future physician workforce needs as well as the number and variety of GME positions necessary to provide that wor kforce. 20. Our AMA will explore innovative funding models for incremental increases in funded residency positions related to quality of resident education and provision of patient care as evaluated by appropriate medical education organizations such as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. 21. Our AMA will utilize its resources to share its content expertise with policymakers and the public to ensure greater awareness of the significant societal value of graduate medical education (GME) in terms of patient care, particularly for underserved and at -risk populations, as well as global health, research and education. 22. Our AMA will advocate for the appropriation of Congressional funding in support of the National Healthcare Workforce Comm ission, established under section 5101 of the Affordable Care Act, to provide data and healthcare workforce policy and advice to the nation and provide data that support the value of GME to the nation. 23. Our AMA supports recommendations to increase the accountability for and transparency of GME funding and continue to monitor data and peer -reviewed studies that contribute to further assess the value of GME. 24. Our AMA will explore various models of all -payer funding for GME, especially as the Institute of Medicine (now a program unit of the National Academy of Medicine) did not examine those options in its 2014 report on GME governance and financing. 25. Our AMA encourages organizations with successful existing models to publicize and share strategies, outcomes and costs. 26. Our AMA encourages insurance payers and foundations to enter into partnerships with state and local agencies as well as academic medical centers and community hospitals seeking to expand GME. 27. Our AMA will develop, along with other interested stakeholders, a national campaign to educate the public on the definition and importance of graduate medical education, student debt and the state of the medical profession today and in the future. 28. Our AMA will collaborate with other stakeholder organizations to evaluate and work to establish consensus regarding the appropriate economic value of resident and fellow services. 29. Our AMA will monitor ongoing pilots and demonstration projects, and explore the feasibility of broader implementat ion of proposals that show promise as alternative means for funding physician education and training while providing appropriate compensation for residents and fellows. 30. Our AMA will monitor the status of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's response to public comments solicited regarding the 2014 IOM report, Graduate Medical Education That Meets the Nation's Health Needs, as well as results of ongoing studies, including that requested of the GAO, in order to formulate new advocacy strategy for GME funding, and will report back to the House of Delegates regularly on important changes in the landscape of GME funding. 31. Our AMA will advocate to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for flexibility beyond the current maximum of five years for t he Medicare graduate medical education cap- setting deadline for new residency programs in underserved areas and/or economically depressed areas. 32. Our AMA will: (a) encourage all existing and planned allopathic and osteopathic medical schools to thoroughly research match statistics and other career placement metrics when developing career guidance plans; (b) strongly advocate for and work with legislators, private sector partnerships, and existing and planned osteopathic and allopathic medical schools to create and fund graduate medical education (GME) programs that can accommodate the equivalent number of additional medical school graduates consistent with the workforce needs of our nation; and (c) encourage the Liaison Committee on Medical Educat ion (LCME), the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA), and other accrediting bodies, as part of accreditation of allopathic and osteopathic medical schools, to prospectively and retrospectively monitor medical school graduates' rates of pl acement into GME as well as GME completion. 33. Our AMA will investigate the status of implementation of AMA Policies D -305.973, \"Proposed Revisions to AMA Policy on the Financing of Medical Education Programs\" and D -305.967, \"The Preservation, Stability a nd Expansion of Full Funding for Graduate Medical Education\" and report back to the House of Delegates with proposed measures to resolve the problems of underfunding, inadequate number of residencies and geographic maldistribution of 314, A -07; -07; CME Rep. -08; Reaffirmed: Sub.

All medical students and resident physicians should have general knowledge of the whole field of medicine regardless of their projected choice of specialty. (2) Schools of medicine should accept the principle and should state in their requirements for admission that a broad cultural education in the arts, humanities, and social sciences, as well as in the biological and physical sciences, is desirable. (3) Medical schools should make their goals and objectives known to prospective students and premedical counselors in order that applicants may apply to medical schools whose programs are most in accord with their career goals. (4) Medical schools should state explicitly in publications their admission requirements and the methods they employ in the selection of students. (5) Medical schools should require their admissions committees to make every effort to determine that the students admitted possess integrity as well as the ability to acquire the knowledge and skills required of a physician. (6) Although the results of standardized admission testing may be an important predictor of the ability of students to complete courses in the preclinical sciences successfully, medical schools should utili ze such tests as only one of several criteria for the selection of students. Continuing review of admission tests is encouraged because the subject content of such examinations has an influence on premedical education and counseling. (7) Medical schools should improve their liaison with college counselors so that potential medical students can be given early and effective advice. The resources of regional and national organizations can be useful in developing this communication. (8) Medical schools are char tered for the unique purpose of educating students to become physicians and should not assume obligations that would significantly compromise this purpose. (9) Medical schools should inform the public that, although they have a unique capability to identif y the changing medical needs of society and to propose responses to them, they are only one of the elements of society that may be involved in responding. Medical schools should continue to identify social problems related to health and should continue to recommend solutions. (10) Medical school faculties should continue to exercise prudent judgment in adjusting educational programs in response to social change and societal needs. (11) Faculties should continue to evaluate curricula periodically as a means of insuring that graduates will have the capability to recognize the diverse nature of disease, and the potential to provide preventive and comprehensive medical care. Medical schools, within the framework of their respective institutional goals and regard less of the organizational structure of the faculty, should provide a broad general education in both basic sciences and the art and science of clinical medicine. (12) The curriculum of a medical school should be designed to provide students with experienc e in clinical medicine ranging from primary to tertiary care in a variety of inpatient and outpatient settings, such as university hospitals, community hospitals, and other health care facilities. Medical schools should establish standards and apply them t o all components of the clinical educational program regardless of where they are conducted. Regular evaluation of the quality of each experience and its contribution to the total program should be conducted. (13) Faculties of medical schools have the resp onsibility to evaluate the cognitive abilities of their students. Extramural examinations may be used for this purpose, but never as the sole criterion for promotion or graduation of a student. (14) As part of the responsibility for granting the MD degree, faculties of medical schools have the obligation to evaluate as thoroughly as possible the non- cognitive abilities of their medical students. (15) Medical schools and residency programs should continue to recognize that the instruction provided by volunte er and part -time members of the faculty and the use of facilities in which they practice make Resolution: 322 (A-19) Page 6 of 7 important contributions to the education of medical students and resident physicians. Development of means by which the volunteer and part -time faculty can expres s their professional viewpoints regarding the educational environment and curriculum should be encouraged. (16) Each medical school should establish, or review already established, criteria for the initial appointment, continuation of appointment, and prom otion of all categories of faculty. Regular evaluation of the contribution of all faculty members should be conducted in accordance with institutional policy and practice. (17a) Faculties of medical schools should reevaluate the current elements of their f ourth or final year with the intent of increasing the breadth of clinical experience through a more formal structure and improved faculty counseling. An appropriate number of electives or selected options should be included. (17b) Counseling of medical stu dents by faculty and others should be directed toward increasing the breadth of clinical experience. Students should be encouraged to choose experience in disciplines that will not be an integral part of their projected graduate medical education. (18) Dir ectors of residency programs should not permit medical students to make commitments to a residency program prior to the final year of medical school. (19) The first year of postdoctoral medical education for all graduates should consist of a broad year of general training. (a) For physicians entering residencies in internal medicine, pediatrics, and general surgery, postdoctoral medical education should include at least four months of training in a specialty or specialties other than the one in which the resident has been appointed. (A residency in family practice provides a broad education in medicine because it includes training in several fields.) (b) For physicians entering residencies in specialties other than internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, and family practice, the first postdoctoral year of medical education should be devoted to one of the four above- named specialties or to a program following the general requirements of a transitional year stipulated in the \"General Requirements\" secti on of the \"Essentials of Accredited Residencies.\" (c) A program for the transitional year should be planned, designed, administered, conducted, and evaluated as an entity by the sponsoring institution rather than one or more departments. Responsibility for the executive direction of the program should be assigned to one physician whose responsibility is the administration of the program. Educational programs for a transitional year should be subjected to thorough surveillance by the appropriate accrediting body as a means of assuring that the content, conduct, and internal evaluation of the educational program conform to national standards. The impact of the transitional year should not be deleterious to the educational programs of the specialty disciplines. (20) The ACGME, individual specialty boards, and respective residency review committees should improve communication with directors of residency programs because of their shared responsibility for programs in graduate medical education. (21) Specialty boards should be aware of and concerned with the impact that the requirements for certification and the content of the examination have upon the content and structure of graduate medical education. Requirements for certification should not be so specific that they inhibit program directors from exercising judgment and flexibility in the design and operation of their programs. (22) An essential goal of a specialty board should be to determine that the standards that it has set for certification continue to assure that successful candidates possess the knowledge, skills, and the commitment to upgrade continually the quality of medical care. (23) Specialty boards should endeavor to develop a consensus concerning the significance of certification by specialty and publicize it so that the purposes and limitations of certification can be clearly understood by the profession and the public. (24) The importance of certification by specialty boards requires that communication be improved between the specialty boards and the medical profession as a whole, particularly between the boards and their sponsoring, nominating, or constituent organizations and also between the boards and their diplomates. (25) Specialty boards should consider having members of the public participate in appropriate board activities. (26) Specialty boards should consider having physicians and other professionals from related disciplines participate in board activities. (27) The AMA recommends to state licensing authorities that they require individu al applicants, to be eligible to be licensed to practice medicine, to possess the degree of Doctor of Medicine or its equivalent from a school or program that meets the standards of the LCME or accredited by the American Osteopathic Association, or to demonstrate as individuals, comparable academic and personal achievements. All applicants for full and unrestricted licensure should provide evidence of the satisfactory completion of at least one year of an accredited program of graduate medical education in the US. Resolution: 322 (A-19) Page 7 of 7 Satisfactory completion should be based upon an assessment of the applicant's knowledge, problem - solving ability, and clinical skills in the general field of medicine. The AMA recommends to legislatures and governmental regulatory authorities that they not impose requirements for licensure that are so specific that they restrict the responsibility of medical educators to determine the content of undergraduate and graduate medical education. (28) The medical profession should continue to encourage participation in continuing medical education related to the physician's professional needs and activities. Efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of such education should be continued. (29) The medical profession and the public should recognize the difficult ies related to an objective and valid assessment of clinical performance. Research efforts to improve existing methods of evaluation and to develop new methods having an acceptable degree of reliability and validity should be supported. (30) Methods curren tly being used to evaluate the readiness of graduates of foreign medical schools to enter accredited programs in graduate medical education in this country should be critically reviewed and modified as necessary. No graduate of any medical school should be admitted to or continued in a residency program if his or her participation can reasonably be expected to affect adversely the quality of patient care or to jeopardize the quality of the educational experiences of other residents or of students in educati onal programs within the hospital. (31) The Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates should be encouraged to study the feasibility of including in its procedures for certification of graduates of foreign medical schools a period of observation adequate for the evaluation of clinical skills and the application of knowledge to clinical problems. (32) The AMA, in cooperation with others, supports continued efforts to review and define standards for medical education at all levels. The AMA supports continued participation in the evaluation and accreditation of medical education at all levels. (33) The AMA, when appropriate, supports the use of selected consultants from the public and from the professions for consideration of special issues related to medical education. (34) The AMA encourages entities that profile physicians to provide them with feedback on their performance and with access to education to assist them in meeting norms of practice; and supports the creation of experiences across the continuum of medical education designed to teach about the process of physician profiling and about the principles of utilization review/quality assurance. (35) Our AMA encourages the accrediting bodies for MD - and DO -granting medical schools to review, on an ongoing basis, their accreditation standards to assure that they protect the quality and integrity of medical education in the context of the emergence of new models of medical school organization and governance. (36) Our AMA will strongly advocate for t he rights of medical students, residents, and fellows to have physician -led (MD or DO as defined by the AMA) clinical training, supervision, and evaluation while recognizing the contribution of non- physicians to medical education. (37) Our AMA will publici ze to medical students, residents, and fellows their rights, as per Liaison Committee on Medical Education and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education guidelines, to physician- led education and a means to report violations without fear of retaliation.

Those who operate a vehicle when impaired by a m edical condition pose threats to both public safety and their own well -being. Physicians have unique opportunities to assess the impact of physical and mental conditions on patients ability to drive safely and have a responsibility to do so in light of the ir professional obligation to protect public health and safety. In deciding whether or how to intervene when a patients medical condition may impair driving, physicians must balance dual responsibilities to promote the welfare and confidentiality of the individual patient, and to protect public safety. Not all physicians are in a position to evaluate the extent or effect of a medical condition on a patients ability to drive, particularly physicians who treat patients only on a short -term basis. Nor do all p hysicians necessarily have appropriate training to identify and evaluate physical or mental conditions in relation to the ability to drive. In such situations, it may be advisable to refer a potentially at -risk patient for assessment. To serve the interest s of their patients and the public, within their areas of expertise physicians should: (a) Assess at -risk patients individually for medical conditions that might adversely affect driving ability, using best professional judgment and keeping in mind that not all physical or mental impairments create an obligation to intervene. (b) Tactfully but candidly discuss driving risks with the patient and, when appropriate, the family when a medical condition may adversely affect the patients ability to drive safely. Help the patient (and family) formulate a plan to reduce risks, including options for treatment or therapy if available, changes in driving behavior, or other adjustments. (c) Recognize that safety standards for those who operate commercial transportation are subject to governmental medical standards and may differ from standards for private licenses. (d) Be aware of applicable state requirements for reporting to the licensing authority those patients whose impairments may compromise their ability to operat e a motor vehicle safely. (e) Prior to reporting, explain to the patient (and family, as appropriate) that the physician may have an obligation to report a medically at -risk driver: (i) when the physician identifies a medical condition clearly related to t he ability to drive; (ii) when continuing to drive poses a clear risk to public safety or the patients own well -being and the patient ignores the physicians advice to discontinue driving; or (iii) when required by law. (f) Inform the patient that the determination of inability to drive safely will be made by other authorities, not the physician. Resolution: 424 (A-19) Page 5 of 5 (g) Disclose only the minimum necessary information when reporting a medically at -risk driver, in keeping with ethics guidance on respect for patient privacy and c onfidentiality.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Family Violence-Adolescents as Victims and Perpetrators H -515.981 The AMA (1) (a) encourages physicians to screen adolescents about a current or prior history of maltreatment. Special attention should be paid to screening adolescents with a history of alcohol and drug misuse, irresponsible sexual behavior, eating disorders, running away, suicidal behaviors, conduct di sorders, or psychiatric disorders for prior occurrences of maltreatment; and (b) urges physicians to consider issues unique to adolescents when screening youths for abuse or neglect. (2) encourages state medical society violence prevention committees to work with child protective service agencies to develop specialized services for maltreated adolescents, including better access to health services, improved foster care, expanded shelter and independent living facilities, and treatment programs. (3) will inv estigate research and resources on effective parenting of adolescents to identify ways in which physicians can promote parenting styles that reduce stress and promote optimal development. (4) will alert the national school organizations to the increasing i ncidence of adolescent maltreatment and the need for training of school staff to identify and refer victims of maltreatment. (5) urges youth correctional facilities to screen incarcerated youth for a current or prior history of abuse or neglect and to refer maltreated youth to appropriate medical or mental health treatment programs. (6) encourages the National Institutes of Health and other organizations to expand continued research on adolescent initiation of violence and abuse to promote understanding of how to prevent future maltreatment and family violence.

The A MA recognizes the prevalence of mental health and substance abuse problems among incarcerated women and continues to support access to appropriate services for women in prisons. The AMA recognizes that a large majority of female inmates who may not have developed appropriate parenting skills are mothers of children under the age of 18. The AMA encourages correctional facilities to provide parenting skills training to all female inmates in preparation for their release from prison and return to their children. The AMA supports and encourages further investigation into the long-term effects of prison nurseries on mothers and their children.

(2) Urges the Center for Substance Abus e Prevention to continue to support community -based prevention strategies which include: (a) Special attention to children and adolescents, particularly in schools, beginning at the pre- kindergarten level. (b) Changes in the social climate (i.e., attitudes of community leaders and the public), to reflect support of drug and alcohol abuse prevention and treatment, eliminating past imbalances in allocation of resources to supply and demand reduction. (c) Development of innovative programs that train and invol ve parents, educators, physicians, and other community leaders in \"state of the art\" prevention approaches and skills. (3) Urges major media programming and advertising agencies to encourage the development of more accurate and prevention-oriented messages about the effects of drug and alcohol abuse.

and 15 16 Whereas, Few facilities have special units for incarcerated individuals with cognitive 17 impairments, and these individuals must rely on fellow incarcerated people for support4; and 18 19 Whereas, Incarcerated people have a constitutional right to adequate medical care;8 and 20 21 Whereas, Existing AMA policy affirms that it believes in \"preserving dignity and self -respect of 22 all individuals at all ages\" (H -25.997); and 23 24 Whereas, Although 49 states and the District of Columbia have laws that permit compassionate 25 release, few incarcerated individuals can receive early release because these state laws are 26 inconsistent, confusing, do not delineate a clear process, or contain overly strict eligibility 27 criteria2; and 28 29 Whereas, For example, Arizona requires compassionate release applicants to be facing 30 \"imminent death,\" but has three different definitions of \"i mminent death\" among Department of 31 Corrections and Board of Executive Clemency documents;2 and 32 33 Whereas, The eligibility criteria in Maryland's medical parole statute are different from those 34 listed in the Code of Maryland Regulations2; and 35 36 Whereas, Michi gan does not have any guidelines for the implementation of its compassionate 37 release policy whatsoever2; and 38 Resolution: 430 (A-19) Page 2 of 4 Whereas, Thirty incarcerated individuals died from 2011 -2016 while navigating the 1 compassionate release process in Georgia, where there are no guidelines for the processing 2 and referral of eligible patients to the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles2; and 3 4 Whereas, In some states including Kansas, eligibility for compassionate release requires a 5 prognosis of only 30 to 60 days to live, even though the review process for compassionate 6 release can take many months2; and 7 8 Whereas, Only 13 states have a statutory or regulatory reporting requirement for their 9 compassionate release programs, and of those states, very few make that information public, 10 making it often impossible to analyze outcomes2; and 11 12 Whereas, Each year over 2,600 incarcerated people appeal to the Federal Bureau of Prisons 13 (BOP) for compassionate release, but 97% of requests are denied9,10; and 14 15 Whereas, The U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General found that of 142 16 incarcerated individuals approved through the BOP's compassionate release program between 17 2006 and 2011, only five had been re -arrested within a three- year timeframe, a recidivism rate 18 of 3.5% compared to an average rate of recidivism of 68% within the same period for all 19 prisoners7,11; and 20 21 Whereas, In 2016, the United States S entencing Commission adopted a new set of federal 22 compassionate release eligibility guidelines based on recommendations from medical and policy 23 experts; however, these guidelines are not legally binding for the BOP and many states do not 24 conform to these g uidelines12; and 25 26 Whereas, Eligibility guidelines for state compassionate release programs rarely account for 27 current medical evidence related to serious illness, health trajectories in the seriously ill and 28 aging, and prognosis12; and 29 30 Whereas, Between 2013 and 2017, the BOP received about 5,400 applications for 31 compassionate release, and as of March 2018, 312 of those applicants have been approved, 32 while 266 have died waiting13; therefore be it 33 34 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association suppor t policies that facilitate 35 compassionate release on the basis of serious medical conditions and advanced age (New 36 HOD Policy) ; and be it further 37 38 RESOLVED, That our AMA collaborate with appropriate stakeholders to draft model legislation 39 that establishes c lear, evidence- based eligibility criteria for timely compassionate release 40 (Directive to Take Action) ; and be it further 41 42 RESOLVED, That our AMA promote transparent reporting of compassionate release statistics, 43 including numbers and demographics of applicants, approvals, denials, and revocations, and 44 justifications for decisions.

Our AMA advocates for adequate payment to health care providers, including primary care and mental health, and addiction treatment professionals, to encourage improved access to comprehensive physical and behavioral health care services to juveniles and adults throughout the incarceration process from intake to re- entry into the community. 2. Our AMA supports partnerships and information sharing between correctional systems, community health systems and state insurance programs to provide access to a continuum of health care services for juveniles and adults in the correctional system. 3. Our AMA encourages state Medicaid agencies to accept and process Medicaid applications from juveniles and adults who are incarcerated. 4. That our AMA encourage state Medicaid agencies to work with their local departments of corrections, prisons, and jails to assist incarcerated juveniles and adults who may not have been enrolled in Medicaid at the time of their incarceration to apply and receive an eligibility determination for Medicaid. 5. Our AMA encourages states to suspend rather than terminate Medica id eligibility of juveniles and adults upon intake into the criminal justice system and throughout the incarceration process, and to reinstate coverage when the individual transitions back into the community. 6. Our AMA urges the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and state Medicaid agencies to provide Medicaid coverage for health care, care coordination activities and linkages to care delivered to patients up to 30 days before the anticipated release from correctional facilities in order to he lp establish coverage effective upon release, assist with transition to care in the community, and help reduce recidivism. 7. Our AMA advocates for necessary programs and staff training to address the distinctive health care needs of incarcerated women and adolescent females, including gynecological care and obstetrics care for pregnant and postpartum women. Citation: CMS Rep. 02, I -16 Support for Health Care Services to Incarcerated Persons D -430.997 Our AMA will: (1) express its support of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care Standards that improve the quality of health care services, including mental health services, delivered to the nation's correctional facilities (2) encourage all correctional systems to support NCCHC accreditation Resolution: 430 (A-19) Page 4 of 4 (3) encourage the NCCHC and its AMA representative to work with departments of corrections and public officials to find cost effective and efficient methods to increase correctional health services funding; and (4) continue support for the programs and goals of the NCCHC through continued support for the travel expenses of the AMA representative to the NCCHC, with this decision to be reconsidered every two years in light of other AMA financial commitments, organizational memberships, and programmatic priorities.

Our AMA recognizes the complexity of factors contributing to the obesity epidemic and the need for a multifaceted approach to reduce the prevalence of obesity and improve public health. A key component of such a multifaceted approach is improved consumer education on the adverse health effects of excessive consumption of beverages containing added sweeteners. Taxes on beverages with added sweeteners are one means by which consumer education campaigns and other obesity -related progra ms could be financed in a stepwise approach to addressing the obesity epidemic. 2. Where taxes on beverages with added sweeteners are implemented, the revenue should be used primarily for programs to prevent and/or treat obesity and related conditions, suc h as educational ad campaigns and improved access to potable drinking water, particularly in schools and communities disproportionately effected by obesity and related conditions, as well as on research into population health outcomes that may be affected by such taxes. 3. Our AMA will advocate for continued research into the potentially adverse effects of long -term consumption of non- caloric sweeteners in beverages, particularly in children and adolescents. 4.Our AMA will: (a) encourage state and local medical societies to support the adoption of state and local excise taxes on sugar -sweetened beverages, with the investment of the resulting revenue in public health programs to combat obesity; and (b) assist state and local medical societies in advocating for excise taxes on sugar -sweetened beverages as requested.

Citation: (CSA Rep. 4, A -03; Reaffirmed: CSAPH Rep. 1, A -13 HIV Testing H -20.920 (1) General Considerations a) Persons who suspect that they have been exposed to HIV should be tested so that appropriate treatment and counseli ng can begin for those who are seropositive; b) HIV testing should be consistent with testing for other infections and communicable diseases; c) HIV testing should be readily available to all who wish to be tested, including having available sites for co nfidential testing; d) The physician's office and other medical settings are the preferred settings in which to provide HIV testing; e) Physicians should work to make HIV counseling and testing more readily available in medical settings. (2) Informed Consent Before HIV Testing a) Our AMA supports the standard that individuals should knowingly and willingly give consent before a voluntary HIV test is conducted, in a manner that is the least burdensome to the individual and to those administering the test. Physicians must be aware that most states have enacted laws requiring informed consent before HIV testing; b) Informed consent should include the following information: (i) patient option to receive more information and/or counseling before deciding whether or not to be tested and (ii) the patient should not be denied treatment if he or she refuses HIV testing, unless knowledge of HIV status is vital to provide appropriate treatment; in this instance, the physician may refer the patient to another physician for care; c) It is the policy of our AMA to review the federal laws including the Veteran's Benefits and Services Act, which currently mandates prior written informed consent for HIV testing within the Veterans Administration hospital system, and subseq uently to initiate and support amendments allowing for HIV testing without prior consent in the event that a health care provider is involved in accidental puncture injury or mucosal contact by fluids potentially infected with HIV in federally operated health care facilities; d) Our AMA supports working with various state societies to delete legal requirements for Resolution: 432 (A-19) Page 4 of 8 consent to medically indicated HIV testing that are more extensive than requirements generally imposed for informed consent to medical care. (3) HIV Testing Without Explicit Consent a) Explicit consent should not always be required prior to HIV testing. Physicians should be allowed, without explicit informed consent, and as indicated by their medical judgment, to perform diagnostic testing for de termination of HIV status of patients suspected of having HIV infection; b) General consent for treatment of patients in the hospital should be accepted as adequate consent for the performance of HIV testing; c) Model state and federal legislation should be developed to permit physicians, without explicit informed consent and as indicated by their medical judgment, to perform diagnostic testing for determination of HIV status of patients suspected of having HIV infection; d) Our AMA will work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Hospital Association, the Federation, and other appropriate groups to draft and promote the adoption of model state legislation and hospital staff guidelines to allow HIV testing of a patient maintaining privacy, but without explicit consent, where a health care worker has been placed at risk by exposure to potentially infected body fluids; and to allow HIV testing, without any consent, where a health care worker has been placed at risk by exposure to body fluids of a deceased patient. (4) HIV Testing Procedures a) Appropriate medical organizations should establish rigorous proficiency testing and quality control procedures for HIV testing laboratories on a frequent and regular basis; b) Physicians and laboratories should review their procedures to assure that HIV testing conforms to standards that will produce the highest level of accuracy; c) Appropriate medical organizations should establish a standard that a second blood sample be taken and tested on all persons found to be seropositive or indeterminate for HIV antibodies on the first blood sample. This practice is also advised for any unexpected negative result; d) Appropriate medical organizations should establish a policy that results from a sing le unconfirmed positive ELISA test never be reported to the patient as a valid indication of HIV infection; e) Appropriate medical organizations should establish a policy that laboratories specify the HIV tests performed and the criteria used for positive, negative, and indeterminate Western blots or other confirmatory procedures; f) Our AMA recommends that training for HIV blood test counselors encourage patients with an indeterminate Western blot to be advised that three- to-six-month follow -up specimens may need to be submitted to resolve their immune status. Because of the uncertain status of their contagiousness, it is prudent to counsel such patients as though they were seropositive until such time as the findings can be resolved. (5) Routine HIV Test ing a) Routine HIV testing should include appropriately modified informed consent and modified pre-test and post -test counseling procedures; b) Hospitals, clinics and physicians may adopt routine HIV testing based on their local circumstances. Such a prog ram is not a substitute for universal precautions. Local considerations may include (i) the likelihood that knowledge of a patient's serostatus will improve patient care and reduce HIV transmission risk; (ii) the prevalence of HIV in patients undergoing invasive procedures; (iii) the costs, liabilities and benefits; and (iv) alternative methods of patient care and staff protection available to the patient; c) State medical associations should review and seek modification of state laws that restrict the ability of hospitals and other medical facilities to initiate routine HIV testing programs; (d) Encourages a review of the evidence for routine HIV testing by the US Preventive Services Task Force; and (e) Supports coverage of and appropriate reimbursement f or routine HIV testing by all public Resolution: 432 (A-19) Page 5 of 8 and private payers. (6) Voluntary HIV Testing a) Voluntary HIV testing should be provided with informed consent for individuals who may have come into contact with the blood, semen, or vaginal secretions of an infected person in a manner that has been shown to transmit HIV infection. Such testing should be encouraged for patients for whom the physician's knowledge of the patient's serostatus would improve treatment. Voluntary HIV testing should be regularly provided for the following types of individuals who give an informed consent: (i) patients at sexually transmissible disease clinics; (ii) patients at drug abuse clinics; (iii) individuals who are from areas with a high incidence of AIDS or who engage in high- risk behavior and are seeking family planning services; and (iv) patients who are from areas with a high incidence of AIDS or who engage in high -risk behavior requiring surgical or other invasive procedures; b) The prevalence of HIV infection in the community shoul d be considered in determining the likelihood of infection. If voluntary HIV testing is not sufficiently accepted, the hospital and medical staff may consider requiring HIV testing. (7) Mandatory HIV Testing a) Our AMA opposes mandatory HIV testing of the general population; b) Mandatory testing for HIV infection is recommended for (i) all entrants into federal and state prisons; (ii) military personnel; (iii) donors of blood and blood fractions; breast milk; organs and other tissues intended for transplantation; and semen or ova for artificial conception; c) Our AMA will review its policy on mandatory testing periodically to incorporate information from studies of the unintended consequences or unexpected benefits of HIV testing in special settings and c ircumstances. (8) HIV Test Counseling a) Pre -test and post -test voluntary counseling should be considered an integral and essential component of HIV testing. Full pre -test and post -test counseling procedures must be utilized for patients when HIV is the f ocus of the medical attention, when an individual presents to a physician with concerns about possible exposure to HIV, or when a history of high -risk behavior is present; b) Post -test information and interpretation must be given for negative HIV test res ults. All negative results should be provided in a confidential manner accompanied by information in the form of a simple verbal or written report on the meaning of the results and the offer, directly or by referral, of appropriate counseling; c) Post -test counseling is required when HIV test results are positive. All positive results should be provided in a confidential face -to-face session by a professional properly trained in HIV post - test counseling and with sufficient time to address the patient's concerns about medical, social, and other consequences of HIV infection. (9) HIV Testing of Health Care Workers a) Our AMA supports HIV testing of physicians, health care workers, and students in appropriate situations; b) Employers of health care workers s hould provide, at the employer's expense, serologic testing for HIV infection to all health care workers who have documented occupational exposure to HIV; c) Our AMA opposes HIV testing as a condition of hospital medical staff privileges; d) Physicians and other health care workers who perform exposure- prone patient care procedures that pose a significant risk of transmission of HIV infection should voluntarily determine their serostatus at intervals appropriate to risk and/or act as if their serostatus were positive. The periodicity will vary according to locale and circumstances of the individual and the judgment should be made at the local level. Health care workers who test negative for HIV should voluntarily redetermine their HIV serostatus at an appropriate period of time after any significant occupational or personal exposure to HIV. Follow -up tests should occur after a time interval exceeding the length of the \"antibody window. Resolution: 432 (A-19) Page 6 of 8 (10) Counseling and Testing of Pregnant Women for HIV Our AMA supports the position that there should be universal HIV testing of all pregnant women, with patient notification of the right of refusal, as a routine component of perinatal care, and that such testing should be accompanied by basic counseling and awareness of appropriate treatment, if necessary. Patient notification should be consistent with the principles of informed consent. (11) HIV Home Test Kits a) Our AMA opposes Food and Drug Administration approval of HIV home test kits. However, our AMA does not oppose approval of HIV home collection test kits that are linked with proper laboratory testing and counseling services, provided their use does not impede public health efforts to control HIV disease; b) Standardized data should be collected by HIV home collection test kit manufacturers and reported to public health agencies; c) A national study of HIV home collection test kit users should be performed to evaluate their experience with telephone counseling; d) A national interagency task force should be established, consisting of members from government agencies and the medical and public health communities, to monitor the marketing and use of HIV home collection test kits. (12) College Students Our AMA encourages undergraduate campuses to conduct confidential, fr ee HIV testing with qualified staff and counselors.

Strict confidentiality must be maintained by each local and state public health authority. (2) Confidentiality a) Our AMA supports uniform protection, at all levels of government, of the identity of those with HIV infection or di sease, consistent with public health requirements; b) Patients should receive general information on the limits of confidentiality of medical records at the initial medical visit. Specific information on the limits of confidentiality should be provided before the patient receives HIV -related services or when the patient is counseled about HIV testing; c) Physicians should be able, without fear of legal sanction, to confidentially discuss a patient's HIV serostatus only with those other health care providers who need this information to properly plan and provide quality medical care to the patient; and d) Our AMA will continue to address, through the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, the patient confidentiality and ethical issues raised by known HIV antibody -positive patients who refuse to inform their sexual partners or modify their behavior. (3) Contact Tracing and Partner Notification Our AMA: a) Strongly recommends that states adopt a system for contact tracing and partner notification in each co mmunity that, while protecting to the greatest extent possible the confidentiality of patient information, provides clear guidelines for public health authorities who need to trace the unsuspecting sexual or needle- sharing partners of HIV -infected persons; b) Requests that states make provisions in any contact -tracing and notification program for adequate safeguards to protect the confidentiality of HIV -seropositive persons and their contacts, for counseling of the parties involved, and for the provision of information on Resolution: 432 (A-19) Page 7 of 8 counseling, testing, and treatment resources for partners who might be infected; c) In collaboration with state medical societies, supports legislation on the physician's right to exercise ethical and clinical judgment regarding whether or not to warn unsuspecting and endangered sexual or needle- sharing partners of HIV -infected patients; and d) Promulgates the standard that a physician attempt to persuade an HIV -infected patient to cease all activities that endanger unsuspecting others and to inform those whom he/she might have infected. If such persuasion fails, the physician should pursue notification through means other than by reliance on the patient, such as by the Public Health Department or by the physician directly. Citation: CSA Re p. 4, A -03; Reaffirmation A -07; Reaffirmed: CEJA Rep. 04, A -17 Discrimination and Criminalization Based on HIV Seropositivity H -20.914 Our AMA: (1) Remains cognizant of and concerned about society's perception of, and discrimination against, HIV -positive people; (2) Condemns any act, and opposes any legislation of categorical discrimination based on an individual's actual or imagined disease, including HIV infection; this includes Congressional mandates calling for the discharge of otherwise qualified individuals from the armed services solely because of their HIV seropositivity; (3) Encourages vigorous enforcement of existing anti -discrimination statutes; incorporation of HIV in future federal legislation that addresses discrimination; and enactment and en forcement of state and local laws, ordinances, and regulations to penalize those who illegally discriminate against persons based on disease; (4) Encourages medical staff to work closely with hospital administration and governing bodies to establish appropriate policies regarding HIV -positive patients; (5) Supports consistency of federal and/or state laws with current medical and scientific knowledge including avoidance of any imposition of punishment based on health and disability status; and (6) Encourages public education and understanding of the stigma created by HIV criminalization statutes and subsequent negative clinical and public health consequences. Citation: (CSA Rep. 4, A -03; Reaffirmed: CSAPH Rep. 1, A -13; Appended: Sub. Res. 2, A -14 AMA Stance on the Interference of the Government in the Practice of Medicine H -270.959 1. Our AMA opposes the interference of government in the practice of medicine, including the use of government -mandated physician recitations. 2. Our AMA endorses the following st atement of principles concerning the roles of federal and state governments in health care and the patient -physician relationship: A. Physicians should not be prohibited by law or regulation from discussing with or asking their patients about risk factors , or disclosing information to the patient (including proprietary information on exposure to potentially dangerous chemicals or biological agents), which may affect their health, the health of their families, sexual partners, and others who may be in contact with the patient. B. All parties involved in the provision of health care, including governments, are responsible for acknowledging and supporting the intimacy and importance of the patient -physician relationship and the ethical obligations of the phys ician to put the patient first. C. The fundamental ethical principles of beneficence, honesty, confidentiality, privacy, and advocacy are central to the delivery of evidence- based, individualized care and must be respected by all parties. D. Laws and regul ations should not mandate the provision of care that, in the physician's clinical judgment and based on clinical evidence and the norms of the profession, are either not necessary or are not appropriate for a particular patient at the time of a patient enc ounter.

Received: 05/09/19 Resolution: 433 (A-19) Page 3 of 3 Attachment: Factors influencing community public health systems in the last 50 -100 years The increased prevalence of chronic disease . Through early population screening, risk stratification and interventions, the ability to realize subsequent reduction in downstream morbidity has dramatically increased if suc h care is sought and obtained. Dementia and autism continue to increase with limited interventions. The aging of the population. Increased \"life span\" produces a marked increase in the need for educational, case management, hygiene, nutritional, mobility, transportation, social interaction and other services if this population is to spend their 'extra decade' happy, productive and comfortable (\"health span\"), rather than victims of preventable morbidity that results in their \"ping ponging\" among costly ins titutional, rehabilitation and home health services. Patient and family understanding of care options in terminal situations is a special challenge. Change in family dynamics. The extended nuclear family is rare, with many single parents living alone and the historical child caretaker miles removed or lost to opioids. Fragmentation, duplication of services/absence of high tech monitoring and communication networks. Many communities lack any overall organizational structure, as well as monitoring and communication systems, to assure high risk individuals are identified, routinely contacted according to their risk status, as well as assuring all service providers share information and avoid duplicating services. Stove pipe funding for addressing social determinants and the use of an \"insurance\" mechanism rather than an integrated community entity. Most individuals do not have insurance to address the cost of \"social determinant\" services such as rides to a doctor, air conditioner, grocery delivery and home i des. Former football star Joe Namath encourages on TV certain Medicare recipients to ask their doctor about prescribing such \"entitlement\" services. Joe and many other on Medicare don't need these services or can afford then on their own. Such funds are no t provided to communities to reach the most isolated and needy. Inadequate resources are a chronic problem, together with numerous categorically funded programs duplicating certain functions and creating \"system\" inefficiency. Increased mental health and addiction morbidity and mortality. Expanded treatment of these maladies and the prevention of associated secondary disease morbidity and mortality is welcome. However, there is a paucity of research and community efforts to \"prevent\" such conditions, such as occurred with the decreased use of tobacco by youth. Poor bi -directional communication between physicians, institutional providers and community health staff. Dr. Ilana Yurkiewicz's, a Stanford physician, provides a horrifying account of Michael's journey published in the September 28, 2018 The Atlantic (courtesy of Undark Magazine) . Communication among patients, practitioners and institutions is a huge problem leading to repeat readmissions and preventable morbidity Loss of close -by specialty care, e specially in obstetrics. Hospitals continue to close and often the telemedicine and transportation service to assure continuation of quality care are missing. Limited health literacy and assistance accessing the health system. Many patients and care takers have little knowledge and ability to access services for which the patient is eligible, criteria can be very complex and there often is no single community number to call for help. Inability to attract and adequately compensate trained public health leadership professionals, In many communities there is an absence of trained public health professionals to lead the system. AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 434 (A-19) Introduced by: New Jersey Subject: Change in Marijuana Classification to Allow Research Referred to: Reference Committee D (Diana Ramos, MD , Chair) Whereas, The use of marijuana has increased due to the medical marijuana program and will 1 increase further when marijuana is legalized for recreational use; and 2 3 Whereas, Physicians have to make marijuana related treatment decisions based on data from 4 anec dotal observations and poorly conducted studies; therefore be it 5 6 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association petition the US Food and Drug 7 Administration / US Drug Enforcement Administration to change the schedule classification of 8 marijuana so that it can be subjected to appropriate research.

Our AMA will engage in efforts to convince United States Pharmacopeia (USP) to retain the current special rules for procedures in the medical office that could include but not be limited to allergen extract compounding in the medical office setting and, if necessary, engage with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and work with the U.S. Congress to ensure that small volume physician office- based compounding is preserved. 2. Our AMA will undertake to form a coalition with affected physician specialty organizations such as allergy, dermatology, immunology, otolaryngology, onc engage with USP, FDA and the U.S. Congress on the issue of physician office-based compounding preparations and the proposed changes to USP Chapter 797. 3. Our AMA reaffirms that the regulation of compounding in the physician office for the physician's patients be under the purview of state medical boards and not state pharmacy boards. 4. Our AMA supports the current 2008 USP Chapter 797 sterile compounding rules as they apply to allergen extracts, including specifically requirements related to the beyond use dates of compounded allergen extract stock.

Secrest, MD, Chair) Whereas, In the United States in 2017, drug- related deaths exceeded 72,000, of which 49,068 1 were opioid- related, leading to 115 opioid overdose deaths per day, the highest figure in United 2 States history, thus making opioids the leading cause of preventable death; and 3 4 Whereas, Opioid misuse has been associated wi th excess annual health care expenditures of 5 up to $20,000 per person on private insurance and up to $15,000 for those on Medicaid, with 6 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting the total economic burden of 7 prescription opioid misuse in the United States as $78.5 billion per year; and 8 9 Whereas, The number of women dying from prescription opioid overdose increased 596 percent 10 between 1999 and 2016 as compared to a 312 percent increase among men; and 11 12 Whereas, Women present with more severe medical, behavioral, psychological, and social 13 problems upon treatment admission and progress more quickly from first drug use to regular 14 use to treatment admission when compared to men; and 15 16 Whereas, Women are less likely to seek treatment for their substance use disorder than men, 17 but gender does not affect treatment outcome once in treatment; and 18 19 Whereas, Many women do not seek treatment or drop out of treatment early because they are 20 unable to take care of their children and, currently, less than four pe rcent of substance use 21 treatment facilities in the United States have beds for the children of admitted patients; and 22 23 Whereas, Evidence suggests family involvement in substance use treatment programming 24 correlates with positive outcomes, substantiating the need for family services; and 25 26 Whereas, Longer treatment retention for patients in substance use rehabilitation programs 27 correlates consistently with improved outcomes, and in a study of over 3,000 women being 28 treated for substance use disorder, the abil ity to bring their children to treatment was a positive 29 predictor for treatment retention in the rehabilitation program; and 30 31 Whereas, Limiting separation from the primary caregiver in the first year of life and continued 32 family cohesion are believed to be protective factors against negative effects on children of 33 parents with substance use disorder; and 34 Resolution: 519 (A-19) Page 2 of 3 Whereas, American Medical Association policies recognize that substance use disorders should 1 be a major public health priority (H -95.975), endorse prompt a ccess to treatment for chemically 2 dependent patients (H-95.956), and encourage the expansion of opioid maintenance programs 3 to any individual who applies and for whom the treatment is suitable, as driven by patient needs, 4 medical judgment, and drug rehabil itation concerns (H-95.954) ; therefore be it 5 6 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support the implementation of childcare 7 resources in existing substance use treatment facilities and acknowledge childcare 8 infrastructure and s upport as a major priority in the development of new substance use 9 programs.

Training must be available so that an adequate number of physicians are prepared to provide Resolution: 519 (A-19) Page 3 of 3 treatment. Program regulations shoul d be strengthened so that treatment is driven by patient needs, medical judgment, and drug rehabilitation concerns. Treatment goals should acknowledge the benefits of abstinence from drug use, or degrees of relative drug use reduction; (4) encourages the extensive application of needle and syringe exchange and distribution programs and the modification of restrictive laws and regulations concerning the sale and possession of needles and syringes to maximize the availability of sterile syringes and needles, while ensuring continued reimbursement for medically necessary needles and syringes. The need for such programs and modification of laws and regulations is urgent, considering the contribution of injection drug use to the epidemic of HIV infection; (5) enc ourages a comprehensive review of the risks and benefits of U.S. state- based drug legalization initiatives, and that until the findings of such reviews can be adequately assessed, the AMA reaffirm its opposition to drug legalization; (6) strongly supports the ability of physicians to prescribe syringes and needles to patients with injection drug addiction in conjunction with addiction counseling in order to help prevent the transmission of contagious diseases; and (7) encourages state medical associations t o work with state regulators to remove any remaining barriers to permit physicians to prescribe needles for patients.

The AMA affirms that addiction treatment is a demonstrably viable and efficient method of reducing the harmful personal and social consequences of the inappropriate use of alcohol and other psychoactive drugs and urges the Administration and Congress to provide significantly increased funding for treatment of alcoholism and other drug dependencies and support of basic and clinical research so that the causes, mechanisms of action and development of addiction can continue to be elucidated to enhance treatment efficacy.

Secrest, MD, Chair) Whereas, A 2012 national survey found that 5.9 percent of pregnant women used illicit drugs, 1 8.5 percent consumed alcohol and 15.9 percent smoked cigarettes; and 2 3 Whereas, In 2014, the prevalence of opioid use disorder in pregnant women was 6.5 per 1,000 4 births and the prevalence of neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS) has tripled in 10 years due to 5 increasing opiate using among pregnant women in Michigan and nationally; and 6 7 Whereas, Substance use during pregnancy is considered to be child abuse in 23 states and 8 cases have been documented where women have been arrested despite voluntarily 9 participating in substance use treatment programs, which is contrary to the American Medical 10 Association's (AMA) stance on the issue (H -420.950); and 11 12 Whereas, AMA policy H -420.969 currently states that \"criminal sanctions or civil liability for 13 harmful behavior by the pregnant woman toward her fetus are inappropriate;\" and 14 15 Whereas, The American Academy of Pediatrics affirms that \"punitive measures taken toward 16 pregnant women such as criminal prosecution and incarceration, have no proven benefits for 17 infant health,\" a position that was reaffirmed in 2017; and 18 19 Whereas, African American women and children have been shown to be disproportionately 20 targeted and tested 1.5 times more often than non -black women and children for substance use, 21 indicating that policies aimed at maternal substance use are being applied in a racially biased 22 manner; and 23 24 Whereas, The Supreme Court has found that involuntary drug testing of pregnant women is a 25 violation of the Fourth Amendment; and 26 27 Whereas, The Committee Opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and 28 Gynecologists encourages physicians to \"retract legislation that punishes women for substance 29 abuse during pregnancy\" and that legally mandated testing and reporting threatens the 30 physician- patient relationship, leading to disengagement from prenatal care; and 31 32 Whereas, The AMA opposes the criminalization of maternal drug addiction, acknowledges that 33 punishment is not an effective way to cure drug dependency or prevent future abuse, and 34 recom mends treatment and education as the most effective method for reducing maternal and 35 fetal harm (H -420.970); and 36 Resolution: 520 (A-19) Page 2 of 4 Whereas, Punitive legislation and physician bias are major barriers to accessing substance 1 abuse treatment and prenatal care for pregnant women, resulting in negative maternal and fetal 2 outcomes; and 3 4 Whereas, Children who are removed from homes due to parental substance use are more likely 5 to remain in foster care for longer, are moved between more placements, and are less likely to 6 be reunited with their family, resulting in significant trauma; and 7 8 Whereas, Although there are no current statistics on the scope of the problem today, anecdotal 9 evidence of infant separation for positive drug tests has created enough fear in pregnant women 10 that som e avoid pre- natal care and even avoid visiting the hospital for childbirth; therefore be it 11 12 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association amend policy H -420.950, \"Substance Use 13 Disorders During Pregnancy,\" by addition and deletion as follows: 14 15 Our AMA will: (1) oppose any efforts to imply that the diagnosis of substance 16 abuse disorder during pregnancy represents child abuse; and (2) support 17 legislative and other appropriate efforts for the expansion and improved access to 18 evidence- based treatment for substance use disorders during pregnancy .; and (3) 19 oppose the removal of infants from their mothers solely based on a single positive 20 prenatal drug screen without an evaluation from a social worker.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Substance Use Disorders During Pregn ancy H -420.950 Our AMA will: (1) oppose any efforts to imply that the diagnosis of substance abuse disorder during pregnancy represents child abuse; and (2) support legislative and other appropriate efforts for the expansion and improved access to evidence- based treatment for substance use disorders during pregnancy. Citation: Res. 209, A -18 Legal Interventions During Pregnancy H -420.969 Court Ordered Medical Treatments And Legal Penalties For Potentially Harmful Behavior By Pregnant Women: (1) Judicial in tervention is inappropriate when a woman has made an informed refusal of a medical treatment designed to benefit her fetus. If an exceptional circumstance could be found in which a medical treatment poses an insignificant or no health risk to the woman, entails a minimal invasion of her bodily integrity, and would clearly prevent substantial and irreversible harm to her fetus, it might be appropriate for a physician to seek judicial intervention. However, the fundamental principle against compelled medical procedures should control in all cases which do not present such exceptional circumstances. (2) The physician's duty is to provide appropriate information, such that the pregnant woman may make an informed and thoughtful decision, not to dictate the woman' s decision. (3) A physician should not be liable for honoring a pregnant woman's informed refusal of medical treatment designed to benefit the fetus. (4) Criminal sanctions or civil liability for harmful behavior by the pregnant woman toward her fetus are inappropriate. (5) Pregnant substance abusers should be provided with rehabilitative treatment appropriate to their specific physiological and psychological needs. (6) To minimize the risk of legal action by a pregnant patient or an injured fetus, the phys ician should document medical recommendations made including the consequences of failure to comply with the physician's recommendation.

In particular, support is crucial for establishing and making broadly available specialized treatment programs for drug- addicted pregnant and breastfeeding women wherever possible; (3) urges the federal government to fund additional research to further knowledge about and effective treatment programs for drug- addicted pregnant and breastfeeding women, encourages also the support of research that provides long- term fol low-up data on the developmental consequences of perinatal drug exposure, and identifies appropriate methodologies for early intervention with perinatally exposed children; (4) reaffirms the following statement: Pregnant and breastfeeding patients with substance use disorders should be provided with physician- led, team -based care that is evidence- based and offers the ancillary and supportive services that are necessary to support rehabilitation; and (5) through its communication vehicles, encourages all phy sicians to increase their knowledge regarding the effects of drug and alcohol use during pregnancy and breastfeeding and to routinely inquire about alcohol and drug use in the course of providing prenatal care.

The AMA pledges its continuing involvement in programs to alert physicians and the public to the dimensions of the problem and the most promising solutions. The AMA, therefore: (1) supports cooperation in activities of organizations such as the National Association for Perinatal Addiction Research and Education (NAPARE) in fostering education, research, prevention, and treatment of substance abuse; (2) encourages the development of model substance abuse treatment programs, complete with an evaluation component that is designed to meet the special needs of pregnant women and women with infant children through a comprehensive array of essential services; (3) urges physicians to routinely provide, at a minimum, a historic al screen for all pregnant women, and those of childbearing age for substance abuse and to follow up positive screens with appropriate counseling, interventions and referrals; (4) supports pursuing the development of educational materials for physicians, p hysicians in training, other health care providers, and the public on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of perinatal addiction. In this regard, the AMA encourages further collaboration with the Partnership for a Drug- Free America in delivering appropriate messages to health professionals and the public on the risks and ramifications of perinatal drug and alcohol use; (5) urges the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and the Federal Office for Substanc e Abuse Prevention to continue to support research and demonstration projects around effective prevention and intervention strategies; (6) urges that public policy be predicated on the understanding that alcoholism and drug dependence, including tobacco dependence as indicated by the Surgeon General's report, are diseases characterized by compulsive use in the face of adverse consequences; (7) affirms the concept that substance abuse is a disease and supports developing model legislation to appropriately address perinatal addiction as a disease, bearing in mind physicians' concern for the health of the mother, the fetus and resultant offspring; and (8) calls for better coordination of research, prevention, and intervention services for women and infants at risk for both HIV infection and perinatal addiction.

Secrest, MD, Chair) Whereas, Someone in the United States needs a blood product every two seconds, yet less 1 than three percent of eligible donors will donate blood each year; and 2 3 Whereas, There are constantly blood supply shortages that deprive patients of lifesaving blood 4 products; and 5 6 Whereas, American Medical Association (AMA) policy H -50.990, \"Blood Shortage and 7 Collection,\" calls for encouragement of blood donation to meet these increased demands and 8 prevent shortage; and 9 10 Whereas, The current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) blood donation guidelines require a 11 12-month deferral period from the most recent sexual contact with a man who has had sex with 12 another man (MSM); and 13 14 Whereas, 2.1 million potential MSM donors are unable to donate blood because of the 12 - 15 month deferral, and a r educed deferral period could potentially allow 317,000 more pints of 16 blood to be collected each year; and 17 18 Whereas, Ninety percent of surveyed MSM individuals were interested in donating blood, yet 19 only five percent reported that they would remain abstinent for an entire year to be eligible to 20 donate; and 21 22 Whereas, Significant stigma still exists surrounding the 12- month deferral period in the MSM 23 community, and it is essential to establish trust in the medical community by advocating for 24 policy that is sci entifically based; and 25 26 Whereas, No evidence supports the effectiveness of the current FDA 12 -month deferral period, 27 and a less stigmatized approach to blood donation criteria could simultaneously maintain the 28 safety of the blood supply; and 29 30 Whereas, The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) claims nucleic acid testing 31 (NAT) for HIV, the technology currently used by blood banks, is reliable to detect HIV within 10 32 to 33 days of exposure; and 33 34 Whereas, Results from mathematical modeling studies, and empirical data from Italy, the United 35 Kingdom (UK), and Australia predict that altering Canada's MSM blood donation policy from a 36 five- to a one- year deferral would not increase the number of transfusion- transmitted HIV 37 infections; and 38 Resolution: 522 (A-19) Page 2 of 3 Whereas, Switching from a lifetime ban to a deferral period has a minute risk (one transfusion 1 transmissible infection in 200 years) of increasing the number of HIV transmissions; and 2 3 Whereas, A review of current evidence for a deferral period before donation in Australia found 4 that a 12 -month deferral for gay and bisexual men exceeds what is required to maintain blood 5 safety; and 6 7 Whereas, The UK changed their 12- month deferral to a three- month deferral in November 2017, 8 reflective of a modeling study that predicted an increased risk of HIV positive donations after 9 reducing the deferral to three months to be 0.18 -0.67 per 1 million, which is within the 10 acceptable threshold of one per million; and 11 12 Whereas, There are no cases of HIV transmission through plasma- derived products in the 13 United States in the last 20 years; and 14 15 Whereas, Reducing the deferral period from 12 months would increase lifesaving blood 16 donations, prevent blood shortages, and contribute to reducing harmful stigma experienced by 17 the MSM community; and 18 19 Whereas, AMA policy H -50.973, \"Blood Donor Deferral Criteria,\" does not specifically address 20 the ability of updated, current HIV testing technology in its potential to decrease the deferral 21 period for MSM; therefore be it 22 23 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association amend AMA policy H -50.973, \"Blood 24 Donor Deferral Criteria,\" by addition and deletion to read as follows: 25 26 Our AMA: (1) supports the use of rational, scientifically -based blood and tissue donation 27 deferral periods that are fairly and consistently applied to donors according to their 28 individual risk; (2) opposes all policies on deferral of blood and tissue donations that are 29 not based on the scientific literature; and (3) supports a blood donation deferral period 30 for men who have sex with men that is representative of current HIV testing technology; 31 and (4) supports research into individual risk assessment criteria for blood donation. 32 (Modify Current HOD Policy) 33 Fiscal Note: Minimal - less than $1,000.

Our AMA supports efforts that enable law enforcement agencies 32 to carry and administer naloxone. 3. Our AMA encourages physicians to co- prescribe 33 naloxone to patients at risk of overdose and, where permitted by law, to the friends and 34 family members of such patients. 4. Our AMA encourages private and public payers to 35 include all forms of naloxone on their preferred drug lis ts and formularies with minimal 36 or no cost sharing. 5.

Our AMA urges federal action to require all US air carriers to report data on in- flight medical emergencies, specific uses of in- flight medical kits and emergency lifesaving devices, and unscheduled diversions due to in- flight medical emergencies; this action should further require the Federal Aviation Administration to work with the airline industry and appropriate medical specialty societies to periodically review dat a on the incidence and outcomes of in- flight medical emergencies and issue recommendations regarding the contents of in -flight medical kits and the use of emergency lifesaving devices aboard commercial aircraft. 2. Our AMA will: (a) support the addition of naloxone to the airline medical kit; (b) encourage airlines to voluntarily include naloxone in their airline medical kits; and (c) encourage the addition of naloxone to the emergency medical kits of all US airlines (14CFR Appendix A to Part 121 - First Ai d Kits and Emergency Medical Kits).

Secrest, MD , Chair) Whereas, Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is defined as a postnatal withdrawal syndrome 1 often occurring in infants exposed to opioids in- utero1; and 2 3 Whereas, The prevalence of opioid use disorder in pregnant women quadrupled from 1994 to 4 2014 to 6.5 per 1,000 births2; and 5 6 Whereas, The prev alence of NAS between 2000 to 2012 increased to 6.0 per 1,000 births, a 7 five-fold increase, and in 2016 was found to be as high as 20 per 1,000 births in 23 hospitals1; 8 and 9 10 Whereas, Current treatment focuses on both pharmacologic care (most commonly the 11 prescription of morphine) and non -pharmacologic care (swaddling, frequent feeds, and skin- to- 12 skin care), with most patients being admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) 3; and 13 14 Whereas, The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that pat ients with NAS be 15 treated via non- pharmacologic care in less severe cases4; and 16 17 Whereas, The cost of treating patients with NAS was found to have surged from $61 million in 18 2003 to $316 million in 2012 with a mean length of stay (LOS) in the NICU of 16.57 days, 19 occupying 4% of US NICU beds5-6; and 20 21 Whereas, Patients with NAS are hyperarousable with altered sleep/wake states and thus 22 require a dark, quiet environment and minimal stimulation7; and 23 24 Whereas, The flashing lights and alarms in a NICU do not re flect the recommended 25 environment for patients with NAS, and patients with NAS placed in NICUs have been found to 26 experience more severe withdrawal, have longer LOS, and increased pharmacotherapy 27 compared to those who were not8-9; and 28 29 Whereas, Rooming- in, where patients with NAS are admitted to in- patient rooms with their 30 parents or legal guardians for the duration of their stay, is an alternative to NICU admission; and 31 32 Whereas, Mothers of patients with NAS are often treated at prenatal clinics for substance use 33 disorder, where they also receive education about NAS, and continue to receive treatment while 34 rooming -in with their child10-11; and 35 36 Whereas, Rooming- in was found to be associated with a reduction of 20 -60% in patients 37 requiring pharmacological tr eatment, shortened LOS from 17 days to an average of 12 days, 38 Resolution: 525 (A-19) Page 2 of 3 and lowered cost by 75% without a significant difference in readmission rates or adverse in- 1 hospital events1,9,11,12; and 2 3 Whereas, Rooming- in has been noted to have the additional benefits of increasing parental 4 involvement and breastfeeding9,12; and 5 6 Whereas, Bonding and attachment aided by the release of oxytocin during breastfeeding may 7 protect the mother against addiction relapse and stress, and breastfeeding can prevent or 8 reduce complications of NAS so infants demonstrate lower NAS scores, need less 9 pharmac ological treatment, and have a shorter LOS13-15; and 10 11 Whereas, Maximum parental presence (100%) was associated with a 9 -day shorter LOS and 8 12 fewer days of infant opioid therapy as well as fewer days of infant opioid therapy and reduced 13 mean NAS score after adjusting for breastfeeding16; and 14 15 Whereas, The AAP Committee on Fetus and Newborn found that rooming -in provides more 16 security for healthy term newborns, increases supervised maternal -newborn interactions, and 17 more opportunities for hospital staff to e mpower parents to care for their infants17; therefore be it 18 19 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support keeping patients with neonatal 20 abstinence syndrome with their parents or legal guardians in the hospital throughout their 21 treatment, as the patient's health and safety permits, through the implementation of rooming- in 22 programs (New HOD Policy) ; and be it further 23 24 RESOLVED, That our AMA support the education of physicians about rooming- in patients with 25 neonatal abstinence sy ndrome.

Citation: (Res. 131, A -90; Reaffirmed: Sunset Report, I -00; Reaffirmed: CEJA Rep. 6, A -10 Perinatal Addiction - Issues in Care and Prevention H -420.962 Our AMA: (1) adopts the following statement: Transplacental drug transfer should not be subject to criminal sanctions or civil liability; (2) encourages the federal government to expand the proportion of funds allocated to drug treatment, prevention, and education. In particular, support is crucial for establishing and making broadly available specialized treatment programs for drug- addicted pregnant and breastfeeding women wherever possible; (3) urges the federal government to fund additional research to further knowledge about and effective treatment programs for drug- addicted pregnant and breastfeeding women, encourages also the support of research that provides long-term follow - up data on the developmental consequences of perinatal drug exposure, and identifies appropriate methodologies for early intervention with perinatally exposed children; (4) reaffirms the following statement: Pregnant and breastfeeding patients with substance use disorders should be provided with physician-led, team -based care that is evidence-based and of fers the ancillary and supportive services that are necessary to support rehabilitation; and (5) through its communication vehicles, encourages all physicians to increase their knowledge regarding the effects of drug and alcohol use during pregnancy and br eastfeeding and to routinely inquire about alcohol and drug use in the course of providing prenatal care.

Res. 507, A -16; Modifi ed: Res. 906, I -17 Drug Abuse in the United States - the Next Generation H -95.976 Our AMA is committed to efforts that can help prevent this national problem from becoming a chronic burden. The AMA pledges its continuing involvement in programs to alert physicians and the public to the dimensions of the problem and the most promising solutions. The AMA, therefore: (1) supports cooperation in activities of organizations such as the National Association for Perinatal Addiction Research and Education (NAPARE) in fostering education, research, prevention, and treatment of substance abuse; (2) encourages the development of model substance abuse treatment programs, complete with an evaluation component that is designed to meet the special needs of pregnant women and women with infant children through a comprehensive array of essential services; (3) urges physicians to routinely provide, at a minimum, a historical screen for all pregnant women, and those of childbearing age for substance abuse and to follow up posi tive screens with appropriate counseling, interventions and referrals; (4) supports pursuing the development of educational materials for physicians, physicians in training, other health care providers, and the public on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of perinatal addiction. In this regard, the AMA encourages further collaboration with the Partnership for a Drug-Free America in delivering appropriate messages to health professionals and the public on the risks and ramifications of perinatal drug and alcohol use; (5) urges the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and the Federal Office for Substance Abuse Prevention to continue to support research and demonstration projects around effective prevention and intervention strategies; (6) urges that public policy be predicated on the understanding that alcoholism and drug dependence, including tobacco dependence as indicated by the Surgeon General's report, are diseases characterized by compulsive use in the face of adverse consequences; (7) affirms the concept that substance abuse is a disease and supports developing model legislation to appropriately address perinatal addiction as a disease, bearing in mind physicians' concern for the health of the mother, the fetus and resultant offspring; and (8) calls for better coordination of research, prevention, and intervention services for women and infants at risk for both HIV infection and perinatal addiction.

Encourages continued research to identify programs and policies that are effective in reduc ing disproportionate minority contact across all decision points within the juvenile justice system. 3. Encourages states to increase the upper age of original juvenile court jurisdiction to at least 17 years of age. 4. Supports reforming laws and policies to reduce the number of youth transferred to adult criminal court. 5. Supports the re -authorization of federal programs for juvenile justice and delinquency prevention, which should include incentives for: (a) community -based alternatives for youth who pose little risk to public safety, (b) reentry and aftercare services to prevent recidivism, (c) policies that promote fairness to reduce disparities, and (d) the development and implementation of gender -responsive, trauma -informed programs and policies ac ross juvenile justice systems. 6. Encourages juvenile justice facilities to adopt and implement policies to prohibit discrimination against youth on the basis of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression in order to advance the safety and well -being of youth and ensure equal access to treatment and services. 7. Encourages states to suspend rather than terminate Medicaid coverage following arrest and detention in order to facilitate faster reactivation and ensure continuity of health care services upon their return to the community. 8. Encourages Congress to enact legislation prohibiting evictions from public housing based solely on an individual's relationship to a wrongdoer and encourages the Department of Housing and Urban Development and local public housing agencies to implement policies that support the use of discretion in making housing decisions, including consideration of the juvenile's rehabilitation efforts.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Clean Air H -135.991 (1) The AMA supports setting the national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards at the level necessary to protect the public health. Establishing such standards at the level necessary to protect the public health. Establishing such standards at a lev el \"allowing an adequate margin of safety,\" as provided in current law, should be maintained, but more scientific research should be conducted on the health effects of the standards currently set by the EPA. (2) The AMA supports continued protection of cer tain geographic areas (i.e., those with air quality better than the national standards) from significant quality deterioration by requiring strict, but reasonable, emission limitations for new sources. (3) The AMA endorses a more effective hazardous pollut ant program to allow for efficient control of serious health hazards posed by airborne toxic pollutants. (4) The AMA believes that more research is needed on the causes and effects of acid rain, and that the procedures to control pollution from another state need to be improved. (5) The AMA believes that attaining the national ambient air quality standards for nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide is necessary for the long- term benefit of the public health. Emission limitations for motor vehicles should be supported as a long- term goal until appropriate peer -reviewed scientific data demonstrate that the limitations are not required to protect the public health.

The public trustee may be el ected at any meeting of the House of Delegates at which the Selection Committee for the Public Trustee submits a nomination for approval by the House of Delegates. On recommendation of the Committee on Rules and Credentials, the House of Delegates shall set the day and hour of such election. The Medical Student Section shall elect the medical student trustee in accordance with Bylaw 3.5.6. 3.4.2 Method of Election. Where there is no contest, a majority vote without ballot shall elect. All other elections s hall be by ballot. 3.4.2.1 At -Large Trustees. 3.4.2.1.1 First Ballot. All nominees for the office of At -Large Trustee shall be listed alphabetically on a single ballot. Each elector shall have as many votes as the number of Trustees to be elected, and e ach Resolution: 611 (A-19) Page 3 of 5 vote must be cast for a different nominee. No ballot shall be counted if it contains fewer or more votes than the number of Trustees to be elected, or if the ballot contains more than one vote for any nominee. A nominee shall be elected if he or she has received a vote on a majority of the legal ballots cast and is one of the nominees receiving the largest number of votes within the number of Trustees to be elected. 3.4.2.1.2 Runoff Ballot. A runoff election shall be held to fill any vacancy not filled because of a tie vote. 3.4.2.1.3 Subsequent Ballots. If all vacancies for Trustees are not filled on the first ballot and 3 or more Trustees are still to be elected, the number of nominees on subsequent ballots shall be reduced to no more than twice the number of remaining vacancies less one. The nominees on subsequent ballots shall be determined by retaining those who received the greater number of votes on the preceding ballot and eliminating the nominee(s) who received the fewest votes on the preceding ballot, except where there is a tie.

Rules for AMA Elections G -610.020 (1) The Speaker and Vice Speaker of the House of Delegates are responsible for overall administration of our AMA elections, although balloting is conducted under the supervision of the chief teller and the Committee on Rules and Credentials. The Speaker and Vice Speaker will advise candidates on allowable activities and when appropriate will ensure that clarification of these rules is provided to all known candidates. The Speaker, in consultation with the Vice Speaker, is responsible for declaring a violation of the rules; (2) Individuals intending to seek election at the next Annual Meeting should make their intentions known to the Speakers, generally by providing the Speaker's office with an electronic announcement \"card\" that includes any or all of the following elements and no more: the candidate's name, photograph, email address, URL, the office sought and a list of endorsing societies. The Speakers will ensure that the information is posted on our AMA website in a timely fas hion, generally on the morning of the last day of a House of Delegates meeting or upon adjournment of the meeting. Announcements that include additional information (e.g., a brief resume) will not be posted to the website. Printed announcements may not be distributed in the venue where the House of Delegates meets. The Speakers may use additional means to make delegates aware of those members intending to seek election; (3) Active campaigning for AMA elective office may not begin until the Board of Trustees , after its April meeting, announces the nominees for council seats. Active campaigning includes mass outreach activities directed to all or a significant portion of the members of the House of Delegates and communicated by or on behalf of the candidate. I f in the judgment of the Speaker of the House of Delegates circumstances warrant an earlier date by which campaigns may formally begin, the Speaker shall communicate the earlier date to all known candidates; (4) An Election Manual containing information on all candidates for election shall continue to be Resolution: 611 (A-19) Page 4 of 5 developed annually, with distribution limited to publication on our AMA website, typically on the Web pages associated with the meeting at which elections will occur. The Election Manual provides an equal opportunity for each candidate to present the material he or she considers important to bring before the members of the House of Delegates and should relieve the need for the additional expenditures incurred in making non- scheduled telephone calls and dupli cative mailings. The Election Manual serves as a mechanism to reduce the number of telephone calls, mailings and other messages members of the House of Delegates receive from or on behalf of candidates; (5) A reduction in the volume of telephone calls from candidates, and literature and letters by or on behalf of candidates is encouraged. The use of electronic messages to contact electors should be minimized, and if used must allow recipients to opt out of receiving future messages; (6) At the Interim Meeti ng, campaign- related expenditures and activities shall be discouraged. Large campaign receptions, luncheons, other formal campaign activities and the distribution of campaign literature and gifts are prohibited at the Interim Meeting. It is permissible at the Interim Meeting for candidates seeking election to engage in individual outreach, such as small group meetings, including informal dinners, meant to familiarize others with a candidate's opinions and positions on issues; (7) Our AMA believes that: (a) specialty society candidates for AMA House of Delegates elected offices should be listed in the pre- election materials available to the House as the representative of that society and not by the state in which the candidate resides; (b) elected specialty s ociety members should be identified in that capacity while serving their term of office; and (c) nothing in the above recommendations should preclude formal co- endorsement by any state delegation of the national specialty society candidate, if that state delegation should so choose; (8) A state, specialty society, caucus, coalition, etc. may contribute to more than one party. However, a candidate may be featured at only one party, which includes: (a) being present in a receiving line, (b) appearing by name or in a picture on a poster or notice in or outside of the party venue, or (c) distributing stickers, buttons, etc. with the candidate's name on them. At these events, alcohol may be served only on a cash or no- host bar basis; (9) Displays of campaign post ers, signs, and literature in public areas of the hotel in which Annual Meetings are held are prohibited because they detract from the dignity of the position being sought and are unsightly. Campaign posters may be displayed at campaign parties, and campai gn literature may be distributed in the non- official business bag for members of the House of Delegates. No campaign literature shall be distributed and no mass outreach electronic messages shall be transmitted after the opening session of the House of Del egates; (10) Campaign expenditures and activities should be limited to reasonable levels necessary for adequate candidate exposure to the delegates. Campaign gifts can be distributed only at the Annual Meeting in the non-official business bag and at one campaign party. Campaign gifts should only be distributed during the Annual Meeting and not mailed to delegates and alternate delegates in advance of the meeting. The Speaker of the House of Delegates shall establish a limit on allowable expenditures for cam paign- related gifts. In addition to these giveaway gifts, campaign memorabilia are allowed but are limited to a button, pin, or sticker. No other campaign memorabilia shall be distributed at any time; (11) The Speaker's Office will coordinate the scheduling of candidate interviews for general officer positions (Trustees, President -Elect, Speaker and Vice Speaker); (12) At the Opening Session of the Annual Meeting, officer candidates in a contested election will give a two-minute self -nominating speech, with the order of speeches determined by lot. No speeches for unopposed candidates will be given, except for president -elect. When there is no contest for president - elect, the candidate will ask a delegate to place his or her name in nomination, and the electi on will then be by acclamation. When there are two or more candidates for the office of president -elect, a two- minute nomination speech will be given by a delegate. In addition, the Speaker of the House of Delegates will schedule a debate in front of the A MA-HOD to be conducted by rules established by the Speaker or, in the event of a conflict, the Vice Speaker; (13) Candidates for AMA office should not attend meetings of state medical societies unless officially invited and could accept reimbursement of tr avel expenses by the state society in accordance with the policies of the society; (14) Every state and specialty society delegation is encouraged to participate in a regional caucus, for the purposes of candidate review activities; and (15) Our AMA (a) re quires completion of conflict of interest forms by all candidates for election to our AMA Board of Trustees and councils prior to their election; and (b) will expand accessibility to completed conflict of interest information by posting such information on the \"Members Only\" section of our AMA Resolution: 611 (A-19) Page 5 of 5 website before election by the House of Delegates, with links to the disclosure statements from relevant electronic documents.

(2) Any ele ctioneering practices that distort the democratic processes of House elections, such as vote trading for the purpose of supporting candidates, are unacceptable. (3) Candidates for elected positions should comply with the requirements and the spirit of Hous e of Delegates policy on campaigning and campaign spending. (4) Candidates and their sponsoring organizations should exercise restraint in campaign spending. Federation organizations should establish clear and detailed guidelines on the appropriate level of resources that should be allocated to the political campaigns of their members for AMA leadership positions. (5) Incumbency should not assure the re- election of an individual to an AMA leadership position. (6) Service in any AMA leadership position shoul d not assure ascendancy to another leadership position. Citation: (CLRPD Rep. 4, I -01; Reaffirmed: CC&B Rep. 2, A -11) Election Process G -610.030 AMA guidelines on the election process are as follows: (1) AMA elections will be held on Tuesday at each Annua l Meeting; (2) Poll hours will not be extended beyond the times posted. All delegates eligible to vote must be in line to vote at the time appointed for the close of polls; and (3) The final vote count of all secret ballots of the House of Delegates shall be made public and part of the official proceedings of the House.

(Directive to Take 19 Action) 20 Fiscal Note: Estimated cost of $200,000 to implement resolution. Received: 05/09/19 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 613 (A-19) Introduced by: Minority Affairs Section Subject: Language Proficiency Data of Physicians in the AMA Masterfile Referred to: Reference Committee F (Greg Tarasidis, MD, Chair) Whereas, The U.S. population's linguistic demographics continue to diversify with over 350 1 languages spoken in the U.S.; 1 and 2 3 Whereas, Population estimates regarding individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP) 4 suggest there are over 25 million people with LEP in the U.S., the majority (64%) of whom are 5 Spanish speakers,2-3 and with substantial additional population who may not have general LEP 6 but may have difficulty communicating in English during medical encounters due to the 7 complexity of health- related cultural -linguistic elements, illness -related s tressors, and other 8 concomitant access -to-care challenges in minority populations;4-6 and 9 10 Whereas, The federal government mandates that health care be provided equitably to patients 11 in their preferred language regardless of national origin or language pre ference;7-8 and 12 13 Whereas, Data demonstrates that language concordance, defined as direct patient -physician 14 communication in the same language, improves patient outcomes and satisfaction;9-11 and 15 16 Whereas, Data demonstrates that language concordant care is superior to professional 17 interpreter -mediated medical care;12-13 and 18 19 Whereas, A majority of medical schools report offering opportunities for linguistic education for 20 medical students in languages other than English (e.g. medical Spanish) due to patient 21 population demographic needs and increasing student demand;17 and 22 23 Whereas The long -term outcomes of medical school education in non -English medical 24 communication skills, such as appropriate interpreter use,18-19 cultural competency, and 25 linguistic training (e.g., medical Spanish)20 are currently unknown and would require collection 26 and evaluation of physician language proficiency data; and 27 28 Whereas, Existing language concordance preliminary data of primary care providers' languages 29 conducted in California demonstrates a gross language concordance mismatch compared to the 30 regional population linguistic profile,21 and conducting similar studies locally, regionally, and 31 nationally would enable a needs assessment of available physician resources with regards to 32 underserved populations; and 33 Resolution: 613 (A-19) Page 2 of 6 Whereas, the Six -point Physician Linguistic Proficiency Self -assessment Scale, from the 1 Adapted International Language Roundtable (ILR) Scale for Physicians23 can measure language 2 fluency as follows: 3 4 Excellent - Speaks proficiently, equivalent to that of an educated speaker, and is 5 skilled at incorporating appropriate medical terminology and concepts into 6 communication. Has complete fluency in the language such that speech in all levels is 7 fully accepted by educated nat ive speakers in all its features, including breadth of 8 vocabulary and idioms, colloquialisms, and pertinent cultural references. 9 Very Good - Able to use the language fluently and accurately on all levels related to 10 work needs in a healthcare setting. Can understand and participate in any conversation 11 within the range of his/her experience with a high degree of fluency and precision of 12 vocabulary. Unaffected by rate of speech. Language ability only rarely hinders him/her in 13 performing at task requiring language; yet, the individual would seldom be perceived as 14 a native. 15 Good - Able to speak the language with sufficient accuracy and vocabulary to have 16 effective formal and informal conversations on most familiar topics. Although cultural 17 references, proverbs and the implications of nuances and idiom may not be fully 18 understood, the individual can easily repair the conversation. May have some difficulty 19 communicating necessary health concepts. 20 Fair - Meets basic conversational needs. Able to understand and respond to simple 21 questions. Can handle casual conversation about work, school, and family. Has difficulty 22 with vocabulary and grammar. The individual can get the gist of most everyday 23 conversations but has difficulty communicating about healthcare concepts. 24 Poor - Satisfies elementary needs and minimum courtesy requirements. Able to 25 understand and respond to 2 -3 word entry level questions. May require slow speech and 26 repetition to understand. Unable to understand or communicate most healthcare 27 concepts. 28 None - Unable to function in the spoken language. Oral production is limited to 29 occasional isolated words. Has essentially no communicative ability; therefore be it 30 31 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association initiate collection of self -reported physician 32 language proficiency data in the Masterfile by asking physicians with the validated six -point 33 adapted ILR -scale for physicians to indicate their level of proficiency for each language besides 34 English in the healthcare settings.

Differences in treatment that are not directly related to differences in individual patientsclinical needs or preferences constitute inappropriate variations in health care. Such variations may contribute to health outcomes that are considerably worse in members of some populations than those of members of ma jority populations. This represents a significant challenge for physicians, who ethically are called on to provide the same quality of care to all patients without regard to medically irrelevant personal characteristics. To fulfill this professional obligation in their individual practices physicians should: (a) Provide care that meets patient needs and respects patient preferences. (b) Avoid stereotyping patients. (c) Examine their own practices to ensure that inappropriate considerations about race, gender identify, sexual orientation, sociodemographic factors, or other nonclinical factors, do not affect clinical judgment. (d) Work to eliminate biased behavior toward patients by other health care professionals and staff who come into contact with patients. (e) Encourage shared decision making. Resolution: 613 (A-19) Page 6 of 6 (f) Cultivate effective communication and trust by seeking to better understand factors that can influence patientshealth care decisions, such as cultural traditions, health beliefs and health literacy, language or other barriers to communication and fears or misperceptions about the health care system. The medical profession has an ethical responsibility to: (g) Help increase awareness of health care disparities. (h) Strive to increase the diversity of the physician w orkforce as a step toward reducing health care disparities. (i) Support research that examines health care disparities, including research on the unique health needs of all genders, ethnic groups, and medically disadvantaged populations, and the development of quality measures and resources to help reduce disparities. AMA Principles of Medical Ethics: I,IV,VII,VIII,IX The Opinions in this chapter are offered as ethics guidance for physicians and are not intended to establish standards of clinical practice or rules of law.

Planning should have as a goal appropriate physician numbers, specialty mix, and geographic distribution. (2) Our AMA encourages and collaborates in the collection of the data needed for workforce planning and in the conduct of national and regional research on physician supply and distribution. The AMA will Resolution: 614 (A-19) Page 3 of 3 independently and in collaboration with state and specialty societies, national medical organizations, and other public and private sector groups, compile and disseminate the results of the research. (3) The medical profession must be integrally involved in any workforce planning efforts sponsored by federal or state governments, or by the private sector. (4) In order to enhance access to care, our AMA c ollaborates with the public and private sectors to ensure an adequate supply of physicians in all specialties and to develop strategies to mitigate the current geographic maldistribution of physicians. (5) There is a need to enhance underrepresented minori ty representation in medical schools and in the physician workforce, as a means to ultimately improve access to care for minority and underserved groups. (6) There should be no decrease in the number of funded graduate medical education (GME) positions. Any increase in the number of funded GME positions, overall or in a given specialty, and in the number of US medical students should be based on a demonstrated regional or national need. (7) Our AMA will collect and disseminate information on market demands and workforce needs, so as to assist medical students and resident physicians in selecting a specialty and choosing a career. (8) Our AMA will encourage the Health Resources & Service Administration to collaborate with specialty societies to determine spec ific changes that would improve the agencys physician workforce projections process, to potentially include more detailed projection inputs, with the goal of producing more accurate and detailed projections including specialty and subspecialty workforces.

Definition Harassment consists of unwelcom e conduct whether verbal, physical or visual that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his/her race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, marital status, citizenship or other protected group status, and that: (1) has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment; (2) has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's participation in meetings or proceedings of the HOD or any AMA Entity; or (3) otherwise adversely affects an individual's participation in such meetings or proceedings or, in the case of AMA staff, such individual's employment opportunities or tangible job benefits. Harassing conduct includes, but is not limited to: epithets, slurs or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; and written, electronic, or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group and that is placed on walls or elsewhere on the AMA's premises or at the site of any AMA meeting or circulated in connection with any AMA meeting. Sexual Harassment Sexual harassment also constitutes discrimination, and is unlawful and is absolutely prohibited. For the purposes of this policy, sexual harassment includes: - making unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or other verbal, physical, or visual conduct of a sexual nature; and - creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment or otherwise unreasonably interfering with an individual's participation in meetings or proceedings of the HOD or any AMA Entity or, in the case of AMA staff, such individual's work performance, by instances of such conduct. Sexual harassment may include s uch conduct as explicit sexual propositions, sexual innuendo, suggestive comments or gestures, descriptive comments about an individual's physical appearance, electronic stalking or lewd messages, displays of foul or obscene printed or visual material, and any unwelcome physical contact. Retaliation against anyone who has reported harassment, submits a complaint, reports an incident witnessed, or participates in any way in the investigation of a harassment claim is forbidden. Each complaint of harassment or retaliation will be promptly and thoroughly investigated. To the fullest extent possible, the AMA will keep complaints and the terms of their resolution confidential. Anti-Harassment Policy 1. Reporting a complaint of harassment Any persons who believe th ey have experienced or witnessed conduct in violation of Anti -Harassment Policy H -140.837 during any AMA House of Delegates meeting or associated functions should promptly notify the Speaker or Vice Speaker of the House or the AMA Office of General Counsel . Any persons who believe they have experienced or witnessed conduct in other activities associated with the AMA (such as meetings of AMA councils, sections, the RVS Update Committee (RUC), or CPT Editorial Panel) in violation of Anti -Harassment Policy H-140.837 should promptly notify the presiding officer(s) of such AMA -associated meeting or activity or either the Chair of the Board or the AMA Office of General Counsel. Anyone who prefers to register a complaint to an external vendor may do so using an AMA compliance hotline (telephone and online) maintained on behalf of the AMA. The name of the reporting party will be kept confidential by the vendor and not be released to the AMA. The vendor will advise the AMA of any complaint it receives so that the AMA may investigate. 2. Investigations Resolution: 616 (A-19) Page 4 of 4 Investigations of harassment complaints will be conducted by AMA Human Resources. Each complaint of harassment or retaliation shall be promptly and thoroughly investigated. Generally, AMA Human Resources will (a) use reas onable efforts to minimize contact between the accuser and the accused during the pendency of an investigation and (b) provide the accused an opportunity to respond to allegations. Based on its investigation, AMA Human Resources will make a determination as to whether a violation of Anti -Harassment Policy H -140.837 has occurred. 3. Disciplinary Action If AMA Human Resources shall determine that a violation of Anti -Harassment Policy H -140.837 has occurred, AMA Human Resources shall (i) notify the Speaker and Vice Speaker of the House or the presiding officer(s) of such other AMA -associated meeting or activity in which such violation occurred, as applicable, of such determination, (ii) refer the matter to the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs (CEJA) for disciplinary and/or corrective action, which may include but is not limited to expulsion from the relevant AMA- associated meetings or activities, and (iii) provide CEJA with appropriate training. If a Delegate or Alternate Delegate is determined to have violated Anti -Harassment Policy H -140.837, CEJA shall determine disciplinary and/or corrective action in consultation with the Speaker and Vice Speaker of the House. If a member of an AMA council, section, the RVS Update Committee (RUC), or CPT Editorial Panel is determined to have violated Anti -Harassment Policy H -140.837, CEJA shall determine disciplinary and/or corrective action in consultation with the presiding officer(s) of such activities. If a nonmember or non- AMA party is the accused, AMA Human R esources shall refer the matter to appropriate AMA management, and when appropriate, may suggest that the complainant contact legal authorities. 4. Confidentiality To the fullest extent possible, the AMA will keep complaints, investigations and resolutions confidential, consistent with usual business practice. [ Editor's note.

Our AMA encourages: (a) medical schools, primary care residencies, and other training programs as appropriate to include the appropriate knowledge and skills to enable graduates to recognize, diagnose, and treat depression and other mental illnesses, either as the chief complaint or with another general medical condition; (b) all physicians providing clinical care to acquire the same knowledge and skills; and (c) additional research into the course and outcomes of patients with depression and other mental illnesses who are seen in general medical settings and into the development of clinical and systems approaches designed to improve patient outcomes. Furthermore, any approaches designed to manage care by reduction in the demand for services should be based on scientifically sound outcomes research findings. 2. Our AMA will work with the National Institute on Mental Health and appropriate medical specialty and mental health advocacy groups to increase public awareness about depression and other mental illnesses, to reduce the stigma associated with depression and other mental illnesses, and to increase patient access to quality care for depression and other mental illnesses. 3. Our AMA: (a) will advocate for the incorporation of integrated services for general medical care, mental health care, and substance use disorder care into existing psychiatry, addiction medicine and primary care training programs' clinical settings; (b) encourages graduate medical education programs in primary care, psychiatry, and addiction medicine to create and expand opport unities for residents and fellows to obtain clinical experience working in an integrated behavioral health and primary care model, such as the collaborative care model; and (c) will advocate for appropriate reimbursement to support the practice of integrat ed physical and mental health care in clinical care settings. 4.Our AMA recognizes the impact of violence and social determinants on women's mental health.

The ment al health field is vast and includes a network of factors involving the life of the individual, the community and the nation. Any program designed to combat mental illness and promote mental health must, by the nature of the problems to be solved, be both ambitious and comprehensive. (2) The AMA recognizes the important stake every physician, regardless of type of practice, has in improving our mental health knowledge and resources. The physician participates in the mental health field on two levels, as an individual of science and as a citizen. The physician has much to gain from a knowledge of modern psychiatric principles and techniques, and much to contribute to the prevention, handling and management of emotional disturbances. Furthermore, as a natural community leader, the physician is in an excellent position to work for and guide effective mental health programs. (3) The AMA will be more active in encouraging physicians to become leaders in community planning for mental health. Resolution: 708 (A-19) Page 4 of 4 (4) The AMA has a deep interest in fostering a general attitude within the profession and among the lay public more conducive to solving the many problems existing in the mental health field.

(Ref. Cmt. G, 3 Rec. 2, A -96; Reaffirmation A -97) 4 5 (2) Conduct of Review. Our AMA supports advocate for the development of additional draft 6 state and federal legislation to: (a) require private review entities and payers to disclose to 7 physicians on request the screening criteria, weighting elements and computer algorithms 8 utilized in the review process, and how they were developed; (b) require that any physician 9 who recommends a denial as to the medical necessity of services on behalf of a utilization 10 review entity or health plan be of the same specialty and have expertise to treat the medical 11 condition or disease as the practitioner who provided the services under review; (c) Require 12 every organization that revie ws or contracts for review of the medical necessity of services 13 to establish a procedure whereby a physician claimant has an opportunity to appeal a claim 14 denied for lack of medical necessity to a medical consultant or peer review group which is 15 independent of the organization conducting or contracting for the initial review; (d) require 16 that any physician who makes judgments or recommendations regarding the necessity or 17 appropriateness of services or site of service be licensed to practice medicine in the same 18 jurisdiction as the practitioner who is proposing the service or whose services are being 19 reviewed; (e) require that review entities respond within 48 hours to patient or physician 20 requests for prior authorization, and that they have personnel available by telephone the 21 same business day who are qualified to respond to other concerns or questions regarding 22 medical necessity of services, including determinations about the certification of continued 23 length of stay; (f) require that any payer instituting prior authorization requirements as a 24 condition for plan coverage provide enrollees subject to such requirements with consent 25 forms for release of medical information for utilization review purposes, to be executed by 26 the enrollee at the time services requiring such prior authorization are recommended or 27 proposed by the physician; and (g) require that payers compensate physicians for those 28 efforts involved in complying with utilization review requirements that are more costly, 29 complex and time consuming than the completion of standard health insurance claim forms. 30 Compensation should be provided in situations such as obtaining preadmission certification, 31 second opinions on elective surgery, and certification for extended length of stay. 32 33 (3) Accountability. Our AMA believes that draft federal and state legislation should also be 34 developed to impose similar liability on health benefit plans for any harm to enrollees 35 resulting from failure to disclose prior to enrollment the information on plan provisions and 36 operation specified under Section 1 (a) -(d) above.

(2); and 5 6 Whereas, The \"Surviving Sepsis Campaign,\" a joint collaboration of the Society of Critical Care 7 Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine whose mission is to reduce 8 mortality and morbidity from sepsis and septic shock worldwide, recommends that early 9 identification and treatment using a bundle of interventions increases the likelihood of survival 10 from sepsis (3); and 11 12 Whereas, Promotion of early screening and diagnosis of Sepsis by primary care physicians and 13 other heal th care providers that practice outside of hospital settings may avoid delay in 14 treatment and improve patient outcomes (4) yet continues to be an area of opportunity to 15 improve sepsis care from a population health approach (3); and 16 17 Whereas, Healthcare p roviders will be empowered by improved knowledge and early use of 18 tools for Sepsis screening to help make a difference in preventing patients from progressing to 19 organ failure; therefore be it 20 21 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Associat ion collaborate with interested medical 22 organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Society of 23 Critical Care Medicine to promote the importance of early detection and expedited intervention 24 of sepsis by healthcare providers who work in out -of-hospital settings to improve patient 25 outcomes and save lives.
