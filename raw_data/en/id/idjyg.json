{"title": "Fourth International Rushmore Conference on Enteric Disease: Methods for Protection from Infection", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Enteric, or diarrheal diseases remain a major health problem for domestic food-producing animals, as well as for Human Beings world-wide. Some such diseases arise from animal to animal, or person to person contact. Others result from contaminated food or water, or by inter-species contact such as by human contact with cattle. Disease outcomes range from transient illness to life threatening conditions with long-term health consequences among survivors. Methods for treatment and/or prevention are limited, and in most cases, effective vaccines are not available. Some of these diseases cross species barriers while others do not. In all cases the disease syndromes are similar as are the methods by which the pathogen attacks the host. For that reason, there is great value in communication between scientists studying individual enteric pathogens, and between veterinary researchers and biomedical researches. The purpose of the International Rushmore Conferences is to bring investigators from a variety of interests and backgrounds together to discuss common challenges in an effort of identifying common solutions. The goals of this conference include improved communication between researchers from different backgrounds, stimulating the development of inter-institutional collaborations, and creating a greater appreciation among biomedical researchers of the availability of valuable large-animal biomedical models for infectious disease research.", "sitename": null, "date": "2011-01-09", "cleaned_text": "Progress 09/01/11 to 08/31/12 Outputs OUTPUTS: The Fourth International Rushmore Conference on Enteric Diseases, subtitled \"Methods for protection from infection\" was held on Saturday and Sunday, December 3-4, 2011 at the Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnificent Mile Hotel in conjunction with the 92th Annual Meeting of the Conference of Research Workers in Animal Diseases (CRWAD). The conference featured four sessions beginning at 8:00 AM on Saturday and ending at noon on Sunday. Presentations came from 23 institutions of higher learning, businesses and/or government agencies and included 35 talks, ranging in length from seven minutes to 45 minutes. Thirteen of the talks were given by invited presenters nominated as international experts in subjects to be covered by the conference. The remainder of presentations was given by individuals responding to the program announcements. The conference covered topics on a wide range of enteric bacteria and viruses that cause diseases in humans and/or animals, including E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Clostridium, Lawsonia, etiological identification, vaccine development, therapy and animal/disease model development. Attendance at the conference was approximately 70. Conference support came from a USDA NIFA grant and generous contributions from Elanco Animal Health, Merial Limited, Harris Vaccines and Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health. PARTICIPANTS: David Francis, PhD, Professor and Principal Conference Organizer, South dakota State University; Richard Isaacson, PhD, Professor and Conference Committee Member, University of Minnesota; Linda Saif, PhD, Professor and Conference Committee Member, The Ohio State University; Rodney Moxley, DVM, PhD, Professor and Conference Committee Member, University of Nebraska-Lincoln; Tom Besser, DVM, PhD, Professor and Conference Committee Member, Washington State University; Shirley Wiener, Madelyn Francis, Nuria Garcia, and Mojun Zhao, Conference Support Staff, South Dakota State University TARGET AUDIENCES: Academic and Industrial Research Scientists. This conference was widely announced through personal e-mailings and through electronic media outlets, including the website for the CRWAD. PROJECT MODIFICATIONS: Nothing significant to report during this reporting period. Impacts This conference brought together scientists from a variety of institutions and disciplines representing both animal and human medicine. This gathering allowed cross-fostering of ideas across programs and disciplines, and nurtured the development of new ideas and collaborations. Substantial attendance from widely dispersed geographical areas attested to the need for such a conference and its potential for accomplishing the stated goal of stimulating interaction between individuals in diverse enteric disease research programs.
