Cincinnati Children's includ es one of the nation's largest pediatric tertiary and quaternary care facilities. During the fiscal year (FY) that ended June 30, 2021, Cincinnati Children's had more than 1.5 million patient encounters and served patients from 65 countries, all 50 states , Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico.1 Purpose of Report The 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA ) process meaningfully and consistently connected with community members and partners to obtain an understanding of health needs experienced and prioritized by the community. The process used a population health mindset and multiple avenues of connection to create a document capable of enhancing collective efforts to equitably improve child health. This report meets the requirements of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the IRS Section 501(r)(3) and is inclusive of Cincinnati Children's four hospital fac ilities - Burnet Campus, Liberty Campus, College Hill Campus, and Linder Center of HOPE . Cincinnati Children's Primary Service Area (PSA), which is an eight -county region in Southwestern Ohio, Northern Kentucky, and Southeastern Indiana, is the defined co mmunity for this assessment. The PSA includes Butler, Clermont, Hamilton and Warren Counties in Ohio; Boone, Campbell and Kenton Counties in Kentucky; and Dearborn County in Indiana.

Information gleaned from this re view, along with the framework of Cincinnati Children's Pursuing Our Potential Together (POPT) strategic plan, feedback from the CHNA Advisory Committee, and an emphasis on community partnership and population health, led to the creation of new primary dat a collection tools for the 2022 assessment. Primary and Secondary Data Collection To understand the extent of child health needs within Cincinnati Children's community, we utilized four primary data collection methods: an online 2021 Child Health Survey , a phone -based 2021 Child Health Survey, Key Informant Surveys, and Parent Discussion Groups. Input was solicited through Cincinnati Children's patients and families, community members, and key child health organizations, including organizations serving vulnerable populations across the Cincinnati Children's PSA. Cincinnati Children's collected secondary data from local, state, and national sources to research child health needs and guide question development. Internal hospital data related to admissi ons and disease prevalence was also reviewed. Prioritization Process During the primary data collection, Key Informant and 2021 Child Health Survey respondents were asked to rank the top two child health and health -related needs in their community. Onc e child health and health -related needs were identified from primary and secondary data sources, a prioritization committee - comprised of leaders representing primary and specialty pediatric care, social work, and Cincinnati Children's regional locations - was assembled. The prioritization committee reviewed the ranked priorities identified during the data collection process and were asked to prioritize the health needs on a 5-point Likert scale based on six criteria. Child health -related needs were rank ed in order of importance. 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment - Child Health Priorities Four child health priorities identified for the 2022 CHNA are: Strategies to address these four priories will be detailed in the accompanying 2022 Implementation Strategy report.

The complete evaluation can be found in Appendix A. 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment - Data Collection Methods The following section describes the approach and broader lens used for data collection for the current CHNA. The process builds on Cincinnati Children's prior reports and is in full compliance with IRS requirements. Primary Data Collection Methods To understand the extent of child health needs within Cincinnati Children's community, we utilized four primary data collection methods: an online 2021 Child Health Survey, a phone -based 2021 Child Health Historical In - Depth Review Review of prior Cincinnati Children's CHNAs and Child Health Surveys Review of CHNA and available surveys conducted by top pediatric institutionsSecondary Data Collection Cincinnati Children's Internal Data External Data Collection and ReviewPrimary Data Collection 2021 Child Health Survey -Online 2021 Child Health Survey -Phone Key Informant Survey Parent Discussion GroupsPrioritization Review of Primary Data Priorities Review Committee Prioritization Process Priority Finalization 19 Survey , Key Informant Surveys, and Parent Discussion Groups. Input was solicited through Cincinnati Children's patient s and families, community members , and key child health organizations , including organizations serving vulnerable populations across the Cincinnati Children's PSA . Prior to creating the primary data collection tools, an in -depth review was conducted of prior Cincinnati Children's CHNAs and Child Health Surveys, along with the written reports and available surveys conducted by other top pediatric institutions. Inform ation gleaned from this review, along with the framework of Cincinnati Children's POPT strategic plan, feedback from the CHNA Advisory Committee, and an emphasis on community partnership and population health, led to the creation of new primary data collec tion tools for the 2022 assessment. A list of Advisory Committee members can be found in Appendix B . 2021 Child Health Survey - Online Version From May through June 2021, the online 2021 Child Health Survey was distributed broadly across the PSA with a primary audience of parents and caregivers of youth under 18 years old. The secondary audience for the survey was community members that interact with children through their extended families, work , or volunteer activities. In the 28 -question survey, par ticipants were asked to share their perspective on health and health -related needs of children in our community and to identify gaps in resources. The survey questions are available in Appendix C . After completing the online survey , all participants were invited to enter a drawing for a $20 cash card. Eighty (80) cash cards were raffled. To maintain the confidentially and anonymity of survey respondents, the drawing opt -in information was collected in a different survey system and could not be tied back to participants ' responses. The online survey was offered on two virtual platforms - Center for Clinical & Translational Science and Training ( CCTST )'s REDcap platform and NRC 's Community Insights . More information about these partner organizations and platforms can be found in Project Collaborations . Participants for the survey were contacted through a distribution strategy that leveraged both internal Cincinnati Children's communications capabilities and external community partnerships to reach the broadest audience possible. A list of partner organizations is available in Appendix D. A total of 1,828 participants completed the online 2021 Child Health survey. Breakdown of responses by primary and secondary audience, county, and select demographics are in Figure 15 and Tables 14 and 15. Descriptive analysis was utilized to analyz e the online 2021 Child Health Survey responses.

More information on UCIPR can be found in Project Collaborations . The phone survey provided an oversample of residents in Hamilton County, with at least 30% of the responses from African American respondents. This county was oversampled given the high population and diversity compared to other counties in the PSA. The primary purpose for utilizing this strategy was to elevate the voice and perspective of parents and caregivers in the community directly around Cincinnati Children's locations , and to ensure an appropriately diverse participant sample, reflective of the community Cincinnati Children's serves . The telephone intervie ws were completed using a random -digit-dial methodology, with phone numbers purchased through Survey Sampling. A random sample of caregivers from throughout Hamilton County was interviewed by cellular and landline telephone from a centrally supervised tel ephone interviewing facility at UCIPR. The calls were made to both landlines and cellular phones to ensure a diverse sampling. Screening questions determined if there were children under age 18 years living in the household. Then, an adult member ( aged at least 18 years ) of the household with the most recent birthday was selected to complete the survey. Because the survey asks questions about their child specifically, a child was also randomly selected from the caregiver's household using the \"Last -Birthday\" selection method. This process ensured that each child in a household ha d an equal chance of being selected. Caregivers answered questions both about their own child(ren) and about children in the community as a whole. A total of 729 participants completed the phone 2021 Child Health survey. The phone survey questions are available in Appendix F . Breakdown of responses by geographic region and select demographics are in Figure 16 and Table 16. Descriptive analysis was utilized to depict phone 2021 Child Health Survey responses. Data summary tables for the phone 2021 Child Health Survey can be found in Appendix E . Figure 16.

They were also asked to identify gaps in resources. Most questions in the survey were multiple choice with opportunities to provide comments and suggestions for improving health in the region. The online survey was offered on CCTST' s REDCap platform. More information about this partner organization can be found in Project Collaborations . The survey questions are available in Appendix G . Descriptive analysis was utilized to depict Key Informant Survey responses. Data summary tables for the Key Informant Survey are available in Appendix H . A total of 4 2 participants, representing 39 organizations, completed the key informant survey (Figure 1 7). Organizations included social servic e agencies, government agencies, health departments, and others who serve medically underserved, low -income, and minority populations (Figure 18). Key informants were selected because of their knowledge and professional experience working on major child health issues in the community and given their ability to provide valuable insights into current challenges and future opportunities. A full list of Key Informant organizations can be found in Appendix I. 23 Figure 1 7. Key Informant Response by County Source: 2021 Key Informant Survey16 Figure 18. Sectors Represented Through Key Informant Reponses Source: 2021 Key Informant Survey16 Other includes Extension Programs and Su Casa Hispanic Services Center Parent Discussion Groups Virtual Parent Discussion Groups were conducted to elevate the voices of specific communities across the PSA. Each session took place over zoom and lasted approximately 1.5 hours. The Parent Discussion Group Questions are availab le in Appendix J . Parents received a $100 cash card as a reimbursement and thank you for the time and participation they provided . Participants were asked questions about health and health -related needs of children in their community, existing and needed resources to support children, and their ideas to ensure children and youth in their communities are healthy and thriving . Eight group sessions and two interviews were conducted in May and June 2021 with a total of 49 participants. One session and one interview were conducted in Spanish with Spanish - speaking parents who identified as Hispanic /Latino (Table 1 7). The Spanish session was conducted in partnership with AccuracyNow. More inform ation about this partner organization can be found in Project Collaborations . The Parent Discussion Group transcripts were coded to assess for common themes. The Parent Discussion group data summary are available in Appendix K .

These organizations include: o Brighton Center o Cincinnati Health Department o Every Child Succeeds o Legal Aid Society of Greater Cincinnati o Lighthouse Youth & Family Services o Society of St. Vincent de Paul o Su Casa Hispanic Center o Talbert House o United Way of Greater Cincinnati o A full list of Key Informant organizations can be found in Appendix I . Parent Discussion Group flyers were advertised in English and Spanish. Spanish flyers included the option to register over the phone with a Spanish speaker. Sessions were also offered in Spanish so parents could participant in their primary language. Parent Discussion Groups included sessions specifically for parents and caregivers of children with s pecial needs . Participants were recruited with support from the Pearlman Center and Cincinnati Children's Division of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics. Parent Discussion Groups were offered virtually (via Zoom) to allow for greater access and safety during the COVID -19 pandemic, and to reduce the time burden on participants by eliminating the need to travel. Participants could either call into the meeting with a provided phone number or join over a weblink. Offering both methods to join the meeting allowed participants with out internet access to still participate. The survey distribution strategy included monitoring of key demographic characteristics ( i.e., zip code, income) of completed responses to the Key Informant and 2021 Child Health Surveys to ensure the surveys reached a diverse population that was reflective of the community Cincinnati Children's serves. Secondary Data Collection Methods Cincinnati Children's collected secondary data from local, state, and national sources to research child health needs and guide question development. Where possible, the most recent data was included in this report. Internal hospital data related to admissions and disease prevalence was also reviewed. The internal data was complemented by data collected from a wide range of external sources, including: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 25 Children's Defense Fu nd Ohio Feeding America Health Resources & Services Administration Indiana Department of Education Indiana Department of Health Indiana Youth Institute Kentucky Department of Education Kentucky Department for Public Health Kentucky Youth Advocates Ohio Department of Education Ohio Department of Health Public Children Services Association of Ohio State of Childhood Obesity United States Census Bureau Wellbeing in the Nation Network A complete list of references can be found in Appendix Q . Project Colla borations The following section briefly describes the collaborations and partners hips utilized in the completion of this assessment. Center for Clinical and Translational Science and Training ( CCTST ) CCTST aims to \"maximize the impact of clinical and translational research to improve individual and population health locally and nationally.\"17 Research and training at the University of Cincinnati, UC Health, Cincinnati Children's, and the greater Cincinnati community are supported by CCTST . Cincinnati Children's consulted with a team from CCTST on the final development of the online 2021 Child H ealth Survey assessment tool. CCTST also hosts the REDCap platform , a HIPAA -compliant data entry and storage tool, which was utilized for the Key Information Survey and the online 2021 Child Health Survey. NRC Health Community Insights The NRC Community Insights platform enables Cincinnati Children's to gather audience insights from more than 10,000 patients and families . Participants opted -in from Cincinnati Children's patient experience surveys to participate in custom surveys . Throu gh the custom surveys, patients and families provid e input and feedback on various topics , including patient experience , hospital operations , and research . The online 2021 Child Health Survey was built into the NRC survey platform and distributed to patient families that live in Cincinnati's PSA. NRC Community Insights platform is managed by NRC Health. University of Cincinnati Institute for Policy Research (UCIPR) The University of Cincinnati institute for Policy Research (UCIPR ) has conducted surveys in the Greater Cincinnati region for more than 40 years. Cincinnati Children's contracted with UCIPR to conduct an abbreviated 2021 Child Health Survey by phone within Hamilton County. UCIPR purchased the sample for this survey fr om Dynata (dynata.com). Using random sampling methodology, UCIPR interviewed caregivers from throughout Hamilton County by cellular and landline telephone from a centrally supervised telephone interviewing facility at UCIPR. Calls during this period were made between 5:00 PM and 9:00 PM, Monday through Friday, from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM on Saturday, and from 2:00 to 9:00 PM on Sunday. 26 The Health Collaborative The Health Collaborative (THC), a 501c3 non-profit with the mission of improving health and health care in Greater Cincinnati, leads the creation of a regional CHNA report . The regional CHNA is separate from the Cincinnati Children's CHNA described herein . While the reports, data collection, and prioritization processes are separate, THC and Cincinnati Children's retained a collaborative relationship throughout the assessment process to create complementary reports. A copy of THC's finalized regional assessment can be found here https://healthcollab.org/community -health -needs -assessment . AccuracyNow AccuracyNow, a subsidiary of Catholic Charities Southwester n Ohio, provides interpretation, translation, and transcription services. Cincinnati Children's contracted with AccuracyNow to conduct the Spanish language Parent Discussion Groups. AccuracyNow provided a Spanish version of our Parent Discussion Group sc ript and questions, along with native -Spanish speaking interpreters to conduct the session and provide simultaneous translation to a Cincinnati Children's staff member on the session. Prioritization Process Child health and health -related needs were asses sed through the collection and analysis of primary and secondary data sources. Child health needs are related to medical conditions, such as chronic disease. Child health -related needs are related to social determinants of health, such as access to healthcare. Secondary data was used to inform data collection tool creation and gui de key questions to identify important child health needs. During the primary data collection, key Informant and 2021 Child Health Survey respondents were asked to rank the top two child health and health -related needs in their community. In the parent d iscussion groups, parents were asked questions about child health needs. The child health and health -related needs identified by the community can be found in Appendix L. Once child health and health -related needs were identified from primary and seconda ry data sources , a prioritization committee - comprised of leaders representing primary and specialty pediatric care, social work, and Cincinnati Children's regional location s - was assembled. Committee members were selected based on their expertise in child and pediatric health, leadership, work with children and families, and experiences collaborating with in the community. The prioritization committee reviewed the ranked priorities identified during the data collection process and were as ked to prioritize the health needs on a 5-point Likert scale based on the following criteria: Magnitude of Child Health Need Severity of Child Health Need Community Will and Community Assets to Address Child Health Need Alignment with Cincinnati Children's POPT: Community Health and DEI Goals Alignment with State and National Child Health Priorities and Resources Availability of Best Practice Programs and Resources to Address Child Health Need The prioritization committe e ranked child health -related needs in order of importance. The prioritization guidelines and rubric can be found in Appendix M. A list of the internal leaders that participated in the prioritization process can be found in Appendix N. 2022 Community He alth Needs Assessment - Prioritized Health Needs After completing the above prioritization process, the following child health needs were selected as the priorities for the 2022 CHNA and I mplementation Strategy reports : 27 Strategies to address these four priories will be detailed in the accompanying 2022 Implementation Strategy report ( https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/about/commun ity/health -needs -assessment ). Other health and health -related needs identified by the community are included in the list below . These other health and health -related needs will be addressed primarily through existing and new community partnerships . Many of the health and health -related needs prioritized by the community exist within or align closely to existing POPT strategies and goals. Based on the POPT Four Pillar structure, Figure 19 depicts how the identified health and health -related needs could align within the existing POPT strategy. The POPT plan will incorporate strategies that directly take these c hild health -related needs into account . Figure 1 9.

Overall Health Status During the primary data collection, parents and caregivers of youth under age 18 years old were asked questions about the general health status of their children. When asked \"what the phrase healthy child means to them,\" parents in our discussion groups described children as flourishing, gi ving smiles, safe, and living their \"best life.\" A common meaning of \"healthy child\" across sessions was a child that has all their needs met - mentally, physically, socially, and emotionally.18 Eighty percent (80%) of caregivers that completed the online 2021 C hild Health Survey14 and 84% of respondents to the phone 2021 Child Health Survey rated their child's health as exce llent or very good (Figure 2 0). Figure 2 0.

In particular, parents raised concerns about th e negative impacts the pandemic has had on social interaction, challenges of remote learning, and delayed medical care . Respondents saw detriments to children's mental and overall health. No themes , however, related directly to illness caused by COVID -19 infection in children and youth were identified during analysis.18 Fifty percent (50.0 %) of key informan ts reported COVID -19 as a moderate priority for the community.16 Forty -three percent (42.6%) of respondents to the online14 and 46.2% to the phone 2021 Child Health Survey15 strongly or somewh at agreed that COVID -19 improved their trust of healthcare professionals. On the other hand , 30.7% of the online 2021 Child Health Survey respondents14 and 41.9% of the phone survey respondents15 somewhat or strong ly disagreed that COVID -19 improved their trust of healthcare professionals. COVID -19 Prevalence in Youth Hamilton County has had the highest cumulative number of confirmed COVID -19 cases in youth across the PSA counties (15,180) .24 Dearbo rn County has had the fewest (1,531)25 (Figure 32).

When comparing March through October 2020 to the same period in 2019, CMS found that fewer vacc inations, childhood screenings, dental services, and mental health services were completed.30 A report from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) reinforces the trends highlighted by CMS data. Through a review of available data, KFF concluded that the COVID -19 pandemic resulted in missed, delayed, or skipped health care for children and youth. This includes primary, specialty, dental, and mental health services. While there were significant i ncreases in telemedicine services during the pandemic, barriers to accessing telemedicine services remain for some populations. Overall, data found that missed and delayed care was only partially offset by the increase in telemedicine services . Deficits present before the onset of the pandemic remain and, in some cases, have worsened.31 COVID -19 Pandemic Impact on Mental Health of Children and Youth A systematic review by Hasina Samji et al explored the impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic on mental health of children and youth globally. Their review concluded that during the COVID -19 pandemic, children and adolescents experienced a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms and an overall decline in general mental health compared to prevalence before the COVID -19 pandemic . Older children, adolescents, and females experienced higher prevalence of depression symptoms, stress, worry, and fear compared to younger children and males during the COVID -19 pandemic . Youth with chronic illness and those with behavioral health diagnoses (including autism, ADD/ADHD, obsessive - compulsive disorder, and others) experienced worse mental health outcomes during the pandemic compared to youth without these diagnosis.32 Cincinnati Children's Available Resou rces to Address the COVID -19 Pandemic Health Impact on Children and Youth Below is a list of resources available within Cincinnati Children's to address the COVID -19 Pandemic Health Impact on Children and Youth priority. This list was compiled from the CHNA Advisory Committee In March to October 2020, the following fewer services were completed when compared to March to October 2019: 1.8 million (~9%) fewer vaccinations for Medicaid beneficiaries aged 2 and younger 4.6 million (~21%) fewer child screenings 11.4 million (~39%) few er dental services 14 million (~34%) fewer mental health services Source: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services30 38 and other internal sources , including hospital website and intranet, etc. Specific strategies are available in the 2022 Implementation Strategy.

From July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021, there were 2,324 Emergency Depart ment (ED) visits related to these five diagnoses . Asthma was the most common, accounting for 73.1% of these ED visits (Table 22). Over the last four fiscal years, the number of ED visits related to asthma have decreased, while visits related to type 1 diabetes, epilepsy, IBD, and SCD have remained relatively unchanged (Table 22).

Hospital Admissions for Chronic Disease From July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021, Cincinnati Children's reported 1,275 admissions related to the five most common chronic diseases. Hospital admissions for epilepsy were the most comment, count ing for 38.8% of admissions . Asthma has the second hig hest admissions at 26.8% (Figure 33). 39 Figure 33. Hospital Admissions Related to Top Five Chronic Diseases, Fiscal Years 2018 - 2021 Source: Cincinnati Children's Hospital Data1 Asthma Asthma is the most common childhood chronic disease. National prevalence data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates 7.0% of youth (under 18 years) or 5.1 million youth had asthma in 2019. Young teens (12-14 years of age ) had the highest prevalence (10.8%). Nationally, prevalence of asthma is higher in lower -income populations. In 2019, 44.3% of youth with asthma reported having one or more asthma attacks in the preceding 12 month period.33 In 2018, 8.7% of children in Indiana had asthma, which is higher than the national ave rage of 8.3% , and the estimated prevalence in Ohio and Kentucky (Table 23).34 Table 23.

Type 1 Diabetes has, historically, been more likely to be diagnosed during childhood ; however, rates of type 2 diabetes are increasing in youth nationally. 2018 estimates from the CDC indicate 210,000 youth (under age 20 years ) across the USA had diagnosed diabetes (both type 1 and type 2). Of these youth, an estimated 89.0% ( 187,000) had - 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 1,400 1,600 1,800 2,000 FY2018 FY2019 FY2020 FY2021 Asthma Epilepsy Inflammatory Bowel Disease Sickle Cell Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Total 40 diagnosed type 1 diabetes .36 In a 2019 report, 3,074 Kentucky youth (under age 20 years ) on Medicaid had diabetes (0.50%).37 In 2018, Ohio Department of Health reported 0.30% of youth (age 0 -18 years ) on Medicaid had type 1 diabetes and 0.30% had type 2 diabetes .38 Epilepsy In 2015, an estimated 470,000 children had diagnosed (also called active) epilepsy in the United States , which is approximately 0.6% of children aged 0 -17 years. In 2015, Ohio had the highest prevalence of children with active epilepsy (16,900 children) across the PSA states (Table 2 5).39 Table 2 5.

IBD does not include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or celiac disease .40 Pediatric prevalence of IBD can be difficult to estimate as most individuals with IBD are diagnosed a s teens and young adults.41 An abstract by Yizhou Ye et al estimates in 2016 between 35,725 and 51,600 pediatric patients ha d IBD in the United States.42 Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) SCD is genetic red blood cell disorder inherited from both parents.43 According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), there are an estimated 100,000 cases in the African American population (0.6% of the African American population) nationally. An estimated one in every 300 to 500 African American children a re born with SCD. SCD is most common in individuals of African descent, but is also common in individuals of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Indian , Caribbean, and Central and South American descent.44 The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) estimates that SCD impacts 1 in 365 A frican Americans and 1 in 16,300 Hispanic /Latino Americans.45 Sickle cell trait (SCT) occurs when an individual inherits the sickle cell gene from one parent, not both.43 Approximately 9% of African Americans have SCT in the United States.44 Obes ity Prevalence of overweight or obese diagnosis among Cincinnati Children's Patients Even though obesity is not one of the most prevalent chronic diseases for ED visit s and inpatient admissions, obes ity prevalence among Cincinnati Children's patients has increased. Between April 2019 and April 2021, there was a 9% incr ease in the prevalence of Cincinnati Children's patients with an overweight or obese diagnosis (2019 : 36.4% to 2021 : 39.7%).1 In April 2021, 39.7% of Cincinnati Children's patients had a recorded diagnosis of overweight or obesity, which is slightly higher than then national and PSA state self -reported rates from the 2019 YRBSS.1, 23 Prevalence of overweight or obese diagnosis Nationally According to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2017 -2018, 19.3% of youth (age d 2-19 years ) were obese (Figure 34). This is a slight increase from the 2015 -2016 prevalence of 18.5%.46 41 Figure 34. National Prevalence of Obesity in Youth Age d 2-19 Years , 2017 -2018 Source: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2017 -201846 Data from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) showed a decrease in obesity prevalence from 2010 to 2018 in Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio for children aged 2-4 years who were enrolled in WIC.47 A 2017 survey of the body mass index ( BMI) among Ohio preschool students age d 3 to 5 years found 70.3% of children had healthy weights, 14.1% were overweight, and 11.6% were obese.48 Based on 2019 YBRSS data, 18.4% of Kentucky high school students were obese and 17.8% were overweight, both slightly higher than national averages (Figure 35).23 Figure 35.

However, reducing the Infant Mortality rate is a priority at the state and local level in the pediatric space. As a pediatric institution, continued work and investment in Infant Mortality is a priority health concern. Infant Mortality The Infant Mortality rate tracks the deaths of children before their first birthday. In 2018, the leading causes of infant deaths were birth defects, preterm birth and low birth weight, injuries, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and maternal pregnancy complications. Racial disparities in infant mortality rates exist at the national and local levels. Nationally, in 2018, the non -Hispanic /Latino black infant mortality rate was over double the non -Hispanic /Latino white rate (10.8 vs. 4.6 per 1,000 live births).49 The Infant Mortality rate in Indiana and Ohio are higher than the national rate (Figure 36).50, 51 Figure 36. Infant Mortali ty Rates per 1,000 Live Births, 2019 Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention50, 51 PSA state preterm birth rates and low birthweight rates are close to the national average s for these two measures ( 10.2% for preterm births and 8.3% for low birth weight ) (Figure 37).50, 51 6.5 5.07.0 5.6 0.02.04.06.08.0 Indiana Kentucky Ohio USA 43 Figure 37.

In 2020, 76 infants died in Hamilton County and the infant mortality rate was 7.4 deaths per 1,000 live births. This was a decrease from 2019. Across Hamil ton County, infant deaths related to preterm birth have decreased over the past decade. The number of birth defect -related deaths decreased from 2019 to 2020. However, the number of sleep -related deaths increased after five years (Figure 38).52 Figure 38. Leading Causes of Infant Death, Hamilton County, 2011 -2020 Source: Cradle Cincinnati52 In 2019, Butler County's Infant Mor tality Rate was 6.7 deaths per 1,000 live births, which is a decreas e from 8.4 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2018.53 In both Butler County and Hamilton County, the non - Hispanic /Latino Black infant mortality rate is over double than the non -Hispanic /Latino White 13 13 14 1521 01020304050607080 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020Number of infant deaths Preterm birth-related Birth defect-related Sleep-related 44 Table 26.

The eight priorities addressed in the 2019 Implementation Strategies are: Childhood Mental Health 2019 Implementation Strategy Initiatives Expand Integrated Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology: clinical psychologists to address both behavioral health promotion and treatment, co -locating them in Pediatric Primary Care, Fairfield, and Hopple Street Primary Care Clinics Pilot expansion of Integrated BMCP intervention services with two community practices Screening patients 10 years of age or older for depression at primary care clinics Integrate mental health services and interventions in school -based health clinics Enhance mental health services to patients by optimizing emergency room and outpatient access Provide telemedicine services to address mental health needs Support and scale a pilot of behavior intervention in 3 Cincinnati Public School elementary schools to support positive mental health Pilot evidence -based program for parents of children age 3 -6 in partnership with local Head Start and Public School preschools Expand Integrated Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology (BMCP): clinical psychologists to address both behavioral health promotion and treatment, co- locating them in Pediatric Primary Care, Fairfield, and Hopple Street Primary Care Clinics. Across Cincinnati Children's three General Pediatrics primary care clinics, BMCP has embedded six psychologists in the clinics, with two new psychologists schedu led to start in fall 2021. In calendar year 2016, there were 1,820 visits completed in these clinics. In calendar year 2021, BMCP is on pace to complete 5,000 visits, which is an increase of 175%.1 Pilot expansion of Integrated BMCP intervention services with two community practices. BMCP embedded behavioral health intervention services into five community practices, with one additional provider scheduled to start in 2021. The six community practices are: ESD Pediatrics, Anderson Primary Care, Children 's Health Care Batesville, Muddy Creek Pediatrics, Anderson Pediatrics, and Mason/Liberty /Springdale . BMCP expects to complete 2,000 visits at these locations in 2021.1 Child Safety and Unintentional Injury Childhood Mental Health Infant Mortality Childhood Obesity Early Literacy and School Readiness Barriers to Care Dental Childhood Asthma On pace to complete 5,000 visits in 20211 46 Screening patients 10 years of age or older for depression at primary care clinics. Screening for depression has been rolled out for all patients 12 and older across Cincinnati Children's General Pedi atric clinics and all participating Physician -Hospital Organization (PHO) practices. Screenings are being completed for 95.5% of all patients meeting the age criteria.1 The PHO, also called Tri -State Child Health Services Inc., comprises Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Ohio Valley Primary Care Associates (an independent practice association), contracted and employed specialist physicians and community -based specialist physicians. The organization includes committees that oversee contracting, credentialing and performance improvement activities. Integrate mental health services and interventions in school -based health clinics. Cincinnati Children's Division of Psychiatry partners with and provides services in over 50 schools in the PSA. In FY21, Cincinnati Children's completed 38,019 visits across these locations (Figure 39).1 Telehealth visits were implemented in FY20. Most of the services provided by the Division of Psychiatry are not integrated into a school -based health clinic, but are independent CCHMC staffed outpatient clinics, which expands the reach of this work into schools that do not have school -based health clinics. Figure 39. School -Based Therapy Visits FY18 to FY20 (in person and telemedicine) Source: Division of Psychiatry1 The Division of Psychiatry is part of a regional collaboration with MindPeace, which oversees the integration of sc hool-based mental health services in nearly every public school in Hamilton County, and some in Butler, Warren, and Clermont counties. MindPeace is a non -profit that started as a project of the Junior League of Cincinnati to answer a significant need for an improved system of mental health care for children in the Greater Cincinnati Area. MindPeace's mission is to ensure a seamless system of mental health care for children and adolescents that meets specific characteristics of quality, provides a continuu m of care has system connections and is affordable. 95.5% of patients 12 and older completed Depression Screenings1 47 MindPeace School Based Mental Health Network 2018 -2019 : 171 Schools have co -located mental health partnerships 2019 -2020 : 180 schools have co -located mental health partnerships 2020 -2021* : 190 schools have co -located mental health partnerships 2018 -2019 : 14 mental health organizations are lead school -based partners.

Over the past three years, there has been tremendous expansion of alternatives to inpatient care, including bridge appointments, intensive outpatient programing, and par tial hospital programming beds. The Bridge Clinic appointments provide access to a team of providers, including a psychiatrist, an advanced practice nurse, a psychologist and Psychiatric Intake Response Center (PIRC) Bridge staff. Working as a cohesive team, the Bridge Clinic provide s well-rounded care to each patient. Clinic staff help patients and families navigate the mental health system, get connected to ongoing services, and provide short -term interventions while long -term care is established. In 2020, 1,293 bridge appointments were completed (Figure 40).1 48 Figure 40. Monthly Completed Bridge Appointments, July 2018 - June 2021 Source: Division of Psychiatry1 In October 2020, the Division of Psychiatry expanded services at the Norwood location to include a n 18- bed partial hospitalization program (PHP), with 272 patients served from October 2020 thru August 2021. The PHP allows patients to receive intensive mental health care services and return home in the evening, avoiding an inpatient stay. New intensive outpatient prog ramming (IOP) for individuals and groups was also implemented at the Norwood location in March 2021. Between March and June 2021, 348 patients were seen through the Norwood IOP. The new Norwood PHP program is an expansion to the existing PHP programs at the Green Township location and the Linder Center of Hope. From July 2020 to June 2021, 381 patients participated in the PHP at Green Township and 246 at the Linder Center for Hope (Figure 41). From FY19 to FY21, there was a drop in the number of patients and PHP visits at both locations. Limiting factors related to the COVID pandemic are the primary reason behind this decrease.1 Figure 41. Patients and PHP Visits at Green Township and Linder Center for Hope FY2019 thru FY2021 Source: Division 2461,744 Visits Green Township Linder Center of Hope FY2019 FY2020 FY2021 49 Provide telemedicine services to address mental health needs. Due to the CO VID pandemic, there has been a rapid transformation to telemedicine across Cincinnati Children's. Within the Division of Psychiatry , at the peak of the pandemic, 90% of services were provided via telemedicine while maintaining normal clinic volumes (Figur e 42).1 As the department transitions into a new phase of the pandemic, telemedicine services will continue to be offered to patients. The ideal balance of in - person vs telemedicine appointments is under review . Figure 4 2. Division of Psychiatry Telehealth Appointments by Year Source: Division of Psychiatry1 *2021 data is from January through June 2021 Support and scale a pilot of behavior intervention in 3 Cincinnati Public School elementary schools to support positive mental health. The goal to support behavior intervention programs in three elementary schools was exceeded. The Good Behavior Game and the Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (PATHS) Program has been implemented in 10 Cincinnati Public Schools ( CPS) elementary sch ools. These programs target child emotional and behavioral regulation through instruction, classroom management, and peer support. Teachers at all 10 elementary schools were trained in both the Good Behavior Game and the PATHS Program. Implementation of the programs was coordinated with additional social and emotional learning (SEL) supports provided by CPS. Results from the data collection sites showed a 20% reduction in lost instructional time as a result of these programs.1 In addition to the partnerships with elementary schools, the Community Health All Children Thrive team and BMCP implemented SEL and prevention programs in eight CPS high schools. Pilot evidence -based program for parents of children age d 3-6 in partnership with local Head Start and Public School preschools. Cincinnati Children's partnered with Head Start, University of Cincinnat i, Hamilton County Educational Services Center (HCESC), and Hamilton County Community Action Agency (HCCAA) to pilot an intervention program for Head Start caregivers. In a small, randomized control trial, HeadStart Peer Navigators assisted preschool caregivers in understanding screening results shared by Head Start teachers. In this program, H eadStart Peer Navigators guided caregivers to complete visits with both their child's Education Agency and Primary Care Provider (PCP).

Through this pilot study, all caregivers in the intervention group received inform ation on screening results . The findings were limited by the fact that few teachers sent in rating forms to the child's PCP. Even still, HeadStart Peer Navigators were a valuable source for assisting caregivers in understanding and accepting screenings. Seventy -five percent (75%) of the PCPs in the pilot study made referrals for evaluation and treatment based on the referrals received from Head Sta rt.1 Additional Work completed related to the Child Mental Health Priority In addition to the above -mentioned strateg ies and activities, Cincinnati Children's also explored a number of additional programs and collaborations to support the mental health of children and families in the community. These activities include: Pilot tested student -level surveying of emotional and behavioral health in two elementary schools using the Panorama survey. In 2021 -2022, this will be expanded to include 27 elementary and high schools in the CPS system.1 Supported CPS in their expanded SEL services, which included providing coaching, quality improvement, and measuremen t guidance to 42 newly hired CPS social workers to promote healthy emotional and behavioral development in students.1 Provided Parents on Point , an evidence -based parent support program using the Chicago Parent Program Model, to 28 c ohorts comprised of 311 parents and caregivers of children aged 2 -5 in three elementary schools, three community -based early childhood organizations, and one church daycare. A total of 808 children (including older siblings) have been impacted. Evaluatio n at post -intervention and three months later revealed improved child behavior, increased positive parenting practices, and decreased use of corporal punishment.1 Adapt for Life instructs students grades K -12 lead healthy lives and become mentally fit. It helps young people understand and identify the drivers that can lead to stress, including harmful and suicidal behavior. Adapt for Life also provides all students with a persona l plan for crisis and other helpful tools to help themselves and others. Through approximately 70 schools in the Greater Cincinnati area, Adapt for Life has reached over 50,000 students over the past 3 years. As a leader in child health, Cincinnati Childr en's employed an emerging learning modality, ProjectECHO, to increase the capacity of pediatric primary care providers to identify and treat common childhood mental health disorders. The Center for Telehealth ProjectECHO Mental Health Series supported the operational components of the platform that utilizes Zoom technology to virtually create face -to-face interactions for Cincinnati Children's specialists and scores of primary care providers. The format allows specialists to provide brief, high yield, pra gmatic didactics of Evidence -based care algorithms with group discussion, followed by cases presented by the participants to elicit feedback and consultation from the community and specialists. Continuing education credits are offered for free, and partic ipants can select introductory courses on Depression or Anxiety, with the option to continue capacity building through the ongoing monthly Graduate Series sessions. The online format increases the geographic reach of the program and removes common obstacl es to learning 1 -day workshops and traveling to traditional lectures . It also provides provider discussion of their active patients for case based learning . Participation in the baseline 8 -session course increases PCP capacity to identify and manage common Mental Health disorders often under -diagnosed or treated in primary care. To approximate provider level measures of Mental Health Capacity, participant sel f-efficacy and clinical knowledge are measured throughout the course (Figure 43 and 44). After the first three cohorts from depression were completed, post-course feedback (32 of 37 responders (possible 41) reported a change in practice. The major themes of their responses included: treating more difficult depression cases than they had in the past, 808 children impacted through Parents on Point parent support group1 51 changing their initial medication choice to first line SSRI (fluoxetine), providing more frequent follow -up for their depressed patients, more use of validate d screening tools, such as PHQ -9 and CSSRS, and engaging more hands -on with therapists and psychiatrists.1 Figure 43. ProjectECHO Depression Cohort Pre and Post Program Self Efficacy Scores (Five -Point Scale) Source: Division of Psychiatry1 Figure 44. ProjectECHO Depression Cohort Pre and Post Program Knowledge Scores Source: Division of Psychiatry1 ProjectECHO courses have become a tele -mentoring model which effectively shares specialist knowledge as an extensio n through the primary care provider to increase access to care to the patient at the level of the medical home, versus the traditional telemedicine model (1 specialist to 1 patient). Across the Mental Health Series for ProjectECHO programs, an estimated 1 6,200 children have been impacted (Figure 45).1 322 433.5 0 1 2 3 4 Pre 56% Cohort 1 Cohort 2 Cohort 3Pre Post 52 Figure 45. Attendance and Impact of Project ECHO Source: Division of Psychiatry1 Health Vine, a network of pediatric providers and organizations backed by Cincinnati Children's, also partners with the Center for Telehealth and utilizes ProjectEcho within its network of providers. Since launching a ProjectEcho Therapist series in late 2021 , they have hosted two courses with 50 therapists .1 The courses consist of twice -monthly sessions over four months and focused on increasing provider knowledge and self -efficacy in managing mental and behavioral health conditions. In 2022, HealthVine plans to continue to partner with the Center for Telehealth on the launch of a trauma series in addition to their Therapist series. Between 2015 and 2020, Cincinnati Children's invested in significant improvements to the College Hill campus, resulting in an expansion of available mental and behavioral health services. As a result of this investment , the residential treatment program expanded to 30 beds and the inpatient program added 10 beds . There is improved space to patients with neurobehavioral issues - like sever e autism - to receive care, and a unit for patients needing care for both mental health and medical needs was added. COVID -19 Pandemic Impact Acceleration of the transition to telemedicine appointments was the largest impact of the COVID pandemic on these strategies. The COVID pandemic created multiple challenges to supporting the emotional and behavioral health of children in our community. Disruptions and major events resulting from the pandemic ( i.e., remote school, parental unemployment, family illness and death) contributed to increased stress and psychological maladjustment. Both The Good Behavior Game and the PATHS Program provided guidelines on incorporating their models into remote learning, and these strategies were adopted in the program. Although this pre served some of the benefits of the programs, opportunities for greater impact were lost due to the constraints of remote versus in -person education. Similarly, Parents on Point was offered remotely following a brief suspension of in -person sessions. The remote delivery format required smaller cohorts of parents and caregivers. After an initial stage of learning how best to deliver the groups remotely, implementation proceeded smoothly. The COVID pandemic also impacted recruitment for the pilot intervent ion with Head Start. However, the switch to virtual formats provided unexpected learnings, such as the Peer Navigators continuing to provide virtual navigation supports to caregivers during the height of the pandemic. At the start of the pandemic, several caregivers in the pilot were in the process of getting a healthcare or Local Education Agency identification of their child with developmental delay or disability. The Peer Navigators were able 53 to maintain navigation services in collabor ation with H eadStart and healthcare professionals even when schools closed and healthcare visits were only virtual, maximizing the outcomes for these students . Childhood Obesity 2019 Implementation Strategy Initiatives Implement nutrition and obesity prevention programs in targeted neighborhoods Work with community organizations and school districts to implement nutrition and obesity prevention programs Address food insecurity in primary care clinics through a partnership with the regional food bank that provides free formula and stocks a food pantry in two clinics Develop partnerships to improve physical activity Implement nutrition and obesity prevention programs in targeted neighborhoods. Partnering with Baby Bears in Norwood in 2021, the Center for Better Health and Nutrition (CBHN) provided nutrition and fitness education to Moms and children. CBHN distributed 180 meals, an assortment of breakfast, snack, and dinner packs, as part of their Fit Kit program.1 The Fit Kit program originated in partnership with the local school systems. Fit Kits include a variety of shelf -stable foods, recipes, a portioned plate, and a physical activity, such as a jump rope, popsicle stick exercise game, or a frisbee. Dinner kits feed four, and breakfast kits feed eight. Work with community organizations and school districts to implement nutrition and obesity prevention programs. During Spring of 2019, CBHN's Fit Kit program distributed 5,170 dinner meal kits with nutrition and physical activity information in selected CPS schools to every student.1 In addition to the meal and physical activity the kits included tips for healthy sleep, physical activity, and other healthy lifestyle topics. For the Spring of 2020, in response to the COVID pandemic, the program remained focused on providing healthy meals, physical activities, and education for healthy lifestyles to students. Partnering with CPS and Norwood schools, the program was expanded, and, instead of providing Fit Kits to every student, the partner school systems helped identify students and familie s with the greatest need. CBHN operates a pediatric weight management program at Roberts Academy and Norwood City Schools, reaching 127 patients and families in the 2019 -2020 school year. In 2021, 200 Meal Bags (equal ing 4,000 meals) containing fresh, shelf stable foods, as well as recipes, were distributed in a partnership with Roberts Academy.1 Partnering with Cooking for Family, CBHN funded family cooking classes for families through CPS schools in 2019 and the beginning of 2020. Due to COVID, this program is temporarily paused, but plans are in place to resume the program in the fu ture. In place of the in -person classes, the Dietitian team at CBHN shared recipes, cooking tips, and nutrition education via social media. From March 2020 through September 2021, the team shared 130 posts that included recipes, cooking tips, nutrition e ducation, and local food resources.1 180 meals distributed1 Number of Fit Kits distributed across CPS and Norwood City Schools in Spring 2020: 3,200 Breakfast Fit Kits 3,200 Snack Fit Kits 6,000 Dinner Fit Kits Source: Center for Better Health and Nutrition1 54 Address food insecurity in primary care clinics through a partnership with the regional foodbank that provides free formula and stocks a food pantry in two clinics. Cincinnati Children's Hopple, Pediatric Primary Care (PPC) , and Fairfield Primary Care clinics all contain onsite food pantries to address food insecurity in the community. PPC and Hopple pantries are in partnership with the Freestore Foodbank , and Fairfield's pantry is in partnership with Shared Harvest. Shelf stable food is available for patients and families during routine visits. Formula is available at the Pediatric Primary Care clinic. Since 2018, 2,711 cans of formula have been distributed and 3,058 families have received food (Table 27).1 Table 27.

CBHN promotes physical activity initiatives with patients and the community. Cincinnati Children's continues its partnership with the YMCA's Fun2Bfit program - a program designed to meet the needs of overweight children and their families. Ten YMCA programs participate in the program. The participating YMCA programs were intentionally selected to ensure the program is available throughout the PSA. The Fun2Bfit program is operated by the YMCA, and Cincinnati Children's staff support the training and availabi lity of equipment for the program, along with supporting recruitment and awareness of the class. Due to the COVID pandemic, this program is on a temporary pause. Once it is deemed safe by health leaders, the intension is to resume this program. HealthWo rks, a part of the CBHN, offers its patients and families in -person group exercise classes three nights each week for an hour each session. On average, about 10 -15 participants attended each class. This program has temporarily stopped due to the COVID pa ndemic. Once its deemed safe by hospital officials to resume this program, the weekly sessions will be reintroduced.1 Since the start of the COVID pandemic in 2020, the Healthworks team pivoted to provide virtual opportunities for patients and community members to engage in physical activity. Videos and virtual resources were posted to social media and Healthworks web site (https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/service/b/better -health/videos ). 55 The Division of Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy at Cincinnati Children's partners with a variety of partner organizations around the PSA to support both indoor and outdoor physical activity events, classes, and programs throughout the area through the \"be.well program.\" The primary audience for these programs are children with developmental and chronic conditions, along with medically complex children. In 2021, a variety of programs, including yoga, geocaching, martial arts, hiking, and biking, were offered through a mix of in person and virtual formats with a total of 445 participants (Figure 46). Figure 46. 2021 be.well Programs and Participation Source: be.well Program, Division of Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy1 Additional Work completed related to the Childhood O besity Priority None COVID -19 Pandemic Impact The COVID pandemic severely limited the number of events and programs CBHN could partner with, which impacted the implementation of efforts related to the Childhood Obesity strategies. In addition to adapting some of the programing to virtual options, the center partnered with school clinics and converted to a mobile clinic mod el at Norwood High School. They also transitioned to Saturday clinics in the community clinic area in order to reach patients and families with their weight management program.

Barriers to Care 2019 Implementation Strategy Initiatives Provide comprehensive primary care services through Cincinnati Children's primary care clinics and school -based health centers including access to legal aid, food pantries, preschool enrollment and community health workers Support a broad quality improvem ent initiative in Cincinnati Health Department's pediatric clinics Partner with community organizations to connect children and families to primary care services Collaborate with Cincinnati Children's physician network and community partners to connect a nd coordinate care Provide comprehensive primary care services through Cincinnati Children's primary care clinics and school -based health centers including access to legal aid, food pantries, preschool enrollment and community health workers. Preventive care bundles have been implemented in all primary care locations and school -based health centers to reliably deliver recommended screenings and services. Data tracking shows that greater than 90% of developmental, hearing/vision, and obesity screenings ar e completed during appointments . Connection to health -related services, such as legal aid, food pantries, and community health workers (CHW) have also expanded. Child HeLP (medical -legal partnership) generates over 750 referrals annually, food pantries a re available on site at three primary care clinics and serve over 2,000 children annually, and 1 2 CHWs are available for patient needs through various programming. In addition to these, the primary care offices were also able to expand lactation services, offer integrated behavioral health, and provide literacy supports for young children.1 Support a broad quality improvement initiative in Cincinnati Health Department's pediatric clinics. Cincinnati Children's Thrive at Five initiative has spread to five Cincinnati Health Department offices and one UC Health practice. Thrive at Five focuses attention on reliably delivering preventative care services through a quality improvement approach. Prior to COVID, a number of the clinics saw improvements in some of the collaborative measures (immunizations, lead, developmental screening). During the COVID - 19 pandemic, many metrics declined in performance due to missed well child visits. During the first half of 2021, clinics are beginning to see some upward trends for measures (Figure 47).1 Child HeLP 750 annual referralsFood Pantries Serve over 2,000 children annuallyCommunity Health Workers 12 Community Health Workers available to support families 57 Figure 47. Lead Screening and Vaccination Completion Rates for Cincinnati Children's and Cincinnati Health Department Clinics, 2019 - 2021 Source: All Children Thrive Learning Network, Cincinnati Children's1 In Spring 2020 and Fall 2021, Cincinnati Children's partnered with the Cincinnati Health Department to conduct seve n Lean Project Initiatives. The Lean Project Initiative provided project teams at the Cincinnati Health Department a multiple week course on quality improvement methods that uses hands - on exercises and 1-on-1 coaching to deepen each teams' ability to solve problems and improve operational performance. Table 28 provides a high-level overview of the seven projects completed and their outcomes. Table 28. Cincinnati Health Department Lean Projects and Results, Spring 2020 and Fall 2021 Lean Project Overview Lean Project Results Pharmacy Comprehensive Medication Review (CMR) Develop a workflow to enable pharmacists to complete medication reviews with patients. This service will bridge the 'access to healthcare' gap immediately by increasing patient knowledge about his/her medication and thereby increase adherence and outcomes. Comprehensive medication review is about getting patients on the right medication at the right dose at the right time. Through LEAN principles, team uncovered numerous system opportunities to release capacity to expand services. Better communication across the system; using huddles Tracked number of CMRs completed - between October to December 2021, 33 patients received a comprehensive medication revie w. Further refinement to the overall workflow will allow this program to become fully integrated into all clinics and patient care. Increased patient satisfaction - verbalizing better understanding of medications 58 Lean Project Overview Lean Project Results School Based Health Center (SBHC) - Cent ral Scheduling (CSU) Access to Care - Create a standardized scheduling process for SBHCs to deliver care to patients in the community - beyond the school. By eliminating waste and non -value added time the CHD will be able to improve reach and access to car e to students and community patients in need. Increased median number of patients seen daily from 6 to 10 Decreased non -value -added time by 23% (9:39 min down to 7:27 min) Eliminated 9 non -value added NP steps in scheduling process from 10 to 1 step Created a Standardized Process to Schedule Student Patient Scheduling (Job Instruction Sheet) Improved CSU process for scheduling community patients at SBHCs Increased appointment access for communi ty patients Environmental Health, Healthy Homes Program: Improving Mold Complaint Response Time The team focused on decreasing time to first contact following a complaint of mold from the community. Surpassed their goal of 2 days decreasing the time from 3.62 to 1.03 days Reduced process time to 62 minutes (72% reduction) Adopted daily team huddles to work through problems Improved staff satisfaction for the team of inspectors who respond to the mold complaints Enhancing the timeliness and effectiveness of the HUD grant program: The CHD has a grant to remediate homes that pose a threat for lead poisoning. The program was identified to have an opportunity to create standard work and improved efficiency. The team worked to reduce the amount of time it takes from receiving notice of a new property with suspected lead poisoning to submission of a work specifications report. The team worked to improve the efficiency of home remediation and create a standardized process. Created standardiz ed work increasing the process steps from 3 to 7 steps resulting in a fine-tuned process that allowed room for improving delays. Adopted a huddle and use of a visual management board providing opportunities to recognize and mitigate delays and barriers sooner Identified immediate areas of improvement with a reduction in the intake HUD application process Reduced the process and wait times by 42% Created a goal moving forward working to decrease the time from HUD grant application intake to complete the Wor k Specifications from 78 days to 33 days. Improve CHD Patient Registration Process To improve the patient registration workflow to deliver fast and efficient registration of multicultural, multi -lingual patients. The process improvement can help improve p atient experience and prevent personal information leaks. The Team surpassed the goal of decreasing the patient registration process from 29 minutes to 10 minutes achieving a 3 -minute registration process. Following Lean graduation, the CHD worked to implement an intentional spread plan with the process now adop ted system wide in all 6 health centers. Currently 5 of the 6 health centers median patient registration times are less than 5 minutes with three centers less than 3 minutes. 59 Lean Project Overview Lean Project Results Pharmacy Medication Delivery Program Develop a workflow to help patients who do not have reliable transportation receive medications. Inconsistent medication availability causes a decrease in medication adherence which put patients at greater risk for disease complications. The COVID -19 pandemic/stay at home orders posed significant challenges for patients. This medication delivery process should increase volume, revenue, patient adherence, and patient and staff satisfaction. Using LEAN principles, pharmacy process standardize d and optimized. 554 successful prescription deliveries from March 20, 2020 to May 1 ,2020 The amount of time it took for prescriptions to get to patients decreased by approximately 111 hours. Increase in patient medication adherence Better customer serv ice Health Insurance Enrollment To improve the process of preparing the patient for Health Insurance Enrollment. The team aimed to reduce the rate of duplication of patients that are uninsured from a baseline of 88%. The duplication leads to significant waste and non - value added steps addressing inaccurate information. The improvement in duplication will lead to financially empowered patients paying minimal co -pays, increased numbers of patients with established medical homes, and increased CHD productivity by working more efficiently on value added steps. Standardized the patient insurance enrollment process decreasing the number of steps from 6 to 5 Surpassed the goal decreasing the rate of duplication to 76% during the Lean class Since Lean graduation, the CHD implemented an intentional spread plan with the enrollment process adopted in all 6 health centers. The team has continued improvement with an initially post class reduction to 37% and a further reduction over the last 6 months down to 21%. The standardized process has resulted in improved accuracy of information gathered during patient enrollment. Source: James M. Anderson Center for Health Systems Excellence , Cincinnati Children's1 Partner with community organizations to connect children and families to primary care services . As active partners with the All Children Thrive Learning Network, the General Pediatrics primary care team engages with community organizations and members across many industries - including early childhood education, mental health, and social service agen cies - to connect children and families to primary care services in the community. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has an office location at the Pediatric Primary Care clinic location. General Pediatrics also has working relationships with social service and health agencies that support the continuum of care between patients and partner agencies, including Legal Aid Society of Greater Cincinnati, local food pantries, local housing and mental health agencie s, and the health department. Cincinnati Children's also partners with early childhood education and HeadStart programs to ensure children are connected with a primary care provider. Additionally, through our school -based health centers, students and community members are connected to and received pediatric primary care. More information about the activities an d initiatives supported by the All Children Thrive Learning Network can be found on their website ( https://www.actnowcincy.org ). Collaborate with Cincinnati Children's physician network and community partners to connect and coordinate care. The Comprehensive Primary Care team worked with managed care companies to enhance benefits for families around transportation, incentives, and awareness to provide needed services to patients. Work was also complet ed to enhance outreach strategies for patients who are due or overdue for care. Studies 60 were conducted to determine the optimal and efficient method to reach families and results are pending. Additionally, CHWs are being co -located in Urgent Care to supp ort the connection back to the medical home and to help with the closure of care gaps, as well as to support families in addressing social determinants of care. These services are also being expanded to include CHWs who can support connections back to Cin cinnati Health Department clinics, as well as a partner UC Health Clinic . Cincinnati Children's Physician Outreach & Engagement (PO&E) team connects and coordinates with community -based physicians in both the PSA and Secondary Service Area (SSA), which is comprised of 17 counties surround ing the PSA . PO&E partners with the Community Practice Advisory Council (CPAC) , a group of physician advisors that is comprised of both community and hospital -based physician leaders . PO&E and CPAC provide resources and monthly communications to community providers aimed at improving communication and the care coordination between Cincinnati Children's specialists and community providers. These initiatives include: COVID Information - Weekly emails are sent to over 1,000 community providers and staff to consolidate COVID information for pediatric providers and share update s from Cincinnati Children's. A COVID website was created specifically for community providers to reference as needed. Early in the pandemic, Cincinnati Children's was able to share surplus PPE with practices in the Physician Hospital Organization (PHO) who needed supplies but could not get them. Synapse - A monthly e -newsletter developed for primary care providers that contains updates, resources, and educational opportunities available to primary care providers through Cincinnati Children's. Approximately 1,500 providers and staff in the PSA and SSA receive Synapse monthly . Throughout the COVID -19 pandemic, virtual education opportunities have been provided for community providers. Topics were determined in collaboration with CPAC leaders for medical and surgical topics. Medical topics are presented via 'Coffee with Colleagues' and surgical topics are part of Globalcast Live events. Each presentation was aligned with a Community Practice Support Tool resource (CPST). Community Practice Support Tools (CPST) - CPST's cover a range of primary care topics to provide insight about illness/disease, first line treatment options, and clinical data about when to refer. They are updated annually and are housed in hard -cover binders for all PCPs in the PSA and SSA. Over 50 topics have been c reated in collaboration with Cincinnati Children's faculty , CPAC , and PHO. Approximately 1,500 CPST's are distributed annually . Mental Health Folder - In 2021, mental health specific resources were developed for distribution to community providers in the PSA and SSA. The folder include s resources available from Cincinnati Children's and resources available in the local community. Newborn Folders - Originally developed in 2018, the newborn f olders are designed to share information with new parents about their newborn. Practices can use the folder 'as is' or add In 202 1, Coffee with Colleagues : 441 attendees at live events 448 viewed the recording 13 medical topics and 4 surgical topics were presented In 2020, 12 medical topics and 5 surgical topics were presented during Coffee with Colleagues Source: Physician Outreach & Engagement Department1 61 elements to something they have created in their practice. Community providers continue to request newborn folders year each to share with their patients. Direct Messaging/E -Consult system - Launched in early 2021, the direct messaging/e -consult system is a secure, electronic pathway created to allow community p roviders to ask Cincinnati Children's faculty non -urgent clinical questions about their shared patients. Currently, 26 divisions from Cincinnati Children's participate in the program. Tracking has shown steady growth in system use with an average of 150 messages (questions) received per month. Additional Work completed related to the Barriers to Care Priority None COVID -19 Pandemic Impact The COVID -19 pandemic significantly impacted the work in primary care. Since families were encouraged to \"stay at home\" during parts of the pandemic, it was difficult to maintain high completion rates of preventative services initially. As a result of re duced in -person visits during the first two months of the pandemic, primary care services quickly implemented operational strategies to provide families telehealth services, quick and easy COVID -19 testing in the office, and most recently, COVID -19 vaccina tions for eligible patients and household members. Unfortunately, the pandemic has exacerbated health as well as economic disparities in Cincinnati and beyond and has compounded the social strain our population experiences. Patients being seen tend to be more complex, often due to delayed care, and have experienced increase social adversity. Cincinnati Children's continue to focus efforts on mitigating these disparities. Childhood Asthma 2019 Implementation Strategy Initia tives Identify and equitably care for children with asthma in primary care and school -based health centers Reduce disparities in asthma outcomes between local neighborhoods through hospital - and community -based clinics Partner with school districts to impr ove asthma control among children in partnership with school nurses and school -based health centers Test and scale other asthma interventions, such as telemedicine and home delivery of medications Broaden awareness and interventions beyond asthma to the ma ny health conditions with disparities in morbidity and admissions Identify and equitably care for children with asthma in primary care and school - based health centers. The asthma care coordinator for the primary care clinics and school -based health centers (SBHC) focus es on assuring those with persistent asthma have their medications. Asthma patients receive new prescriptions every three months. Each month, a list of all persistent asthma patien ts due for their three - month medication renewal is compiled for follow -up. Medication management for individuals with asthma is tracked as part of the clinic's participation in the Ohio Department of Medicaid's Comprehensive Primary Care Program that has a threshold of 28.9%. 62 Reduce disparities in asthma outcomes between local neighborhoods through hospital - and community -based clinics. Cincinnati Children's primary care clinics and SBHC screen for Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) at all visits. For asthma patients, the clinics also tested the use of a Bubble Diagram tool developed by the Cincinnati Children's Health Equity Network (HEN). The Bubble Diagram elevates the patient and caregiver voice in what matters to them related to the patient's asthma. Patients and caregivers are asked separately about a number of topics that can relate to or impact asthma, along with areas for patient/caregiver to provide additional concerns. The Bubble Diagram helps identify the needs important to families, which in turn builds better relationships. Any barriers raised will be addressed with the family, even if they are n ot related to asthma. Partner with school districts to improve asthma control among children in partnership with school nurses and school -based health centers. SBHC staff provide outreach to SBHC patients with chronic conditions prior to school breaks to assure the students had medications during school breaks. The primary focus of this outreach is SBHC patients with Asthma; however, this program has been expanded to other chronic diseases as resources have allowed as well. Cincinnati Children's primary care practices and SBHC have also historically partnered to track Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores. HEN is tracking improvement in ACT scores, with a goal of implementing consistent tracking between the primary care and SBHC locations moving forward (Fig ure 48). 75% Compliance Medication Management for individuals with Asthma Between April 2020 and March 2021, services were delivered to 34% of patients, with the target threshold greater or equal to 28.9%. Source: Cincinnati Children's Primary Care, SBHC & Outpatient Medical/Surgical Subspecialties1 63 Figure 48. Patients with an ACT Score in Last 13 Months, All Locations Source: Cincinnati Children's Primary Care, SBHC & Outpatient Medical/Surgical Subspecialties1 Test and scale other asthma interventions, such as telemedicine and home delivery of medications. To address identified barriers to asthma treatment and control, the primary care clinics and SBHC have piloted and implemented new interventions to improve asthma outcomes. As part of routine care, clinics now offer home delivery of asthma medications to pa tients and telemedicine appointments with a patient's medical provider, asthma care coordinator, and Community Health Worker (CHW). Additional information about these programs can be found in the FY2019 Community Benefit report (https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/about/community/community -benefit ). Broaden awareness and interventions beyond asthma to the many health conditions with disparities in morbidity and admissions. Currently the Bubble Diagram is only being used in General Pediatrics within subgroups of the overall asthma population. Each clinic has been testing the tool in different asthma sub-population s. The primary care clinics and SBHC are in the e arly planning stages to spread use of the HEN Bubble Diagram to the larger asthma population seen at all clinics. The goal is to implement this tool across all patient visits if there is a concern about disparities. Ideally, any parent can say \"these are my concerns for my child.\" Expanding the use of the Bubble Diagram will open dialogue between patients, parents, and providers. Additionally, the pharmacy delivery program is available to any patient. The primary audience for this program is still ast hma, but the program has expanded to include additional chronic disease, and it is also utilized by providers at the SBHC. Additional Work completed related to the Childhood Asthma Priority Through a grant with the Ohio Department of Health, General Pediatrics is focusing on disparities and children with asthma by partnering with CHW s. Leveraging last 13 months Most recent score in last 13 months well controlled 64 connecting with patients and families directly to assess homes , allergens, barriers to care, and other concerns raised by the family . COVID -19 Pandemic Impact The greatest impact of the COVID pandemic was connecting with patients. Most patients were not coming into the clinics for visits and were extremely hesita nt to utilize telehealth visits for asthma . Offering telehealth visits is new for this work and was successfully used for patients with milder asthma exacerbations. Outreach programs to patients in need of medication refills continued throughout the pandemic with a fair amount of success. Finally, because of the reduced on -site capacities for COVID and increased need to operate and connect remotely with families, it was very difficult to get families involved with the CHW and telehealth visits to assess for in -home asthma triggers. Child Safety an d Unintentional Injury 2019 Implementation Strategy Initiatives Implement safety outreach in high -risk neighborhoods Provide car seat education and installation support Train community organizations to promote safety and unintentional injury programs and resources Provide training and support for community organizations around trauma -informed care Implement safety outreach in high -risk neighborhoods.

The learning collaborative brings together partners from multiple sectors in Hamilton County, including hospitals, community health centers, home h ealth agencies, and social service organizations. The primary focus of the network is to reduce preterm births and address racial disparities in birth outcomes. Partner with community organizations to address infant mortality. In response to an increase in infant sleep -related deaths in 2020, Cradle Cincinnati and Hamilton County Department of Job & Family Services partnered to spread awareness about the preventability of sleep - related deaths. Under the leadership of two local moms, over 24 partner organ izations designed and developed a widespread advertising and community engagement campaign to raise awareness of the ABCs of Safe Sleep. The campaign launched in Spring 2021. All local health systems have adopted this campaign, and the Ohio Department of Health launched the campaign statewide in October 2021.54 In 2020, the Cradle Cincinnati Learning Collaborative hosted 5 virtual collaborative meetings for 100 prenatal care providers, developed COVID -19 educational materials for families, and provided care to over 4,500 women.

As a neighborhood - based approach, Cradle Cincinnati Connections links vital services that fill in systems gaps, such as housing assistance, depression screenings, breastfeeding support and access to infant essentials ( i.e., cribs and diapers). Cradle Cincinnati Connections covers 12 zip codes, which includ es approximately 20 Cincinnati neighborhoods. In 2020, the team hosted two drive - thru baby showers in Bond Hill and Price Hill, that included training and free baby essentials, including cribs, food, and diaper bags full of baby supplies.54 Develop strategies to incorporate an equity -based focus on infant mortality redu ction. Queens Village is an active social -support community of Black women, with a focus on providing safe, supportive spaces for mothers to connect with peers, relieve stress, process trauma, and work collectively to build a better world for themselves an d their families. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, Queens Village launched a number of virtual outreach platforms to continue reaching and supporting Black women and mothers . In 2020, Cincinnati Children's, The Urban League, and Queens V illage partnered on a medical field workforce training program. Ten Black women completed the program, and nine secured jobs in the medical field.54 Additional Work completed related to the Infant Mortality Priority None COVID -19 Pandemic Impact In response to the changing environment and mental impact of the COVID pandemic on mothers, Cradle Cincinnati Connections team focused more on mental wellbeing of mothers, hosting support groups and In 2020, Queens Village Hosted 96 Virtual Events: 50 episodes of Alone Together Facebook Live series 1,000 The Kitchen Table Facebook page members 1 The Queens Demands video to encouraged voting Hosted In Her Voice virtual workshop for teen girls Over 200 Black women received care packages as part of a Social Media Campaign to celebrate Black Women for the Win campaign Source: Cradle Cincinnati, 2020 Annual Report54 95% of the women served in this program in 2020 had health insurance, 80% are part of medical homes - which reduced ER visits, and 90% of their children attended well -child visits. Overall, the program reached 645 women in 2020. Source: Cradle Cincinnati, 2020 Annual Report54 68 Facebook Live discussions. Traditional home visits trans itioned from in -person to virtual visits, telephone calls, support via text message, and porch drop -offs. Several programs and educational opportunities were pivoted to virtual platforms. In addition to the programs mentioned in the above section, the an nual Infant Mortality summit switched to a virtual platform, reaching more than 2,000 attendees.54 Early Literacy/School Readiness 2019 Implementation Strategy Initiatives Support the public -school district to improve early literacy and third grade reading by offering quality improvement and data analytic support Lead a city-wide effort to distribute books through pediatric clinics via 2 national programs: Reach Out and Read and Imagination Library Pilot a community -based network of parents and caregivers to promote early literacy Support the public -school district to improve early literacy and third grade reading by offering quality improvement and data analytic support. General Pediatrics works with patients at their clinics to help discuss the importance of early childhood educa tion, help the family identify a program that fits their needs, and provide support and assist the family with the - at times - difficult and lengthy enrollment process. By assisting families to enroll in high quality early childhood education and prescho ol, children are more likely to be ready to learn when they enter kindergarten. Additionally, screenings and talking with parents about a child's development helps identify developmental concerns. Staff connect children with developmental concerns to ear ly intervention programs that serve children birth -age 5. From January to mid -August 2021, 190 children were served by the Early Childhood Education Navigator in clinics (Figure 49).1 Figure 49. Children Served by Early Childhood Education Navigator located in Primary Care Clinics Source: Department of General Pediatrics1 *Data from January to mid -August 2021 Lead a city -wide effort to distribute books through pediatric clinics via 2 national programs: Reach Out and Read and Imagination Library. Cincinnati Children's successfully implemented the Reach Out and Read program and registered children for Imagination Library through 27 pediatric practices throughout the city. In the last ye ar, enrollment in the Imagination Library increased from 12,000 children to 24,000 children enrolled with the implementation of the Ohio Governor's Imagination Library (OGIL) Program, which allows enrollment online. As of July 2021, there are 24,465 child ren enrolled in Imagination Library.1 Cincinnati Children's 494 418 190 0100200300400500600 2019 2020 2021* 69 has partnered with multiple organizations that serve children to increase enrollment in OGIL, including WIC, The Cincinnati Hamilton County Public Library, and Santa Maria Community Services. To increase awareness of OGIL across the hospital and community , the Reach Out and Read team has also presented workshops on early literacy to different parent groups and hospitals. Enrollment of children in OGIL continues and is expanding to include enrollment through the birthing hospitals in Hamilton County . Pilot a community -based network of parents and caregivers to promote early literacy. In 2020, General Pediatrics worked with low -income parents and parents of color in the community to better understand the barriers they face when trying to enroll children in early childhood education programs including preschool. Twenty in dept h interviews with parents and four focus groups with community programs to understand barriers were completed. Additionally, the team worked with Design Impact to host \"Creative Sessions\" or very in -depth work groups/focus groups with parents and communit y programs to further understand these barriers and then have the team members co -create solutions. Using quality improvement, the co -created solutions were tested with community partner agencies including CPS, HCCAA Head Start and HCESC Head Start. Thes e pilot tests showed success improving application completion for CPS, HCCAA Head Start and HCESC Head Start (Figures 50, 51, 52) and enrollment rates. HCCAA Head Start saw the highest increase, with the percentage of request for services that resulted in a completed application rising from 30% to 70%. Currently, the team is working on implementing two of the top solutions voted on by the community.1 Figure 50.

All learnings on how to improve the enrollment process are shared with all partner programs. Work to streamline and improve Cincinnati Children's refer ral process connecting patients with high quality early childhood education programs is ongoing . 71 COVID -19 Pandemic Impact The COVID pandemic slowed OGIL enrollment in clinics tremendously, due to the transition to telehealth visits. In order to reach parents, the Reach Out and Read team committed to engaging in outreach with different parent groups via Zoom meetings. They also held virtual story times w ith The Cincinnati Hamilton County Public Library and invited parents to attend. Finally, the team also worked with the media to increase enrollment and outreach through PSA's, radio interviews, articles, and podcasts. This multi -factor approach helped to increase enrollment in OGIL during the COVID pandemic. When looking at General Pediatrics efforts to increase enrollment in early childhood education programs, it was more difficult to reach families as staff was not in clinic and not as many families came into clinic. The biggest impact was/is that families were/are still not comfortable sending their children to an in - person preschool program because of the fe ars surrounding COVID -19. Many programs offered virtual options last year, but this is a difficult platform for young children under 5 and does not have the same impact as in -person, high quality early childhood education with a qualified teacher. Genera l Pediatrics is continuing to find the program that works best for the individual family's wants and needs. Currently this is virtual for some families and in person for others. Many community programs are under -enrolled, so the team is trying to connect families with these high-quality programs and encourage the importance of high-quality early childhood education. Dental 2019 Implementation Strategy Initiatives Partner with community organizations and school districts to address child dental needs Partner with community organizations and school districts to address child dental needs. Cincinnati Children's Dental team partners with the CHECK clinic (Foster care) on weekly basis to provide dental screenings and identify high risk children requiring i mmediate dental/surgical intervention. In the past year, the team has seen approximately 320 patients in 40 clinics annually, which is double the number of clinics completed annually in 2019.1 The Division of Dentistry also partners with local community dental programs, including Lincoln Heights, SeeMoreSmil es, and Klermont 4 Kids, to provide access to Direct to OR referrals (DtOR) for high -risk, high acuity surgical intervention. A collaboration is also in the works with CincySmiles to address the most acute patients in a timeframe to reduce morbidity and E D visits. Through these partnerships, additional children have been identified and connected to the care they need. An average of 37 patients per month are scheduled for the OR through DtORs.1 Additional Work completed related to the Dental Priority None COVID -19 Pandemic Impact The primary impact of the COVID pandemic is related to availability of operating room block time. During the first phase of the pandemic, reductions in in -person capacity reduced the availability of OR block times and the number of children that could be scheduled, which also impacted the prioritization of referred cases. DtORs currently make up about 20% all Dental OR cases.1 72 Appendix B: Com munity Health Needs Assessment Advisory Committee The CHNA Advisory Committee provided expertise, leadership, and guidance throughout the CHNA process.

Physical Activity Physical Activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Youth that participate in regular physical activity can improve cognitive functions, academic performance, and mental health and increase the likelihood of a healthier adulthood. Physical Act ivity Guidelines for Americans recommends children and youth age d 6 to 17 years engage in 60 minutes or more of moderate -to-vigorous physical activity daily.62 According to YRBSS data from 2019, 17% of high school students in the USA did not engage in at least 60 minutes of physical activity during a seven -day period. This is an increase from 15.4% in 2017. More high school students in Kentucky and Ohio do not engage in at least 60 minutes of physical activity in a seven day period compared to the national average (Table 35).23 Table 35.

Lack of park access is associated with lower levels of physical activity, increased screen time, inadequate sleep, and higher likelihood of being overweight or obesity in youth.63 Across Cincinnati Children's PSA, there is a wide range of access to parks. Data from the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network shows that 69% of Hamilton County's population live within half a mile of park, compared t o 8% of residents in Dearborn County (Figure 58).35 Figure 58.
