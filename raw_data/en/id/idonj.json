They are recognized as dangerous yet sacred precincts of crisis and opportunity in all ancient cultures. Humanity is at such a choice point now, a defining moment in our evolution as a species in relationship to all beings as well as the planet itself. Although there are no certainties at these crisis points, ancient teachings assure us that there are possibilities. Practice at the Crossroads: Acupuncture, Alchemy, Spirituality and Healing is an invitation to explore some of the crucial choices facing us now. It is also a laboratory where we will begin to cultivate an attitude and develop practical skills that support the emergence of new possibilities in our patients' lives and in our practices. - What would change in your practice if you had the support of a community to remind you regularly to take seriously the words of the Neijing Suwen, to open the eyes of your heart daily to the light of your Self, your patients, and the natural world? - What does healing look like when we take the risk to move beyond dualism, to courageously stand for a reality outside the numbing barrage of media chatter and our own resistance to the unknown? - How can you more effectively address the pandemic of trauma, fear, isolation, dislocation, and emotional instability that is underlying many of the symptoms your patients bring to the treatment room? - What are the tools and skills available to us from the past as well as those yet waiting for our discovery that can help us transform the lead of illness and suffering into the gold of wisdom, compassion, true health, and well-being. And how would your life and work change if you felt support to lean back into your Tao in service to the cultivation of your own inner work, resiliency, and integrity?
