But after the incident, social media posts falsely claimed he had recently been vaccinated for COVID-19 and suggested that led to his collapse. Team officials said he has not been vaccinated. Full Story Danish soccer player Christian Eriksen was waiting to receive a throw-in during the first half of his team's opening Euro 2020 match on June 12 in Copenhagen when he [suddenly collapsed](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/12/sports/soccer/denmark-christian-eriksen-collapse.html), suffering cardiac arrest. He received medical treatment on the field and was awake when he left. He since has undergone an operation and [has been released](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/18/football/christian-eriksen-denmark-discharged-hospital-spt-intl/index.html). But soon after he collapsed during the match, erroneous speculation emerged on social media appearing to link a COVID-19 vaccination to the incident. A [since-deleted tweet](https://www.facebook.com/groups/137204671811144/permalink/138685944996350/) falsely claimed Eriksen received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on May 31. \"Inter Milan Chief Medic and Cardiologist confirmed that he received the Pfizer vaccine 12 days ago,\" read one tweet attributing the quote to Radio Sportiva. The claim has been reposted on But Inter Milan's director, Giuseppe Marotta, denied the claims and said Eriksen, who also plays for the Italian club, had no previous signs of health issues. \"He didn't have COVID and wasn't vaccinated either,\" [Marotta reportedly told Rai Sport](https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/eriksens-former-cardiologist-says-he-had-no-history-heart-concerns-2021-06-13/). Radio Sportiva also [disputed the social media claims](https://twitter.com/RadioSportiva/status/1404073305158606853), saying on Twitter that the radio station never interviewed any Inter Milan officials about Eriksen's condition. Denmark's match against Finland was nearing the half when Eriksen fell to the ground. The match was suspended after a lengthy delay as medical staff [performed CPR](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/15/football/christian-eriksen-post-cardiac-arrest-message-spt-intl/index.html) and used a defibrillator to resuscitate him. He was taken to a hospital and was later reported to be in stable condition. The Danish Football Union said in a [tweet on June 17](https://twitter.com/DBUfodbold/status/1405431822020972546?s=20) that Eriksen would receive an implantable cardioverter defibrillator \u2014 a heart starter. The device is necessary after a \"cardiac attack due to rhythm disturbances,\" according to the sports organization. Eriksen was [discharged](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/18/football/christian-eriksen-denmark-discharged-hospital-spt-intl/index.html) from the hospital on June 18 after a \"successful operation,\" the sports organization told CNN. The speculation surrounding Eriksen's vaccination status came as health officials investigate elevated cases of heart inflammation \u2014 [particularly in young men](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/evidence-grows-stronger-covid-vaccine-link-heart-issue-cdc-says-n1270339) \u2014 following their second dose of an mRNA vaccine.

The decision to vaccinate is still a safer choice, he said. [Dr. E Kevin Hall](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/kevin_hall/), an assistant professor of pediatrics at the Yale School of Medicine, said the patients his institution has seen with suspected post-vaccination myocarditis have done well and have been discharged. \"The cases of possible myocarditis as a result of the COVID vaccines appears to be very rare,\" Hall told us in an email. \"We believe the risks of COVID far outweigh the risks of the possible vaccine side effect.\" The [CDC recommends ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html)COVID-19 vaccines for any person over age 12.
