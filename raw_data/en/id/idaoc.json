If this is your first time with breathing exercises, Dias recommends going slowly throughout the routine and not to worry about breathing too deeply. It's also possible that you'll notice coldness in your hands or feet during this\u2014and that's completely normal.

(Don't worry, Dias will count for you, so all you have to do is focus on your breath.)
