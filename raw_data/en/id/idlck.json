It gives definitions of terms and explains the rules you will need to follow to get the medical treatments, services, and other medical care that are covered by the plan. For the deta ils on what medical care and prescription drugs are covered by our plan and how much you pay when you get these service s, use the benefits information in the next chapter, Chapter 4 Covered services ). Section 1.1 \"Network provider s\" and \"covered services\" Here are some definitions that can help you understand how you get the care and services that are covered for you as a member of our plan: \"Provider s\" are doctors and other health care professionals licensed by the state to provide medical services and ca re. The term \" provider s\" also includes hospitals and other health care facilities. \"Network provider s\" are the doctors and other health care professionals, medical groups, hospitals, and other health care facilities that have an agreement with us to accep t our payment and your cost -sharing amount as payment in full. We have arranged for these provider s to deliver covered services to Members in our plan. The provider s in our network generally bill us directly for care they give you. When you see a network provider , you usually pay only your share of the cost for their services. \"Covered services \" include all the medical care, health care services, medications, supplies, and equipment that are covered by our plan. Your covered services for medical care are listed in Chapter 4 . Section 1.2 Basic rules for getting your medical care covered NHPRI Exchange Health Plan will generally cover your medical care as long as: The care you receive is included in the plan's Medical Benefits (reference Chapter 4 of this booklet). The care you receive is considered medically necessary . 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 18 | P a g e You have a network Primary Care Provider (a PCP) who is providing and overseeing your care. As a member of our plan, you must choose a network PCP (for more information about this, see Section 2.1 in this chapter ). o In most situations, your network PCP must give you approval in advance before you can use other provider s in the plan's network, such as specialists, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, or home heal th care agencies. This is called giving you a \"referral.\" For more information about this, see Section 2.3 of this chapter. o Referrals from your PCP are not required for emergency care or urgently needed care. There are also some other kinds of care you can get without having approval in advance from your PCP (for more information about this, see Section 2.2 of this chapter). You must receive your care from a network provider (for more information about this, see Section 2 in this chapter). In most cases, care you receive from an out -of-network provider (a provider who is not part of our plan's network) will not be covered. Here are two exceptions: o The plan covers emergency care or urgently needed care that you get from an out-of-network provider . For more information about this, and to see what emergency or urgently needed care means, see Section 3 in this chapter. o If you need medical care our plan is required to cover and the provider s in our network cannot provide this ca re, you can get this care from an out-of-network provider . An authorization must be obtained from Neighborhood prior to seeking care. In this situation, you will pay the same as you would pay if you got the care from a network provider . For information abo ut getting approval to see an out-of- network doctor, see Section 2.4 in this chapter . Section 1.3 Preauthorization Preauthorization is required for certain covered services . Services that require preauthorization are marked with an asterisk (*) in the Summary of Medical Benefits. If a preauthorization is required, Neighborhood will make a decision as expeditiously as your health condition might require, but no later than fifteen (15 ) calendar days from the receipt of the request. This timeframe may be extended by fifteen (15 ) calendar days if you request it or NHRPI determines there is a need for additional information and documents (for example medical evidence) and the delay is in your best interest. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 19 | P a g e Your network provider is responsible for o btaining preauthorization for in -network covered services . You must request approval from Neighborhood prior to schedulin g an appointment or receiving covered services from non-network provider s, by calling Member Services at 1- 866-423-0945 . Neighborhood 's Medical Management Department will review your request for services. Fast (expedited) Preauthorization Review You may request an fast preauthorization review.

Neighborhood will make a decision as expeditiously as your health condition might require, but no later than 72 hours after receipt of the request. This timeframe may be extended b y fifteen (15 ) calendar days if you request it or NHRPI determines there is a need for additional information and documents (for example medical evidence) and the delay is in your best interest.

SECTION 2 Use provider s in the plan's network to get your medical care Section 2.1 You choose a Primary Care Provider (PCP) to provide and oversee your medical care What is a \" PCP\" and what does the PCP do for you?

Please call Neighborhood Member Services at 855-321-XCHG (855 - 321-9244) if your provider decides to leave our network and you need to continue to seeing him or he r for a while. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 25 | P a g e Section 2.4 Getting care from out -of-network provider s You might need health care services when you are \"out of area\".

Covered services provided by non -Neighborhood Plan provider s are not paid for unless approved by Neighborhood before you make the appointment or receive the service. Contact Member Services. Our Medical Management team will review your request. SECTION 3 Getting covered services when you have an emergency or urgent need for care Section 3.1 Getting care if you have a medical emergency What is a \"medical emergency \" and what should you do if you have one? An \" emergen cy medical condition \" means a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) so that a prudent layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attent ion to result in a condition: Placing the health of the individual, or with respect to a pregnant woman her unbor n child in serious jeopardy; Constituting a serious impairm ent to bodily functions; or Constituting a serious dys function of any bodily organ or part . The medical symptoms may be an illness, injury, severe pain, or a medical condition that is quickly getting worse . Examples of some types of emergencies are: Broken bones Poisoning or swallowing a dangerous substance 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 27 | P a g e Drug overdose Very bad pain or pressure Bleeding that will not stop Severe trouble breathing Change in level of consciousness Bad head injury Seizures (or a change in pattern of seizures) Complications of pregnancy such as persistent bleeding or severe pain Thoughts of Suicide If you have a medical emergency : Get help as quickly as possible. Call 911 for help or go to the nearest emergency room or hospital. Call for an ambulance if you need it. You do not need to get approval or a referral first from you r PCP. The hospital does not need to be part of Neighborhood 's network. You may need to receive services in the hospital once your emergency condition has been taken care of. These are call post stabilization services or care and services given to you to m ake sure another emergency does not happened. Your doctor will make sure you receive the care you need so that you can safely return home. Call your PCP within 48 hours to tell him/ her about your emergency visit. As soon as possible, make sure that our plan has been told about your emergency . We need to follow up on your emergency care. You or someone else should call to tell us about your emergency care, usually within 48 hours. Call our Member Services Department at 855-321-XCHG (855 -321-9244) . What is covered if you have a medical emergency ? You may get covered emergency medical care whenever you need it, anywhere in the United States and territories . Our plan covers ambulance services in situations where getting to the emergency room in any other way could endanger your health. For more information, see the Medical Benefits description in Chapter 4 of this booklet. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 28 | P a g e If you have an emergency , we will talk with the doctors who are giving you emergency care to help m anage and follow up on your care. The doctors who are giving you emergency care will decide when your condition is stable and the medical emergency is over. After the emergency is over you are entitled to follow -up care to be sure your condition continues to be stable. Your follow -up care will be covered by our plan. If your emergency care is provided by out-of-network provider s, we will try to arrange for network provider s to take over your care as soon as your medical condit ion and the circumstances allow . We may not cover continued out of -network services after the emergency condition is treated and stabilized. This may happen if we dete rmine, in coordination with the member 's provider s, that the member is safe for transport back into the Service Area and that transport is appropr iate and cost -effective . What if it wasn't a medical emergency ? Sometimes it can be hard to know if you have a medical emergency . For example, you mi ght go in for emergency care - thinking that your health is in serious danger - and the doctor may say that it wasn't a medical emergency after all. If it turns out that it was not an emergency , as long as you reasonably thought your health was in serious danger, we will cover your care. However, after the doctor has said that it was not an emergency , we will cover additional care only if you get the additional care in one of these two ways: You go to a network provider to get the additional care , or The additional care you get is considered \"urgently needed care\" and you follow the rules for getting this urgent care (for more information about this, see Section 3.2 below). Section 3.2 Getting care when you have an urgent need for care What is \"urgently ne eded care\"? \"Urgently needed care\" is a non -emergency , unforeseen medical illness, injury, or condition, that requires immediate medical care . Urgently needed care may be furnished by in -network provider s or by out-of-network provider s when network provide rs are temporarily unavailable or inaccessible. The unforeseen condition could, for example, be an unforeseen flare -up of a known condition that you have. What if you are in the plan's service area when you have an urgent need for care? 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 29 | P a g e In most situations, if you are in the plan's service area, we will cover urgently needed care only if you get this care from a network provider and follow the other rules described earlier in this chapter. However, if the circumstances are unusual or extra ordinary, and network provider s are temporarily unavailable or inaccessible, we will cover urgently needed care that you get from an out-of-network provider . If you or your child needs urgent care, call your primary care doctor's office. Say you need to schedule a \"sick visit.\" Your doctor should give you an appointment within 24 hours , or, he or she will direct you to an urgent care center in Neighborhood 's network. Urgent care sites are helpful when you have a problem that needs to be seen that day but yo ur doctor's office cannot give you an appointment. Here are some examples of problems that need urgent care: A sore throat Skin rash Pink eye Low grade fever Ear infection Mild or moderate trouble breathing Runny nose Coughing Persistent diarrhea For more information about urgent care centers in your community, search the Neighborhood Provider Directory online at www.nhpri.org or call Neighborhood Member Services at 855-321-XCHG (855 -321-9244) What if you are outside the plan's service area when you have an urgent need for care? When you are outside the service area and cannot get care from a network provider , our plan will cover urgently needed care that you get from any provider . If this happens, we recommend that y ou or someone acting for you contact your PCP. You need to do this to arrange for any necessary follow -up care. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 30 | P a g e We may not cover continued services after the Urgent condition is treated and stabilized. This may happen if we determine, in coordination with the member 's provider s, that: (1) the member is safe for transport back into the Service Area; and: (2) that transport is appropriate and cost -effective Our plan does not cover urgently needed care or any other care if you receive the care outside of the United States. SECTION 4 If you are billed directly for the full cost of your covered services Section 4.1 You can ask us to pay our share of the cost of covered services If a doctor or hospital sends you a bill or if you paid for covered services , Neighb orhood will help you resolve the issue. Neighborhood will pay you back when appropriate. To better help you, please make sure you let Neighborhood know as soon as you receive any bil l. You can send the receipts to: Member Services Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island 299 Promenade Street Providence , RI 02908 This includes emergency services received out -of-area.

It includes a list of covered services as a member of NHPRI Exchange Health Plan . Later in this chapter, you can find information about medical services that are not covered. It also explains limits on certain services. Section 1.1 Types of out -of-pocket costs you may pay for your covered services To understand the payment information we give you in this chapter, you need to know about the types of out-of-pocket costs you may pay for your covered ser vices . The \"deductible \" is the amount you must pay for medical services before our plan begins to pay its share. A \"copayment\" is the fixed amount you pay each time you receive certain medical services. You pay a copayment at the time you get the medical service. \"Coinsurance\" is the percentage you pay of the total cost of certain medical services. You pay a coinsurance at the tim e you get the medical service. Section 1.2 Your yearly plan deductible An individual deductible of [$260-$3,250] per member p er contract year applies to each member for covered services received (Medical $250 -$3,000 and Pharmacy $10 -$250) A family deductible of [$520-$6,500] per family per contract year applies for all enrolled Members of a family for covered services received (Medical $500 -$6,000 and Pharmacy $20 - $500) Your deductible is the amount you have to pay out-of-pocket before we will pay our share for your covered medical services. Until you have paid the deductible amount, you must pay the full cost of your covered services . Once you have paid your deductible , we will begin to pay our share of the costs for covered medical services and you will pay your share , including your copayment or coinsurance amount , for the rest of the calendar year. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 4: Covered health care services 34 | P a g e All amounts any enrolled Members in a family pay toward their individual deductible s are applied toward the family deductible . Once the family deductible has been met during a contract year , all enrolled Members in a family will thereafter have satisfied their individual deductible s for the remainder of that contract year . Please note that any amount paid by the member for a covered service rendered during the last 3 months of a contract year will be carried forward to the next contract year 's deductible . The deductible does not apply to some services. This means that we will pay our share of the costs for these services even if you have not paid your yearly deductible yet. The deductible does not apply to the following services: Mental Health services in a provider 's offic e or in your home Chemical dependency treatment in a provider 's office or in your home Outpatient cardiac rehabilitation Chiropractic medicine Diabetic podiatric office visits Diabetic vision care services Diagnostic hearing tests Early intervention services Emergency room services Hemophilia services in a doctor's office House calls Allergist and dermatologist visits Asthma education visits Diabetes education Hospital based clinic visits Nutritional counseling Office visits Specialist visits Pediatric office visits Urgent care visits Podiatrist services Prevention and early detection services Adult immunizations Pediatric immunizations Smoking cessation counseling Surgery in a doctor's office Vision care services Section 1.3 The most you will pay for covered medical services Out-of-Pocket Maximum (Individual) This Certificate of Coverage has an individual out-of-pocket maximum of [$ 850-$6,000] per member per contract year for all covered services . Only copayments, deductible s, and coinsurance count toward the out-of-pocket maximum (Medical $750 -$5,000 and Dental $100 -$1,000) 2014 Certificate of Coverage for Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 4: Covered health care services 35 | P a g e Out-of-Pocket Maximum (Family) The family out-of-pocket maximum of [$1,700-$12,000] is satisfied in a contract year by adding the amount of covered health care expenses applied to the out -of- pocket maximum for all family members (Medical $1,500 -$10,000 and Pharmacy $200 -$2,000) No one (1) family member can contribute more than [$850-$6,000] towards the contract year family out -of- pocket maximum (Medical $750 -$5,000 and Pharmacy $100 -$1,000) All amounts any enrolled Members in a family pay toward their Individual out-of-pocket maximum s are applied toward the [$1 ,700-$12,000] family out-of-pocket maximum (Medical $1,500 -$10,000 and Pharmacy $200 -$2,000) Once the family out-of-pocket maximum has been met during a contract year , all enrolled Members in a family will have satisfied their $850 -$6,000] individual out-of-pocket maximum s for the remainder of that contract year (Medical $750 -$5,000 and Pharmacy $100 -$1,000) Section 1.4 Our plan does not allow provider s to \"balance bill\" you As a member of NHPRI Exchange Health Plan , an important protection for you is that after you meet any deductible s, you only have to pay your cost-sharing amount when you get services covered by our plan. We do not allow provider s to add additional separate charges, called \" balance billing .\" This protection (that you never pay more than your cost -sharing amount) applies even if we pay the provi der less than the provider charges for a service and even i f there is a dispute and we do no t pay certain provider charges. Here is how this protection works. If your cost sharing is a copayment (a set amount of dollars, for example, $15.00), then you pay only that amount for any covered services from a network provider . If your cost sharing is a coinsurance (a percentage of the total charges), then you never pay more than that percentage. However, your cost depends on which type of provider you see: If you receive the covered services from a network provider , you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by t he plan's reimbursement rate (as determined in the contract between the provider and the plan). If you receive the covered services from an out-of-network provider , you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the plan's reimbursement rate for out-of-network 2014 Certificate of Coverage for Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 4: Covered health care services 36 | P a g e provider s. (Remember, the plan covers services from out-of-network provider s only in certain situations, such as in an emergency or when you get a referral to a provider for services not able to be provided in the network.)

However, occasionally, you may receive a bill from a provider for covered services Sometimes when you get medical care, you may need to pay the full cost right away. Other times, you may find that you have paid more than you exp ected under the coverage rules of the plan. In either case, you can ask our plan to pay you back (paying you back is often called \"reimbursing\" you). It is your right to be paid back by our plan whenever you've paid more than your share of the cost for med ical services that are covered by our plan. There may also be times when you get a bill from a provider for the full cost of medical care you have received. In many cases, you should send this bill to us instead of paying it. We will look at the bill and decide whether the services should be covered. If we decide they should be covered, we will pay the provider directly. Our payments to you or the provider fulfill our responsibility under this agreement. Your benefits are personal to you and cannot be assigned, in whole or in part, to another person or organization . We reserve the right to be reimbursed by the Member for payments made due to our error . Here are examples of situations in which you may need to ask our plan to pay you back or to pay a bill you have received: 1. When you've received emergency or urgently needed medical care from a provider who is not in our plan's network You can receive emergency services from any provider , whether or not the provider is a part of our network. When you receive emergency or urgently needed care from a provider who is not part of our network, you are only responsible for paying your share of the cost, not for the entire cost. You should ask the provider to bill the plan for our share of the cost. If you pay the entire amount yourself at the time you receive the care, you need to ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost. Send us the bill, along with documentation of any payments you have made. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 5: Asking us to pay our share of a bill you received for covered medical services 82 | P a g e At times you may get a bill from the provider asking for payment that you think you do not owe. Send us this bill, along with documentation of any payments you have already made. o If the provider is owed anything, we will pay the provider directly. o If you have already paid m ore than your share of the cost of the service, we will determine how much you owed and pay you back for our share of the cost. 2. When a network provider sends you a bill you think you should not pay Network provider s should always bill the plan directly, an d ask you only for your share of the cost. But sometimes they make mistakes, and ask you to pay more than your share. You only have to pay your cost -sharing amount when you get services covered by our plan. We do not allow provider s to add additional sepa rate charges, called \"balance billing .\" This protection (that you never pay more than your cost -sharing amount) applies even if we pay the provider less than the provider charges for a service and even if there is a dispute and we don't pay certain provider charges. Whenever you get a bill from a network provider that you think is more than you should pay, send us the bill. We will contact the provider directly and resolve the billing problem. If you have already paid a bill to a network provider , but you feel that you paid too much, send us the bill along with documentation of any payment you have made and ask us to pay you back the difference between the amount you paid and the amount you owed under the plan. 3. When you obtain a prescription at a no n-designated pharmacy If you need to obtain a prescription at a non -designated pharmacy, you will need to pay for the prescription up front and submit a claim for reimbursement. All of the examples above are types of coverage decisions. This means that if we deny your request for payment, you can appeal our decision . Chapter 7 of this booklet (What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeal s, complaint s) has information about how to make an appeal . 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 5: Asking us to pay our share of a bill you received for covered medical services 83 | P a g e SECTION 2 How to ask us to pay y ou back or to pay a bill you have received Section 2.1 How and where to send us your request for payment Send us your request for payment, along with your bill and documentation of any payment you have made.

Otherwise, we will consider your request and make a coverage decision. If we decide that the medi cal care is covered and you followed all the rules for getting the care, we will pay for our share of the cost. If you have already paid for the service, we will mail your reimbursement of our share of the cost to you. If you have not paid for the service yet, we will mail the payment directly to the provider . (Chapter 3 explains the rules you need to follow for getting your medical services covered.) If we decide that the medical care is not covered, or you did not follow all the rules, we will not pay for our share of the cost. Instead, we will send you a letter that explains the reasons why we are not sending the payment you have requested and your rights to appeal that decision. Section 3.2 If we tell you that we will not pay for all or part of the medical care, you can make an appeal If you think we have made a mistake in turning down your request for payment or you don't agree with the amount we are paying, you can make an appeal .

These bene fits are commonly referred to as Personal Injury Protect ion (PIP) and Medi cal Payments (MedPay) benefi ts. To the extent permitted under applicable state law, our coverage is secondary to both PIP and MedPay benefi ts. If we pay benefits before PIP or MedPay benefi ts have been exhausted, we may recover the cost of these benefits as described above .

We can collect up to the amount of any benefit or any payment we made. This provision applies in addition to the rights described above. You may recover money by suit, settlement, or otherwise. If this happens, you are required to reimburse us for the cost of health care services, supplies, medications, and expenses for which we paid or will pay.

Workers' compensation Employers provide workers' compensation insurance for their employees. Employers do this to protect them in case of work -related illness or injury. If you have a work -related ill ness or injury, you and your employer must ensure that all medic al claim s related to the illness or injury are bill ed to your employer's workers' compensati on insurer. We will not provide co verage for any injury or illness for which it determines that the member is entitled to benefits pursuant to: (1) any workers' compensation statute or equivalent employer liability; o r (2) indemnification law. This is the case whether or not the emplo yer has obtained workers' compensation coverage as required by law. We may pay for costs of health care services or medications for any work -related ill ness or injury. If we do this, we ha ve the right to recover those costs from you, the person, or company legally obligated to pay for such services, or from the provider .

Such circumstances include, but are not limited to: epidemi c; strike; war; riot; and civil insurrecti on. In such circumstances, we will make a good faith effort to arr ange for the provision of services. In doing so, we will take into account the impact of the event and the availability of network provider s. Section 1. 7 Patient protection disclosure You do not need prior authorization from Neighborhood or from any other person (including a Primary Care Provider ) in order to obtain access to obstetrical or gynecological care from a health care professional in our network who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology.

Your provider is solely responsible for the quality of the services provided to you. SECTION 5 How we coordinate you r Benefits when you are covered by more than one Plan Section 5.1 Introduction to Coordination of Benefits (COB) This Coordination of Benefits (\"COB\") provision applies when you or your covered dependents have health care benefits under more than one plan. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 9: Other Plan Provisions 127 | P a g e We follow the COB rules of payment issued by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The COB rules have been adopted by the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC). From time to time these rules may change befor e we issue a revised Certificate of Coverage. We use the COB regulations in effect at the time of coordination to determine benefits available to you under this agreement. If this provision applies, the order of benefit determination rules as stated in thi s section will determine whether we pay benefits before or after the benefits of another plan. Section 5.2 Definitions The following definitions apply to Section 5: Allowable Expense means the necessary, reasonable and customary item of expense for health care which is: covered at least in part under one or more plans covering the person for whom the claim is made; and incurred while this agreement is in force. When a plan provides health care benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service is considered as both an allowable expense and a benefit paid. Benefits means any treatment, facility, equipment, drug, device, supply or service for which you receive reimbursement under a plan . Claim means a request that benefits of a plan be provided or paid. Plan means any health care insurance benefit package provided by an organization as defined in Section 8.0 - Glossary. Primary plan means a plan whose b enefits for a person's health care coverage must be determined without taking the existence of any other plan into consideration. Secondary plan means a plan which is not a primary plan . Section 5.3 When you have more than one agreement with NHPRI If you are covered under more than one agreement with us, you are entitled to covered benefits under both agreements . If one agreement has a benefit that the other(s) does not, you are entitled to coverage under the agreement that has the benefit . The tota l payments you receive will never be more than the total cost for the services you receive. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 9: Other Plan Provisions 128 | P a g e Section 5.4 How we Coordinate your benefits when you are covered by more than one plan When You Are Covered By More Than One Insurer Covered benefits provided under any other plan will always be paid before the benefits under our plan if that insurer does not use a similar coordination of benefits rule to determine coverage. The plan without the coordination of benefits provision will always be the primary plan. Bene fits under another plan include all benefits that would be paid if claims had been submitted for them. If you are covered by more than one plan and both insurers use similar coordination of benefits rules to determine coverage, we use the following conditi ons to determine which plan covers you first: Whether you are the main subscriber or a dependent; If married, whether you or your spouse was born earlier in the year; OR Length of time each spouse has been covered. Non -Dependent/Dependent - If you are cove red under a plan and you are the main subscriber, the benefits of that plan will be determined before the benefits of a plan which covers you as a dependent. If, however, you are a Medicare beneficiary, then, in some instances, Medicare will be Secondary a nd the plan which covers you as the main subscriber or as a dependent will provide the benefits first. If one of your dependents covered under this agreement is a student, the benefits of any other coverage available because of student enrollment (except accident -only type coverage) will be determined before the benefits under this agreement. Dependent Child/Parents Not Separated or Divorced - If dependent children are covered under separate plans of more than one person (i.e. \"parents\" or individuals acti ng as \"parents\"), the benefits of the plan covering the parent born earlier in the year will be determined before those of the parent whose birthday falls later in the year. If both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the plan which covered the parent longer are determined before those of the plan which covered the other parent for a shorter period of time. The term \"birthday\" only refers to the month and day in a calendar year, not the year in which the person was born. If the other plan does n ot determine benefits according to the parents' birth dates, but by parents' gender instead, the other plan's gender rule will determine the order of benefits. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 9: Other Plan Provisions 129 | P a g e Dependent Child/Parents Separated or Divorced - If two or more plans cover a person as a depende nt child of divorced or separated parents, the plan responsible to cover benefits for the child will be determined in the following order: First , the plan of the parent with custody of the child; Then , the plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of t he child; AND Finally , the plan of the parent not having custody of the child. If the terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, and the entity obligated to pay or provide the parent's be nefits under that parent's plan has actual knowledge of those terms, the benefits of that plan are determined first and the benefits of the plan of the other parent are the secondary plan. If the terms of a court decree state that the parents share joint c ustody, without stating that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, the plans covering the child will follow the order of benefit determination rules outlined in the section above. Active/Inactive Employee - If you are covered under another health plan as an employee (not laid off or retired), your benefits and those of your dependents under that plan will be determined before benefits under this plan. Longer/Shorter Length of Coverage - If none of the above rules deter mine the order of benefits, the benefits of the plan which covered a member or subscriber longer are determined before those of the plan which covered that person for the shorter term. In general, if you use more benefits than you are covered for during a benefit period, the following formula is used to determine coverage: The insurer covering you first will cover you up to its allowance. Then, the other insurer will cover any allowable benefits you use over that amount. It will never be more than the total amount of coverage that would have been provided if benefits were not coordinated. Maximum benefits paid by first insurer + Any remaining allowable expense paid by other insurer = Total Benefits Paid. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 10: Definitions of important words 130 | P a g e Chapter 10. Definitions of important w ords Adoptive child - A child is an adoptive child as of the date he or she: Is legally adopted by the subscriber ; or Is placed for adoption with the subscriber .

It gives definitions of terms and explains the rules you will need to follow to get the medical treatments, services, and other medical care that are covered by the plan. For the deta ils on what medical care and prescription drugs are covered by our plan and how much you pay when you get these service s, use the benefits information in the next chapter, Chapter 4 Covered services ). Section 1.1 \"Network provider s\" and \"covered services\" Here are some definitions that can help you understand how you get the care and services that are covered for you as a member of our plan: \"Provider s\" are doctors and other health care professionals licensed by the state to provide medical services and ca re. The term \" provider s\" also includes hospitals and other health care facilities. \"Network provider s\" are the doctors and other health care professionals, medical groups, hospitals, and other health care facilities that have an agreement with us to accep t our payment and your cost -sharing amount as payment in full. We have arranged for these provider s to deliver covered services to Members in our plan. The provider s in our network generally bill us directly for care they give you. When you see a network provider , you usually pay only your share of the cost for their services. \"Covered services \" include all the medical care, health care services, medications, supplies, and equipment that are covered by our plan. Your covered services for medical care are listed in Chapter 4 . Section 1.2 Basic rules for getting your medical care covered NHPRI Exchange Health Plan will generally cover your medical care as long as: The care you receive is included in the plan's Medical Benefits (reference Chapter 4 of this booklet). The care you receive is considered medically necessary . 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 18 | P a g e You have a network Primary Care Provider (a PCP) who is providing and overseeing your care. As a member of our plan, you must choose a network PCP (for more information about this, see Section 2.1 in this chapter ). o In most situations, your network PCP must give you approval in advance before you can use other provider s in the plan's network, such as specialists, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, or home heal th care agencies. This is called giving you a \"referral.\" For more information about this, see Section 2.3 of this chapter. o Referrals from your PCP are not required for emergency care or urgently needed care. There are also some other kinds of care you can get without having approval in advance from your PCP (for more information about this, see Section 2.2 of this chapter). You must receive your care from a network provider (for more information about this, see Section 2 in this chapter). In most cases, care you receive from an out -of-network provider (a provider who is not part of our plan's network) will not be covered. Here are two exceptions: o The plan covers emergency care or urgently needed care that you get from an out-of-network provider . For more information about this, and to see what emergency or urgently needed care means, see Section 3 in this chapter. o If you need medical care our plan is required to cover and the provider s in our network cannot provide this ca re, you can get this care from an out-of-network provider . An authorization must be obtained from Neighborhood prior to seeking care. In this situation, you will pay the same as you would pay if you got the care from a network provider . For information abo ut getting approval to see an out-of- network doctor, see Section 2.4 in this chapter . Section 1.3 Preauthorization Preauthorization is required for certain covered services . Services that require preauthorization are marked with an asterisk (*) in the Summary of Medical Benefits.

Examples of some types of emergencies are: Broken bones Poisoning or swallowing a dangerous substance 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 27 | P a g e Drug overdose Very bad pain or pressure Bleeding that will not stop Severe trouble breathing Change in level of consciousness Bad head injury Seizures (or a change in pattern of seizures) Complications of pregnancy such as persistent bleeding or severe pain Thoughts of Suicide If you have a medical emergency : Get help as quickly as possible. Call 911 for help or go to the nearest emergency room or hospital. Call for an ambulance if you need it. You do not need to get approval or a referral first from you r PCP. The hospital does not need to be part of Neighborhood 's network. You may need to receive services in the hospital once your emergency condition has been taken care of. These are call post stabilization services or care and services given to you to m ake sure another emergency does not happened. Your doctor will make sure you receive the care you need so that you can safely return home. Call your PCP within 48 hours to tell him/ her about your emergency visit. As soon as possible, make sure that our plan has been told about your emergency . We need to follow up on your emergency care. You or someone else should call to tell us about your emergency care, usually within 48 hours. Call our Member Services Department at 855-321-XCHG (855 -321-9244) . What is covered if you have a medical emergency ? You may get covered emergency medical care whenever you need it, anywhere in the United States and territories . Our plan covers ambulance services in situations where getting to the emergency room in any other way could endanger your health. For more information, see the Medical Benefits description in Chapter 4 of this booklet. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 28 | P a g e If you have an emergency , we will talk with the doctors who are giving you emergency care to help m anage and follow up on your care. The doctors who are giving you emergency care will decide when your condition is stable and the medical emergency is over. After the emergency is over you are entitled to follow -up care to be sure your condition continues to be stable. Your follow -up care will be covered by our plan. If your emergency care is provided by out-of-network provider s, we will try to arrange for network provider s to take over your care as soon as your medical condit ion and the circumstances allow . We may not cover continued out of -network services after the emergency condition is treated and stabilized. This may happen if we dete rmine, in coordination with the member 's provider s, that the member is safe for transport back into the Service Area and that transport is appropr iate and cost -effective . What if it wasn't a medical emergency ? Sometimes it can be hard to know if you have a medical emergency . For example, you mi ght go in for emergency care - thinking that your health is in serious danger - and the doctor may say that it wasn't a medical emergency after all. If it turns out that it was not an emergency , as long as you reasonably thought your health was in serious danger, we will cover your care. However, after the doctor has said that it was not an emergency , we will cover additional care only if you get the additional care in one of these two ways: You go to a network provider to get the additional care , or The additional care you get is considered \"urgently needed care\" and you follow the rules for getting this urgent care (for more information about this, see Section 3.2 below). Section 3.2 Getting care when you have an urgent need for care What is \"urgently ne eded care\"? \"Urgently needed care\" is a non -emergency , unforeseen medical illness, injury, or condition, that requires immediate medical care . Urgently needed care may be furnished by in -network provider s or by out-of-network provider s when network provide rs are temporarily unavailable or inaccessible. The unforeseen condition could, for example, be an unforeseen flare -up of a known condition that you have. What if you are in the plan's service area when you have an urgent need for care? 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 29 | P a g e In most situations, if you are in the plan's service area, we will cover urgently needed care only if you get this care from a network provider and follow the other rules described earlier in this chapter. However, if the circumstances are unusual or extra ordinary, and network provider s are temporarily unavailable or inaccessible, we will cover urgently needed care that you get from an out-of-network provider . If you or your child needs urgent care, call your primary care doctor's office. Say you need to schedule a \"sick visit.\" Your doctor should give you an appointment within 24 hours , or, he or she will direct you to an urgent care center in Neighborhood 's network. Urgent care sites are helpful when you have a problem that needs to be seen that day but yo ur doctor's office cannot give you an appointment. Here are some examples of problems that need urgent care: A sore throat Skin rash Pink eye Low grade fever Ear infection Mild or moderate trouble breathing Runny nose Coughing Persistent diarrhea For more information about urgent care centers in your community, search the Neighborhood Provider Directory online at www.nhpri.org or call Neighborhood Member Services at 855-321-XCHG (855 -321-9244) What if you are outside the plan's service area when you have an urgent need for care? When you are outside the service area and cannot get care from a network provider , our plan will cover urgently needed care that you get from any provider . If this happens, we recommend that y ou or someone acting for you contact your PCP. You need to do this to arrange for any necessary follow -up care. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 30 | P a g e We may not cover continued services after the Urgent condition is treated and stabilized. This may happen if we determine, in coordination with the member 's provider s, that: (1) the member is safe for transport back into the Service Area; and: (2) that transport is appropriate and cost -effective Our plan does not cover urgently needed care or any other care if you receive the care outside of the United States. SECTION 4 If you are billed directly for the full cost of your covered services Section 4.1 You can ask us to pay our share of the cost of covered services If a doctor or hospital sends you a bill or if you paid for covered services , Neighb orhood will help you resolve the issue. Neighborhood will pay you back when appropriate. To better help you, please make sure you let Neighborhood know as soon as you receive any bil l. You can send the receipts to: Member Services Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island 299 Promenade Street Providence , RI 02908 This includes emergency services received out -of-area.

You are responsible for paying the full cost of services that aren't covered by our plan, either because they are not plan covered services , or they were obtained out-of-network and were not authorized. If you have any questions about whether we will pay for any medical service or care that you are considering, you have the right to ask us whether we will cover it before you get it. If we say we will not cover your services, you have the right to appeal our deci sion not to cover your care. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 31 | P a g e Chapter 7 ( What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeal s, complaint s) has more information about what to do if you want a coverage decision from us or want to appeal a decision we have already made .

It includes a list of covered services as a member of NHPRI Exchange Health Plan . Later in this chapter, you can find information about medical services that are not covered. It also explains limits on certain services. Section 1.1 Types of out -of-pocket costs you may pay for your covered services To understand the payment information we give you in this chapter, you need to know about the types of out-of-pocket costs you may pay for your covered ser vices . The \"deductible \" is the amount you must pay for medical services before our plan begins to pay its share. A \"copayment\" is the fixed amount you pay each time you receive certain medical services. You pay a copayment at the time you get the medical service. \"Coinsurance\" is the percentage you pay of the total cost of certain medical services. You pay a coinsurance at the tim e you get the medical service. Section 1.2 Your yearly plan deductible An individual deductible of [$260-$3,250] per member p er contract year applies to each member for covered services received (Medical $250 -$3,000 and Pharmacy $10 -$250) A family deductible of [$520-$6,500] per family per contract year applies for all enrolled Members of a family for covered services received (Medical $500 -$6,000 and Pharmacy $20 - $500) Your deductible is the amount you have to pay out-of-pocket before we will pay our share for your covered medical services. Until you have paid the deductible amount, you must pay the full cost of your covered services . Once you have paid your deductible , we will begin to pay our share of the costs for covered medical services and you will pay your share , including your copayment or coinsurance amount , for the rest of the calendar year. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 4: Covered health care services 34 | P a g e All amounts any enrolled Members in a family pay toward their individual deductible s are applied toward the family deductible . Once the family deductible has been met during a contract year , all enrolled Members in a family will thereafter have satisfied their individual deductible s for the remainder of that contract year . Please note that any amount paid by the member for a covered service rendered during the last 3 months of a contract year will be carried forward to the next contract year 's deductible . The deductible does not apply to some services. This means that we will pay our share of the costs for these services even if you have not paid your yearly deductible yet. The deductible does not apply to the following services: Mental Health services in a provider 's offic e or in your home Chemical dependency treatment in a provider 's office or in your home Outpatient cardiac rehabilitation Chiropractic medicine Diabetic podiatric office visits Diabetic vision care services Diagnostic hearing tests Early intervention services Emergency room services Hemophilia services in a doctor's office House calls Allergist and dermatologist visits Asthma education visits Diabetes education Hospital based clinic visits Nutritional counseling Office visits Specialist visits Pediatric office visits Urgent care visits Podiatrist services Prevention and early detection services Adult immunizations Pediatric immunizations Smoking cessation counseling Surgery in a doctor's office Vision care services Section 1.3 The most you will pay for covered medical services Out-of-Pocket Maximum (Individual) This Certificate of Coverage has an individual out-of-pocket maximum of [$ 850-$6,000] per member per contract year for all covered services . Only copayments, deductible s, and coinsurance count toward the out-of-pocket maximum (Medical $750 -$5,000 and Dental $100 -$1,000) 2014 Certificate of Coverage for Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 4: Covered health care services 35 | P a g e Out-of-Pocket Maximum (Family) The family out-of-pocket maximum of [$1,700-$12,000] is satisfied in a contract year by adding the amount of covered health care expenses applied to the out -of- pocket maximum for all family members (Medical $1,500 -$10,000 and Pharmacy $200 -$2,000) No one (1) family member can contribute more than [$850-$6,000] towards the contract year family out -of- pocket maximum (Medical $750 -$5,000 and Pharmacy $100 -$1,000) All amounts any enrolled Members in a family pay toward their Individual out-of-pocket maximum s are applied toward the [$1 ,700-$12,000] family out-of-pocket maximum (Medical $1,500 -$10,000 and Pharmacy $200 -$2,000) Once the family out-of-pocket maximum has been met during a contract year , all enrolled Members in a family will have satisfied their $850 -$6,000] individual out-of-pocket maximum s for the remainder of that contract year (Medical $750 -$5,000 and Pharmacy $100 -$1,000) Section 1.4 Our plan does not allow provider s to \"balance bill\" you As a member of NHPRI Exchange Health Plan , an important protection for you is that after you meet any deductible s, you only have to pay your cost-sharing amount when you get services covered by our plan. We do not allow provider s to add additional separate charges, called \" balance billing .\" This protection (that you never pay more than your cost -sharing amount) applies even if we pay the provi der less than the provider charges for a service and even i f there is a dispute and we do no t pay certain provider charges. Here is how this protection works. If your cost sharing is a copayment (a set amount of dollars, for example, $15.00), then you pay only that amount for any covered services from a network provider . If your cost sharing is a coinsurance (a percentage of the total charges), then you never pay more than that percentage. However, your cost depends on which type of provider you see: If you receive the covered services from a network provider , you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by t he plan's reimbursement rate (as determined in the contract between the provider and the plan). If you receive the covered services from an out-of-network provider , you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the plan's reimbursement rate for out-of-network 2014 Certificate of Coverage for Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 4: Covered health care services 36 | P a g e provider s. (Remember, the plan covers services from out-of-network provider s only in certain situations, such as in an emergency or when you get a referral to a provider for services not able to be provided in the network.)

However, occasionally, you may receive a bill from a provider for covered services Sometimes when you get medical care, you may need to pay the full cost right away. Other times, you may find that you have paid more than you exp ected under the coverage rules of the plan. In either case, you can ask our plan to pay you back (paying you back is often called \"reimbursing\" you). It is your right to be paid back by our plan whenever you've paid more than your share of the cost for med ical services that are covered by our plan. There may also be times when you get a bill from a provider for the full cost of medical care you have received. In many cases, you should send this bill to us instead of paying it. We will look at the bill and decide whether the services should be covered. If we decide they should be covered, we will pay the provider directly. Our payments to you or the provider fulfill our responsibility under this agreement. Your benefits are personal to you and cannot be assigned, in whole or in part, to another person or organization . We reserve the right to be reimbursed by the Member for payments made due to our error . Here are examples of situations in which you may need to ask our plan to pay you back or to pay a bill you have received: 1. When you've received emergency or urgently needed medical care from a provider who is not in our plan's network You can receive emergency services from any provider , whether or not the provider is a part of our network. When you receive emergency or urgently needed care from a provider who is not part of our network, you are only responsible for paying your share of the cost, not for the entire cost. You should ask the provider to bill the plan for our share of the cost. If you pay the entire amount yourself at the time you receive the care, you need to ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost. Send us the bill, along with documentation of any payments you have made. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 5: Asking us to pay our share of a bill you received for covered medical services 82 | P a g e At times you may get a bill from the provider asking for payment that you think you do not owe. Send us this bill, along with documentation of any payments you have already made. o If the provider is owed anything, we will pay the provider directly. o If you have already paid m ore than your share of the cost of the service, we will determine how much you owed and pay you back for our share of the cost. 2. When a network provider sends you a bill you think you should not pay Network provider s should always bill the plan directly, an d ask you only for your share of the cost. But sometimes they make mistakes, and ask you to pay more than your share. You only have to pay your cost -sharing amount when you get services covered by our plan. We do not allow provider s to add additional sepa rate charges, called \"balance billing .\" This protection (that you never pay more than your cost -sharing amount) applies even if we pay the provider less than the provider charges for a service and even if there is a dispute and we don't pay certain provider charges. Whenever you get a bill from a network provider that you think is more than you should pay, send us the bill. We will contact the provider directly and resolve the billing problem. If you have already paid a bill to a network provider , but you feel that you paid too much, send us the bill along with documentation of any payment you have made and ask us to pay you back the difference between the amount you paid and the amount you owed under the plan. 3. When you obtain a prescription at a no n-designated pharmacy If you need to obtain a prescription at a non -designated pharmacy, you will need to pay for the prescription up front and submit a claim for reimbursement. All of the examples above are types of coverage decisions. This means that if we deny your request for payment, you can appeal our decision . Chapter 7 of this booklet (What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeal s, complaint s) has information about how to make an appeal . 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 5: Asking us to pay our share of a bill you received for covered medical services 83 | P a g e SECTION 2 How to ask us to pay y ou back or to pay a bill you have received Section 2.1 How and where to send us your request for payment Send us your request for payment, along with your bill and documentation of any payment you have made.

Otherwise, we will consider your request and make a coverage decision. If we decide that the medi cal care is covered and you followed all the rules for getting the care, we will pay for our share of the cost. If you have already paid for the service, we will mail your reimbursement of our share of the cost to you. If you have not paid for the service yet, we will mail the payment directly to the provider . (Chapter 3 explains the rules you need to follow for getting your medical services covered.) If we decide that the medical care is not covered, or you did not follow all the rules, we will not pay for our share of the cost. Instead, we will send you a letter that explains the reasons why we are not sending the payment you have requested and your rights to appeal that decision. Section 3.2 If we tell you that we will not pay for all or part of the medical care, you can make an appeal If you think we have made a mistake in turning down your request for payment or you don't agree with the amount we are paying, you can make an appeal .

These bene fits are commonly referred to as Personal Injury Protect ion (PIP) and Medi cal Payments (MedPay) benefi ts. To the extent permitted under applicable state law, our coverage is secondary to both PIP and MedPay benefi ts. If we pay benefits before PIP or MedPay benefi ts have been exhausted, we may recover the cost of these benefits as described above .

We can collect up to the amount of any benefit or any payment we made. This provision applies in addition to the rights described above. You may recover money by suit, settlement, or otherwise. If this happens, you are required to reimburse us for the cost of health care services, supplies, medications, and expenses for which we paid or will pay.

Workers' compensation Employers provide workers' compensation insurance for their employees. Employers do this to protect them in case of work -related illness or injury. If you have a work -related ill ness or injury, you and your employer must ensure that all medic al claim s related to the illness or injury are bill ed to your employer's workers' compensati on insurer. We will not provide co verage for any injury or illness for which it determines that the member is entitled to benefits pursuant to: (1) any workers' compensation statute or equivalent employer liability; o r (2) indemnification law.

Such circumstances include, but are not limited to: epidemi c; strike; war; riot; and civil insurrecti on. In such circumstances, we will make a good faith effort to arr ange for the provision of services.

Your provider is solely responsible for the quality of the services provided to you. SECTION 5 How we coordinate you r Benefits when you are covered by more than one Plan Section 5.1 Introduction to Coordination of Benefits (COB) This Coordination of Benefits (\"COB\") provision applies when you or your covered dependents have health care benefits under more than one plan. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 9: Other Plan Provisions 127 | P a g e We follow the COB rules of payment issued by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The COB rules have been adopted by the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC). From time to time these rules may change befor e we issue a revised Certificate of Coverage. We use the COB regulations in effect at the time of coordination to determine benefits available to you under this agreement. If this provision applies, the order of benefit determination rules as stated in thi s section will determine whether we pay benefits before or after the benefits of another plan. Section 5.2 Definitions The following definitions apply to Section 5: Allowable Expense means the necessary, reasonable and customary item of expense for health care which is: covered at least in part under one or more plans covering the person for whom the claim is made; and incurred while this agreement is in force. When a plan provides health care benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service is considered as both an allowable expense and a benefit paid. Benefits means any treatment, facility, equipment, drug, device, supply or service for which you receive reimbursement under a plan . Claim means a request that benefits of a plan be provided or paid. Plan means any health care insurance benefit package provided by an organization as defined in Section 8.0 - Glossary. Primary plan means a plan whose b enefits for a person's health care coverage must be determined without taking the existence of any other plan into consideration. Secondary plan means a plan which is not a primary plan . Section 5.3 When you have more than one agreement with NHPRI If you are covered under more than one agreement with us, you are entitled to covered benefits under both agreements . If one agreement has a benefit that the other(s) does not, you are entitled to coverage under the agreement that has the benefit . The tota l payments you receive will never be more than the total cost for the services you receive. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 9: Other Plan Provisions 128 | P a g e Section 5.4 How we Coordinate your benefits when you are covered by more than one plan When You Are Covered By More Than One Insurer Covered benefits provided under any other plan will always be paid before the benefits under our plan if that insurer does not use a similar coordination of benefits rule to determine coverage. The plan without the coordination of benefits provision will always be the primary plan. Bene fits under another plan include all benefits that would be paid if claims had been submitted for them. If you are covered by more than one plan and both insurers use similar coordination of benefits rules to determine coverage, we use the following conditi ons to determine which plan covers you first: Whether you are the main subscriber or a dependent; If married, whether you or your spouse was born earlier in the year; OR Length of time each spouse has been covered. Non -Dependent/Dependent - If you are cove red under a plan and you are the main subscriber, the benefits of that plan will be determined before the benefits of a plan which covers you as a dependent. If, however, you are a Medicare beneficiary, then, in some instances, Medicare will be Secondary a nd the plan which covers you as the main subscriber or as a dependent will provide the benefits first. If one of your dependents covered under this agreement is a student, the benefits of any other coverage available because of student enrollment (except accident -only type coverage) will be determined before the benefits under this agreement. Dependent Child/Parents Not Separated or Divorced - If dependent children are covered under separate plans of more than one person (i.e. \"parents\" or individuals acti ng as \"parents\"), the benefits of the plan covering the parent born earlier in the year will be determined before those of the parent whose birthday falls later in the year. If both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the plan which covered the parent longer are determined before those of the plan which covered the other parent for a shorter period of time. The term \"birthday\" only refers to the month and day in a calendar year, not the year in which the person was born. If the other plan does n ot determine benefits according to the parents' birth dates, but by parents' gender instead, the other plan's gender rule will determine the order of benefits. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 9: Other Plan Provisions 129 | P a g e Dependent Child/Parents Separated or Divorced - If two or more plans cover a person as a depende nt child of divorced or separated parents, the plan responsible to cover benefits for the child will be determined in the following order: First , the plan of the parent with custody of the child; Then , the plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of t he child; AND Finally , the plan of the parent not having custody of the child. If the terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, and the entity obligated to pay or provide the parent's be nefits under that parent's plan has actual knowledge of those terms, the benefits of that plan are determined first and the benefits of the plan of the other parent are the secondary plan. If the terms of a court decree state that the parents share joint c ustody, without stating that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, the plans covering the child will follow the order of benefit determination rules outlined in the section above. Active/Inactive Employee - If you are covered under another health plan as an employee (not laid off or retired), your benefits and those of your dependents under that plan will be determined before benefits under this plan. Longer/Shorter Length of Coverage - If none of the above rules deter mine the order of benefits, the benefits of the plan which covered a member or subscriber longer are determined before those of the plan which covered that person for the shorter term. In general, if you use more benefits than you are covered for during a benefit period, the following formula is used to determine coverage: The insurer covering you first will cover you up to its allowance. Then, the other insurer will cover any allowable benefits you use over that amount. It will never be more than the total amount of coverage that would have been provided if benefits were not coordinated. Maximum benefits paid by first insurer + Any remaining allowable expense paid by other insurer = Total Benefits Paid. 2014 Certificate of Coverage for N eighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Exchange Health Plan Chapter 10: Definitions of important words 130 | P a g e Chapter 10.

Page 1 NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH PLAN OF RHODE ISLAND Small Group Products Actuarial Memorandum I. SCOPE AND PURPOSE Milliman, Inc. (Milliman) has been retained by Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island (NHPRI) to prepare the premium rates and actuarial memorandum for Small Group products to be offered on the Rhode Island Health Benefit Exchange (RIHBE). This document contains the Part III Actuarial Memorandum for NHPRI's Small Group block of business, effective January 1, 2014. This actuarial memorandum is submitted in conjunction with the Part I Unified Rate Review Template. This actuarial memorandum will also serve as the memorandum to support the 2013 Rate Review Process OHIC Template. The memorandum is intended to demonstrate that the premiums for these products are reasonable in relation to the benefits provided and to demonstrate compliance with regulatory authority. This memorandum may not be appropriate for any other purpose. This actuarial memorandum has been prepared to be included in NHPRI's rate filings and is intended for use by the State of Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC), the Rhode Island Health Benefit Exchange (RIHBE), the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), and their subcontractors to assist in the review of NHPRI's filings. However, we recognize that this certification may become a public document. Milliman makes no representations or warranties regarding th e contents of this letter to third parties. Likewise, third parties are instructed that they are to place no reliance upon this actuarial memorandum prepared for NHPRI by Milliman that would result in the creation of any duty or liability under any theory of law by Milliman or its employees to third parties. The memorandum does not guarantee that the rates will be adequate. Rather, the filing shows that the rates will be adequate if the assumptions underlying their development are realized. Differences between our projections and actual amounts depend on the extent to which future experience conforms to the assumptions made for this analysis. It is certain that actual experience will not conform exactly to the assumptions used in this analysis. Actual amounts will differ from projected amounts to the extent that actual experience deviates from expected experience. II.

The proposed rates within this actuarial memorandum are for new products that are intended to be offered on the RIHBE. NHPRI currently does not offer any products in the commercial health insura nce market. As such, there are no rate adjustments being proposed. IV. EXPERIENCE PERIOD PREMIUM AND CLAIMS Not applicable. NHPRI currently does not offer any products in the commercial health insurance market. Because of this, no relevant experience base d premium and/or claims data is available. The premium rates and corresponding factors proposed in this memorandum are based on a manual rate development process. V. BENEFIT CATEGORIES Not applicable. As no relevant data was available for the purpose of developing premium rates, experience data was not summarized by benefit category. The premium rates and corresponding factors proposed in this memorandum are based on a manual rate development process. VI. PROJECTION FACTORS Not applicable. Factors were not developed for the purpose of projecting experience period allowed claims, since no experience data was available. The premium rates and corresponding factors proposed in this memorandum are based on a manual rate development process. Assumptions for items such as morbidity changes, demographic changes, and trend were considered in developing manual rates as described in Section VII. VII. CREDIBILITY MANUAL RATE DEVELOPMENT NHPRI currently does not offer any products in the commercial health insurance market, which results in no experience data being available. For this reason, the premium rates and corresponding factors proposed in this memorandum are solely based on the ma nual rate development process. In order to estimate premium rates for NHPRI products, the following steps were performed. These steps outline the premium development process including Population Assumptions (including morbidity), Claim Costs, Administr ative Expenses, Risk Adjustment Transfer, and Federal Transitional Reinsurance. While some of these items may fall outside of the scope of manual rate development, it is important to understand the process in its entirety. A. Step 1: Project Statewide Marke t Members and Health Status by Population Cohort We anticipate shifts in the insured population when the Rhode Island Health Benefit Exchange opens in 2014. We projected Rhode Island statewide members and their health status to help determine NHPRI's sha re of the market, the morbidity of their members, and NHPRI's risk adjustment receipts or payments . Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 3 For the purpose of projecting Rhode Island membership, a population projection model developed by Milliman's Indianapolis Health Practice (the Model) was u tilized. This model estimates the calendar year 2011 insurance market population and applies assumptions in order to project the developed population to future years. Estimated insurance market population counts are divided into cohorts that represent a combination of age, gender, household income (measured as percent of the Federal Poverty Level), and self -reported health status. Insurance coverage's incorporated in the model include Medicaid, Medicare, Individual Insured, Small Group Insured, Large Gro up Insured, Self -Funded, Employer Part -Time, Employer Retiree, and Uninsured. For each type of insurance coverage, enrollment is estimated by percent of Federal Poverty Level, Age, and Gender. Additionally, morbidity assumptions for both the baseline per iod and projection period are estimated. The model uses the latest data available from multiple public and proprietary sources in order to understand the current market population by insurance coverage, age, gender, percent of Federal Poverty Level (FPL), health status, and Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). The data utilized by the Model is comprised of public data sources outlined below. Current Population Survey (CPS) data - This data, which is updated monthly, provides us with demographic information by insurance coverage, age, FPL, and health status. In order to obtain a credible sample size, CPS data from 2009 through 2011 is summarized. In situations where CPS sample size credibility is a concern, state data is blended with the corresponding HHS regional data to further enhance credibility in modeling results. American Community Survey (ACS) data - Because of a larger sample size, ACS data is used in order to provide more accurate enrollment counts by insurance coverage, age, gender, and FPL. Th is population count data is merged with the CPS data by health status in order to obtain a detailed estimate of the current population. MLR data - Publically available 2011 Medical Loss Ratio Reporting Form data (MLR) is used in order to determine the curr ent number of covered lives by insurance segment (Individual, Small Group, Large Group). This data also provides insight on claims and premiums per member per month (PMPM) for these insurance segments. In addition to the data sources described above, the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines TM (HCG) and Milliman Medical Underwriting GuidelinesTM (MUG) are utilized. These sources provide insight into items such as relative claims cost by age, gender, and health status. Pairing the HCG and MUG data with the publicly available data sources enables the Model to produce age/gender and morbidity esti mates for the population. Each of the data sources outlined plays a specific role in understanding the current population. The methodology implemented within the model is outlined below. The CPS data is utilized to estimate the percent of the population in Excellent, Very Good, Good, and Fair/Poor Health Status. ACS data is utilized to estimate the population breakdown by insurance coverage, age, gender, FPL, health status, and MSA. MLR d ata is used to understand the size of the insured markets (Individual, Small Group, Large Group), along with estimating current market claims PMPM. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 4 The proportion of the population that will purchase coverage on the RIHBE is then estimated (i.e., \"take- up\"). These take -up rate assumptions are primarily driven by a member's current insurance status (i.e., insured or uninsured) and the federal subsidy available (if any) if the member enrolls in a plan on the RIHBE. We assumed a moderate number of small g roups will purchase coverage through the RIHBE (with or without brokers). This assumption is based, in part, on studies of the Massachusetts and Utah markets that show relatively low take- up in the small group market. We then applied employer -sponsored insurance transition rates and individual/uninsured RIHBE take-up rates to estimate the population counts in each market (stratified by income -to-poverty ratio, health status, and family size). The result is a 2014 population projection by cohort (i.e., age, gender, income, and exchange status). B. Step 2: Project NHPRI Enrollment by Market and Exchange Status NHPRI's expected 2014 Small Group enrollment was projected based on our estimate of the statewide population and market share estimates provided by NH PRI. As NHPRI will only be offering products on the RIHBE, it is assumed that no off exchange enrollment will exist. We estimated the members that would select each of NHPRI's benefit plans based on an assumed distribution of membership by Metal Level . We also assumed that all 2014 members are enrolled for the entire year. C. Step 3: Project Statewide Risk Scores For Use in the Risk Adjustment Transfer Payment For the purpose of estimating NHPRI's risk adjustment transfer payment, the population projecti on model outlined in Step 1 was utilized to project statewide risk scores. This was completed by inferring the health status of the projected insured population by cohort using the self-reported health status field in the CPS data. R elative health status factors for each self - reported health status category, developed based on data available within the MUGs, were inferred based on the proportion of members within each self -reported health status category. These inferred relative health status factors wer e combined with age/gender claim cost factors from the HCGs to produce final statewide average risk scores for each population cohort. D. Step 4: Project NHPRI's Risk Score For Use in the Risk Adjustment Transfer Payment We assumed that NHPRI's risk scores for a given age, gender, and FPL cohort were comparable to the statewide average risk scores for the same cohort. This assumption relies on there being similar Selection and Coding Intensity between NHPRI and the statewide average. Selection refers to th e health status difference between a given carrier and the overall market. Coding Intensity refers to a differing frequency and accuracy with which diagnosis codes are captured in claims data impacting the calculated risk score of the population. We did not model the impact of selection between the metal plans because carriers are not permitted to rate for selection. E. Step 5: Estimate 2014 Statewide Average Claims for the Risk Adjustment Transfer Payments To estimate the statewide premium in NHPRI's risk adjustment transfer payment, the statewide claim costs were estimated using 2011 Medical Loss Ratio Reporting Form (MLR) data. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island is the predominant carrier in Rhode Is land, and as a result, was the focus of this portion of the analysis. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 5 State wide claim cost PMPM was calculated by adjusting for: Trend from 2011 to 2014, The pharmacy and device taxes, Health status changes due to uninsured individuals entering the insured market, Assumed \"richness\" of the plans and the resulting utilization patterns resulting from a given benefit design level, and Additional induced utilization for those enrolling in alternate Silver plans (i.e., those with cost sharing reductions). We are assuming no pent -up demand will occur in the Small Group market. When trending figures within the analysis, a consistent annual trend assumption of 5.8 % was used for each year. F. Step 6: Project NHPRI's 2014 Claim Costs Since no experience is currently available for NHPRI, 2014 claim costs were developed using the Milliman Managed Care Rating Model (MCRM) and the Milliman Prescription Drug Rating Model (RXRM). These models were calibrated to reflect cost and utilization levels appropriate for NHPRI's assumed provider contracting arrangements and enrollment characteristics. Specific considerations included: Reflecting NHPRI's assumed 2014 provider reimbursement rates, Reflecting NHPRI's assumed utilization rates, Adjusting the degree of healthcare management, Reflecting NHPRI's plan designs, and Reflecting results produced through the population modeling work, including assumptions for morbidity changes. These models were used in order to estimate utilization per 1,000 and average cost per service for the purpose of developing NHPRI's credibility manual. Finally, we projected claim costs PMPM for every combination of age, gender, metal plan, income level, and exchange status. G. Step 7: Add Administrative Expenses Administrative expenses were added to NHPRI's claim costs, including: General Administrative Expenses, Commercial Reinsurance Premium Net of Recoveries, Quality Improvement/Information Technology, Premium Tax, Comparative Effectiveness Research, Reinsurance Operating Fee, Risk Adjustment Admin Fee, and Contribution to Surplus. Additional details related to administrative expenses can be found in Section XI, Non -Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 6 H. Step 8: Add Estimated Federal Transitional Reinsurance Expenses Additional costs or savings due to the Federal transitional reinsurance program were estimated. Differences exist between the markets since only the individual market is eligible for transitional reinsurance. It was assumed that NHPRI would pay $5.25 PMPM in reinsurance contributions. No reinsurance recoveries are assumed for the Small Group market. Additional details related to Federal Transitional Reinsurance can be found in Section X, Risk Adjusters and Reinsurance. I. Step 9: Estimate NHPRI 's Risk Adjustment Transfer Payment NHPRI's risk adjustment transfer payment was estimated using the CMS formula, which includes the statewide average premium, induced demand factor, geographical cost factor, NHPRI's risk score by plan, the plan's actuari al value, and allowable rating factors. The key determinant of whether NHPRI receives or makes a transfer payment is how NHPRI's risk score (normalized across all carriers) compares to the product of the actuarial value and allowable rating factors (norma lized across all carriers). The statewide average premium was estimated by adding expenses to the statewide average claim costs (i.e., Steps 5 and 7). Next, NHPRI's risk score s were normalized from Step 4 to the statewide average risk score by removing the portion of NHPRIs' risk score that can be accounted for through age rating factors, leaving an \"uncompensated risk\" factor. We then multiplied the \"uncompensated risk\" factor by the state average premium PMPM to estimate the net risk adjustment PMPM received or payable by NHPRI. Additional details related to Risk Adjustment can be found in Section X, Risk Adjusters and Reinsurance. J. Step 10: Calculate Composite Required Premium The composite required premium was calculated by summing expected claims, administrative expenses, the net impact of federal reinsurance, and the net impact of state risk adjustment. An additional load was added to account for family policies with more than three members under the age of 21. Lastly, it was verified that no e xpected minimum loss ratio rebates or risk corridor payments we estimate to r esult from the established premium rates. K. Step 11: Calculate Premiums by Rate Cell The composite required premium was divided by the composite of all allowable rating factors across NHPRI's projected block of business by rating cell to determine a base rate. This base rate, in combination with the allowable rating factors, will result in the premium rates charged to enrollees in 2014. Age and plan design are the only allowable rating factors for each cohort in Rhode Island. We developed NHPRI's rating factors to meet the regulatory requirements below: Age factors as specified by law, and Plan factors based on the plan's actuarial value, cost sharing utilization, network, and cost of administration. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 7 VIII. CREDIBILITY OF EXPER IENCE Since no experience data is available, a credibility assumption of 0% was applied. The manual rates developed through the steps outlined under Section VII are the sole basis for the premium rates proposed in this memorandum. IX. PAID TO ALLOWED RATI O The paid to allow ed ratio provided in Worksheet 1 , Section III of the Unified Rate Review Template (URRT) and in \"II Data Collection\" of the 2013 Rate Review Process OHIC Template was developed using the MCRM and RXRM models calibrated for the purpose of developing NHPRI's manual rates. These models were used to develop both paid and allowed claims on a per member per month (PMPM) basis for every combination of age, gender, metal plan, income level, and exchange status. The resulting paid and allowed claims PMPM were weighted based on NHPRI's membership projections in order to arrive at an estimated paid to allowed ratio. X. RISK ADJUSTERS AND REINSURANCE The processes used to estimate risk adjustment and reinsurance were completed in Steps 9 and 8 of the premium development process respectively. A. Risk Adjustment Transfer Payment Estimate NHPRI's risk adjustment transfer payment was estimated using the CMS formula, which includes the statewide average p remium, induced demand factor, geographical cost factor, NHPRI's risk score by plan, the plan's actuarial value, and allowable rating factors. The key determinant of whether NHPRI receives or makes a transfer payment is how NHPRI's risk score (normalized across all carriers) compares to the product of the actuarial value and allowable rating factors (normalized across all carriers). The statewide average premium was estimated by adding expenses to the statewide average claim costs produced in the premium development process (Steps 5 and 7). Next, NHPRI's risk score s (from Step 4 of the premium development process) were normalized to the statewide average risk score and the portion of NHPRIs' risk score that can be accounted for through age rating factors was removed; leaving an \"uncompensated risk\" factor. We then multiplied the \"uncompensated risk\" factor by the state average premium PMPM to estimate the net risk adjustment PMPM received or payable by NHPRI. It is assumed that NHPRI will have a similar level of risk compared to other insurers in the Small Group market. As a result, it is estimated that for NHPRI there will be no risk adjustment received or payable. B. Federal Transitional Reinsurance Estimate Additional costs or savings due to the Federal transitional reinsurance program were estimated. Differences exist between the markets since only the individual market is eligible for transitional reinsurance. It was assumed that NHPRI would pay $5.25 PMPM in reinsurance contributions. No rei nsurance recoveries are assumed for the Small Group market. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 8 XI. NON- BENEFIT EXPENSES AND PROFIT & RISK The proposed rates reflect an administrative load of approximately 21% including General Administrative Expenses, Contribution to Surplus, Taxes and Fees. This load was developed through the use of assumptions provided to Milliman from NHPRI. A. Administrative Expense Load The table below outlines the Administrative Expenses that are reflected in the proposed premium rates. These expenses were developed usi ng assumptions provided to Milliman from NHPRI. All categories are demonstrated as both a PMPM and percent of premium. However, please note that some items were developed and applied on a differen t basis. In these situations, items have been converted to PMPM equivalents or Percent of Premium equivalents as needed for illustrative purposes. Table 1: Administrative Expenses Description PMPM Equivalent Percent of Premium General Administrative Expense $ 39.35 11.4% Commercial Reinsurance Net of Recoveries $ 1.75 0.5% Quality Improvement $ 5.45 1.6% Additional Child Load $ 2.73 0.8% NHPRI will not be paying any broker commissions and, as such, administrative expenses associated with commissions are not reflected. The Additional Child Load is intended to reflect that rates for family policies cannot account for more than three members under the age of 21. A portion of this load will be reflect ed in claims experience in subsequent years (0.6 %), while the remaining portion is intended to account for additional administrative expenses associated with these members. B. Contribution to Surplus & Risk margin The proposed rates reflect 3% of premium be ing allocated to Contribution to Surplus & Risk Margin. This load was applied evenly to all plans being offered by NHPRI. C. Taxes and Fees The table below outlines the Taxes and Fees that are included in the non- benefit expenses. Table 2: Taxes and Fees Description PMPM Equivalent Percent of Premium Premium Tax $ 6.89 2.00% Comparative Effectiveness Research $ 0.17 0.05% Reinsurance Operating Fee $ 0.11 0.03% Risk Adjustment Admin Fee $ 0.08 0.02% Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 9 It is currently understood that there will be no Exchange Operation Fees in Rhode Island for calendar year 2014. Additionally, it is assumed that NHPRI will not be assessed the Health Insurer Tax provided that over 80% of premiums are received for Medicai d. XII. PROJECTED LOSS RATIO The projected loss ratio for NHPRI's Small Group bock of business is approximately 85.3%. This loss ratio is calculated consistently with the Federally prescribed MLR methodology, and reflects the projected loss ratio prior to reflecting any applicable credibility adjustments. A credibility adjusted loss ratio is estimated at approximately 94.5% based on membership projections developed by Milliman with guidance from NHPRI. XIII. INDEX RATE No experience data was made available as NHPRI current does not offer plans in the commercial health insurance market. As such, an index rate for the experience period was not calculated. For the projection period, the index rate was calculated using information produced during the premium rate development process. The index rate provided reflects the estimated total allowed claims divided by total projected member months. The estimate produced reflects the utilization level, demographics, etc. of NHPRI's assumed enrollment. There will be no non -essential health benefits included in NHPRI plans. Because of this, the index rate provided aligns with the projected allowed claims PMPM. Premiums in the Rhode Island small g roup market will be calculated using monthly trend factors. For details related to proposed trend, please see XX, Effective Rate Review Information. In order to arrive at each plan's rate level based on the projected index rate, adjustments for the follo wing items are considered: Cost sharing structure of the plan, Assumed cost sharing utilization of the plan, and Administrative costs. All plans offered have a consistent provider network, utilization management, and delivery system. Additionally, items such as risk adjustment and reinsurance are accounted for consistently on all plans. Also, as previously noted non- essential health benefits will not be offered. Assumptions for cost structure and utilization differences by plan are outlined within Secti on XV, AV Pricing Values. XIV. AV METAL VALUES In the Small Group market, NHPRI intends to offer two plans. Specifically, plans to be offered include the following: One plan at the Gold metal level, One plan at the Silver metal level, Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 10 The AV Metal Values included in Worksheet 2 of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template were based on the Federal AV Calculator. No adjustments to plan cost sharing were needed in order to determine AV using the Federal AV Calculator. While the Federal AV Calculator does no t contain an input for every potential variation in plan designs, it is assumed that the majority of variation between AVs is being captured by the plan characteristics available within the Federal AV Calculator. This assumption is consistent with documentation provided within the Actuarial Value Calculator Methodology document made available by the Department of Health and Human Services. XV. AV PRICING VALUES AV pricing values were developed based on the allowable rating factors for each cohort in Rhode Island. In order to be consistent with the OHIC rate review process, the premium of a plan covering 100% of allowed costs for a 21- year old assuming Silver Metal Level utilization was calculated as the fixed reference plan for basis of the AV Pricing Values. We developed NHPRI's rating factors to meet the regulatory requirements below: Age factors as specified by law, and Plan factors based on the plan's actuarial value, cost sharing utilizati on, network, and cost of administration. There are no assumed network differences between the plans being offered by NHPRI. Also, administrative costs are assumed to be consistent for each offering. However, certain administrative costs are developed on a PMPM basis and thus when demonstrated as a percent of premium they may vary. The MCRM model calibrated for the purpose of developing NHPRI's manual rates was utilized for developing NHPRI's AV Pricing Values. This MCRM model is based on data from the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines TM (HCGs). The HCGs provide a flexible but consistent basis for the determination of claim costs for a wide variety of health benefit plans. These rating structures are used to anticipate future claim levels, evaluate past experience and establish interrelationships between different benefit levels. The HCGs are developed as a result of Milliman's continuing research on health care costs. They were first developed in 1954 and have been updated and expanded annually since t hen. These guidelines are continually monitored as we use them in measuring the experience or evaluating the rates of our clients and as we compare them to other data sources. The HCGs are a cooperative effort of all Milliman health actuaries and represent a combination of their experience, research and judgment. An extensive amount of data is used in developing these guidelines, including published and unpublished data. In most instances, cost assumptions are based upon our evaluation of several data sources and, hence, are not specifically attributable to a single source. Since these guidelines are a proprietary document of Milliman, they are only available for release to specific clients that lease these guidelines and to Milliman consulting h ealth actuaries. We used the calibrated MCRM model to estimate the value of cost -sharing and relative utilization of services for each plan. Our pricing models assume the same demographic and risk characteristics for each plan priced, thereby excluding e xpected differences in the morbidity of members assumed to select the plan. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 11 The table below includes AV Pricing Values for the two plans offered on the Small Group market. Factors are shown separately for utilization and relative AV, the product of which produces the proposed AV Pricing Value. Table 3: Cost Sharing Utilization Factor by Metal Level Metal Level Cost Sharing Utilization Factor Relative AV Factor AV Pricing Value Gold 1.05 0.81 0.85 Silver 1.00 0.71 0.71 XVI. MEMBERSHIP PROJECTIO NS The membership projections were developed in conjunction with NHPRI. These projections reflect market share estimates assumed by NHPRI. Additionally, the projections reflect the total market size estimated in Step 1 of the premium development process. Membership by plan is outlined in the table below. Table 4: Membership by Plan Plan Membership Gold 398 Silver 663 Total 1,061 XVII. TERMINATED PRODUCTS Not applicable. No plans are being terminated as NHPRI currently does not offer products in the Small Group market. XVIII. PLAN TYPE Not applicable. The plan types listed in Worksheet 2, Section I of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template appropriately describe NHPRI's plans. XIX. WARNING ALERTS The following differences between the plan -level projections in Wor ksheet 2 and the total projected amounts found in Worksheet 1 were noted. Explanations regarding these differences are as follows: A warning is listed in cell A82 of Worksheet 2, Plan Product Info. This warning is the result of rounding differences betw een values listed within the workbook. Total Premium is appropriately aligning to the nearest dollar. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 12 XX. EFFECTIVE RATE REVIEW INFORMATION The following section contains additional information and documentation pertaining to the 2013 Rate Review Process OHIC Template. As previously indicated, experience data was not available for the purpose of developing premium rates for NHPRI's products. Because of this, some sections of the OHIC Template have been intentionally left blank. Additionally, methodologies utilized for rate development purposes are consistent with those de scribed in prior sections of this document. This section is intended to capture documentation for information not included within the Part I Unified Rate Review Template. A. Experience Data Part 1. Historical Information Since no experience data was available, Part 1 has not been completed. Part 2. Prospective Information Since no experience data was available, sections A and C have not been completed. Section B was completed using assumptions consistent with the premium rate development process outlined in Section VII of this memorandum. The Expected Pure Medical Cost Ratio was calculated as estimated total claims PMPM divided by projected total premium PMPM . This calculatio n is not intended to be consistent with the Federally prescribed MLR methodology , and does not include the impact of Federal Reinsurance or Risk Adjustment . Administrative cost percentages are consistent with values shown in Section XI of this memorandum , yet are allocated to the prescribed categories. B. Data Collection Information contained in this section and corresponding documentation is consistent with values shown within the Part I Unified Rate Review Template; however, it contains two additional i tems. Base EHB Rate for Projection Period This value was calculated by adjusting the Index Rate to reflect the premium of a plan covering 100% of allowed cost for a 21- year old enrollee assuming Silver Metal Level utilization . To accomplish this, composit e age and cost sharing utilization factors were calculated. A description of the methodology used to calculate cost sharing utilization factors is available within Section XV of this memorandum. Additional supporting calculations have been provided within the 2013 Rate Review OHIC Template. Monthly Effective Date Projection Factor An annual premium trend rate of 6% is being proposed. Given that experience data is not available this value is intended to represent a trend level consistent with a standard commercial market. Additionally, the information requested in rows 47 and 48 of this tab is not identical to the corresponding section of the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template. The primary difference is that the Federal template requests 'Taxes & Fees' while the 2013 OHIC Template specifically requests 'Premium Tax'. To account for this variation, Taxes and Fees other than Premium Tax have been included in the 'Administrative Expense Load' field. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 13 C. Plan Rates All products are new for 2014; therefore, 2013 values have been left blank within this tab. Metallic Tier Actuarial Value was calculated in an identical manner as outlined in Section XIV, AV Metal Values. AVs provided within this section align with values shown in Worksheet 2 of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template. Additionally, the Proposed Plan Relativity Factors are consistent with the values outlined in Section XV, AV Pricing Values. A description and supporting information for these values can be found within aforementioned sections of this memorandum. Membership for 1/1/2014 was estimated using membership projections as outlined in XVI, Membership Projections. As outlined within the premium development process, publically available survey data was used for the purpose of understanding the current population. Projections were performed at the member level as data was not available at the group and/or subscriber level in the available survey data. For this reason, columns R and S have not been completed. For the small group market, since data is not available it is assumed that all groups will be effective on January 1, 2014. The proposed base rate PMPM reflects the premium of a plan covering 100% of allowed claims for a 21-year old enrollee with utilization set at the Silver Metal Level. This figure aligns with the base EHB ra te shown in the second tab of the template. Pediatric Dental benefits will not be offered. Each member's rate can be calculated as the product of the EHB Base Rate, the AV Pricing Value, and the appropriate Age Factor. Please note that AV Pricing Values were developed in a different manner, yet presented as a percentage of the EHB Base Rate for filing purposes. D. Administrative Costs As outlined in Section XI of this memorandum, administrative costs were developed through the use of assumptions provided to Milliman from NHPRI. Prior year administrative cost data is not available due to NHPRI currently not offering products in the commercial market. Administrative costs were broken down in to the applicable categories through the use of assumptions provi ded to Milliman from NHPRI. It is currently understood that there will be no Exchange Operation Fees in Rhode Island for calendar year 2014. Additionally, it is assumed that NHPRI will not be assessed the Health Insurer Tax provided that over 80% of pr emiums are received for Medicaid. Additional details related to administrative costs can be found in Section XI, Non- Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk. XXI. RELIANCE In developing the premium rates in this actuarial memorandum, I relied on data and other information provided by NHPRI. I have not audited or verified this data and other information. If the underlying data or information is inaccurate or incomplete, the results of the analysis may likewise be inaccurate or incomplete. I performed a limited review of the data used directly in the analysis for reasonableness and consistency and have not found material defects in the data. If there are material defects in the data, it is possible that they would be uncovered by a detailed, systematic review and comparison of the data to search for data values that are questionable or for relationships that are materially inconsistent. Such a review was beyond the scope of my assignment. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 14 XXII. ACTUARIAL CERTIFICAT ION I, Jeremy D. Palmer, am a member of the American Academy of Actuaries and meet its qualification standards for actuaries issuing statements of actuarial opinion in the United States. I have been retained by Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island (the \"Company\") to prepare this filing. I am a ffiliated with Milliman, Inc. (\"Milliman\"), an independent actuarial consulting firm that is not affiliated with, nor a subsidiary, nor in any way owned or controlled by a health plan, health insurer, or a trade association of health plans or insurers. I hereby certify that the projected index rate is, to the best of my knowledge and understanding: In compliance with all applicable State and Federal Statutes and Regulations (45 CFR 156.80(d)(1)) . Developed in compliance with the applicable Actuarial Standards of Practice. Reasonable in relation to the benefits provided and the population anticipated to be covered Neither excessive nor deficient . I certify that the index rate and only the allowable modifiers as described in 45 CFR 156.80(d)(1) and 45 CFR 156.80(d)(2) were used to generate plan level rates. The allowable modifiers used to generate plan -level rates were: The actuarial value and cost -sharing design of the plan. The plan's provider network, delivery system characteristics, and utilization management practices. Administrative costs, excluding Exchange user fees. I certify that the percent of total premium that represents essential health benefits included in Worksheet 2, Sections III and IV were calculated in accordance with relevant actuar ial standards of practice. I certify that the benefits included within Neighborhood's plans are substantially equivalent to the Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) in the State of Rhode Island's benchmark plans. I certify that any benefit substitutions are : Actuarially equivalent to the benefits being replaced, Are made within only the same essential health benefit category, Are based on a standardized plan population , Are determined regardless of cost -sharing, Are not prescription drug benefits, and Are based on an analysis performed in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and methodologies. I certify that the AV Calculator was used to determine the AV Metal Values shown in Worksheet 2 of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template for all plans except those specified in the certification. The AV Metal Values included in Worksheet 2 of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template were based on the Federal AV Calculator. No adjustments to plan cost sharing were needed in order to determine AV using the Federal AV Calculator. While the Federal AV Calculator does not contain an input for every potential variation in plan designs, it is assumed that the majority of variation between AVs is being captured by the plan characteristics available wi thin the Federal AV Calculator. This assumption is consistent with documentation provided within the Actuarial Value Calculator Methodology document made available by the Department of Health and Human Services. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 15 The Part I Unified Rate Review Template an d the 2013 Rate Review Process OHIC Template do not demonstrate the process used by Milliman to develop the rates. Rather, it represents information required by Federal and State regulation s to be provided in support of the review of rate increases, for certification of qualified health plans that the index rate is developed in accordance with Federal regulation and used consistently and only adjusted by the allowable modifiers.

Page 1 NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH PLAN OF RHODE ISLAND Small Group Products Actuarial Memorandum I. SCOPE AND PURPOSE Milliman, Inc. (Milliman) has been retained by Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island (NHPRI) to prepare the premium rates and actuarial memorandum for Small Group products to be offered on the Rhode Island Health Benefit Exchange (RIHBE). This document contains the Part III Actuarial Memorandum for NHPRI's Small Group block of business, effective January 1, 2014. This actuarial memorandum is submitted in conjunction with the Part I Unified Rate Review Template. This actuarial memorandum will also serve as the memorandum to support the 2013 Rate Review Process OHIC Template. The memorandum is intended to demonstrate that the premiums for these products are reasonable in relation to the benefits provided and to demonstrate compliance with regulatory authority. This memorandum may not be appropriate for any other purpose. This actuarial memorandum has been prepared to be included in NHPRI's rate filings and is intended for use by the State of Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC), the Rhode Island Health Benefit Exchange (RIHBE), the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), and their subcontractors to assist in the review of NHPRI's filings. However, we recognize that this certification may become a public document. Milliman makes no representations or warranties regarding th e contents of this letter to third parties. Likewise, third parties are instructed that they are to place no reliance upon this actuarial memorandum prepared for NHPRI by Milliman that would result in the creation of any duty or liability under any theory of law by Milliman or its employees to third parties. The memorandum does not guarantee that the rates will be adequate. Rather, the filing shows that the rates will be adequate if the assumptions underlying their development are realized. Differences between our projections and actual amounts depend on the extent to which future experience conforms to the assumptions made for this analysis. It is certain that actual experience will not conform exactly to the assumptions used in this analysis. Actual amounts will differ from projected amounts to the extent that actual experience deviates from expected experience. II.

The proposed rates within this actuarial memorandum are for new products that are intended to be offered on the RIHBE. NHPRI currently does not offer any products in the commercial health insura nce market. As such, there are no rate adjustments being proposed. IV. EXPERIENCE PERIOD PREMIUM AND CLAIMS Not applicable. NHPRI currently does not offer any products in the commercial health insurance market. Because of this, no relevant experience base d premium and/or claims data is available. The premium rates and corresponding factors proposed in this memorandum are based on a manual rate development process. V. BENEFIT CATEGORIES Not applicable. As no relevant data was available for the purpose of developing premium rates, experience data was not summarized by benefit category. The premium rates and corresponding factors proposed in this memorandum are based on a manual rate development process. VI. PROJECTION FACTORS Not applicable. Factors were not developed for the purpose of projecting experience period allowed claims, since no experience data was available. The premium rates and corresponding factors proposed in this memorandum are based on a manual rate development process. Assumptions for items such as morbidity changes, demographic changes, and trend were considered in developing manual rates as described in Section VII. VII. CREDIBILITY MANUAL RATE DEVELOPMENT NHPRI currently does not offer any products in the commercial health insurance market, which results in no experience data being available. For this reason, the premium rates and corresponding factors proposed in this memorandum are solely based on the ma nual rate development process. In order to estimate premium rates for NHPRI products, the following steps were performed. These steps outline the premium development process including Population Assumptions (including morbidity), Claim Costs, Administr ative Expenses, Risk Adjustment Transfer, and Federal Transitional Reinsurance. While some of these items may fall outside of the scope of manual rate development, it is important to understand the process in its entirety. A. Step 1: Project Statewide Marke t Members and Health Status by Population Cohort We anticipate shifts in the insured population when the Rhode Island Health Benefit Exchange opens in 2014. We projected Rhode Island statewide members and their health status to help determine NHPRI's sha re of the market, the morbidity of their members, and NHPRI's risk adjustment receipts or payments . Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 3 For the purpose of projecting Rhode Island membership, a population projection model developed by Milliman's Indianapolis Health Practice (the Model) was u tilized. This model estimates the calendar year 2011 insurance market population and applies assumptions in order to project the developed population to future years. Estimated insurance market population counts are divided into cohorts that represent a combination of age, gender, household income (measured as percent of the Federal Poverty Level), and self -reported health status. Insurance coverage's incorporated in the model include Medicaid, Medicare, Individual Insured, Small Group Insured, Large Gro up Insured, Self -Funded, Employer Part -Time, Employer Retiree, and Uninsured. For each type of insurance coverage, enrollment is estimated by percent of Federal Poverty Level, Age, and Gender. Additionally, morbidity assumptions for both the baseline per iod and projection period are estimated. The model uses the latest data available from multiple public and proprietary sources in order to understand the current market population by insurance coverage, age, gender, percent of Federal Poverty Level (FPL), health status, and Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). The data utilized by the Model is comprised of public data sources outlined below. Current Population Survey (CPS) data - This data, which is updated monthly, provides us with demographic information by insurance coverage, age, FPL, and health status. In order to obtain a credible sample size, CPS data from 2009 through 2011 is summarized. In situations where CPS sample size credibility is a concern, state data is blended with the corresponding HHS regional data to further enhance credibility in modeling results. American Community Survey (ACS) data - Because of a larger sample size, ACS data is used in order to provide more accurate enrollment counts by insurance coverage, age, gender, and FPL. Th is population count data is merged with the CPS data by health status in order to obtain a detailed estimate of the current population. MLR data - Publically available 2011 Medical Loss Ratio Reporting Form data (MLR) is used in order to determine the curr ent number of covered lives by insurance segment (Individual, Small Group, Large Group). This data also provides insight on claims and premiums per member per month (PMPM) for these insurance segments. In addition to the data sources described above, the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines TM (HCG) and Milliman Medical Underwriting GuidelinesTM (MUG) are utilized. These sources provide insight into items such as relative claims cost by age, gender, and health status. Pairing the HCG and MUG data with the publicly available data sources enables the Model to produce age/gender and morbidity esti mates for the population. Each of the data sources outlined plays a specific role in understanding the current population. The methodology implemented within the model is outlined below. The CPS data is utilized to estimate the percent of the population in Excellent, Very Good, Good, and Fair/Poor Health Status. ACS data is utilized to estimate the population breakdown by insurance coverage, age, gender, FPL, health status, and MSA. MLR d ata is used to understand the size of the insured markets (Individual, Small Group, Large Group), along with estimating current market claims PMPM. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 4 The proportion of the population that will purchase coverage on the RIHBE is then estimated (i.e., \"take- up\"). These take -up rate assumptions are primarily driven by a member's current insurance status (i.e., insured or uninsured) and the federal subsidy available (if any) if the member enrolls in a plan on the RIHBE. We assumed a moderate number of small g roups will purchase coverage through the RIHBE (with or without brokers). This assumption is based, in part, on studies of the Massachusetts and Utah markets that show relatively low take- up in the small group market. We then applied employer -sponsored insurance transition rates and individual/uninsured RIHBE take-up rates to estimate the population counts in each market (stratified by income -to-poverty ratio, health status, and family size). The result is a 2014 population projection by cohort (i.e., age, gender, income, and exchange status). B. Step 2: Project NHPRI Enrollment by Market and Exchange Status NHPRI's expected 2014 Small Group enrollment was projected based on our estimate of the statewide population and market share estimates provided by NH PRI. As NHPRI will only be offering products on the RIHBE, it is assumed that no off exchange enrollment will exist. We estimated the members that would select each of NHPRI's benefit plans based on an assumed distribution of membership by Metal Level . We also assumed that all 2014 members are enrolled for the entire year. C. Step 3: Project Statewide Risk Scores For Use in the Risk Adjustment Transfer Payment For the purpose of estimating NHPRI's risk adjustment transfer payment, the population projecti on model outlined in Step 1 was utilized to project statewide risk scores. This was completed by inferring the health status of the projected insured population by cohort using the self-reported health status field in the CPS data. R elative health status factors for each self - reported health status category, developed based on data available within the MUGs, were inferred based on the proportion of members within each self -reported health status category. These inferred relative health status factors wer e combined with age/gender claim cost factors from the HCGs to produce final statewide average risk scores for each population cohort. D. Step 4: Project NHPRI's Risk Score For Use in the Risk Adjustment Transfer Payment We assumed that NHPRI's risk scores for a given age, gender, and FPL cohort were comparable to the statewide average risk scores for the same cohort. This assumption relies on there being similar Selection and Coding Intensity between NHPRI and the statewide average. Selection refers to th e health status difference between a given carrier and the overall market. Coding Intensity refers to a differing frequency and accuracy with which diagnosis codes are captured in claims data impacting the calculated risk score of the population. We did not model the impact of selection between the metal plans because carriers are not permitted to rate for selection. E. Step 5: Estimate 2014 Statewide Average Claims for the Risk Adjustment Transfer Payments To estimate the statewide premium in NHPRI's risk adjustment transfer payment, the statewide claim costs were estimated using 2011 Medical Loss Ratio Reporting Form (MLR) data. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island is the predominant carrier in Rhode Is land, and as a result, was the focus of this portion of the analysis. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 5 State wide claim cost PMPM was calculated by adjusting for: Trend from 2011 to 2014, The pharmacy and device taxes, Health status changes due to uninsured individuals entering the insured market, Assumed \"richness\" of the plans and the resulting utilization patterns resulting from a given benefit design level, and Additional induced utilization for those enrolling in alternate Silver plans (i.e., those with cost sharing reductions). We are assuming no pent -up demand will occur in the Small Group market. When trending figures within the analysis, a consistent annual trend assumption of 5.8 % was used for each year. F. Step 6: Project NHPRI's 2014 Claim Costs Since no experience is currently available for NHPRI, 2014 claim costs were developed using the Milliman Managed Care Rating Model (MCRM) and the Milliman Prescription Drug Rating Model (RXRM). These models were calibrated to reflect cost and utilization levels appropriate for NHPRI's assumed provider contracting arrangements and enrollment characteristics. Specific considerations included: Reflecting NHPRI's assumed 2014 provider reimbursement rates, Reflecting NHPRI's assumed utilization rates, Adjusting the degree of healthcare management, Reflecting NHPRI's plan designs, and Reflecting results produced through the population modeling work, including assumptions for morbidity changes. These models were used in order to estimate utilization per 1,000 and average cost per service for the purpose of developing NHPRI's credibility manual. Finally, we projected claim costs PMPM for every combination of age, gender, metal plan, income level, and exchange status. G. Step 7: Add Administrative Expenses Administrative expenses were added to NHPRI's claim costs, including: General Administrative Expenses, Commercial Reinsurance Premium Net of Recoveries, Quality Improvement/Information Technology, Premium Tax, Comparative Effectiveness Research, Reinsurance Operating Fee, Risk Adjustment Admin Fee, and Contribution to Surplus. Additional details related to administrative expenses can be found in Section XI, Non -Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 6 H. Step 8: Add Estimated Federal Transitional Reinsurance Expenses Additional costs or savings due to the Federal transitional reinsurance program were estimated. Differences exist between the markets since only the individual market is eligible for transitional reinsurance. It was assumed that NHPRI would pay $5.25 PMPM in reinsurance contributions. No reinsurance recoveries are assumed for the Small Group market. Additional details related to Federal Transitional Reinsurance can be found in Section X, Risk Adjusters and Reinsurance. I. Step 9: Estimate NHPRI 's Risk Adjustment Transfer Payment NHPRI's risk adjustment transfer payment was estimated using the CMS formula, which includes the statewide average premium, induced demand factor, geographical cost factor, NHPRI's risk score by plan, the plan's actuari al value, and allowable rating factors. The key determinant of whether NHPRI receives or makes a transfer payment is how NHPRI's risk score (normalized across all carriers) compares to the product of the actuarial value and allowable rating factors (norma lized across all carriers). The statewide average premium was estimated by adding expenses to the statewide average claim costs (i.e., Steps 5 and 7). Next, NHPRI's risk score s were normalized from Step 4 to the statewide average risk score by removing the portion of NHPRIs' risk score that can be accounted for through age rating factors, leaving an \"uncompensated risk\" factor. We then multiplied the \"uncompensated risk\" factor by the state average premium PMPM to estimate the net risk adjustment PMPM received or payable by NHPRI. Additional details related to Risk Adjustment can be found in Section X, Risk Adjusters and Reinsurance. J. Step 10: Calculate Composite Required Premium The composite required premium was calculated by summing expected claims, administrative expenses, the net impact of federal reinsurance, and the net impact of state risk adjustment. An additional load was added to account for family policies with more than three members under the age of 21. Lastly, it was verified that no e xpected minimum loss ratio rebates or risk corridor payments we estimate to r esult from the established premium rates. K. Step 11: Calculate Premiums by Rate Cell The composite required premium was divided by the composite of all allowable rating factors across NHPRI's projected block of business by rating cell to determine a base rate. This base rate, in combination with the allowable rating factors, will result in the premium rates charged to enrollees in 2014. Age and plan design are the only allowable rating factors for each cohort in Rhode Island. We developed NHPRI's rating factors to meet the regulatory requirements below: Age factors as specified by law, and Plan factors based on the plan's actuarial value, cost sharing utilization, network, and cost of administration. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 7 VIII. CREDIBILITY OF EXPER IENCE Since no experience data is available, a credibility assumption of 0% was applied. The manual rates developed through the steps outlined under Section VII are the sole basis for the premium rates proposed in this memorandum. IX. PAID TO ALLOWED RATI O The paid to allow ed ratio provided in Worksheet 1 , Section III of the Unified Rate Review Template (URRT) and in \"II Data Collection\" of the 2013 Rate Review Process OHIC Template was developed using the MCRM and RXRM models calibrated for the purpose of developing NHPRI's manual rates. These models were used to develop both paid and allowed claims on a per member per month (PMPM) basis for every combination of age, gender, metal plan, income level, and exchange status. The resulting paid and allowed claims PMPM were weighted based on NHPRI's membership projections in order to arrive at an estimated paid to allowed ratio. X. RISK ADJUSTERS AND REINSURANCE The processes used to estimate risk adjustment and reinsurance were completed in Steps 9 and 8 of the premium development process respectively. A. Risk Adjustment Transfer Payment Estimate NHPRI's risk adjustment transfer payment was estimated using the CMS formula, which includes the statewide average p remium, induced demand factor, geographical cost factor, NHPRI's risk score by plan, the plan's actuarial value, and allowable rating factors. The key determinant of whether NHPRI receives or makes a transfer payment is how NHPRI's risk score (normalized across all carriers) compares to the product of the actuarial value and allowable rating factors (normalized across all carriers). The statewide average premium was estimated by adding expenses to the statewide average claim costs produced in the premium development process (Steps 5 and 7). Next, NHPRI's risk score s (from Step 4 of the premium development process) were normalized to the statewide average risk score and the portion of NHPRIs' risk score that can be accounted for through age rating factors was removed; leaving an \"uncompensated risk\" factor. We then multiplied the \"uncompensated risk\" factor by the state average premium PMPM to estimate the net risk adjustment PMPM received or payable by NHPRI. It is assumed that NHPRI will have a similar level of risk compared to other insurers in the Small Group market. As a result, it is estimated that for NHPRI there will be no risk adjustment received or payable. B. Federal Transitional Reinsurance Estimate Additional costs or savings due to the Federal transitional reinsurance program were estimated. Differences exist between the markets since only the individual market is eligible for transitional reinsurance. It was assumed that NHPRI would pay $5.25 PMPM in reinsurance contributions. No rei nsurance recoveries are assumed for the Small Group market. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 8 XI. NON- BENEFIT EXPENSES AND PROFIT & RISK The proposed rates reflect an administrative load of approximately 21% including General Administrative Expenses, Contribution to Surplus, Taxes and Fees. This load was developed through the use of assumptions provided to Milliman from NHPRI. A. Administrative Expense Load The table below outlines the Administrative Expenses that are reflected in the proposed premium rates. These expenses were developed usi ng assumptions provided to Milliman from NHPRI. All categories are demonstrated as both a PMPM and percent of premium. However, please note that some items were developed and applied on a differen t basis. In these situations, items have been converted to PMPM equivalents or Percent of Premium equivalents as needed for illustrative purposes. Table 1: Administrative Expenses Description PMPM Equivalent Percent of Premium General Administrative Expense $ 39.35 11.4% Commercial Reinsurance Net of Recoveries $ 1.75 0.5% Quality Improvement $ 5.45 1.6% Additional Child Load $ 2.73 0.8% NHPRI will not be paying any broker commissions and, as such, administrative expenses associated with commissions are not reflected. The Additional Child Load is intended to reflect that rates for family policies cannot account for more than three members under the age of 21. A portion of this load will be reflect ed in claims experience in subsequent years (0.6 %), while the remaining portion is intended to account for additional administrative expenses associated with these members. B. Contribution to Surplus & Risk margin The proposed rates reflect 3% of premium be ing allocated to Contribution to Surplus & Risk Margin. This load was applied evenly to all plans being offered by NHPRI. C. Taxes and Fees The table below outlines the Taxes and Fees that are included in the non- benefit expenses. Table 2: Taxes and Fees Description PMPM Equivalent Percent of Premium Premium Tax $ 6.89 2.00% Comparative Effectiveness Research $ 0.17 0.05% Reinsurance Operating Fee $ 0.11 0.03% Risk Adjustment Admin Fee $ 0.08 0.02% Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 9 It is currently understood that there will be no Exchange Operation Fees in Rhode Island for calendar year 2014. Additionally, it is assumed that NHPRI will not be assessed the Health Insurer Tax provided that over 80% of premiums are received for Medicai d. XII. PROJECTED LOSS RATIO The projected loss ratio for NHPRI's Small Group bock of business is approximately 85.3%. This loss ratio is calculated consistently with the Federally prescribed MLR methodology, and reflects the projected loss ratio prior to reflecting any applicable credibility adjustments. A credibility adjusted loss ratio is estimated at approximately 94.5% based on membership projections developed by Milliman with guidance from NHPRI. XIII. INDEX RATE No experience data was made available as NHPRI current does not offer plans in the commercial health insurance market. As such, an index rate for the experience period was not calculated. For the projection period, the index rate was calculated using information produced during the premium rate development process. The index rate provided reflects the estimated total allowed claims divided by total projected member months. The estimate produced reflects the utilization level, demographics, etc. of NHPRI's assumed enrollment. There will be no non -essential health benefits included in NHPRI plans. Because of this, the index rate provided aligns with the projected allowed claims PMPM. Premiums in the Rhode Island small g roup market will be calculated using monthly trend factors. For details related to proposed trend, please see XX, Effective Rate Review Information. In order to arrive at each plan's rate level based on the projected index rate, adjustments for the follo wing items are considered: Cost sharing structure of the plan, Assumed cost sharing utilization of the plan, and Administrative costs. All plans offered have a consistent provider network, utilization management, and delivery system. Additionally, items such as risk adjustment and reinsurance are accounted for consistently on all plans. Also, as previously noted non- essential health benefits will not be offered. Assumptions for cost structure and utilization differences by plan are outlined within Secti on XV, AV Pricing Values. XIV. AV METAL VALUES In the Small Group market, NHPRI intends to offer two plans. Specifically, plans to be offered include the following: One plan at the Gold metal level, One plan at the Silver metal level, Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 10 The AV Metal Values included in Worksheet 2 of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template were based on the Federal AV Calculator. No adjustments to plan cost sharing were needed in order to determine AV using the Federal AV Calculator. While the Federal AV Calculator does no t contain an input for every potential variation in plan designs, it is assumed that the majority of variation between AVs is being captured by the plan characteristics available within the Federal AV Calculator. This assumption is consistent with documentation provided within the Actuarial Value Calculator Methodology document made available by the Department of Health and Human Services. XV. AV PRICING VALUES AV pricing values were developed based on the allowable rating factors for each cohort in Rhode Island. In order to be consistent with the OHIC rate review process, the premium of a plan covering 100% of allowed costs for a 21- year old assuming Silver Metal Level utilization was calculated as the fixed reference plan for basis of the AV Pricing Values. We developed NHPRI's rating factors to meet the regulatory requirements below: Age factors as specified by law, and Plan factors based on the plan's actuarial value, cost sharing utilizati on, network, and cost of administration. There are no assumed network differences between the plans being offered by NHPRI. Also, administrative costs are assumed to be consistent for each offering. However, certain administrative costs are developed on a PMPM basis and thus when demonstrated as a percent of premium they may vary. The MCRM model calibrated for the purpose of developing NHPRI's manual rates was utilized for developing NHPRI's AV Pricing Values. This MCRM model is based on data from the Milliman Health Cost Guidelines TM (HCGs). The HCGs provide a flexible but consistent basis for the determination of claim costs for a wide variety of health benefit plans. These rating structures are used to anticipate future claim levels, evaluate past experience and establish interrelationships between different benefit levels. The HCGs are developed as a result of Milliman's continuing research on health care costs. They were first developed in 1954 and have been updated and expanded annually since t hen. These guidelines are continually monitored as we use them in measuring the experience or evaluating the rates of our clients and as we compare them to other data sources. The HCGs are a cooperative effort of all Milliman health actuaries and represent a combination of their experience, research and judgment. An extensive amount of data is used in developing these guidelines, including published and unpublished data. In most instances, cost assumptions are based upon our evaluation of several data sources and, hence, are not specifically attributable to a single source. Since these guidelines are a proprietary document of Milliman, they are only available for release to specific clients that lease these guidelines and to Milliman consulting h ealth actuaries. We used the calibrated MCRM model to estimate the value of cost -sharing and relative utilization of services for each plan. Our pricing models assume the same demographic and risk characteristics for each plan priced, thereby excluding e xpected differences in the morbidity of members assumed to select the plan. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 11 The table below includes AV Pricing Values for the two plans offered on the Small Group market. Factors are shown separately for utilization and relative AV, the product of which produces the proposed AV Pricing Value. Table 3: Cost Sharing Utilization Factor by Metal Level Metal Level Cost Sharing Utilization Factor Relative AV Factor AV Pricing Value Gold 1.05 0.81 0.85 Silver 1.00 0.71 0.71 XVI. MEMBERSHIP PROJECTIO NS The membership projections were developed in conjunction with NHPRI. These projections reflect market share estimates assumed by NHPRI. Additionally, the projections reflect the total market size estimated in Step 1 of the premium development process. Membership by plan is outlined in the table below. Table 4: Membership by Plan Plan Membership Gold 398 Silver 663 Total 1,061 XVII. TERMINATED PRODUCTS Not applicable. No plans are being terminated as NHPRI currently does not offer products in the Small Group market. XVIII. PLAN TYPE Not applicable. The plan types listed in Worksheet 2, Section I of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template appropriately describe NHPRI's plans. XIX. WARNING ALERTS The following differences between the plan -level projections in Wor ksheet 2 and the total projected amounts found in Worksheet 1 were noted. Explanations regarding these differences are as follows: A warning is listed in cell A82 of Worksheet 2, Plan Product Info. This warning is the result of rounding differences betw een values listed within the workbook. Total Premium is appropriately aligning to the nearest dollar. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 12 XX. EFFECTIVE RATE REVIEW INFORMATION The following section contains additional information and documentation pertaining to the 2013 Rate Review Process OHIC Template. As previously indicated, experience data was not available for the purpose of developing premium rates for NHPRI's products. Because of this, some sections of the OHIC Template have been intentionally left blank. Additionally, methodologies utilized for rate development purposes are consistent with those de scribed in prior sections of this document. This section is intended to capture documentation for information not included within the Part I Unified Rate Review Template. A. Experience Data Part 1. Historical Information Since no experience data was available, Part 1 has not been completed. Part 2. Prospective Information Since no experience data was available, sections A and C have not been completed. Section B was completed using assumptions consistent with the premium rate development process outlined in Section VII of this memorandum. The Expected Pure Medical Cost Ratio was calculated as estimated total claims PMPM divided by projected total premium PMPM . This calculatio n is not intended to be consistent with the Federally prescribed MLR methodology , and does not include the impact of Federal Reinsurance or Risk Adjustment . Administrative cost percentages are consistent with values shown in Section XI of this memorandum , yet are allocated to the prescribed categories. B. Data Collection Information contained in this section and corresponding documentation is consistent with values shown within the Part I Unified Rate Review Template; however, it contains two additional i tems. Base EHB Rate for Projection Period This value was calculated by adjusting the Index Rate to reflect the premium of a plan covering 100% of allowed cost for a 21- year old enrollee assuming Silver Metal Level utilization . To accomplish this, composit e age and cost sharing utilization factors were calculated. A description of the methodology used to calculate cost sharing utilization factors is available within Section XV of this memorandum. Additional supporting calculations have been provided within the 2013 Rate Review OHIC Template. Monthly Effective Date Projection Factor An annual premium trend rate of 6% is being proposed. Given that experience data is not available this value is intended to represent a trend level consistent with a standard commercial market. Additionally, the information requested in rows 47 and 48 of this tab is not identical to the corresponding section of the Part 1 Unified Rate Review Template. The primary difference is that the Federal template requests 'Taxes & Fees' while the 2013 OHIC Template specifically requests 'Premium Tax'. To account for this variation, Taxes and Fees other than Premium Tax have been included in the 'Administrative Expense Load' field. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 13 C. Plan Rates All products are new for 2014; therefore, 2013 values have been left blank within this tab. Metallic Tier Actuarial Value was calculated in an identical manner as outlined in Section XIV, AV Metal Values. AVs provided within this section align with values shown in Worksheet 2 of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template. Additionally, the Proposed Plan Relativity Factors are consistent with the values outlined in Section XV, AV Pricing Values. A description and supporting information for these values can be found within aforementioned sections of this memorandum. Membership for 1/1/2014 was estimated using membership projections as outlined in XVI, Membership Projections. As outlined within the premium development process, publically available survey data was used for the purpose of understanding the current population. Projections were performed at the member level as data was not available at the group and/or subscriber level in the available survey data. For this reason, columns R and S have not been completed. For the small group market, since data is not available it is assumed that all groups will be effective on January 1, 2014. The proposed base rate PMPM reflects the premium of a plan covering 100% of allowed claims for a 21-year old enrollee with utilization set at the Silver Metal Level. This figure aligns with the base EHB ra te shown in the second tab of the template. Pediatric Dental benefits will not be offered. Each member's rate can be calculated as the product of the EHB Base Rate, the AV Pricing Value, and the appropriate Age Factor. Please note that AV Pricing Values were developed in a different manner, yet presented as a percentage of the EHB Base Rate for filing purposes. D. Administrative Costs As outlined in Section XI of this memorandum, administrative costs were developed through the use of assumptions provided to Milliman from NHPRI. Prior year administrative cost data is not available due to NHPRI currently not offering products in the commercial market. Administrative costs were broken down in to the applicable categories through the use of assumptions provi ded to Milliman from NHPRI. It is currently understood that there will be no Exchange Operation Fees in Rhode Island for calendar year 2014. Additionally, it is assumed that NHPRI will not be assessed the Health Insurer Tax provided that over 80% of pr emiums are received for Medicaid. Additional details related to administrative costs can be found in Section XI, Non- Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk. XXI. RELIANCE In developing the premium rates in this actuarial memorandum, I relied on data and other information provided by NHPRI. I have not audited or verified this data and other information. If the underlying data or information is inaccurate or incomplete, the results of the analysis may likewise be inaccurate or incomplete. I performed a limited review of the data used directly in the analysis for reasonableness and consistency and have not found material defects in the data. If there are material defects in the data, it is possible that they would be uncovered by a detailed, systematic review and comparison of the data to search for data values that are questionable or for relationships that are materially inconsistent. Such a review was beyond the scope of my assignment. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 14 XXII. ACTUARIAL CERTIFICAT ION I, Jeremy D. Palmer, am a member of the American Academy of Actuaries and meet its qualification standards for actuaries issuing statements of actuarial opinion in the United States. I have been retained by Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island (the \"Company\") to prepare this filing. I am a ffiliated with Milliman, Inc. (\"Milliman\"), an independent actuarial consulting firm that is not affiliated with, nor a subsidiary, nor in any way owned or controlled by a health plan, health insurer, or a trade association of health plans or insurers. I hereby certify that the projected index rate is, to the best of my knowledge and understanding: In compliance with all applicable State and Federal Statutes and Regulations (45 CFR 156.80(d)(1)) . Developed in compliance with the applicable Actuarial Standards of Practice. Reasonable in relation to the benefits provided and the population anticipated to be covered Neither excessive nor deficient . I certify that the index rate and only the allowable modifiers as described in 45 CFR 156.80(d)(1) and 45 CFR 156.80(d)(2) were used to generate plan level rates. The allowable modifiers used to generate plan -level rates were: The actuarial value and cost -sharing design of the plan. The plan's provider network, delivery system characteristics, and utilization management practices. Administrative costs, excluding Exchange user fees. I certify that the percent of total premium that represents essential health benefits included in Worksheet 2, Sections III and IV were calculated in accordance with relevant actuar ial standards of practice. I certify that the benefits included within Neighborhood's plans are substantially equivalent to the Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) in the State of Rhode Island's benchmark plans. I certify that any benefit substitutions are : Actuarially equivalent to the benefits being replaced, Are made within only the same essential health benefit category, Are based on a standardized plan population , Are determined regardless of cost -sharing, Are not prescription drug benefits, and Are based on an analysis performed in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and methodologies. I certify that the AV Calculator was used to determine the AV Metal Values shown in Worksheet 2 of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template for all plans except those specified in the certification. The AV Metal Values included in Worksheet 2 of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template were based on the Federal AV Calculator. No adjustments to plan cost sharing were needed in order to determine AV using the Federal AV Calculator. While the Federal AV Calculator does not contain an input for every potential variation in plan designs, it is assumed that the majority of variation between AVs is being captured by the plan characteristics available wi thin the Federal AV Calculator. This assumption is consistent with documentation provided within the Actuarial Value Calculator Methodology document made available by the Department of Health and Human Services. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island Actuarial Memorandum Milliman, Inc. Page 15 The Part I Unified Rate Review Template an d the 2013 Rate Review Process OHIC Template do not demonstrate the process used by Milliman to develop the rates. Rather, it represents information required by Federal and State regulation s to be provided in support of the review of rate increases, for certification of qualified health plans that the index rate is developed in accordance with Federal regulation and used consistently and only adjusted by the allowable modifiers.

To accomplish this mission, Neighborhood offers low-cost health insurance coverage through Rhode Island programs such as RIte Care and Rhody Health Partners. Neigh borhood 's vision is for everyone in Rhode Island to have comprehensive healthcare coverage and access to high -quality health care. In service of this vision, beginning in 2014 , we are pleased to be able to offer health insurance products to small groups in Rhode Island through the Rhode Island Health Benefit Exchange (RIHBE). Milliman, Inc. (Milliman) was retained by Neighborhood to prepare the premium rates for small group products to be offered on the RIHBE. Since Neighborhood has not offered product s in the commercial health insurance market prior to 2014, experience data was not available for developing premium rates. Because of this, t he premium rates and rating factors for these products were developed from information published in the Milliman Health Cost GuidelinesTM and from information provided by Neighborhood. Neighborhood is sensitive to healthcare affordability concerns. We believe that the premium rates being proposed for these plans are appropriate in relation to the benefits and pro visions offered . Administrative expenses, including contributions to surplus, taxes and fees will represent approximately 21% of premium. The projected credibility adjusted loss ratio for these new products is 94.5% , which is well above the federal minim um loss ratio. Differences between our projections and actual amounts depend on the extent to which future experience conforms to the assumptions made for this analysis. It is certain that actual experience will not conform exactly to the assumptions us ed in this analysis. Neighborhood looks forward to expanding upon its mission, and working with the state to toward delivering affordable health care for all Rhode Islanders.

You are responsible for copayments, deductibles , and the difference between the maximum benefit and our allowance , if any, which may apply to a covered health care service . Network providers agree not to bill, charge, collect a deposit from, or in any way seek reimbursement from you for a covered health care service , except for the copayments , deductibles, and the di fference between the maximum benefit and our allowance , if any, which may apply to a covered health care service. It is your obligation to pay a network provider your copayment, deductible, and the difference between the maximum benefit and our allowance . If you do not pay the network provider , the provider may decline to provide current or future services to you. The provider may pursue payment from you. See Section 1.9 - Your Responsibility to Pay Your Providers for more information. Not all of the individual providers at a network facility will be network providers . It is your responsibility to make sure that each provider from whom you receive care is in the network . However, if you receive certain types of services at a network facility, and there are covered health care services provided with those services by a non-network provider outside of your control, you will be reimbursed for such covered health care services . The types of services this applies to are: inpatient admissions a t a network facility under the direction of a network physician; outpatient services performed at a network facility by a network physician; AND emergency room services at a network facility. 5.2 How Non -Network Providers Are Paid You are responsible for paying all charges from a non-network provider. You are liable for the difference between the amount that the non-network health care provider bills and the payment we make for covered health care services. Generally, we send reimbursement to you; but, we do reserve the right to reimburse a non-network provider directly. We reimburse you or a non-network provider up to the maximum benefit or our allowance , less any copayments and deductibles which may apply to a covered health care service. We reimburse non-network provider services using the same guidelines we use to pay network providers . Generally, our payment for non-network provider services will not be more than the amount we pay for network provider services. Payments we make to you are personal. Y ou cannot transfer or assign any of your right to receive payments under this agreement to another person or organization.

In these situations, you may be liable for the difference between the amount that the non-network health care provider bills and the payment we will make for the covered services as set forth in this paragraph.COB GRP (09/10) 6.0 HOW WE COORDINATE YOUR BENEFITS WHEN YOU ARE COVERED BY MORE THAN ONE PLAN Introduction This Coordination of Benefits (\"COB\") provision applies when you or your covered dependents have health care benefits under more than one plan. We follow the COB rules of payment issued by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The COB rules have been adopted by the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC). From time to time these rules may change before we issue a revised Certificate of Coverage . We use the COB regulations in effect at the time of coordination to determine benefits available to you under this agreement . If this provision applies, the order of benefit determination rules as stated in this section will determine whether we pay benefits before or after the benefits of another plan. 6.1 Definitions The following definitions apply to Section 6: ALLOWABLE EXPENSE means the necessary, reasonable and customary item of expense for health care which is: covered at least in part under one or more plans covering the person for whom the claim is made; AND incurred while this agreement is in force. When a plan provides health care benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service is considered as both an allowable expense and a benefit paid. BENEFITS means any treatment, facility, equipment, drug, device, supply or service for which you receive reimbursement under a plan. CLAIM means a request that benefits of a plan be provided or paid. PLAN means any health care insurance benefit package provided by an organization as defined in Section 8.0 - Glossary. PRIMARY PLAN means a plan whose b enefits for a person's health care coverage must be determined without taking the existence of any other plan into consideration. SECONDARY PLAN means a plan which is not a primary plan . 6.2 When You Have More Than One Agreement with Neighboorhood Health P lan of Rhode Island If you are covered under more than one agreement with us, you are entitled to covered benefits under both agreements . If one agreement has a benefit that the other(s) does not, you are entitled to coverage under the agreement that has the benefit . The total payments you receive will never be more than the total cost for the services you receive. How We Coordinate Your Benefits When You Are Covered By More Than One Plan 67 COB GRP (09/10) 6.3 When You Are Covered By More Than One Insurer Covered benefits provided under any other plan will always be paid before the benefits under our plan if that insurer does not use a similar coordination of benefits rule to determine coverage. The plan without the coordin ation of benefits provision will always be the primary plan. Benefits under another plan include all benefits that would be paid if claims had been submitted for them. If you are covered by more than one plan and both insurers use similar coordination of benefits rules to determine coverage, we use the following conditions to determine which plan covers you first: whether you are the main subscriber or a dependent; if married, whether you or your spouse was born earlier in the year; OR length of time each spouse has been covered. (1 Non-Dependent/Dependent - If you are covered under a plan and you are the main subscriber , the benefits of that plan will be determined before the benefits of a plan which covers you as a dependent. If, however, you are a Medicare beneficiary, then, in some instances, Medicare will be Secondary and the plan which covers you as the main subscriber or as a dependent will provide the benefits first. If one of your dependents covered unde r this agreement is a student, the benefits of any other coverage available because of student enrollment (except accident -only type coverage) will be determined before the benefits under this agreement. (2 Dependent Child/Parents Not Separated or Divorced - If dependent children are covered under separate plans of more than one person (i.e. \"parents\" or individuals acting as \"parents\"), the benefits of the plan covering the parent born earlier in the year will be determined before those of the parent whose bi rthday falls later in the year. If both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the plan which covered the parent longer are determined before those of the plan which covered the other parent for a shorter period of time. The term \"birthday\" only r efers to the month and day in a calendar year , not the year in which the person was born. If the other plan does not determine benefits according to the parents' birth dates, but by parents' gender instead, the other plan's gender rule will determine the order of benefits . (3 Dependent Child/Parents Separated or Divorced - If two or more plans cover a person as a dependent child of divorced or separated parents, the plan responsible to cover benefits for the child will be determ ined in the following order: first, the plan of the parent with custody of the child; then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child; AND finally, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child. If the terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, and the entity obligated to pay or provide the parent's benefits under that parent's plan has actual knowledge of those terms, the benefi ts of that plan are determined first and the benefits of the plan of the other parent are the secondary plan . How We Coordinate Your Benefits When You Are Covered By More Than One Plan 68 COB G RP (09/10) If the terms of a court decree state that the parents share joint custody, without stating that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, the plans covering the child will follow the order of benefit determination rules o utlined in Section 6.3 (2) above. (4 Active/Inactive Employee - If you are covered under another health plan as an employee (not laid off or retired), your benefits and those of your dependents under that plan will be determined before benefits under this plan. (5 Longer/Shorter Length of Coverage - If none of the above rules determine the order of benefits , the benefits of the plan which covered a member or subscriber longer are determined before those of the plan which covered that person for the shorter term. In general, if you use more benefits than you are covered for during a benefit period, the following formula is used to determine coverage: The insurer covering you first will cover you up to its allowance.
