We also understand th at responding to this long-term incident may affect your mental health, morale, and resilience. In this issue ASPR TRACIE strives to collect and share the most valuable, timely, and helpful information for you and your colleagues and offer the following resources to address healthcare worker mental health and resilience: The COVID-19 Behavioral Health Resource Collection includes a section on Self-Care and Resilience Resources for Responders and Healthcare Workers. The Behavioral Health Compendium can help Regional Emergency Coordinators and federal and state planners better understand how programs with behavioral health components (e.g., steady state programs, grants, certain HHS programs, waivers and flexibilities) can support the pandemic response. ASPR TRACIE Mini Modules to Relieve Stress for Healthcare Workers Responding to COVID-19 are designed for healthcare workers in all settings, but primarily hospital-based providers, staf f, and leaders dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. These resources, coupled with the Mental and Behavioral Health and Online Training Webinars and Peer-to-Peer Sessions sections of ASPR's COVID-19 webpage , can help our partners, stakeholders, and the general population bolster mental health and resilience. The articles in this issue of The Exchange focus on three categories: understanding acute and chronic stressors in the healthcare worker population, identifying at-risk employees, and promising practices in building resilience. The articles feature authors at all levels of government who represent urban, suburban, and rural areas of the country. In the spirit of planning for and responding to the 2020-2021 influenza season and other potential concurrent incidents, I encourage you to visit ASPR TRACIE's Natural Disasters Topic Collection , and continue to monitor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's pages on 2019 Novel Coronavirus and Influenza and ASPR TRACIE's Novel Coronavirus Resources Page . ASPR TRACIE develops resources in conjunction with partners, stakeholders, and other subject matter experts who have direct experiences in the field. Please share your own promising practices, lessons learned, or requests for technical assistance about COVID-19 so that others may learn from your experiences. As always, we welcome your feedback. Jack Herrmann MSEd, NCC, LMHC Acting Director, National Healthcare Preparedness Program, HHS ASPR If you are experiencing the stressful effects of this pandemic and need more immediate assistance, please reach out to SAMHSA's Disaster Distress Helpline (1-800-985-5990) or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK). Both are available 24/7, 365 days a year.WELCOME TO ISSUE 1 2! The last issue of The Exchange focused on lessons learned during COVID-19 (with articles on patient surge, safety and staff health, operational considerations, and telehealth). In the months that have passed since a pandemic was declared, we have witnessed our nation's healthcare providers working tirelessly to care for patients, with surges testing their facilities' and their own personal resilience. This kind of work is grueling and can take a significant toll on physical and mental health. ASPR TRACIE has had the honor of working with subject matter experts (SMEs) to gather and share timely information throughout the pandemic. We recognize that many of our stakeholders work in healthcare facilities and may be feeling overwhelmed by the work and the amount of information coming out. It is our goal to develop new and share with you existing articles, tools, quick sheets, and templates\u2014all vetted by SMEs\u2014that can help you identify and address risk and the negative mental health effects of stress in yourselves, your colleagues, and your staff. We encourage you to continue to visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Coronavirus (COVID-19) pag e for clinical information and our Novel Coronavirus Resources page for updates. Your feedback is what makes us successful\u2014please contact us with your comments, questions, technical assistance needs, and resources to share. We look forward to our continued collaboration. Shayne DirectorCorina Sol\u00e9 Brito, Communications Manager and Technical Resources Lead Bridget Kanawati, Assistance Center LeadJennifer Nieratko, Special Projects ManagerAT A GLANCE 5 Acute and Chronic Stressors What short- and longer-term stressors are associated with the COVID-19 pandemic? These articles list and define the stressors healthcare workers faced in the initial months of the pandemic, during patient surges, and on a continuing basis. 6Identifying At-Risk Employees Stress can manifest in a variety of ways; the articles in this section define the concept of risk and highlight strategies for recognizing and managing the negative behaviors and mental health issues associated with stress. 7Building Resilience: What Works? There are many ways to care for staff and for staff to bolster their own resilience. These articles highlight a few that are specific to the stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (but can also be applied to life outside of work). 8SummaryWHAT'S NEW WITH ASPR? The last issue of The Exchange focused on lessons learned during COVID-19. In the months that have passed, our nation's scientists have been working nonstop to develop therapeutics and vaccines to fight this novel virus. HHS Secretary Azar renewed the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Declaration on October 2; the Emergency Declaration regarding the opioid crisis was renewed on October 8 . Check out the PHE overview and frequently asked questions (FAQ) to learn more about public health emergency declarations. In September, many communities fought wildfires and ASPR's Division of Critical Infrastructure Protection issued Five Ways to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19 during Wildfire Response Operations . BARDA reported on New Medical Countermeasures in Burn Care and how they could enhance patient outcomes. By October, more than 50 million BARDA-supported COVID-19 diagnostic tests had been shipped to communities across the country. BARDA also announced a $31 million agreement with Cytiva to expand the company's manufacturing capacity for products that are essential in producing COVID-19 vaccines (e.g., cell culture media, cell culture buffers, mixer bags, and XDR bioreactors). ASPR also provided guidance to help persons with disabilities return to the community after a COVID-19 diagnosis. In November, bamlanivimab, a monoclonal antibody treatment for COVID-19 from Eli Lilly and Company, received Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ; ASPR had previously purchase d 300,000 doses of the treatment and after EUA immediately announced an allocation process. This page describes this antibody treatment and the allocation and distribution process. Later that month, members of the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) Trauma and Critical Care Team deployed to El Paso to support medical professionals with intubated COVID-19 patients. Visit the ASPR homepage , and blog and follow us on LinkedIn , Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to learn more about how ASPR is working to strengthen the nation's ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from emergencies. 5 Acute and Chronic Stressors Healthcare workers encounter short - and longer-term stressors during nearly every incident that requires patient care. What is different about a pandemic, however, is the duration of the incident (ongoing) and the threat that a relatively new virus poses to us all, regardless of occupation, socioeconomic status, or community . This section highlights those and other stressors unique to COVID-19 and how to recognize them in yourself, you colleagues, and your staff. EXPERIENCES FROM THE FIELD Coping on the Front Lines of a Pandemic: Understanding and Managing COVID-19 Stressors Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the nature and frequency of stressors experienced by the healthcare workforce have increased exponentially. Rachel Kaul, the Behavioral Health Lead for ASPR EMMO, shares how to recognize and mitigate these stressors while bolstering resilience. Pandemic Workforce Well-being: Recognizing Stressors and Supporting Our Own The Mount Sinai Hospital System is comprised of eight hospitals and numerous urgent care and outpatient locations across New York City. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the system and its staff was overwhelmed by patient surge. Dr. Jonathan Ripp (Chief Wellness Officer, Mount Sinai Health System, Dean for Well-Being and Resilience, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Co-Chair, Collaborative for Healing and Renewal in Medicine (CHARM)) and Dr. Brendan Carr (Professor and System Chair of Emergency Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Mount Sinai Health System) shared how they developed new and maximized existing programs to ensure the system recognized and helped mitigate the unprecedented type and level of stress encountered by healthcare workers. Understanding Stress and Taking Care of Each Other (and, In Turn, Ourselves) Dr. Patricia Watson is a psychologist at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). For more than 20 years, she has focused on high stress occupations (e.g., first responders, healthcare workers) and the importance of peer support and self-care. ASPR TRACIE asked Dr. Watson to explain risk factors for stress and PTSD in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and strategies for identifying and managing these and other negative behavioral health effects.SUMMARY6 ADDITIONAL ASPR TRACIE RESOURCES Behavioral Health Speaker Series Disaster Behavioral Health Self Care for Healthcare Workers Modules Mini Modules to Relieve Stress for Healthcare Workers Responding to COVID-19 ADDITIONAL RESOURCES Moral Injury in Healthcare Workers Moral Injury (National Center for PTSD) Behavioral Health Practices Shown to be Effective in Healthcare Settings During the COVID Response Pandemic Workforce Well-Being: A Comprehensive Toolkit for Supporting Our Own During COVID-19 Health Care Workers Ask Therapist: 'Why Aren't More People Taking This Seriously?'While this issue of The Exchange focuses on acute and chronic stressors, identifying at-risk employees, and fostering resilience, it is important to understand these are somewhat artificial distinctions; they are actually interrelated concepts. Though it is helpful to segment them for the purposes of highlighting key factors in each, it is important to understand how they are related in order to craft a comprehensive understanding and strategy to optimize healthcare worker mental health. Brian Flynn, Ed.D. and Dr. Joshua Morganstein, Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress7 Identifying At-Risk Employees Once we understand the stressors associated with COVID-19, recognizing their negative mental health effects on ourselves and our colleagues becomes easier. The resources in this section can help you identify \"at-risk\" employees and provide a segue the third category of this newsletter: resilience. SUMMARY EXPERIENCES FROM THE FIELD Supporting Health and Behavioral Health Professionals in Times of Disaster: Reflections on \"At-Risk Employees\" What is unique about the pandemic and its contribution to our country's actual and perceived risk? Brian W. Flynn, Ed.D., RADM, USPHS, Ret., Associate Director for Health Systems, Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress, Adjunct Professor, and Joshua C. Morganstein, MD, CAPT, USPHS, Associate Director Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress, Associate Professor and Assistant Chair, both from the Department of Psychiatry, Uniformed Services University, offer a unique view on risk, how it may be manifested in this unprecedented time, and important steps in risk mitigation to enhance sustainment. Note: In this article, we use the term \"healthcare worker\" to refer to those involved in providing behavioral and physical healthcare. As this and other recent disasters have shown, support staff (e.g., housekeeping, logistics, maintenance, information technology , nutrition) are also being impacted in many of the same ways, and it is critical that they be included in organization-wide resilience-building efforts. Support for Overstretched Clinicians During the Ongoing Pandemic: Literature and Practice Eileen Barrett, MD, MPH, SFHM MACP, is the Director of Graduate Medical Education at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine's Office of Professional Wellbeing. In this article, she highlights select journal articles and practical resources clinicians and healthcare enterprise leaders can consider to bolster healthcare worker mental health care and individual and organizational resilience.

Everything we were doing, we were doing for the first time. During COVID-19, we noted three categories of major stressors (fear for basic needs, uncertainty, and processing) and did our best to address those using existing and new strategies. Dr. Jonathan Ripp, Mount Sinai Health System9 Building Resilience: What Works? When we understand stressors and what being at-risk looks and feels like, we can appreciate the plethora of resources available that can bolster healthcare worker response. The articles in this section highlight traditional and alternative strategies our stakeholders use to ensure healthcare workers and systems remain as strong as possible during the pandemic. SUMMARY EXPERIENCES FROM THE FIELD Total Force Fitness through HOPE: Applying Warrior Principles to Healthcare The Consortium for Health and Military Performance (CHAMP) is a Center of Excellence at the Department of Defense's Uniformed Services University. CHAMP uses the \"Total Force Fitness\" approach and \"HOPE\" framework tooptimize the performance of military service members and their loved ones. Dr . Gloria Park (Director of Performance Psychology) and Dr. Gabe Paoletti (Mental Fitness Scientist) have worked to apply these principles to healthcareworkers on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic. Plan, Do, Check, Act: Managing COVID-19 in New Orleans In June 2020, ASPR TRACIE hosted the webinar Ensuring Healthcare Safety Throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic to allow speakers to share lessons learned in adjusting care delivery , the role of leaders, and how rounding was changed to ensure workforce safety during COVID-19. Tracey Moffatt, RN, MHA, System Nursing Officer and VicePresident of Quality, from Ochsner Health (in New Orleans, LA) shared her experiences with ensuring staff protectionand resilience; she provided ASPR TRACIE with an update in October 2020. Adding Alternatives: Complementary Practices and Considerations Caring for others in a pandemic can wreak havoc on our minds and bodies. ASPR TRACIE met with Eleni Fredlund, MS, LMHC, ADS, the director of the New Mexico Integrative Wellness Medical Reserve Corps, to learn more about their deployment to support patients and healthcare workers affected by COVID-19 using Chinese medicine coupledwith Psychological First Aid and other types of emotional support.10 ADDITIONAL ASPR TRACIE RESOURCES Behavioral Health Speaker Series COVID-19 Workforce Resilience/Sustainability Resources ADDITIONAL RESOURCES Behavioral Health Practices Shown to be Effective in Healthcare Settings During the COVID Response Promoting Resilience & Recovery from the Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic SAMHSA Tip Sheets for Disaster Responders Emergency Responder Self-Care Plan: Behavioral Health PPEIf you can help people acknowledge that they have made their way through something very difficult, find some meaningful structure and have positive social support, and create little toeholds where they can make a difference and be helpful to others and themselves, that can hopefully help reduce stress reactions and moral distress and increase sense of safety, calm, connectedness, self-efficacy and hope. Dr. Patricia Watson11 Summary Traditionally, the impact of disasters on healthcare and other frontline worker mental health has not received much attention for a myriad of reasons. Over the past several years, however , as disasters increased in number and severity , we have learned that acknowledging stress, promoting and supporting resilience building, encouraging breaks, and providing resources (e.g., buddy systems, wellness check-ins, information about stress responses and constructive strategies, and professional support when needed) before, during, and after an incident is critical to ensuring staf f experience the least negative impacts possible. COVID-19 has presented healthcare with a unique set of challenges: constrained resources, a highly infectious, novel pathogen that poses a significant threat to the health of providers and support staf f, large numbers of critically ill patients and deaths\u2014often with only the caregivers to accompany the patient in their final moments\u2014limited PPE and therapeutics, restricted social interactions, and a protracted timeline with no clear end in sight. These challenges have contributed to unprecedented mental health impacts among healthcare workers. Highly publicized suicides are the tip of the iceberg. Surges in healthcare worker stress and related symptoms accompany surges of patients in overwhelmed hospitals. Self-reported anxiety, depression, and burnout have sharply increased. To preserve our workforce, we must ensure that mental health is incorporated throughout the incident management process and the entire system/facility during COVID-19 and beyond. There is no such thing as providing too much information or offering too much support to our healthcare workers. Making them feel valued and empowering them to participate in \"intra-action\" reviews where they can suggest improvements in policies and practices, and providing numerous opportunities to build individual and team resilience (including self-analysis, mindfulness and other stress-reduction and self-care practices; providing psychological first aid training to enable them to support their team members) can help blunt the ef fects of the response. Further , identifying particular high- risk stressors (e.g., attending many deaths or procedures, uncertainty over personal health and job security , fatigue, long stretches of shifts, family illness or related issues) and job categories (e.g., critical care, chaplaincy , and the emergency department) can be helpful when choosing stress-reducing resources and approaches. Thanks to all of you who are committed to fighting this pandemic and to supporting each other in the process.
