General Guidance on Repeat Dosing with BAT\u00ae The data for administration of a second dose of BAT\u00ae during a single episode of botulism is limited. Typically a second dose or vial is not recommended as one vial of BAT\u00ae contains enough antitoxin to cover all \"naturally\" occurring foodborne botulism. Other exposures, such as with an intentional release, could have higher toxin loads; special treatment guidance will be given in those situations. Clinical situations that may require an additional dose of BAT\u00ae are those where C. botulism organism might continue to be present in the body and elaborating toxin, such as with: Wound botulism Adult intestinal colonization Please consult with the Section of Epidemiology, CDC, or an infectious disease specialist PRIOR to using a second vial for specifics on dosing and intervals. Report all suspected cases of botulism immediately to: Section of Epidemiology 907-269-8000 during business hours 1-800 -478-0084 after hoursUpdated 8/1/2018 for use of BAT\u00ae (Botulinum Antitoxin ) Botulism is both a medical and public health emergency. As soon as patients are stable, any suspected case of botulism should be immediately reported to the Alaska Section of Epidemiology : call 907 -269-8000 during business hours or 1-800-478-0084 after hours . In March 201 3, FDA licensed the use of BAT\u00ae for use in managing cases of suspected botulism. Prior to this, the product (H-BAT) was under an investigational new drug (IND) protocol for treatment o f suspected cases. BAT\u00ae contains antitoxins to treat botulism types A -G, including E, which is the most common type in Alaska. One vi al of BAT\u00ae is supplied in this botulism treatment kit. This document contains specific instructions for using BAT\u00ae. Overview of treatment plan 1. Obtain clinical specimen s (blood, stool, vomitus) for botuli num toxin testing. 2. Save suspected food. 3. Administer BAT\u00ae per package insert instructions . Closely monitor patient for any symptoms of anaphylactic symptoms ; have resuscitative measures available. Detailed, step -by-step instructions 1. PRIOR to administration of BAT\u00ae, draw 15-20 cc of whole blood most often into multiple tubes ; enough to result in 10cc of serum. Ask your laboratory to separate off the serum and hold the serum in the refrigerator pending instructions from the Section of Epidemiology (SOE) . 2. Whenever possible, obtain stool, vomitus, and gastric contents for botulism testing. Send these clinical specimens to your laboratory and ask them to be hel d pending instructions from SOE . 3. Save any suspect food items brought to the hospital by the patient /family member(s). Food should be refrigerated, sent to your laboratory, and held pending instructions from SOE . 4. If BAT\u00ae is received frozen, it can be thawed expeditiously at 37\u00b0C (99\u00b0F) in a warm water bath (instead of in a refrigerator at 2\u00b0C8\u00b0C [3 6\u00b0F46\u00b0F]). See package insert for specific details on storage, handling and dilution into 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (USP) for infusion. 5. Sensitivity testing is no longer required; however, skin sensitivity testing should be considered for those patients at risk of acute hypersens itivity reaction . See package insert for details . 6. Administer the BAT\u00ae according to the package insert ; procedures are summarized on the following page in Table s 1 and 2. One 20 ml vial of BAT\u00ae is considered an adult dose. Children >17 years of age should receive an adult dose. For children < 17 years , consult Updated 8/1/2018 2 package in sert for weight -based scaling of dose. In general for very young children (0 -3 years old), it is advisable to consult a CDC botulism officer at 770 -488-7100 (24/7 hotline); or for infants (less than 1 year old) consult the California Infant Botulism Program (510 - 231-7600). 7. Note that administration with an in -line filter (pore size 15 microns or less) is strongly recommended but not required . Smaller pore size in -line filters such a s 0.2 micron or 1.2 microns may be used but may result in slower infusion. If no in -line filters are available, consider using a filter needle to withdraw the contents out of BAT\u00ae vial. 8. The data for administration of a second dose of BAT\u00ae during a single episode of botulism is limited. Antitoxin does NOT reverse paralysi s but arrests its progression. Recovery follows the regeneration of new neuromuscular connections. Therefore, t ypically a second dose or Updated 8/1/2018 3 vial is not recommended as one vial of BAT\u00ae contains enough antitoxin to cover all \"naturally\" occurring foodborne botulism. Other exposures, such as with an intentional release, could have higher toxin loads; special treatment guidance will be given in those situations. Clinical situations that may require an additional dose of BAT\u00ae are those where C. botulism organism might continue to be present in the body and elaborating toxi n, such as with: Wound botulism Adult intestinal colonization Please consult with the Section of Epidemiology , CDC, or an infectious disease specialist PRIOR to using a second vial for specifics on dosing and intervals. 9.

See Table 1 for infant dose. 2.2 Preparation 1. Bring vial to room temperature. Emergent BioSolutions Confidential and Proprietary Page 4 of 19 If frozen, thaw vial by placing in a refrigerator at 36 to 46 \u00b0F (2 to 8 \u00b0C) until the contents are thawed for approximately 14 hours. Product can be thawed rapidly by placing at room temperature for one hour followed by a water bath at 98.6 \u00b0F (37 \u00b0C) until thawed. Do not thaw this product in a microwave oven. D o not refreeze the vial. 2. Inspect vial to ensure there is no damage to the seal or vial. If damaged, discard the vial. 3. Do not shake the vial during preparation to avoid foaming. 4. Dilute 1:10 in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (saline) by adding BAT solution from the vial to the appropriate amount of saline in an IV bag. Do not use any other diluents. As the fill volume per vial varies by lot number (approximately 10 to 22 milliliters per vial), 90 to 200 milliliters of saline will be required. Withdraw the entire contents of the vial to obtain the total volume in the vial. If a partial vial is required (for pediatric dosing), the entire content of the vial should be withdrawn to ensure accurate calculation of the dosage [Table 2]. 5. Visually inspect the product for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if the solution is turbid, cloudy, or contains particles other than a few translucent -to-white proteinaceous particulates . 6. Use an intravenous line with constant infusion pump. Use a 15 micron sterile, non- pyrogenic, low protein binding in-line filter . 7. BAT vials are for single use only and contain no preservative . Once punctured, use the vial contents to prepare the infusion bag and administer as soon as possible . 8. Discard any unused portion. 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS BAT is a sterile solution of purified F(ab') 2 plus F(ab ')2-related immune globulin fragments derived from equine plasma, containing antitoxin activity to botulinum neurotoxins A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Each single- use vial, regardless of size or fill volume, contains a minimum antitoxin potency of: 4,500 U serotype A antitoxin, antitoxin, 3,000 U serotype C antitoxin, 600 U serotype D antitoxin, 5,100 U serotype E antitoxin, 3,000 U serotype F antitoxin, and 600 U serotype G antitoxin. Emergent BioSolutions Confidential and Proprietary Page 5 of 19 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions may occur following BAT administration. Patients who have had previous therapy with an equine -derived antivenom/antitoxin, with a history of hypersensitivity to horses, asthma, or hay fever are at a greater risk for developing severe hypersensitivity reactions to BAT. Administer BAT in a setting with appropriate equipment, medication , including epinephrine, and personnel trained in the management of hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis , and shock. Monitor all patients for signs and symptoms of acute allergic reaction (e.g. urticaria, pruritus, erythema, hypotension, ta chycardia) during and following the BAT infusion. In case of hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue BAT administration immediately and administer appropriate emergency care. Have immediately available m edications such as epinephrine for emergency treatment of acute hypersensitivity reactions. For patients at risk for hypersensitivity reaction, begin BAT administration at the lowest rate achievable (< 0.01 mL/min) and monitor. 5.2 Delayed Allergic Reactions (Serum Sickness) Delayed allergic reactions (serum sickness e.g. fever, urticarial or maculopapular rash, myalgia, arthralgia, and lymphadenopathy) may occur following BAT administration, typically 10 -21 days after infusion. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of delayed allergic reaction. If a delayed allergic reaction (serum sickness) is suspected, administer appropriate medical care. 5.3 Infusion Reactions Chills, fever, headaches, nausea, and vomiting can be related to the rate of infusion. Arthralgia, myalgia and fatigue or vasovagal reactions may also develop. Carefully observe patients for the onset of these infusion reactions throughout the infusion period and immediately following an infusion. Reduce the rate of infusion if the patient experiences infusion reactions and administer symptomatic therap y. If symptoms worsen, discontinue the infusion and administer appropriate medical care. Emergent BioSolutions Confidential and Proprietary Page 6 of 19 5.4 Interference with Blood Glucose Testing The maltose contained in BAT can interfere with some types of blood glucose monitoring systems i.e. those based on glucose deh ydrogenase pyrroloquinoline -quinone (GDH -PQQ) method. This can result in falsely elevated glucose readings and inappropriate administration of insulin, resulting in life -threatening hypoglycemia. Cases of true hypoglycemia may go untreated if the hypoglyce mic state is masked by falsely elevated results [ see Drug Interactions ( 7)]. 5.5 Transmissible Infectious Agents Because BAT is made from equine plasma, it may carry the risk of transmitting infectious agents e.g. viruses. The equine plasma pools are screened for the p resence of certain infectious agents and the manufacturing process for BAT includes measures to inactivate and remove certain viruses [ see Description ( 11)]. Despite these measures, such products can still potentially transmit disease. No cases of transmission of viral diseases have been associated with the use of BAT. Report all infections thought by a physician to have been transmitted by BAT to Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc. at 1 -800-768-2304. Discuss the risks and benefits of this product with the patient or their legal guardian before administering it to the patient [ see Patient Counse ling Information ( 17)]. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions observed in 5 % of healthy volunteers in clinical trials were headache, nausea, pruritus, and urticaria. The most common adve rse reactions reported in 1% of patients in a clinical study were pyrexia, rash, chills, nausea , and edema. The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in detail in other sections of the labeling: Hypersensitivity reactions [ see Warnings and P recautions ( 5.1)] Delayed allergic reactions/serum sickness [ see Warnings and Precautions( 5.2)] Infusion reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compare d to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a randomized, double -blind, parallel arm trial conducted to evaluate the safety of BAT in healthy subjects, and to establish the pharmacokinetic profil e of the seven botulinum antitoxin serotypes contained in BAT following intravenous (IV) administration, 40 subjects were randomized to receive either one (n=20) or two vials (n=20) of BAT. Emergent BioSolutions Confidential and Proprietary Page 7 of 19 In a second parallel arm, randomized, double -blind pharmacodynami c trial, 26 healthy subjects were randomized to receive either BAT in saline (n=16) or placebo (0.9% saline; n=10). The most common adverse reactions in all healthy subjects were headache (9%), pruritus (5%), nausea (5%), and urticaria (5%). Other adverse reactions reported in less than 4% of subjects included pyrexia and throat discomfort. All reported adverse reactions were considered mild or moderate. No serious adverse reactions were reported. T wo moderate acute allergic reactions that required prematu re termination of the infusion and treatment were reported. Reactions were predefined as mild if the subject was aware but could tolerate. Moderate reactions were predefined as discomfort enough to interfere with normal daily activity. A total of 231 subje cts with suspected or confirmed botulism were exposed to BAT in an open- label observational expanded access clinical study sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The majority of adult (213/216) and pediatric (13/15) subjects rec eived one dose of BAT. Three adult subjects were exposed to a second dose of BAT, and two pediatric subjects each received two infant doses (10% of the adult dose). The administration of a second dose varied from seven hours to one month after the first dose. Safety data was actively collected from treating physicians by the CDC. However, no on -site safety monitoring was performed, and the CDC relied on follow -up information provided by the treating physicians to determine the reporting frequencies for adv erse reactions. Of the 231 subjects receiving BAT, safety information was available for 228 subjects. Adverse reactions were reported in 10% of all subjects. The most common adverse reactions were pyrexia (4%), rash (2%), chills (1%), nausea (1%), and edem a (1%). Other adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of subjects. No subject experienced anaphylaxis. One subject experienced a serious adverse reaction of hemodynamic instability characterized by bradycardia, tachycardia, and asystole during BAT administration. One subject experienced mild serum sickness (< 1%) with myalgia, arthralgia, and dark urine twelve days after BAT administration.

All subjects from the two clinical trials were tested for immunogenicity against BAT at baseline and at the end of the studies (Day 28) using a validated assay. Eleven subjects seroco nverted during the course of the two trials. One subject from each clinical trial experienced a moderate allergic reaction during the administration of BAT. Both subjects were negative for anti -BAT antibodies at baseline and at the end of their respective studies. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed Emergent BioSolutions Confidential and Proprietary Page 9 of 19 incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to BAT with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misle ading. 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug Laboratory Interactions: Blood Glucose Testing BAT contains maltose which can interfere with certain types of blood glucose monitoring systems [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4)]. Only test systems that are glucose -specific should be used in patients receiving BAT. This interference can result in falsely elevated glucose readings that can lead to untreated hypoglycemia or to inappropriate insulin administration, resulting in life -threatening hypoglycemia. The product information of the blood glucose testing system, including that of the test strips, should be carefully reviewed to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose - containing parenteral systems. If any uncertainty exists, contact the manufacturer of the testing system to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose -containing parenteral products. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPU LATIONS 8.1 Pregnan cy Risk Summary There are no human or animal data to establish the presence or absence of BAT associated risk. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data to assess the presence or absence of BAT in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production/excretion. Consider t he developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother's clinical need for BAT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from BAT or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The effectiveness of BAT has not been established in pediatric patients. Limited pediatric safety data are available. Fifteen pediatric subjects (age 10 days to 17 years; including 1 newborn, 3 infants and toddlers, 4 children and 7 adolescents) received BAT under the CDC expanded access Emergent BioSolutions Confidential and Proprietary Page 10 of 19 clinical study. A 3 -year old subject and an infant received two infant doses , and 13 pediatric subjects received one pediatric dose according to Salisbury Rule [ Table 2]. Two adverse reactions were reported in two pediatric subjects. One subject experienced an adverse reaction of pyrexia following infusion of BAT, while the other subject experienced a serious adverse reacti on of hemodynamic instability characterized by tachycardia, bradycardia, and asystole during infusion of BAT. Dosing in pediatric patients is based on Salisbury Rule. 8.5 Geriatric Use The safety, pharmacokinetics, and effectiveness of BAT have not been established in geriatric subjects. Thirty six geriatric subjects received BAT under the CDC expanded access clinical study . One geriatric subject experienced rash as an adverse reaction following infusion of BAT. 11 DESCRIPTION BAT [Botulism Antitoxin Hept avalent (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) - (Equine)] is a sterile solution of F(ab') 2 and F(ab') 2-related antibody fragments prepared from plasma obtained from horses that have been immunized with a specific serotype of botulinum toxoid and toxin. To obtain the final heptavalent product, the seven antitoxin serotypes are blended. BAT is supplied in either a 20 or 50 milliliter vial size, with a fill volume ranging from 10 to 22 milliliters per vial. BAT is administered intravenously. The manufacturing process for each antitoxin type includes cation- exchange chromatography to purify the immune globulin fraction, digestion with pe psin to produce F(ab') 2 plus F (ab')2- related immune globulin fragments , anion exchange chromatography to remove the pepsin as well as other impurities and filtration. In addition, the manufacturing process includes two viral inactivation/removal steps; solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment and virus filtration [ Table 4]. The S/D treatment step is effective at inactivating known -enveloped viruses such as equine encep equine herpes virus, rabies, and equine influenza. The BAT manufacturing process also includes a robust filtration step that is effective in reducing the levels of some lipid -enveloped viruses (listed above) as well as non -enveloped viruses including equine rhinovirus, equine adenoviruses and adeno- associated viruses, and equine parvovirus.

The formulated bulk material contains approximately 3 -7 g% (30- 70 milligrams/milliliter) protein. The product potency is expressed in units based on the mouse neutralization assay (MNA). Each unit of BAT is designed to neutralize 10,000 mouse intraperitoneal lethal dose 50% units (MIPLD 50) of botulinum neurotoxin for serotype A, B, C, D, F, and G and 1,000 MIPLD 50 of serotype E. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOG Y 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of BAT is through passive immunization with equine polyclonal antibody fragments (primarily F(ab) 2 and Fab) against botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. In the circulation the polyclonal antibody fragments bind to free BoNT. This prevents the BoNT from interacting with ganglioside anchorage sites and protein receptors on the cholinergic nerve endings. In turn this prevents BoNT internalization into the target cells. The antibody/antigen complexes are then cleared from the circulation by the organs involved in processing immune complexes. Experimental evidence concerning the amount of circulating antitoxin needed to counteract BoNT intoxication is not fully documented. The outcome of treatment depends, as it does with other comparable conditions, largely on the time interval elapsing after th e onset of symptoms and antitoxin administration. Emergent BioSolutions Confidential and Proprietary Page 12 of 19 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A proof -of-concept clinical dose- response trial was conducted using the extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) muscle of the foot as a model for measuring muscle paralysis after exposure to botuli sm toxin. In this model, BAT prevented subjects from experiencing a decrease in muscle function after exposure to botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) serotypes A and B. Subjects treated with placebo (n=10) demonstrated a loss of greater than 50% EDB muscle functi on within 3 days of exposure to BoNT serotypes A and B. In the BAT arm of the trial (n=16), EDB muscle function was stable over time indicating that BAT was effective in preserving muscle function for up to 28 days following exposure to both BoNT serotype A and B. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics (PK) of the seven botulism antitoxin serotypes was determined in healthy human subjects following IV administration of either one (n=20) or two vials (n=20) of BAT. The various PK parameters are summarized in Table 5. The PK parameters varied based upon the antitoxin serotype measured. Antitoxin serotypes D and E had the shortest half -lives. While antitoxin serotype B and C had the longest half - lives. The AUC 0- and C max values increased in a dose proportional fashion as the BAT dose increased from one to two vials. In addition, mean clearance values appeared to be similar between both treatment groups for the seven antitoxin serotypes, suggesting dose linearity of BAT ov er the dose range studied.

The evaluation of new treatment options for botuli sm using controlled human trials is unethical and infeasible. Therefore the effectiveness of BAT for treatment of botulism is based on well controlled efficacy studies conducted in guinea pigs and rhesus macaques. Guinea Pig In a controlled therapeutic efficacy study, guinea pigs were intoxicated with various BoNT serotypes (A, B, C, D, E, F or G) at a dose of 1.5x guinea pig intramuscular lethal dose 50% units (GPIMLD 50) via intramuscular injection into the right hind limb. T he animals were then treated with either placebo control or 1x scaled human dose of BAT (weight/weight based on an average human body weight of 70 kilograms), after the onset of moderate clinical signs of botulism (right hind limb weakness, sal ivation, lac rimation, weak limbs and noticeable changes in breathing rate or pattern). Treatment with BAT resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the survival rate of animals across all of the serotypes tested [Table 6].

Nonhuman Primate In a controlled therapeutic efficacy study, rhesus macaques were intoxicated with BoNT serotype A delivered intravenously at a dose of 1.7x nonhuman primate intravenous lethal dose 50% (NHPLD 50) units per kilogram of body weight. The anima ls were then treated with either placebo control or 1x scaled human dose of BAT (weight/weight based on an average human body weight of 70 kilograms), after the onset of clinical signs of botulism (ptosis, muscular weakness, or respiratory distress). Treat ment with BAT resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the survival rate [ Table 7].

The safety has been tested in healthy adults and patients with suspected botulism who were treated with BAT under an expanded access clinical study. The pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profiles of BAT have been evaluated in two clinical studies. In these clinical studies, BAT was shown to have an acceptable safety profile when one or two vials of BAT were administered intravenously to healthy subjects. In a randomized, single -center, double -blind trial the pharmacokinetics and safety of BAT was evaluated in 40 healthy subjects receiving either one (n = 20) or two (n = 20) vials of BAT by IV infusion. Serum BAT levels were measured in the subjects using the Mouse Neutralization Assay (MNA) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. In a randomized single center, double -blind trial the pharmacodynamics and safety of BAT was evaluated in 26 healthy subjects receiving either a sing le vial of BAT (n=16) or placebo (n=10) by IV infusion. The effects of BAT in preventing paralysis of the EDB foot muscle following administration of botulinum neurotoxin serotype A or B was determined [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2) ]. To provide additional support for the efficacy demonstrated in the animal models, a preliminary analysis of data from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) open - Emergent BioSolutions Confidential and Proprietary Page 15 of 19 label, observational expanded access clinical study for the treatment of subjects with suspected or confirmed botulism with BAT was conducted. Across the 148 subjects treated with BAT in the period analyzed, 109 subjects had a final discharge di agnosis of suspected or confirmed botulism and were included in the analysis population. The median time from the onset of botulism symptoms to treatment with BAT was 3.6 days (range: 0.25 - 38 days). Early treatment ( 2 days after onset of symptoms) with BAT was associated with a shorter length of hospitalization, duration in intensive care unit (ICU) and duration of mechanical ventilation compared to later treatment [ Table 8] and is consistent with the mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1)].

Inform patients of the following: BAT is prepared from equine plasma and may contain infectious agents such as viruses that can cause disease. The risk that such products will transmit an infectious age nt has been reduced by screening the horses for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing for the presence of certain current viral infections, and by inactivating and/or removing certain viruses during manufacturing. Despite these measures, such products can still potentially transmit disease. There is also the possibility that unknown infectious agents may be present in such products. Inform patients that persons who have received previous therapy with an equine -derived antivenom/antitoxin , have known allergies to horses , have asthma or get hay fever (seasonal allergies) may be at increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions and should only receive BAT if the benefits outweigh the risks. Advise patients about the potential interference with non- glucose specific monitoring systems. The maltose contained in BAT can interfere with some types of blood glucose monitoring systems. Only testing systems that are glucose -specific should be used in patients receiving BAT. This interference can result in falsely elevated glucose readings that can lead to untreated hypoglycemia or to inappropriate insulin administration, resulting in life-threatening hypoglycemia.

Botulism is a muscle -paralyzing disease caused by a toxin made by a bacterium called Clostridium bot ulinum . Botulism can cause the following conditions: Double vision, Blurred vision, Drooping eyelids, Slurred speech, Difficulty swallowing, Dry mouth, Muscle weakness that spreads through the body, Difficulty breathing. Botulism can also cause paralysis and death. After a person is exposed to the toxin, problems can start as early as three hours or as late as a few days. It can take weeks or months to get better. During that time, many people need special care in the hospital. The effectiveness of BAT has been studied in animals with botulism. What is BAT? BAT is a botulism antitoxin made from the plasma of horses. It contains antibody fragments which can neutralize botulism toxins. BAT may make the illness from botulism less severe. Treatment with BAT will not reverse the paralysis, but may decrease the duration and extent of paralysis. Who should use BAT? Your doctor may give you BAT if they suspect that you have been exposed to botulism toxin. You should get the treatment as quickly as possible to stop the progression of the illness. Unless the benefits outweigh the risks, you should not receive BAT if you have a known history of allergies to horses or horse blood products , asthma or hay fever (seasonal allergies) . How will you receive BAT? BAT is given as an injection into your vein. Your doctor will determine the dose of BAT. The treatment may take several hours to administer. Your doctor will decide if you need more than one injection. Emergent BioSolutions Confidential and Proprietary Page 19 of 19 What are the possible or reasonably likely side effects of BAT? The most common side effects of BAT are: Headache Fever Rash Hives Chills Nausea Swelling Some people have a chilly feeling, difficulty breathing, and have a quick rise in body temperature within the first 20 to 60 minutes after getting BAT. This can be managed by your doctor. BAT can cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor or go to the emergency department right away if you have trouble breathing, swelling of your tongue or lips, or a very fast heart rate because this can be signs of a serious alle rgic reaction. Tell your doctor if you get pains in your joints and back, fever, and a rash within one to three weeks after getting BAT. These can be signs of \"serum sickness\" and can last for a few weeks. Your doctor can give you medicine to help with ser um sickness. Talk to your doctor about any side effects that concern you. You can ask your doctor for additional prescribing information that is available to healthcare professionals. What other information do you need to know about BAT? BAT is made from h orse plasma. The horses are carefully screened and the plasma is carefully cleaned, but there is a small risk that it may give you a virus. Talk to your doctor if you have any symptoms that concern you. You may report side effects directly to Emergent BioS olutions Canada Inc. at 1 -800-768- 2304 or to FDA's MedWatch reporting system at 1- 800-FDA- 1088.
