The authors would like tothank the many individuals who gener-ously contributed their time and energy toenrich this manual over the course ofnearly a decade. We are especially indebted to Elizabeth Shrader, who drafted an early version ofthis manual as a consultant to the Centerfor Health and Gender Equity (CHANGE).Her pioneering research on violence inMexico, and later in the Ruta Cr\u00edtica Study,inspired a generation of researchers, andhelped inform the early work of theInternational Research Network onViolence Against Women (IRNVAW). This project was initiated by CHANGE. We are therefore indebted to CHANGEand the current Executive Director, JodiJacobson, for support of the manual dur-ing its initial stages. We also wish to acknowledge the indi- vidual participants of IRNVAW whoseefforts and critical reflections form the basisof many of the recommendations con-tained herein. Participants in IRNVAW meetings whose work and reflections have also drawn heavily on experi- ences and insights emerging from our par-ticipation in research collaborations withcolleagues from the Department ofEpidemiology and Public Health, Ume\u00e5University, Sweden, particularly Lars Pe\u00f1a, Andr\u00e9sHerrera, and to Lars \u00c5ke Persson andStig Wall for graciously allowing us to drawheavily from their book on epidemiologyand field methods, as well as to LarsDalgren, Anna Winkvist, and MariaEmmelin for the inspiration we receivedfrom their book on qualitative researchmethods. Likewise, many of the examples used in this manual have come from the WHOMulti-country Study on Women's Healthand Domestic Violence. In particular,Claudia Garc\u00eda Moreno, coordinator of thestudy, has supported this project from itsinception and has provided invaluablefinancial, technical, and moral supportthroughout. We are also grateful to HenricaJansen for permission to use her beautifulphotographs from the WHO study. Wewould also like to acknowledge the ableguidance of the steering committee of theWHO multi-country study, and the valu-able contributions of all the researchersinvolved in this study: Core Research Team Claudia Garcia-Moreno, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland(Study Coordinator), Charlotte Watts, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK, Lori Heise, PATH, Washington, DC, USA, Mary Ellsberg, PATH, Washington DC, USA,Henrica A.F.M.

This began to change in the 1980sas women's groups organized locally andinternationally to demand attention to thephysical, psychological, and economicabuse of women. Gradually, violenceagainst women has come to be recognizedas a legitimate human rights issue and as asignificant threat to women's health andwell-being. Now that international attention is focused on gender-based violence,methodologically rigorous research isneeded to guide the formulation andimplementation of effective interventions,policies, and prevention strategies. Untilfairly recently, the majority of research onviolence consisted of anecdotal accounts orexploratory studies performed on nonrep-resentative samples of women, such asthose attending services for batteredwomen. While this research has played acritical role in bringing to light the issuesof wife abuse, rape, trafficking, incest, andother manifestations of gender-based vio-lence, it is less useful for understanding thedimensions or characteristics of abuseamong the broader population. This manual has been developed in response to the growing need to improvethe quality, quantity, and comparability ofinternational data on physical and sexualabuse. It outlines some of the method-ological and ethical challenges of conduct-ing research on violence against womenand describes a range of innovative tech-niques that have been used to addressthese challenges. We hope that the man-ual will be useful for those interested inpursuing research on violence, especiallyin developing countries and otherresource-poor settings. The manual draws on the collective experiences and insights of many individu-als, most notably the members of theInternational Research Network onViolence Against Women (IRNVAW), an adhoc group of researchers and activists thatmeets periodically to share experiencesregarding research on violence. TheNetwork arose out of a two-day meetingon methodology and research ethics organ-ized in June 1995 by the Center for Healthand Gender Equity. To date the IRNVAWhas sponsored four international meetingsand several members have collaboratedwith the World Health Organization(WHO) in the design and implementationof a multi-country study on women'shealth and domestic violence. Many of theexamples and insights included in thismanual come from the pioneering work ofIRNVAW members, as well as the WHOMulti-country Study on Women's Healthand Domestic Violence, a household sur-vey of women that has been conducted inIntroduction6Researching Violence Against Womenat least ten countries to date. We have also drawn extensively from our own researchexperiences, primarily in Nicaragua,Indonesia, and Ethiopia. Readership This manual is written for anyone inter-ested in the application of social scienceand public health research methods to thestudy of gender-based violence. The man-ual assumes a certain level of familiaritywith the logic of research and is not a sub-stitute for training in research or researchmethodologies. It is designed for researchers who want to know more about adapting tradi-tional research techniques to the specialcase of investigating physical and sexualabuse. And it is designed for activists, community workers, and serviceproviders who want to become conver- sant in methodological issues. One of thegoals of this manual is to facilitate collabo-rations between researchers and commu-nity-based workers and activists byproviding practitioners with an introductionto the tools and language of research, andby giving researchers greater insight intothe specific issues that accompany researchon violence. Focus of the manual For the sake of brevity, this manualfocuses primarily on the issue of violence against women by their intimate part-ners. Gender-based violence assumes many forms, including rape, sexual assaultand coercion, stalking, incest, sexualharassment, female genital mutilation, andtrafficking in women. Although many ofthe insights presented herein will apply tothese other types of violence, no singlemanual could exhaustively address allforms of abuse. Additionally, we concen-trate on applied research , as opposed to research designed to advance theory or toaddress questions of primarily academicrelevance.The manual is directed particularly to those researchers interested in the intersec-tion of violence and health in develop- ing countries , given the clear impact that gender violence has on women's healthstatus. However, much of the informationpresented in the manual is applicable toviolence research as it relates to otherissues, such as human rights, the well-being of families and children, and eco-nomic development. Similarly, the lessonsfor developing countries may be relevantto some violence research undertaken inindustrialized countries, particularly amongeconomically marginalized and/or politi-cally disenfranchised populations. Finally, the manual advances an ethic of research that is action-oriented, account-able to the antiviolence movement, andresponsive to the needs of women livingwith violence. It strongly encourages col-laboration between researchers and thoseworking directly on violence as activistsand/or practitioners. Recent experiences incountries as diverse as Canada, Zimbabwe,Indonesia, South Africa, Nicaragua, andCambodia have shown that powerful syn-ergies can be achieved from partnershipsbetween researchers and advocates.Whereas researchers help to ensure thatthe endeavor is grounded in the principlesof scientific inquiry, the involvement ofadvocates and service providers helpsensure that the right questions are asked inthe right way, and that the knowledge gen-erated is used for social change.A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 7This document was based on the contributions of thousands of women from around the world who shared their stories and personal experiences in the hopes that their voices would contribute to diminishing the suffering of future generations of women from violence. The publication is dedicated to them.1 PHOTO BY HAFM JANSENA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 9society in the world legitimize, obscure, and deny abuse. The same acts that would bepunished if directed at an employer, a neigh-bor, or an acquaintance often go unchal-lenged when men direct them at women,especially within the family. For over three decades, women's advo- cacy groups around the world have beenworking to draw more attention to thephysical, psychological, and sexual abuseof women and to stimulate action. Theyhave provided abused women with shelter,lobbied for legal reforms, and challengedthe widespread attitudes and beliefs thatsupport violence against women. 2 Increasingly, these efforts are havingViolence against women is the most per- vasive yet underrecognized human rights vio-lation in the world. It is also a profoundhealth problem that saps women's energy,compromises their physical and mentalhealth, and erodes their self-esteem. In addi-tion to causing injury, violence increaseswomen's long-term risk of a number of otherhealth problems, including chronic pain,physical disability, drug and alcohol abuse,and depression. 1, 2Women with a history of physical or sexual abuse are also at increasedrisk for unintended pregnancy, sexuallytransmitted infections, and miscarriages. 3-5 Despite the high costs of violence againstwomen, social institutions in almost everyCHAPTER ONE Violence Against Women as a Health and Development Issue* Topics covered in this chapter: Definitions of violence against women Prevalence of intimate partner violenceThe patterning of intimate partner violencePrevalence and characteristics of sexual coercion and abuseThe effects of violence on women's healthExplaining gender-based violenceHow do women respond to abuse?Challenges for international research on gender-based violence * Parts of this chapter are reprinted from Heise, Ellsberg and Gottemoeller, 19992(available online at http://www.infoforhealth.org/pr/l11edsum.shtml).10 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER ONE results. Today, international institutions are speaking out against gender-based vio-lence. Surveys and studies are collectingmore information about the prevalence andnature of abuse. More organizations, serv-ice providers, and policy makers are recog-nizing that violence against women hasserious adverse consequences for women'shealth and for society. This chapter provides a brief overview of the issue of violence against women,including definitions, international preva-lence, the documented health conse-quences of abuse, and evidence regardingcausation and women's experiences ofabuse. We include this information here forindividuals who may be new to the topicand/or for those who are writing researchproposals and may not have easy access tothe international literature. DEFINITIONS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN Although both men and women can be victims as well as perpetrators of violence,the characteristics of violence most com-monly committed against women differ incritical respects from violence commonlycommitted against men. Men are morelikely to be killed or injured in wars oryouth- and gang-related violence thanwomen, and they are more likely to bephysically assaulted or killed on the streetby a stranger. Men are also more likely tobe the perpetrators of violence, regardlessof the sex of the victim. 1In contrast, women are more likely to be physicallyassaulted or murdered by someone theyknow, often a family member or intimatepartner. 2They are also at greater risk of being sexually assaulted or exploited,either in childhood, adolescence, or asadults. Women are vulnerable to differenttypes of violence at different moments intheir lives (see Figure 1.1). There is still no universally agreed-upon terminology for referring to violence againstwomen. Many of the most commonly usedterms have different meanings in differentregions, and are derived from diverse theo-retical perspectives and disciplines.FIGURE 1.1 THE LIFE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN (Adapted from Watts and Zimmerman, 20026and Shane and Ellsberg, 2002.7)Pre-birth Infancy ChildhoodElderly AdolescenceReproductive AgeSex-selective abortionElder/widow abuse Female infanticide Neglect (health care, nutrition) Child abuse MalnutritionFGMForced prostitution TraffickingForced early marriage Psychological abuseRapeHonor killing by non-partner Homicide/Femicide traffickingSexual harassmentA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 11One frequently used model for under- standing intimate partner abuse and sexualabuse of girls is the \"family violence\"framework, which has been developed pri-marily from the fields of sociology andpsychology. 8, 9\"Family violence\" refers to all forms of abuse within the family regard-less of the age or sex of the victim or theperpetrator. Although women are fre-quently victimized by a spouse, parent, orother family member, the concept of \"fam-ily violence\" does not encompass the manytypes of violence to which women areexposed outside the home, such as sexualassault and harassment in the workplace.Moreover, feminist researchers find theassumption of gender neutrality in the term\"family violence\" problematic because itfails to highlight that violence in the familyis mostly perpetrated by men againstwomen and children. There is increasing international consen- sus that the abuse of women and girls,regardless of where it occurs, should beconsidered as \"gender-based violence,\" as itlargely stems from women's subordinate sta-tus in society with regard to men (Figure1.2). The official United Nations definitionof gender-based violence was first presentedin 1993 when the General Assembly passedthe Declaration on the Elimination ofViolence against Women. 10According to this definition, gender-based violence includes ahost of harmful behaviors directed atwomen and girls because of their sex,including wife abuse, sexual assault, dowry-related murder, marital rape, selective mal-nourishment of female children, forcedprostitution, female genital mutilation, andsexual abuse of female children (see Box1.1 for the complete definition). 10 Even when the abuse of women by male partners is conceptualized as gender-based violence, the terms used to describethis type of violence are not consistent. Inmany parts of the world, the term \"domes-tic violence\" refers to the abuse of womenby current or former male intimate part-ners. 11, 12However, in some regions, includ- ing Latin America, \"domestic violence\"refers to any violence that takes place inthe home, including violence against chil-dren and the elderly. 13, 14The term \"bat- tered women\" emerged in the 1970s and iswidely used in the United States andEurope to describe women who experi-ence a pattern of systematic dominationand physical assault by and\"intimate violence\" are generallywomen, whereas \"wife abuse\" and \"wifeassault\" can be read to exclude common-law unions and dating violence. For the purposes of this manual, we use the terms \"violence against women\" (VAW) and \"gender-based violence\" (GBV) inter-changeably to refer to the full range ofabuses recognized by the UN Declarationand other international agreements. We useVIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AS A HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUE The term \"violence against women\" means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffer- ing to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or private life. Accordingly, violence againstwomen encompasses but is not limited to the following: a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including battering, sexual abuse of female children in the household, dowry-related vio-lence, marital rape, female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation; b) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring within the general com- munity, including rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation atwork, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forcedprostitution; c) Physical, sexual and psychological violence perpetrated or condoned by the State, wherever it occurs. Acts of violence against women also include forced sterilization and forced abortion, coercive/forced use of contraceptives, female infanticide and prenatalsex selection.BOX 1.1 UNITED NATIONS DEFINITION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN (From United Nations, 1993.10)12 Researching Violence Against Womenthe and to the range of sexu-ally, psychologically, and physicallycoercive acts used against adult and ado-lescent women by current or former maleintimate partners. PREVALENCE OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE International research consistently demon- strates that a woman is more likely to beassaulted, injured, raped, or killed by a cur-rent or former partner than by any otherperson. Table 1.1 presents findings fromnearly 80 population-based studies carriedout in more than 50 countries. These studiesindicate that between 10 percent and 60 per-cent of women who have ever been marriedor partnered have experienced at least oneincident of physical violence from a currentor former intimate partner. Most studies esti-mate a lifetime prevalence of partner vio-lence between 20 percent and 50 percent.Although women can also be violent, andabuse exists in some same-sex relationships,the vast majority of partner abuse is perpe-trated by men against their female partners. Researchers find considerable variation in the prevalence of partner violence fromcountry to country, and among studieswithin a country. Unfortunately, lack ofconsistency in study methods, studydesign, and presentation of results makes it difficult to explore the causes and conse-quences of violence. As a result, it is oftendifficult to compare results even betweenstudies performed in the same country. Partly to address this shortcoming, the World Health Organization worked withcollaborating institutions in 15 sites in tencountries between 1998 and 2004 to imple-ment a multi-country study of domesticviolence and women's health. The WHO Multi-country Study on Women's Healthand Domestic Violence Against Women \u2014 also referred to here as the WHO VAWStudy\u2014was the first ever to produce trulycomparable data on physical and sexualabuse across settings. 16This research proj- ect sought to minimize differences relatedto methods by employing standardizedquestionnaires and procedures, as well as acommon approach to interviewer training. We will return to the WHO VAW Study many times throughout the manual tohighlight some of the challenges posed bythis project and how they were resolved. THE PATTERNING OF INTIMATE PARTNERVIOLENCE The WHO VAW Study also provided a rare opportunity to examine the \"patterning\" ofviolence across settings. Does physical vio-lence occur together with other types ofviolence? Do violent acts tend to escalateover time? Are women most at risk frompartners or from others in their lives? The WHO VAW Study findings confirm that most women who suffer physical orsexual abuse by a partner generally experi-ence multiple acts over time. Likewise, phys-ical and sexual abuse tend to co-occur inCHAPTER ONE FIGURE 1.2 THE OVERLAP BETWEEN GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE AND FAMILY/DOMESTIC VIOLENCE Gender-based violence For example: Rape by strangers Female genital mutilation Sexual harassament in the workplace Selective malnutritionof girlsIntimatepartner violence Sexual abuse of womenand girlsin the familyFor example: Child abuse Elder abuseFamily violenceA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 13VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AS A HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUE Proportion of women physically assaulted Year of Sample Study* by a partner (%) Country Ref study Coverage size population* Age (years) last 12 mo Ever Africa Ethiopia 172002 Meskanena Woreda 2261 1367 III 15-49 16 31 South Africa211998 Eastern 396 III 18-49 11 271998 Mpumalanga 419 III 18-49 12 281998 Northern Province 464 III 18-49 5 19 221998 National 10,190 II 15-49 6 13 Tanzania 202002 Dar Salaam III 15-49 15 33 202002 Midlands Province 966 I >18 17b Latin America and the Caribbean Barbados261990 National 264 I 20-45 30a,c Brazil 202001 Sao Paulo III 15-49 202001 Pernambuco 1188 III 15-49 Santiago 22-55 26d 281997 Santiago 310 II 15-49 23 292004pSanta 19d National Dominican 242002 National 6807 III 15-49 11 22 Ecuador 321995 National 11,657 II 15-49 12 El Salvador 332002 6 Haiti 242000 National 2347 III 15-49 21 29 Mexico361996 Guadalajara 382003 Nicaragua391995 Leon 360 III 15-49 27 52 401997 Managua 378 III 15-49 33 69 411998 National 8507 III 15-49 13 30 421995-1996 III 15-49 10 432004 National 5070 Peru 242000 National 17,369 III 15-49 2 42TABLE 1.1 PHYSICAL ASSAULTS ON WOMEN BY AN INTIMATE MALE PARTNER, SELECTED POPULATION-BASED STUDIES, 1982-200414 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER ONE Proportion of women physically assaulted Year of Sample Study* by a partner (%) Country Ref study Coverage size population* Age (years) last 12 mo Ever Latin America and the Caribbean (continued) Peru (continued) 202001 Lima 1019 III 15-49 17 50 202001 Cusco National 8000 I >18 1a22a Asia Western 6300 3b8b,d 502002-2003 National 6438 National (villages) 1225 II <50 19 16 National 15-49 20-64 India 241998-1999 National 90,303 15-49 10 19 531999 Six states 9938 III 15-49 14 40 292004pLucknow 506 IV 15-49 25 35 292004pTrivandrum 700 IV 15-49 20 43 292004pVellore 716 IV 15-49 16 31 Indonesia552000 Central Java 765 IV 15-49 2 11 Japan 202001 Yokohama 1276 III 18-49 3 13 New Zealand 562002 Auckland 1309 III 18-64 5 30 562002 North Waikato 1360 III 18-64 34 Papua New Guinea 571982 National, rural villages 628 IIIk67 Philippines 581993 National 8481 15-49 10 591998 26 City & Bukidnon 292004pPaco 1000 IV 15-49 6 21 Republic of Korea 601989 National 707 II >20 38 Samoa 202000 National 1204 III 15-49 18 41 202002 Nakonsawan Ha Tay province 1090 III 15-60 14 25TABLE 1.1 PHYSICAL ASSAULTS ON WOMEN BY AN INTIMATE MALE PARTNER, SELECTED POPULATION-BASED STUDIES, 1982-2004A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 15VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AS A HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUE Proportion of women physically assaulted Year of Sample Study* by a partner (%) Country Ref study Coverage size population* Age (years) last 12 mo Ever Europe Albania 622002 National 4049 III 15-44 5 8 Azerbaijan 632001 National 5533 III 15-44 8 20 Finland *641997 National I 30 *652002 9i 661999 20-49 18 27 Republic of Moldova 721997 National 4790 III 15-44 8 15 Romania 731999 National 5322 III 15-44 10 29 Russia 742000 Three 5482 15-44 7 22 Serbia/Montenegro 202003 1189 >18 10 Anatolia I 14-75 58a Ukraine 791999 National 5596 III 12a30a 812001 National 12,226 821995-1996 National 7123 III 15-49 13 34 292004pEl-Sheik Zayed 631 IV 15-49 11 11 Israel831997 Arab population 1826 II 19-67 32 West Bank and Gaza Strip841994 Palestinian population 2410 II 17-65 52 Key DHS survey data24INCLEN data85CDC study WHO study20*International Violence Against Women (IVAWS) StudyTABLE 1.1 PHYSICAL ASSAULTS ON WOMEN BY AN INTIMATE MALE PARTNER, SELECTED POPULATION-BASED STUDIES, 1982-2004 * Study population: I = all women; II = currently married/partnered women;III = ever-married/partnered women;IV = women with a pregnancy outcome; V = married women - half with pregnancy outcome, half without; VI women who had apartner within the last 12 months. aSample group included women who had never been in a relationship and thereforewere not in exposed group.bAlthough sample included all women, rate of abuse is shown for ever-married/partneredwomen (number not given). cPhysical or sexual assault. dDuring current relationship. eRate of partner abuse among ever- married/partnered women recalculated from authors' data. fWeighted for national representativity.gWithin the last five years. hIncludes threats. iSince the age of 18. jSince the age of 16. kNonrandom sampling methods used. pPublication date (field work dates not reported).

Figure 1.3 summarizes the proportion of women who have experi-enced violence by an intimate partneramong ever-partnered women aged 15 to 49in the various sites included in the study.The first bar portrays the percentage ofwomen in each setting who have experi-enced physical violence by a partner; thesecond bar portrays sexual violence by apartner; and the third bar represents the per-centage of ever-partnered women who haveexperienced either physical and/or sexualviolence by a partner in their lifetime. Until recently, it was believed that few women exclusively experienced sexual vio-lence by an intimate partner. Available stud-ies from North and Central America hadindicated that sexual violence was generallyaccompanied by physical abuse and by emo-tional violence and controlling behaviors. 2 The findings from the WHO VAW Studysuggest that, although this pattern is main-tained in many countries, a few sitesdemonstrate a significant departure. Inboth the capital and province of Thailand,a substantial portion of women who expe-rience partner violence, experience sexualviolence only (Figure 1.4). In Bangkok, 44percent of all cases of lifetime partner vio-lence have experienced only sexual vio-lence. The corresponding statistic in theThai province is 29 percent of cases. Asimilarly high percentage of cases of vio-lence in Bangladesh province (32 percent)and Ethiopia province (31 percent) involvesexual violence only. These results speak to the importance of developing a broader international researchbase on violence against women. Insightsderived exclusively from the NorthAmerican literature may not reflect the real-ity of women's experiences in other settings.

Forced sexual contact can take placeat any time in a woman's life and includesa range of behaviors, from forcible rape tononphysical forms of pressure that compelgirls and women to engage in sex againsttheir will. The touchstone of coercion isthat a woman lacks choice and faces severephysical, social, or economic consequencesif she resists sexual advances. Studies indicate that the majority of non- consensual sex takes place among individu-als who know each other\u2014spouses, familymembers, dating partners, or acquain-tances. 86, 87In fact, much nonconsensual sex takes place within consensual unions andincludes a woman being compelled to havesex when she does not want it, or toengage in types of sexual activity that shefinds degrading or humiliating. 1, 88, 89Much sexual coercion also takes place against children and adolescents in bothindustrial and developing countries.Between one-third and two-thirds ofknown sexual assault victims are age 15 oryounger, according to justice system statis-tics and information from rape crisis cen-ters in Chile, Peru, Malaysia, Mexico,Panama, Papua New Guinea, and theUnited States. 2 Sexual exploitation of children is wide- spread in virtually all societies. Child sex-ual abuse refers to any sexual act thatoccurs between an adult or older adoles-cent and a child, and any nonconsensualsexual contact between a child and a peer.Laws generally consider the issue of con-sent to be irrelevant in cases of sexualcontact by an adult with a child, definedvariously as someone under 13, 14, 15, or16 years of age. Because of the taboo nature of the topic, it is difficult to collect reliable figureson the prevalence of sexual abuse in child-hood. Nonetheless, the few representativesample surveys provide cause for concern.VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AS A HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUE FIGURE 1.4 INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE ACCORDING TO TYPES OF VIOLENCE (AMONG EVER-ABUSED WOMEN) 100 - 80 - 60 - 40 - 20 - 0 - Bangladesh City Bangladesh ProvinceBrazil City Brazil Province Ethiopia ProvinceJapan City Namibia CityPeru City Peru Province Thailand City Thailand ProvinceTanzania City Tanzania ProvinceSerbia Samoa sexual violence only physical violence only sexual and physical violence (From WHO, 2005.20)Percent 44 30 2648 19 3229 65 630 61 2935 45 2139 45 1723 73 430 58 12 418 Researching Violence Against WomenA review of 25 studies worldwide indicates that 0 to 32 percent of women report thatthey experienced sexual abuse in child-hood (see Table 1.2). Although both girlsand boys can be victims of sexual abuse,most studies report that the prevalence of abuse among girls is at least 1.5 to 3 timeshigher than among boys. 90Abuse among boys may be underreported compared withabuse among girls, however. Further data reveal that coercion may be an element in many young girls' initiationinto sexual life. An increasing number ofstudies have begun to document that asubstantial number of young women's first sexual experiences are forced orunwanted, especially among younger ado-lescents. Table 1.3 summarizes data from anumber of population-based surveys onthe prevalence of forced first sex, includingdata emerging from the WHO VAW Study.A plethora of studies now confirm that theyounger a girl is when she first has sex,the more likely she is to report her sexualdebut as forced. 91 Trafficking in women and girls for forced labor and sexual exploitation isanother type of gender-based violence thathas grown rapidly during the past decade,largely as a result of war, displacement,and economic and social inequitiesbetween and within countries. Althoughreliable statistics on the number of womenand children who are trafficked are lack-ing, rough estimates suggest that from700,000 to 2 million women and girls aretrafficked across international borders everyyear. 6, 92, 93These women face many risks, including physical violence and rape, bothin their work and when trying to negotiatesafer-sex practices. Another aspect of gender-based violence that has been largely overlooked until recently is violence against women in situ-ations of armed conflict. Recent reportshave documented systematic rape in manyconflicts, including the former Yugoslavia,Rwanda, Liberia, Sierra Leone, andUganda. 94-96These reports have highlighted the extent to which rape has been used asa deliberate strategy to \"destabilize popula-tion, advance ethnic cleansing, expresshatred for the enemy or supply combatantswith sexual services.\" 96In 2002, the International Criminal Tribunal in TheHague recognized the seriousness of sex-ual offences in war as a crime againsthumanity. International relief agencies arealso calling attention to the precarious situ-ation of women in refugee settings whererape, child sexual abuse, intimate partnerviolence, and other forms of sexualexploitation are widespread. THE EFFECTS OF VIOLENCE ON WOMEN'S HEALTH Gender-based violence is associated with serious health problems affecting bothwomen and children, including injuries,gynecological disorders, mental health dis-orders, adverse pregnancy outcomes, andsexually transmitted infections (STIs)(Figure 1.5). Violence can have direct con- sequences for women's health, and it canincrease women's risk of future ill health. Therefore, victimization, like tobacco oralcohol use, can best be conceptualized asa risk factor for a variety of diseases andconditions, rather than primarily as a healthproblem in and of itself. 2, 4 Both population-based research and studies of emergency room visits in theUnited States indicate that physical abuse isan important cause of injury amongwomen. 97Documented injuries sustained from such physical abuse include contu-sions, concussions, lacerations, fractures,and gunshot wounds. Population-basedstudies indicate that 40 to 75 percent ofwomen who are physically abused by apartner report injuries due to violence atsome point in their life. 2 Nevertheless, injury is not the mostCHAPTER ONEA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 19VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AS A HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUE Country & Year (Ref.

The experi-ence of abuse often erodes women'sself-esteem and puts them at greater risk ofa variety of mental health problems,including depression, anxiety, phobias,post-traumatic stress disorder, and alcoholand drug abuse. 2 Violence and sexual abuse also lie behind some of the most intractable22 Researching Violence Against Womenreproductive health issues of our times\u2014 unwanted pregnancies, HIV and otherSTIs, and complications of pregnancy.Physical violence and sexual abuse canput women at risk of infection andunwanted pregnancies directly , if women are forced to have sex, for example, or ifthey fear using contraception or condomsbecause of their partner's reaction. A his-tory of sexual abuse in childhood also canlead to unwanted pregnancies and STIsindirectly by increasing sexual risk-taking in adolescence and adulthood. There is agrowing body of research indicating thatviolence may increase women's suscepti-bility to HIV infection. 117-120Studies carried out in Tanzania and South Africa foundthat seropositive women were more likelythan their seronegative peers to reportphysical partner abuse. The results indi-cate that women with violent or control-ling male partners are at increased risk ofHIV infection. There is little informationas yet to indicate how violence increaseswomen's risk for HIV. Dunkle and col-leagues suggest that abusive men aremore likely to have HIV and imposerisky sexual practices on their partners.There are also indications that disclosureof HIV status may put women at risk forviolence. 118 Violence can also be a risk factor during pregnancy. Studies from around the worlddemonstrate that violence during preg-nancy is not a rare phenomenon. Withinthe United States, for example, between 1percent and 20 percent of currently preg-nant women report physical violence, withthe majority of findings between 4 percentand 8 percent. 5The differences are due partly to differences in the way womenwere asked about violence. 3, 5, 121, 122A recent review found that the prevalence of abuseduring pregnancy is 3 to 11 percent inindustrialized countries outside of NorthAmerica and between 4 and 32 percent indeveloping countries, including studiesfrom China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Mexico, India,Nicaragua, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, andSouth Africa. 3 Violence during pregnancy can have serious health consequences for womenand their children. 2Documented effects include delayed prenatal care, inadequateweight gain, increased smoking and sub-stance abuse, STIs, vaginal and cervicalinfections, kidney infections, miscarriagesand abortions, premature labor, fetal dis-tress, and bleeding during pregnancy. 4 Recent research has focused on the rela- tionship between violence in pregnancyand low birth weight, a leading cause ofinfant deaths in the developing world.Although research is still emerging, find-ings of six different studies performed inthe United States, Mexico, and Nicaraguasuggest that violence during pregnancycontributes to low birth weight, pre-termdelivery, and to fetal growth retardation, atleast in some settings. 121, 123A recent meta analysis of existing studies confirms thatintimate partner violence during pregnancyis indeed associated with a significant,albeit small, reduction in birth weight. 124 In its most extreme form, violence kills women. Worldwide, an estimated 40 tomore than 70 percent of homicides ofwomen are perpetrated by intimate part-ners, frequently in the context of an abu-sive relationship. 125By contrast, only a small percentage of men who are murdered arekilled by their female partners, and in manysuch cases, the women are defendingthemselves or retaliating against abusivemen. 126A study of female homicide in South Africa found that intimate femicide(female murder by an intimate partner)accounted for 41 percent of all femalehomicides. This study estimated that awoman is killed by her intimate partner inSouth Africa every six hours. 127Violence is also a significant risk factor for suicide.Studies in numerous countries have foundthat women who have suffered domesticCHAPTER ONEA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 23VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AS A HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUE Gender-Based Victimization Child sexual abuse Sexual assault Physical abuse Nonfatal Outcomes Fatal Outcomes Direct & Indirect Physical Health Mental Health Injury Post traumatic stress Femicide Functional impairment Depression Suicide Physical symptoms Anxiety Maternal mortality Poor subjective health Phobias/panic disorders AIDS-related Permanent disability Eating disorders Sexual dysfunction Injurious Health Behaviors Low self-esteem Smoking Mental distress Alcohol and drug use Substance abuse disorders Sexual risk-taking Physical inactivity Overeating Functional Disorders Chronic pain syndromes Irritable bowel syndrome Gastrointestinal disorders Somatic complaints Fibromyalgia Reproductive Health Unwanted pregnancy STIs/HIV Gynecological disorders Unsafe abortion Pregnancy complications Miscarriage/low birth weight Pelvic inflammatory diseaseFIGURE 1.5 HEALTH OUTCOMES OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN (From Heise et al, 1999.2)24 Researching Violence Against Womenviolence or sexual assault are much more likely to have had suicidal thoughts, or tohave attempted to kill themselves. 19 EXPLAINING GENDER- BASED VIOLENCE Violence against women is widespread, but it is not universal. Anthropologists havedocumented small-scale societies\u2014such asthe Wape of Papua New Guinea\u2014wheredomestic violence is virtually absent. 128, 129 This reality stands as testament to the factthat social relations can be organized tominimize abuse. Why is violence more widespread in some places than in others? Increasingly,researchers are using an \"ecological frame-work\" to understand the interplay of per-sonal, situational, and socio-cultural factorsthat combine to cause abuse. 21, 130-133In this framework, violence against women resultsfrom the interaction of factors at differentlevels of the social environment (Figure 1.6). The framework can best be visualized as four concentric circles. The innermost cir-cle represents the biological and personalhistory that each individual brings to his orher behavior in relationships. The secondcircle represents the immediate context inwhich abuse takes place: frequently thefamily or other intimate or acquaintancerelationship. The third circle represents theinstitutions and social structures, both for-mal and informal, in which relationshipsare embedded, such as neighborhoods, theworkplace, social networks, and peergroups. The fourth, outermost circle is theeconomic and social environment, includ-ing cultural norms. A wide range of studies shows that several factors at each of these levelsincrease the likelihood that a man willabuse his partner: At the individual level , the male was abused as a child or witnessed maritalviolence in the home, had an absent orrejecting father, or frequently uses alco-hol. A recent review of nationally repre-sentative surveys in nine countriesfound that for women, low educationalattainment, being under 25 years of age,having witnessed her father's violenceagainst her mother, living in an urbanarea, and low socio-economic statuswere consistently associated with anincreased risk of abuse. 24 At the level of the family and rela-tionship , the male controls wealth and decision making within the family andmarital conflict is frequent. At the community level , women are isolated with reduced mobility and lackof social support. Male peer groupscondone and legitimize men's violence. At the societal level , gender roles are rigidly defined and enforced and theconcept of masculinity is linked totoughness, male honor, or dominance.The prevailing culture tolerates physicalpunishment of women and children,accepts violence as a means to settleinterpersonal disputes, and perpetuatesthe notion that men \"own\" women. The ecological framework combines individual level risk factors with family,community, and society level factors identi-fied through cross cultural studies, andhelps explain why some societies andsome individuals are more violent thanothers, and why women, especially wives,are so much more likely to be the victimsof violence within the family. Other factorscombine to protect some women. Forexample, women who have authority andpower outside the family tend to experi-ence lower levels of abuse in intimate part-nerships. Likewise, when family membersand friends intervene promptly, theyCHAPTER ONEA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 25appear to reduce the likelihood of domes- tic violence. In contrast, wives are morefrequently abused in cultures where familyaffairs are considered \"private\" and outsidepublic scrutiny. Justifications for violence frequently evolve from gender norms, that is, socialnorms about the proper roles and respon-sibilities of men and women. Many cul-tures hold that a man has the right tocontrol his wife's behavior and that womenwho challenge that right\u2014even by askingfor household money or by expressing theneeds of the children\u2014may be punished.In countries as different as Bangladesh,Cambodia, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Nicaragua, Tanzania,and Zimbabwe, studies find that violence isfrequently viewed as physical chastise-ment\u2014the husband's right to \"correct\" anerring wife. 2As one husband said in a focus group discussion in Tamil Nadu,India, \"If it is a great mistake, then the hus-band is justified in beating his wife. Whynot? A cow will not be obedient withoutbeatings.\" 134 Worldwide, studies identify a consistent list of events that are said to \"trigger\" vio-lence. 130These include: not obeying the husband, talking back, not having foodready on time, failing to care adequatelyfor the children or home, questioning himabout money or girlfriends, going some-where without his permission, refusing himsex, or expressing suspicions of infidelity.All of these represent transgressions ofdominant gender norms in many societies. Although the ecological framework has gained broad acceptance for conceptualiz-ing violence, there have been few attemptsto explore how individual and communitylevel risk factors relate to each other andultimately influence women's vulnerabilityto violence. One study performed in theUnited States found that the socio-eco-nomic status of the neighborhood had agreater impact on the risk of violence thanindividual household income levels.135A study in Bangladesh found that someaspects of women's status could eitherincrease or decrease a woman's risk ofbeing beaten, depending on the socio-cul-tural conditions of the community she lives in. In one site, characterized by more con-servative norms regarding women's rolesand status, women with greater personalautonomy and those who participated for ashort time in savings and credit groupsexperienced more violence than womenwith less autonomy. Community-levelmeasures of women's status had no effecton the risk of violence. The opposite was true in the less conser- vative setting where women had betteroverall status. In this site, individual meas-ures of autonomy and participation in creditschemes had no impact on the risk of vio-lence, whereas living in a community wheremore women participated in credit groupsand where women had a higher status over-all had a protective effect. These findingssuggest that the same condition (mobility orparticipating in a credit group) may havecompletely different effects on a woman'srisk of violence, according to whether theactivity is seen as acceptable by communitynorms. These findings underscore the com-plexity of these issues and the dangers inapplying knowledge gained from one site toanother without understanding of thebroader cultural context. 136 HOW DO WOMEN RESPOND TO ABUSE? Most abused women are not passive vic- tims, but use active strategies to maximizetheir safety and that of their children.Some women resist, others flee, and stillothers attempt to keep the peace by capit-ulating to their husband's demands. Whatmay seem to an observer to be lack ofresponse to living with violence may infact be a woman's strategic assessment ofVIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AS A HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUE26 Researching Violence Against Womenwhat it takes to survive and to protect her- self and her children. A woman's response to abuse is often limited by the options available to her.Women consistently cite similar reasons forremaining in abusive relationships: fear ofretribution, lack of other means of eco-nomic support, concern for the children,emotional dependence, lack of supportfrom family and friends, and an abidinghope that \"he will change.\" In some coun-tries, women say that the social unaccept-ability of being single or divorced poses anadditional barrier that keeps them fromleaving destructive marriages. 2 At the same time, denial and fear of social stigma often prevent women fromreaching out for help. In numerous sur-veys, for example, from 22 to almost 70percent of abused women say that untilthe interview they never told anyone abouttheir abuse. Those who reach out do soprimarily to family members and friends.Few have ever contacted the police. 1, 20Despite the obstacles, many women eventually do leave violent partners\u2014evenif after many years. In a study in Le\u00f3n,Nicaragua, for example, 70 percent ofabused women eventually left theirabusers. The median time that womenspent in a violent relationship was sixyears. Younger women were likely to leavesooner than older women. 137 Studies suggest a consistent set of factors that propel a woman to leave an abusiverelationship: The violence gets more severeand triggers a realization that her partner isnot going to change, or the violencebegins to take a toll on the children.Women also cite emotional and logisticalsupport from family or friends as pivotal intheir decision to leave. 2 Leaving an abusive relationship is a multi- stage process. The process often includesperiods of denial, self-blame, and endurancebefore women recognize the abuse as apattern and identify with other women inthe same situation, thereby beginning toCHAPTER ONE FIGURE 1.6.

Most women leave and return several times before they finallyleave once and for all. 138Leaving does not necessarily guarantee a woman's safety,however, because violence may continueeven after a woman leaves. In fact, awoman's risk of being murdered by her abuser is often greatest immediately after separation. 139 CHALLENGES FOR INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH ON GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE Nearly 30 years of groundbreaking research in the field of gender-based vio-lence has greatly expanded internationalawareness of the dimensions and dynamicsof violence. However, there are still manygaps in our current state of knowledge.Researchers interested in gender-based vio-lence from a public health perspective facea number of important challenges. The scarcity of population-baseddata limits our understanding ofhow violence affects differentgroups of women. Until very recently, the majority of research was been car-ried out with nonrepresentative samplesof women, often those who haveattended shelters or other services forvictims. Although these studies are use-ful for understanding the dynamics ofabuse, they do not tell us how manywomen overall are affected, nor provideinformation about individuals who donot seek services. According to mostestimates, these women greatly outnum-ber those who seek help. Most international prevalence figureson violence are not comparable. This is due mainly to inconsistencies in theway that violence is conceptualized andmeasured. Researchers need to developconsensus around violence researchmethods that allow us to make mean-ingful comparisons between studies.Methodological consistency refers notonly to defining violence using similarcriteria, but also the use of measures tominimize underreporting of violence,such as ensuring privacy during theinterview and providing interviewerswith special training on violence. 139 Research on violence may putwomen at risk. Many researchers point out that research on violence involves anumber of inherent risks to both respon-dents and interviewers. 140The World Health Organization has developed a setof guidelines to minimize the risk ofharm to researchers and participants. 141 However, these guidelines are just nowbeing incorporated more widely intointernational research practice. More public health research isneeded to understand how violenceaffects the health of women andchildren in different settings. Studies of battered women consistently demon-strate the negative impact of abuse onwomen's psychological status and repro-ductive health, and emerging epidemio-logical studies indicate that violencetowards mothers may even affect infantbirth weight and survival. However,more research is needed to determinewhat proportion of women's overallmental and physical health problems isassociated with violence and to investi-gate the mechanisms through whichviolence affects health. More cross-cultural research isneeded to reveal how societal normsand institutions promote or discour-age violent behavior. Most researchers agree that cultural norms can greatlyaffect the extent and characteristics ofVIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AS A HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUE28 Researching Violence Against Womenviolence, as well as the way that spe- cific acts are interpreted in differentsocieties. Nonetheless, there have beenfew systematic attempts to comparethese issues in different settings. Mosttheories about the dynamics of abuse have been based on the experiences ofUS and European women, and it isunclear how relevant these are towomen from other cultures. Research evaluating different approaches to violence prevention isscarce. Although there has been an enormous increase in both communityand clinic-based programs to preventviolence and to support abused womenand girls, few programs have been sys-tematically documented or evaluated.For example, many activists and profes-sional associations in the United Statescurrently encourage health providers toask each woman at every visit whethershe has been abused. However, there islittle information about what happens towomen after disclosing violence, orwhether asking women is an effectivetool for enhancing women's safety. Inparticular, we need to develop criteriafor assessing whether practices that areeffective in one setting are likely to berelevant or feasible in another, very dif-ferent setting. The greatest challenge facing researchers in the field of violence is tolearn from past mistakes, to identify \"bestpractices,\" and to find out what makesthem successful so that we can channelresources and efforts where they are mostlikely to make a difference.1.

Shewas very afraid, and her voice trembled as she spoke, but she really wanted to tell me abouther tragedy. She kept looking over to where her mother-in-law was watching us. She askedme for help and I told her about the Women's Police Station. When her mother-in-law got upto go to the latrine, I quickly gave her a copy of the pamphlet and she hid it. She thanked mewhen I left and I ended up crying in the street because I couldn't stand to see such a younggirl being so mistreated... Nicaraguan interviewer. (Ellsberg et al, 2001. 19) A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 35that transcend those in other areas because of the potentially threatening and traumaticnature of the subject matter. In the case ofviolence, the safety and even the lives ofwomen respondents and interviewers maybe at risk. 1 In 1991, the Council for International Organization of Medical Sciences (CIOMS)In many ways, researching violence against women is similar to researchingother sensitive topics. There are issues ofconfidentiality, problems of disclosure, andthe need to ensure adequate and informedconsent. As the previous quote from aninterviewer illustrates, however, there areaspects of gender-based violence researchCHAPTER TWO Ethical Considerations for Researching ViolenceAgainst Women* Topics covered in this chapter: Respect for persons at all stages of the research process Minimizing harm to respondents and research staffMaximizing benefits to participants and communities (beneficence)Justice: Balancing risks and benefits of research on violence against women * This chapter was adapted from Ellsberg and Heise, 2002.136 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER TWO presented a set of International Guidelines for Ethical Review of EpidemiologicalStudies. 3These guidelines apply the basic ethical principles of biomedical researchinvolving human subjects to the field ofepidemiology: respect for persons, non-maleficence (minimizing harm), benefi- cence (maximizing benefits), and justice. In 1999, the World Health Organization(WHO) published guidelines for address-ing ethical and safety issues in gender-based violence research. 4The guidelines were based on the experiences of the International Research Network on ViolenceAgainst Women (IRNVAW) and weredesigned to inform the WHO Multi-country Study on Women's Health and DomesticViolence Against Women . (See Box 2.1 for a description of the main points.) The authorsargue that these ethical guidelines are criti-cal, not only to protecting the safety ofrespondents and researchers, but also toensuring data quality. This chapter examines each of the basic principles mentioned in the CIOMSguidelines in turn and explores the chal-lenges of applying them to the specialcase of conducting research on domesticand sexual violence. RESPECT FOR PERSONS AT ALL STAGES OF THERESEARCH PROCESS Informed consent for respondents The principle of respect for persons incor- porates two fundamental ethical principles:respect for autonomy and protection ofvulnerable persons. These are commonlyaddressed by individual informed consentprocedures that ensure that respondentsunderstand the purpose of the researchand that their participation is voluntary. There is still no consensus on whether the informed consent process for VAW stud-ies should explicitly acknowledge that thestudy will include questions on violence orwhether it is sufficient to warn participantsthat sensitive topics will be raised. TheWHO VAW study used an oral consentprocess that referred to the survey as astudy on women's health and life experi-ences. 5Women were advised that, \"Some of the topics discussed may be personal anddifficult to talk about, but many womenhave found it useful to have the opportunityto talk.\" Women were told that they couldend the interview at any time or skip anyquestion they did not want to answer. (SeeBox 2.3 for an example of the informedconsent form used in the WHO VAW study.)A more detailed explanation of the natureof the questions on violence was provideddirectly before the violence questions, andrespondents were asked whether theywanted to continue and were againreminded of their option not to answer. It isa good idea to prepare a list of responsesfor questions that a woman might ask aboutthe study, such as how she was selected forthe study, what will the study be used for,and how her responses will be kept secret. The safety of respondents and the research team is paramount and should infuse all project decisions. Prevalence studies need to be methodologically sound and to build upon currentresearch experience about how to minimize the underreporting of abuse. Protecting confidentiality is essential to ensure both women's safety and data quality. All research team members should be carefully selected and receive specialized training and ongoing support. The study design must include a number of actions aimed at reducing anypossible distress caused to the participants by the research. Fieldworkers should be trained to refer women requesting assistance to availablesources of support. Where few resources exist, it may be necessary for the study to create short-term support mechanisms. Researchers and donors have an ethical obligation to help ensure that theirfindings are properly interpreted and used to advance policy and intervention development. Violence questions should be incorporated into surveys designed for other purposes only when ethical and methodological requirements can be met. (From WHO, 1999.4)BOX 2.1 ETHICAL AND SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESEARCH A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 37because children are generally considered more vulnerable and less able to act ontheir own behalf. The dilemma is particu-larly acute in settings where there are noeffective services to assist troubled families,or where reporting is likely to trigger a cas-cade of events that might put the child ateven greater risk (such as being removedfrom his/her home and placed in an institu-tion). The WHO VAW study specificallyexcluded questions about child abuse, butrequired teams to develop local protocolsETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR RESEARCHING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN Mandatory reporting of abuse Some countries have laws that require cer-tain kinds of professionals to report casesof suspected abuse to authorities or socialservice agencies. Such laws raise difficultissues for researchers because they throwinto conflict several key ethical principles:respect for confidentiality, the need to pro-tect vulnerable populations, and respect forautonomy. In the case of adult women,there is consensus among most researchersthat the principles of autonomy and confi-dentiality should prevail and thatresearchers should do everything withintheir power to avoid usurping a woman'sright to make autonomous decisions abouther life. (Of course if a woman seeks sup-port in reporting her abuse, researchersshould oblige.) The dilemma of whether to comply with legal reporting requirements is particularlyproblematic when dealing with child abuse.There is no consensus internationally abouthow to handle cases of child abuseResearchers involved in the WHO Multi-country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence Against Women debated at length the value of mentioning violence directly in the initial consent process versusadding a second-order consent process immediatelybefore the questions on abuse. Some researchersargued that it was important to alert women up frontas to the true nature of the questions whereas othersfelt it was preferable to postpone introducing thenotion of violence until immediately prior to the actualabuse-related questions. This would allow some rap-port to develop, but still give a woman an opportu-nity to opt out of the violence-related questions. The consent process was well received by respon- dents in all countries except Japan. During pilot test- ing, several Japanese respondents expressed asense of betrayal because they had not been informed that the interview contained questions about violence. 6As a result, the Japan team modi- fied its consent language to explicitly acknowledge violence up front. This is an excellent example of how ethical principles and actual experience can combine to guide practice.BOX 2.2 ADAPTING ETHICAL GUIDELINES TO LOCAL SETTINGS Used in the WHO Multi-country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence Against Women Hello, my name is [*]. I work for [*]. We are conducting a survey in [study loca-tion] to learn about women's health and life experiences. You have been chosen bychance (as in a lottery/raffle) to participate in the study.

SIGNED: ____________________________________________________________ (From WHO, 2004.5)BOX 2.3 INDIVIDUAL CONSENT FORM 38 Researching Violence Against Womenfor handling cases of child abuse that inter- viewers might nonetheless come to knowabout. The guiding principle of these proto-cols was to act in \"the best interests of thechild,\" a standard that each team opera-tionalized locally, based on advice from key agencies about prevailing conditions. Community agreement In many countries, it is also important toobtain community support for research, aswell as individual consent. (Communityconsent, however, should never replaceindividual consent.) This is often sought bymeeting with community leaders to explainthe overall objectives of the research. Forsafety reasons, when obtaining communitysupport for VAW research, it is important to frame the study in general terms\u2014such asa study on women's health or life experi-ences rather than mention violence orabuse directly. If it becomes well known inthe community that women are beingquestioned about violence, men may pro-hibit their partners from participating ormay retaliate against them for their partici-pation. In addition to potentially jeopardiz-ing the safety of respondents, this couldalso undermine the study objectives anddata accuracy. MINIMIZING HARM TO RESPONDENTS ANDRESEARCH STAFF Ensuring participant safety The primary ethical concern related to researching VAW is the potential for inflict-ing harm to respondents through their par-ticipation in the study. A respondent maysuffer physical harm if a partner finds outthat she has been talking to others abouther relationship with him. Because manyviolent partners control the actions of theirspouses closely, even the act of speakingto another person without his permissionmay trigger a beating. No systematic studies have been per- formed to determine how often womensuffer negative consequences from partici-pating in research on violence. However,several VAW researchers have recordedchilling examples of experiences where women have been placed at risk as a resultof inadequate attention to safety issues. 8 For example, researchers from Chiapas,Mexico, describe how, when they firstbegan researching domestic violence, theywere not fully aware of the risks involved.They included a small set of questions ondomestic violence within a larger study onreproductive health without taking anyspecial precautions regarding safety ofrespondents. They were shocked to learnlater that three respondents were beaten bytheir partners because they had partici-pated in the survey. 9 The WHO guidelines provide a number of suggestions about how to minimize risksto respondents, including: Interviewing only one woman per house-hold (to avoid alerting other women whomay communicate the nature of the studyback to potential abusers). Not informing the wider community thatthe survey includes questions on violence. Not conducting any research on violencewith men in the same clusters wherewomen have been interviewed. 4 Protecting privacy and confidentiality His mother and sisters kept passing by, and would peek in the doorway to see what wewere talking about, so we would have tospeak really softly...and the girl said to me,\"Ay, don't ask me anything in front ofthem.\" (Nicaraguan interviewer) 2 Protecting privacy is important in its own right and is also an essential elementin ensuring women's safety. In addition toCHAPTER TWOA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 39supervisors and even drivers can also play a role in distracting household memberswho are intent on listening to the inter-view. In one instance in Zimbabwe, field-workers entered into lengthy negotiationsto purchase a chicken from the husband ofa respondent so that she could be inter-viewed in private. 10Other researchers have carried candy and coloring books to keepchildren busy during interviews. Indeed, the Japanese team for the WHO VAW study found it so difficultto achieve privacy in Japan'scrowded apartments that they had todepart from the protocol and useself-response booklets for especiallysensitive questions. In this highly lit-erate population, women were ableto read and record their answerswithout the questions having to beread aloud. 6 Ensuring privacy may be even more problematic in telephone sur-veys. Interviewers for the VAW sur-vey in Canada were trained to detectwhether anyone else was in theroom or listening on another line,and to ask whether they should callback at another time. They providedrespondents with a toll free number to call back if they wanted to verifyETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR RESEARCHING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN interviewing only one woman per house-hold, the WHO recommendations adviseresearchers to conduct violence-relatedinterviews in complete privacy, with theexception of children under the age oftwo. In cases where privacy cannot beensured, interviewers should be encour-aged to reschedule the interview for a dif-ferent time or place. Achieving this level ofprivacy is difficult and may require moreresources than might be needed forresearch on less sensitive topics. Researchers have developed a variety of creative methods for ensuring privacy.Interviewers in Zimbabwe and Nicaraguaoften held interviews outside or accompa-nied women to the river as they washedclothes. Many studies have successfullyused \"dummy\" questionnaires, containingunthreatening questions on issues such asbreastfeeding or reproductive health.Respondents are forewarned that if some-one enters the room, the interviewer willchange the topic of conversation byswitching to a dummy questionnaire. Othermembers of the research team such asInterview only one woman per household. Don't inform the wider community that the survey includes questions on violence. Don't interview men about violence in the same households or clusters where women have been asked about violence. Interviews should be conducted in complete privacy. Dummy questionnaires may be used if others enter the room during the interview. Candy and games may be used to distract children during interviews. Use of self-response questionnaires for some portions of the interview may beuseful for literate populations. Train interviewers to recognize and deal with a respondent's distress during theinterview. End the interview on a positive note that emphasizes a woman's strengths.BOX 2.4 SUGGESTIONS FOR MINIMIZING HARM TO WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN RESEARCH Interview in Thailand PHOTO BY HAFM JANSEN40 Researching Violence Against Womenthat the interview was legitimate, or in case they needed to hang up quickly. About1,000 out of a sample of 12,000 womencalled back, and 15 percent of the callswere to finish interrupted interviews. 11 Minimizing participant distress Interviews on sensitive topics can provokepowerful emotional responses in some par-ticipants. The interview may cause awoman to relive painful and frighteningevents, and this in itself can be distressingif she does not have a supportive socialenvironment. 12Interviewers therefore need to be trained to be aware of the effects thatthe questions may have on informants andhow best to respond, based on a woman'slevel of distress. Most women who become emotional during an interview actively choose to pro-ceed, after being given a moment to collectthemselves. Interviewer training shouldinclude practice sessions on how to iden-tify and respond appropriately to symp-toms of distress as well as how toterminate an interview if the impact of thequestions becomes too negative. Interviewer training should also include explicit exercises to help field staff exam-ine their own attitudes and beliefs aroundrape and other forms of violence.Interviewers frequently share many of thesame stereotypes and biases about victimsthat are dominant in the society at large.Left unchallenged, these beliefs can lead tovictim-blaming and other destructive atti-tudes that can undermine both the respon-dent's self esteem and the interviewer'sability to obtain quality data. Referrals for care and support At a minimum, the WHO guidelines sug-gest that researchers have an ethical obliga-tion to provide a respondent withinformation or services that can help hersituation. In areas where specific violence-related services are available, researchteams have developed detailed directoriesthat interviewers can use to make referrals.In Canada's VAW survey, for example, thecomputer program used by telephoneinterviewers had a pop-up screen thatlisted resources near the respondent, basedon her mail code. In Zimbabwe, Brazil,Peru, and South Africa, researchers devel-oped small pamphlets for respondents thatlisted resources for victims along with ahost of other health and social serviceagencies. 10All women were offered the pamphlet after being asked if it would besafe for them to receive it (cases have beenreported where women have been beatenwhen a partner found informational mate-rial addressing violence). In Zimbabwe,interviewers carried a referral directory andwrote out addresses on physician referralpads so that the referral would not attractsuspicion if discovered. Ideally, contactshould be made in advance with the serv-ices so that they are prepared to receivereferrals from the study. In settings where resources are scarce or nonexistent, researchers have developedinterim support measures. For example, astudy on violence against women per-formed in rural Indonesia brought in aCHAPTER TWO Respondent in Tanzania tells children to go play beforestarting her interviewPHOTO BY HAFM JANSENA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 41counselor to the field once a week to meet with respondents.13In Ethiopia, the study hired mental health nurses to work in theclosest health center for the duration of thefieldwork. 14The number of women who actually make use of such services is oftenquite low, but subsequent interviews withwomen indicate that they appreciate know-ing that services are available if needed. 11 In Peru and in Bangladesh, the WHO VAWteam has used the study as an opportunityto train local health promoters in basiccounseling and support skills. In this way,the team will leave behind a permanentresource for the community. Bearing witness to violence The image of these stories affects you, to seehow these women suffer, and especially thefeeling that no one supports them. These areexperiences that you never forget...(Nicaraguan interviewer) 2 Although preventing harm to respon- dents is of primary importance, researchersalso have an ethical obligation to minimizepossible risks to field staff and researchers.Sources of risk include threats to physicalsafety either as a result of having to travelin dangerous neighborhoods or fromunplanned encounters with abusive indi-viduals who object to the study. Somestrategies to reduce the first source of riskinclude removing extremely dangerousneighborhoods from the sampling framebefore drawing the sample (for examplethose controlled by narco-traffickers); out-fitting teams with cell phones; and havingmale drivers accompany female interview-ers into dangerous areas. Abusive partners have also been known to threaten interviewers with physical harm.In a South African study, for example, aman came home from a bar in the middleof his partner's interview and pulled a gunon the fieldworker, demanding to see thequestionnaire. Because of prior training, theinterviewer had the presence of mind togive the man an English version of thequestionnaire, which he was unable toread. 10\"Dummy\" questionnaires would also have been helpful in this situation. The most common risk for fieldwork- ers, however, is the emotional toll of listen-ing to women's repeated stories of despair,physical pain, and degradation. It is hardto overestimate the emotional impact thatresearch on violence may have on field-ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR RESEARCHING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN Researchers in a study performed in Cambodia found a young woman who was held prisoner in her own home by her husband. When the research team arrived to interview her, they found the woman locked in her house, with only a peephole where a chain was threaded through a crudely cut hole in the door. The womanconducted the interview through the peephole. During the interview, the husbandappeared and was suspicious about their activity. The team gave him a falseexplanation for their visit and then left the home. The next day, the team sought help from the Ministry of Women's Affairs, which co- sponsored the study. Secretariat staff informed the researchers that the woman's hus-band had stormed into their office the preceding afternoon, dragging his wife by the arm. He demanded to know who had been at his door. He told the Secretariat personnel that if they couldn't confirm her explanation, then his wife would suffer.They readily confirmed her story. She was safe for the moment, but the researchersrealized that it would be too dangerous to ever approach this woman again. The team made several overtures with different government officials and the police to help get the woman freed, but everyone was afraid to intervene because thewoman's husband had an important position. Researchers described the frustrationthat the team felt at not being able to free the woman and the guilt they felt at having put the woman in greater danger. (From Zimmerman, 1995.8)BOX 2.5 PROTECTING RESPONDENT SAFETY IN CAMBODIA Interview in Bangladesh PHOTO BY HAFM JANSEN42 Researching Violence Against Womenworkers and researchers. As the narrative from a Nicaraguan fieldworker presented atthe beginning of this chapter illustrates, astudy on violence often becomes anintensely personal and emotional journeyfor which many researchers are not pre- pared. Particularly when field staff havehad personal experiences of abuse, theexperience can be overwhelming. JudithHerman, in her work on psychologicaltrauma in survivors of political and domes-tic violence, describes this as a commonexperience for those who study violence: To study psychological trauma is to come face to face both with human vulnerabilityin the natural world and with the capacityfor evil in human nature. To study psycho-logical trauma means bearing witness tohorrible events. 15 Including discussions of violence in interviewer training is crucial for reducingdistress during fieldwork. During fieldwork,another important measure is to provideinterviewers and research staff with regularopportunities for emotional debriefing, orwhen necessary, individual counseling.Researchers have used a variety of creativestrategies for protecting the emotionalhealth of their staff. In Peru, for example,the WHO multi-country team employed aprofessional counselor to lead weekly sup-port sessions that incorporated guidedimagery and relaxation techniques.Experience has repeatedly demonstratedthat emotional support for fieldworkers isessential. Not only does it help interview-ers withstand the demands of the field-work, but it also improves their ability togather quality data. Transcripts of debriefing sessions with interviewers who participated in studieswithout adequate support illustrate thispoint: ...When I heard stories about women being beaten and tied up, I would leavethere feeling desperate... I would be awreck, and my supervisor would tell me\"get a hold of yourself, you cry for every lit-tle thing.\" But how could I control myself? Icouldn't stand it... I would try, but some-times it was impossible, and I would burstinto tears during the next interview...(Nicaraguan interviewer) 2 Other interviewers commented that they felt extremely drained and distracted by theinterviews where women reported vio-lence. One woman reported that she hadstopped working for the study because shecould not bear to listen to women's storiesof abuse. 2 Experience has shown that trauma- related stress is not confined to field staffwho are directly involved with respon-dents. Field supervisors, transcribers, driv-ers, and even data entry personnel may beaffected. In one study in Belize, a tran-scriber broke down after hours of listeningto in-depth qualitative interviews with sur-vivors of abuse. 16 It is particularly important to provide opportunities during training for inter-viewers to address their own experiencesof abuse. Given the high prevalence ofgender-based violence globally, it is likelythat a substantial proportion of interview-ers will have experienced gender-basedviolence themselves at some point. Theseexperiences need to be taken into consid-eration. Most people learn to cope withpainful past experiences, and usually donot dwell on them in their everyday lives.However, when trainees are confrontedwith the subject matter the informationmay awaken disturbing images and oremotions. For many trainees, simplyacknowledging the fact that these reac-tions are normal and providing timelyopportunities to discuss them will be suffi-cient to help them complete the trainingand participate successfully in fieldwork.In those rare cases where feelings becometoo overwhelming, trainees should besupported in their decision to withdrawfrom the study.CHAPTER TWOA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 43MAXIMIZING BENEFITS TO PARTICIPANTS AND COMMUNITIES(BENEFICENCE) The principle of beneficence refers to the ethical obligation to maximize possiblebenefits to study participants and thegroup of individuals to which they belong.This principle gives rise to norms requiringthat the risks of research be reasonable inlight of the expected benefits, that theresearch design be sound, and that theinvestigators be competent both to conductthe research and to ensure the well-beingof participants. The interview as an intervention Asking women to reveal stories of traumacan be a transforming experience for bothresearchers and respondents. Indeed, thereis ample evidence that most women wel-come the opportunity to tell their stories if they are asked in a sympathetic, non-judgmental way. In our experience,women rarely refuse to answer questionson violence. Many women who disclose violence in surveys have never told anyone abouttheir situations. 17Many studies find that participants find the experience to be sohelpful that they ask fieldworkers to \"inter-view\" a friend or relative who has a storyto tell. As Herman notes, \"rememberingand telling the truth about terrible eventsare prerequisites both for the restoration ofthe social order and for the healing ofindividual victims.\" 15 Even the act of telling her story can offer a woman some small way of trans-forming her personal ordeal into a way tohelp others. Indeed, researchers sensitiveto this issue encourage interviewers andfield staff to take hope and satisfactionfrom their participation in the process ofgiving a voice to women's suffering. A qualitative study of survivors ofabuse who had visited a women's crisiscenter in Nicaragua found that a centralpart of women's process of recovery andpersonal as well as collective empower-ment came not only from increasedknowledge of their rights, but also fromthe opportunity to share their experiencesand to help other women in similar situa-tions. 18In this sense, asking women about experiences of violence may be seen asan intervention in itself. At the very least,asking conveys the message that violenceis a topic worthy of study, and not ashameful or unimportant issue. In this same vein, many fieldworkers in the Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua, research describedthe experience of listening to women's sto-ries, as well as the opportunity to tell theirown stories in the debriefing sessions, as aprofoundly healing experience. One inter-viewer who had never before discussedher experiences said, [when I joined this study] I felt that I had finally found someone I couldtell everything to, someone withwhom I could share my bur-den, because it's horrible to feelso alone. Now I feel that aweight has been taken offme...I feel relieved... 19 The interview is also an opportunity to provide womenwith information on gender-based violence.Many studies have issued small cards thatcan be easily hidden in a shoe or inside ablouse with information about localresources for abused women and messagessuch as, \"If you are being abused, thereare ways out\" or \"Violence is never justi-fied.\" Such messages may enable womento see experiences in a new light or toidentify violence in others close to them. Researchers also stress the importance of ending the interview on a note thatemphasizes women's strengths and tries tominimize distress, particularly as a respon-dent may have revealed information thatETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR RESEARCHING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN Remembering and telling the truth about terrible events are prerequisites both for the restoration of the social order and for the healing of individual victims. (Herman, 1992.15)44 Researching Violence Against Womenmade her feel vulnerable.20A number of studies have carefully scripted such end-ings to ensure that the interview finisheswith clear statements that explicitlyacknowledge the abuse, highlight theunacceptability of the violence, and emphasise the respondent's strengths inenduring and/or ending the violence. TheWHO study ends each interview with thewords, \"From what you have told me, I can tell that you have had some very difficulttimes in your life. No one has the right totreat someone else in that way. However,from what you have told me I can also seethat you are strong and have survivedthrough some difficult circumstances.\" 7 One indication of how women have viewed the interview process can beobtained by assessing respondents' satisfac-tion with the interview. At the end of theWHO interview, respondents were askedthe following question: \"I have askedabout many difficult things. How has talk-ing about these things made you feel?\" Theanswers were written down verbatim andcoded by the interviewer the followingthree categories: good/better, bad/worse,and same/no difference. The majority(between 60 and 95 percent in seven sites)of women who had experienced physicalor sexual partner violence reported thatthey felt good/better at the end of theinterview. In most countries, the range wassimilar between women who had or hadnot experienced partner violence. Very fewwomen reported feeling worse after beinginterviewed. Between 0.5 and 8.4 percentof women reporting partner violence ever(highest in Peru) and between zero and 3.2percent of women with no history of part-ner violence felt worse. 17 Assuring scientific soundness The CIOMS guidelines note: \"A study thatis scientifically unsound is unethical in thatit exposes subjects to risk or inconveniencewhile achieving no benefit in knowledge.\" 3 This principle is particularly important inthe area of gender-based violence wherewomen are asked to disclose difficult andpainful experiences and where the act ofresearch itself may put women at furtherrisk of abuse. Thus the WHO guidelinesnote that violence researchers have an ethi-cal responsibility to ensure the soundnessof their work by selecting a large enoughsample size to permit conclusions to bedrawn, and by building upon currentknowledge about how to minimize under-reporting of violence. (See Chapter 7 formore discussion of sampling techniques.)Underreporting of violence will dilute asso-ciations between potential risk factors andhealth outcomes, leading to falsely nega-tive results. Underestimating the dimen-sions of violence may also preventviolence intervention programs fromreceiving the priority they deserve in theallocation of resources. Research demonstrates that disclosure rates of violence are highly influenced bythe design and wording of questions, thetraining of interviewers, and the imple-mentation of the study. 2In Chapter 6, we discuss this issue in much greater depthand outline the variety of measures thathave been developed to enhance disclo-sure of violence. CHAPTER TWO Looking for households in SamoaPHOTO BY HAFM JANSENA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 45Using study results for social change It is important to feed research findings into ongoing advocacy, policy making,and intervention activities. Too often criti-cal research findings never reach the atten-tion of the policy makers and advocatesbest positioned to use them. The enor-mous personal, social, and health-relatedcosts of violence against women place amoral obligation on researchers anddonors to try to ensure that study findingsare applied in the real world. It is alsoimportant that the study communityreceives early feedback on the results ofthe research in which it has participated.Chapter 14 addresses this issue in moredetail and describes several successfulexamples of how research findings havebeen used to contribute to changing lawsand policies on domestic violence. One way to improve the relevance of research projects is, from the outset, toinvolve organizations that carry out advo-cacy and direct support for survivors ofviolence, either as full partners in theresearch or as members of an advisorycommittee. Such committees can play animportant role in helping guide the studydesign, advise on the wording of ques-tions, assist with interviewer training, andgive guidance on possible forms of analy-sis and the interpretation of results. Thesegroups also have a central role to play inpublicizing and applying the project'sfindings. JUSTICE: BALANCING RISKS AND BENEFITS OFRESEARCH ON VIOLENCEAGAINST WOMEN Research, like any endeavor that touches people's lives, involves inherent risks. Theprinciple of distributive justice demandsthat the class of individuals bearing theburden of research should receive anappropriate benefit, and those who standETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR RESEARCHING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN to benefit most should bear a fair propor-tion of the risks and burdens of the study. In the case of gender-based violence research, the risks are potentially large, butso too are the risks of ignorance, silence,and inaction. Researchers and ethicalreview boards must constantly balance thisreality. Lisa Fontes cites the case of a col-league from India who wanted to studywives who were hospitalized after havingbeen burned by their husbands in disputesover dowry. She ultimatelydecided not to conduct theresearch for fear that theresearch would put women atfurther risk. As Fontesobserves, \"Her decision elimi-nated the research-related riskto the participants, but alsoeliminated the potential benefitof reducing the terrible isola-tion and vulnerability of thesevictims.\" 21 It is possible to conduct research on violence with full respect forethical and safety considerations if propercare and resources are devoted to this end.We must remember that women living withviolence are already at risk. Researcherscannot eliminate this reality, just as theycannot fully eliminate the possibility thatfurther harm will be caused by their study.The obligation of researchers is to carefullyweigh the risks and benefits of any studyand to take every measure possible to limitpossible harm and to maximize possiblebenefit. At the very least, we must ensurethat when women take risks to share theirstories, we honor that risk by using thefindings for social change. Women would ask me what this survey was for, and how it would help them. I would tell them that we won't see the solution tomorrow or the next year. Our daughters and granddaughters will see the fruits of this work, maybe things will be better by then. Nicaraguan fieldworker.

DIFFERENT TYPES OF RESEARCH There are many different types of research and the language of research can be daunt-ing. For the purposes of this manual, weD eveloping a research strategy may be the most crucial task in any researchproject. The entire project can be derailedby errors in this phase. Common errorsinclude research questions that are not wellconceptualized or articulated, a researchdesign that is not well suited to the task, ormethods that do not match the needs ofthe project or the skills and resources athand. With proper planning, however,these pitfalls can be avoided. Which elements are most critical to developing an effective research pro- posal protocol ? This chapter begins with a brief overview of the different types ofresearch and the roles they can play instrengthening the global response to vio-lence against women. It continues with adiscussion of the early steps in the researchprocess\u2014namely, formulating the researchCHAPTER THREE Developing a Research Strategy Topics covered in this chapter: Different types of research The research processChoosing a research topic and objectivesFormulating your research questionsChoosing a research designQuantitative or qualitative methods?Population- or service-based research?Collaboration between researchers and activistsDrafting the protocol50 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER THREE have adopted the following typology to describe the many different types of research (see Table 3.1). Basic research is dedicated to advanc- ing theory and may not necessarily answerquestions that have obvious program or pol-icy implications. Applied research uses many of the same techniques but concen-trates on asking questions of more immedi-ate, practical relevance. Formative or exploratory research tends to be less in- depth and is geared toward generating thebackground insights and knowledge neces-sary to pursue further research or to designan actual intervention. Operationsresearch concentrates on improving the process of ongoing interventions.Evaluation research helps evaluate the impact or success of interventions. This manual concentrates primarily on the logic and tools of formative and applied research. All types of research are important and can make substantial contri-butions to knowledge in the field of gen-der violence. Theory building, evaluation,and operations research are complex fieldsin their own right, however, and arebeyond the scope of this book. THE RESEARCH PROCESS Four basic steps are common to virtuallyall research projects: Identify a problem to study Collect data Analyze the data Report the results Box 3.1 presents a more detailed list of the steps that are commonly taken toachieve the goals of the study. The orderin which these steps are performed andthe techniques used to achieve them mayvary widely from study to study dependingon the researcher's theoretical frame-work\u2014the underlying assumptions abouthow knowledge is produced. The two main traditions within research\u2014positivistic and naturalisticinquiry\u2014approach the enterprise in dis-tinctly different ways. Positivistic inquiry , also known as science-based or deductiveinquiry, generally starts with a hypothesisand proceeds to test it in a systematic andlinear way (see Figure 3.1). In contrast, nat- uralistic inquiry (also known as interpre- tive inquiry ) concentrates on studying the natural environment without manipulationor predetermined constraints on the out-come. The research process in naturalisticinquiry tends to follow a circular path.

This is referred to as an emer- gent design because the actual focus of the study and even the methods used for data collection and analysis may emerge as the study progresses. Naturalistic studiestend to use qualitative research methodsand positivistic studies tend to use quantita-tive methods. Both traditions can be eitherdescriptive or analytic and both can play animportant role in the study of violenceagainst women. This manual presentsexamples from both approaches. CHOOSING A RESEARCH TOPIC AND OBJECTIVES The first step in any research endeavor is to identify a problem or area that couldbenefit from further investigation. In thefield of violence there are hundreds of top-ics worthy of further study. One simplyneeds to determine what kind of informa-tion is most needed in a specific context. The next step in the process is to narrow the focus of inquiry to a topic amenable toinvestigation. Guiding questions here are:What do you want to know and what isworth knowing? Researchers generallybegin to narrow their topic by gatheringand reading all the relevant articles andbooks on the subject (also known as a \"lit-erature review\"). It is very important toidentify what is already known about anissue before deciding on a research topic.Otherwise, you risk either \"reinventing thewheel\" or investigating questions that donot contribute to advancing knowledge orimproving people's quality of life. When the research impulse emerges from the need of a service provider, an NGO, oran activist group, it may be relatively easy todefine a research objective. For example,you may be a family planning provider whowants to know the degree to which coercionFollowing are some of the most important steps that will need to be taken in the course of most studies. There may be some differences according to whether theresearch is based primarily on quantitative or qualitative methods. Problem formulation Explore the research problem through contacts with community representatives,health workers, local women's groups, and through a review of the published andunpublished literature. Formulate the research problem; discuss within the research team and with others concerned to get suggestions and identify a conceptual framework. Formulate and decide on research objectives, study design, study area, studypopulation, and study methods. Operationalize the variables under study.* Design an appropriate sampling plan or strategy. Prepare draft questionnaire.* Plan for initial data analysis. Translate materials, questionnaires, forms. Plan for study personnel, equipment to be used, transport, accommodation,finance, and other logistics. Write a preliminary study protocol. Organization Obtain consent from the participating communities (individually or via representatives). Obtain consent from other local, district, or national authorities concerned. Obtain financial support. Obtain ethical clearance from ethical review committee. Develop manual or instructions for fieldworkers. Organize support network for women participants and fieldworkers. Obtain educational materials on violence for use by study participants. Recruit fieldworkers. Train fieldworkers. Pilot study of organization, questionnaire, equipment, standardize measurementprocedures.* Revise questionnaire, instructions to fieldworkers, study protocol.* Fieldwork Supervise fieldwork. Edit interviews to identify errors.* Maintain contact with the local community to ensure a good participation in and support for the study. Hold \"debriefing\" sessions with fieldworkers to avoid \"burnout.\" Analysis and reporting Control data entry to minimize errors.* Discuss quality of data, difficulties with certain questions, and routines with fieldworkers.* Inspect the data matrix together, collaborate with fieldworkers in the control andclearing of data.* Perform preliminary analysis, discuss with the research team and with communityrepresentatives and relevant authorities. Complete final analysis and interpretation. Report back to community, health authorities, and political authorities. Discuss consequences and possible actions. Present results in reports and publications both for local and broader audiences, where relevant. Plan for intervention and evaluation. * These steps are particularly relevant for quantitative studies.

Or you may be the director of awomen's shelter who wants to know what happens to women once theyleave your care. Even here it isimportant to investigate whatmay already be known aboutthe topic, either in the researchliterature or by others in thecommunity. When the motivation for research comes from outside the local community, perhapsfrom a university or government agency, it isespecially important to to involve others\u2014preferably service providers and activists\u2014inthe process of refining your research topic.One way to do this is to consult with localstakeholders or individuals who, by virtue of their work and/or life experience, mayhave insights into questions that need to beasked, and answered. This can take the formof consultation with a local advisory board,or individual meetings with women's groups and others who may haveopinions on what researchwould be useful to pursue.Consulting with potential stake-holders early in the processcan help ensure that the research is both relevant and doable, and itcan help build trust and alliances with thevery groups that will probably be in a posi-tion to use and disseminate the findings. Toooften researchers only seek out localwomen's groups or other nongovernmentalorganizations when they want access to aresearch population (e.g., approaching alocal shelter in order to find \"abusedwomen\" to interview). Not surprisingly, thiscan breed resentment and distrust. FORMULATING YOUR RESEARCH QUESTIONS The next task is to express your research interests in simply worded, direct questions,preferably one question for each topic.The research questions should supportyour research objectives. Table 3.2 givesseveral examples of how you might goabout developing research questions. Youmay start out with many more questionsthan can be resolved in a single study. Ifyou do, trim the list to a manageablenumber. This can be a sensitive process,particularly if you are balancing the needsof different actors. For example, the kindof information that a governmentalwomen's institute would like to collect onviolence may be quite different from thedata that women activists need for advo-cacy purposes, or what a researcher mightconsider important from a theoretical per-spective. Although reaching a consensusregarding the research questions can betime-consuming, including the perspec-tives of stakeholders at this stage is likelyto greatly increase the potential impact ofthe study results. Remember that as a rule, research ques- tions in qualitative research can be initiallymore general, because they will be refinedas data are collected and analyzed.However, in quantitative research, whenconducting surveys, for example, you needto determine the research questions beforedata collection begins because they formthe basis for establishing the hypotheses tobe tested. (See Table 3.2.) CHOOSING A RESEARCH DESIGN Many organizations interested in using research to improve the quality of theirprograms or services make the same mis-take: They choose a study design beforeclarifying exactly what information isneeded. We recommend that you carefullyconsider alternative study designs, andchoose one that best addresses theresearch objectives and is most likely toanswer the research questions you haveCHAPTER THREE The best way to build trust and long-term allies is to include individuals and organizations in the process of establishing research topics and questions. Decide on a research design or on data collection methods after you decide what you want to know.A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 53carried out with a sample size that is too small to yield significant results mayunderestimate the prevalence of violenceor its impact on a given population,which could in turn negatively affect poli-cies or program funding. While there is a wide range of different research designs available to address differ-ent research questions, this manual willDEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY developed. This decision must, of course,take into account what is feasible given aproject's material and human resources. Ifyou cannot implement the most appropri-ate design for a given research question, itis better to change the focus of theresearch or to modify the design. A poorlydesigned study may actually do moreharm than good. For example, a survey Research Objective A Cambodian woman's advocacy organization wanted to determine how widespread violence was in Cambodia and how women responded to domesticviolence. They also wanted understand how community members viewed victims and perpetrators of abuse. The purpose of the research was to bolster lobbying effortsand to produce a public awareness campaign. 4, 5 An international organization working with Somali refugees in Kenya was interested in finding out more about sexual violence in the refugee camps. Aid workers had heard rumors that a number of women in the camp were raped when they left the camp to get firewood and feared that some pregnancies may have been theproduct of forced sex by guards or bandits. 6, 7 The International Planned Parenthood Federation,Western Hemisphere Division (IPPF/WHD) initiated a program to integrate screening and care for survivors of gender-based violence within reproductive health programs in Venezuela, Peru, and the Dominican Republic. The program managers wanted to evaluate how the program had succeeded in changing the atti-tudes and practices of health providers and whetherwomen felt satisfied with the care they were receiving. 8 A Voluntary Testing and Counseling (VCT) clinic in Tanzania was interested in finding out whether the threat of violence after disclosure of HIV status was an obstacle for women to come in for testing. The program man- agers also wanted to know whether violence was a riskfactor for women contracting HIV. 9Research Question How common is abuse by an intimate partner in Cambodia? How common is forced sex? Who are the perpetrators? Where does the violence take place?In the home? On the street? At work? Other places? To whom do women turn after they have been victim- ized? What services do they think are important? How commonly do community members subscribe tocommon rape myths? Do women in the camps feel at risk of rape? What are the most common circumstances of forced sex? Who are the perpetrators? What do women and men think could be done to improve women's safety? What did the health promoters know about domestic vio- lence prior to the training? What did they learn duringthe training course about the identification, assessment, and referral of abused women and children? Was therea positive change in providers' attitudes towards victims of violence? How many women attending family plan-ning and sexually transmitted infection clinics were askedabout violence? How many were appropriately referred according to the protocols developed? How satisfied were women with the care they received at the clinics? What percentage of women attending voluntary clinical treatment services have been physically or sexually abused by their partners? Did the violence take place before the testing or afterwards? Was fear of violence an important issue in women's ability to protect them- selves from HIV? Was fear of violence a reason that women might be reluctant to go for VCT?Possible Study Design Population-based survey of men and women Focus group discussions with community leaders In-depth interviews with survivors of violence Survey of women in the camp In-depth interviewsParticipatory appraisal Before and after surveys of providers' attitudes and knowledge Review of service data Focus groups with providers and clients Exit interviews with clients Survey of clients In-depth interviewsFocus groups with community men and womenTABLE 3.2 SELECTING A RESEARCH DESIGN Examples of different methods that might be used for different research questions. Descriptions of the specific methods are pro vided in later chapters. (Adapted from Shrader, 2000.3)54 Researching Violence Against Womenfocus on five broad types of designs that are often used in public health research. Quantitative approaches Cross-sectional surveys Cohort studies Case-control studies Qualitative approaches Rapid assessment techniques In-depth qualitative studies These study designs will be described in greater depth in Chapters 4 and 5. QUANTITATIVE OR QUALITATIVE METHODS? Quantitative research methods produce information that can be presented and ana-lyzed with numbers, such as the percentageof women who have been raped or whoattend shelters for battered women. These methods are drawn largelyfrom the fields of epidemiol-ogy, sociology, economics,and psychology. In contrast,qualitative methods gather information that is presentedprimarily in text form throughnarratives, verbatim quotes, descriptions, lists, and case studies.Qualitative methods are primarily borrowedfrom the disciplines of anthropology, soci-ology, nursing, and psychology. As wementioned earlier, although research meth-ods are not necessarily tied to a specifictheoretical tradition, quantitative methods tend to be used in researchusing a positivistic or post-positivistic framework,whereas qualitative methodsare more associated with thenaturalistic or interpretiveframework.The two approaches represent different research paradigms , or views about the nature of reality and how knowledge isproduced. The positivistic paradigmassumes that there is only one true versionof reality and that it can be uncoveredthrough scientific research. In contrast, thenaturalistic paradigm assumes that reality issubjective rather than objective\u2014it exists inthe views, feelings, and interpretations ofindividuals, including the researcher.According to this perspective, many differ-ent and equally valid versions of realitymay exist at the same time, and some ofthese versions may actually be createdthrough the interaction of researchers andsubjects. Positivistic researchers try toreduce outside influences or biasto a min- imum, whereas naturalistic researchersbelieve that research is inherently biased.They try to be aware of different sourcesof subjective bias, for example, by keepingreflexive journals of their own reactionsand thoughts throughout the researchprocess. A third paradigm has emerged in recent years, known as a critical or \"emancipatory\"paradigm. 10-12According to Ford-Gilboe and colleagues, \"The aim of research within thecritical paradigm is the development ofapproaches that have the potential toexpose hidden power imbalances and toempower those involved to understand, aswell as to transform, the world.\" 12Critical theory is embraced by most feminist andparticipatory researchers, and because itemphasizes uncovering power relationsbased on class, gender, and ethnicity, it isparticularly well suited for research on vio-lence against women. 13As Ulin and col- leagues point out, \"An important premise offeminist theory is that social life and behav-ior are constrained in various ways by whatis considered acceptable behavior based ongender. Feminist research focuses on thepolitical dimension inherent in understand-ing these constraints from the standpoints ofCHAPTER THREE Quantitative methods usually produce findings that can be summarized in numbers. Qualitative methods produce results that are commonly summarized in words or pictures. Quantitative methods tend to provide less in-depth information about many people, while qualitative methods give more detailed information about relatively few people.A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 55people in different power and gender posi- tions.\"14Because the underlying goal is to contribute to social change, criticalresearchers tend to be more pragmatic inthe use of methods, and often use a combi-nation of qualitative and quantitative datadepending on what is likely to be most per-suasive to policy makers and to the public. 12 Quantitative methods are useful for drawing conclusions that are valid for thebroader population under study. They areparticularly appropriate for measuring thefrequency of a problem or condition andits distribution in a population (for exam-ple, how many women in a communityhave experienced violence and which agegroups are most affected). Surveys areoften used to obtain information aboutpeople's opinions and behavior, for exam-ple through Knowledge, Attitudes, andPractices (KAP) surveys. When quantitativedata are collected about a group of peoplethat is chosen using special methodsknown as \"random sampling techniques,\" itis possible to carry out statistical analysisand to generalize the results of the study toa larger population. (For more informationabout sampling techniques, see Chapter 7.)If the target group of the program is notvery large\u2014for example, if it is limited to asingle community\u2014then it may be possibleto survey all homes or individuals in thestudy population (i.e., conduct a census). The main disadvantage of surveys is that they often provide fairly superficial infor-mation, and may not contribute much tounderstanding complex processes or theircauses. For example, a survey may indicatehow many women are experiencing vio-lence or how many have heard an educa-tional message, but it provides lessinformation about how women experienceviolence, or how well they understood theeducational message. Qualitative methodsare more appropriate when the aim is togain understanding about a process, orwhen an issue is being studied for the firsttime in a particular setting. Qualitativeresults allow you to understand thenuances and details of complex social phe-nomena from the respondents' point ofview. Although you cannot say your find-ings are true for everyone, you can revealmultiple layers of meaning for a particulargroup of people. This level of understand-ing is particularly important when studyinghuman behavior and trying to discern howit interacts with people's beliefs, attitudes,and perceptions. As an example, the National Committee for the Abandonment of Harmful TraditionalPractices in Mali, a network of organizationsthat work to discourage female genital muti-lation (FGM), wanted to learn why someapproaches had been more successful thanothers in motivating villages to abandonFGM. Instead of carrying out a population-based survey to measure individual behav-iors and attitudes towards FGM, theydecided to carry out a qualitative study inthree villages where the practice of FGMhad been abandoned. Although this studydid not give information about the numberof villages that had taken this step, it pro-vided very rich information about the differ-ent issues and considerations that helpedvillage leaders and community membersmake their decision. For the purpose ofimproving community-levelinterventions, this study wasmuch more useful than a sur-vey would have been. 15 Most research objectives are best achieved through a com-bination of qualitative andquantitative methodologies. Weencourage researchers to use avariety of methods to look atthe same issue, or triangulation , to enhance the validity and utility of theirresearch. Because triangulation allows you toview your subject from different perspectivesand to look for potential inconsistencies, itincreases the validity and trustworthiness ofDEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY Triangulation refers to the use of more than one method to look at the same issue. It can also involve the use of one method on different study populations. Triangulation helps to ensure that your findings are trustworthy, or convincing to others.56 Researching Violence Against Womenyour findings. For example, the results of survey research may be complemented andenriched by in-depth interviews with a sub-sample of women who were interviewed.Their words, thoughts, and observationslend depth and meaning to the numbersgenerated to describe the essentially painfulreality of physical and sexual abuse.Similarly, one can strengthen qualitative datadisplays and narrative with references topopulation-based data, thereby giving anapproximation of how widespread certaintypes of violent behavior are. In Nicaragua, researchers combined the results of a survey of 488 women on expe-riences of violence with narratives of threewomen's experiences obtained through in-depth interviews. 16The narratives covered many of the same themes as the survey,and often provided moving illustrations ofhow women felt about the violence.Figure 3.2 illustrates how survey resultsand narratives may be used to provide different perspectives on how children areaffected by domestic violence. Althoughthe feelings expressed by the youngwoman cannot be generalized to all bat-tered women, her story provides a win-dow into the devastating impact that abusecan have on women and their children.This type of insight is difficult to obtainfrom numbers. Likewise, a research project in Tanzania used qualitative and quantitative methodsto examine how violence affectedwomen's decisions to seek VCT forHIV/AIDS. 9Through in-depth interviews with men and women, the researcherslearned about how testing and disclosureof HIV status could lead to violence. Twowomen described the aftermath of disclos-ing their seropositive status with the fol-lowing words: \"It took two weeks to tell him. He told me, 'You know who has brought it?' I told him,'If you are blaming me then blame me, butyou are the one who has brought it.'\" \"When I informed him of the results there was endless violence in the house.\" In a second stage, the researchers inter- viewed 245 women who attended theclinic, and asked them standardized ques-tions about experiences of violence. Theyfound that HIV positive women were twiceas likely to have been beaten by a partnerthan were HIV negative women, andamong young women, HIV positivewomen were ten times more likely to havebeen beaten than HIV negative women.The researchers concluded that violence isa risk factor for HIV/AIDS because it limitswomen's ability to protect themselves.Moreover, HIV positive women are atgreater risk of physical abuse if they dis-close their serostatus. It was difficult todetermine from survey data alone whenthe violence took place in relation to dis-closure of serostatus. Thus, the qualitativeinformation provided insights useful ininterpreting the survey results.CHAPTER THREE FIGURE 3.2 AN EXAMPLE OF COMBINING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA \"Mommy, you look like a monster\" \"When he would beat me, my daughters would get involved in the fight. Then he would throw them around in his fury, and this hurt me more than when he beat me. ...and once, I was recovering after he had beaten me, and my daughtercame up to me and said \"Mommy, you look like a monster.\" And she began to cry, and what really hurt me wasn't so much the blows, it was her sobbing and the bitterness that she was feeling...

A key decision regarding design is whether to draw one's sample from the communityat large (this is often referred to as a \"popu-lation-based study\") or from a serviceprovider, for example, a women's crisis cen-ter or a community health center. The deci-sion should be based on the goals andobjectives of your research. If the goal of the research is to evaluate a service (e.g.,how well the women's police station meetsvictims' needs) or determine what propor-tion of emergency room clients suffer abuse,then it makes sense to focus your researchon women attending these services. If, how-ever, your goal is to be able to say some-thing that applies to abuse victims moregenerally, then it is important to recruit yoursample from the community at large. Toooften, researchers rely on service-based data(police statistics, hospital records, or inter-views with women attending crisis services)to draw conclusions about patterns of phys-ical or sexual abuse in a larger population.In reality, these data apply only to womenwho seek formal services\u2014a group that dif-fers substantially from the full universe ofabused women and children. Women thatmake their way into police or hospitalrecords have frequently suffered moresevere abuse and are more likely to havebeen abused by a stranger than women thatdo not report abuse. An example of this can be seen in the comparison of results from two studies car-ried out in Nicaragua on sexual abuse ofchildren. One study was based on policerecords, and included only cases of abusethat were reported to the police. This studyconcluded that in 95 percent of child sexualabuse cases girls were the victims of abuse. 17 In contrast, a study carried out in Le\u00f3n,Nicaragua, asked men and women whowere randomly selected from the communityto respond to an anonymous questionnaireabout their experiences of sexual abuse inchildhood. This study found that 30 percentof the total number of incidents of child sex-ual abuse were reported by men. 18These findings indicate that either boys are lesslikely than girls to disclose abuse when ithappens, perhaps because of shame or fearof being stigmatized, or that parents are lesslikely to report cases of abuse of boys to thepolice. This comparison shows that theinformation obtained from service-based samples can differ greatly from resultsobtained from a community-based survey. Record reviews can nonetheless yield important information, especially about thequality of services that women receive fromhealth and justice system professionals. Acase in point is a study conducted by theSouth African NGO ADAPT that reviewedthe charts of 398 women presenting with ahistory of assault to the CasualtyDepartment of Alexandra Health Clinic dur-ing October and November in 1991.(Alexandra Township is a rapidly urbanizingcommunity near the heart of Johannesburg.)This study found that providers failed torecord the identity of the perpetrator in 78percent of cases. The charts included onlydisembodied descriptions of the violencesuch as \"chopped with an axe\" or \"stabbedwith a knife.\" Organizers used these data toemphasize to clinic administrators the needto sensitize providers to issues of violenceand to encourage more complete and accu-rate documentation. 19 In another example, the IPPF carried out a study before initiating a program to trainproviders to screen for abuse in three LatinAmerican countries (Peru, Venezuela, andDominican Republic). They reviewedrecords to see how many women werebeing asked about violence in reproductivehealth clinics, and carried out a surveyamong providers to measure their knowl-edge and attitudes towards survivors ofviolence. By carrying out periodic follow-up surveys and record reviews, programDEVELOPING A RESEARCH STRATEGY58 Researching Violence Against Womenmanagers were able to measure changes in attitudes as a result of training, andincreases in screening and care for survivorsof violence. 8 COLLABORATION BETWEEN RESEARCHERSAND ACTIVISTS Throughout this manual, we emphasize the importance of creating partnershipsbetween researchers and those who are ina position to use the research effectively,such as service providers, governmentagencies, women's health advocates, orNGOs. We believe that this is the best wayto ensure that research objectives aregrounded in local needs and perspectives,and that the results will be used for pro-moting social change. Those who work with victims of abuse alsobring knowledge and skillsthat will surely enrich theresearch process and improveits quality. We recognize, however, that successful partnershipsbetween researchers and prac-titioners are not always easyto forge, as each group bringsa different set of expectations,needs, and skills to theendeavor. Practitioners fre-quently worry that the research process could compromise theirprimary mission or undermine services.Researchers, for their part, often fear thatnonresearchers may not appreciate theimportance of scientific rigor. There is also a legacy of past experi- ences that any potential collaboration mustovercome. Researchers are sometimes sur-prised when their overtures to activists orservice providers are met with suspicion.They don't realize that many activists havehad negative experiences with researchers. At a 1993 symposium on researcharound sexual coercion, a panel of serviceproviders and activists explored the originsof the historical tension betweenresearchers and community-based organi-zations. As panel members explained,many NGOs had experiences with researchin the past that left them distrustful ofrequests to \"collaborate\" on research.Frequently, they noted, researchers appearmore concerned with their own profes-sional advancement than with the well-being of the respondents. The powerimbalance between researcher and respon-dent becomes especially problematic whennorthern researchers conduct research insouthern countries. Panelists could allrelate instances in which research resultsfrom developing countries were widelyreported at international conferences, butremained unavailable and unknown in thehost country. At the same time, all panelists could give examples of research collaborations thatwere highly positive. In these examples,the researchers involved the serviceproviders or community group in the for-mulation of the research questions. Theinvestigators treated the NGO as a truepartner, as opposed to a site for research.They also recognized the practical expert-ise that comes from years of living with orworking on an issue. Most importantly, thestudy generated knowledge that was use-ful, not only for advancing the field of vio-lence research, but also for improving thework of the service providers. Past experiences have highlighted the following points as key to facilitating suc-cessful collaboration: 20-22 Flexibility Shared goals Clear sense of responsibilities and roles Benefits on both sides Mutual respect and recognition of eachother's strengths Equal access to funding and creditCHAPTER THREE \"Collaboration works best when there is mutual learning on both sides,\" notes Gita Misra of SAKHI, a community- based group that works with South Asian battered women in New York City. SAKHI encourages anyone undertaking research on abuse in the South Asian community to participate in its 20-hour intensive training course for community volunteers.A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 59The last point is particularly important. The organization that controls the budgetin any collaboration often wields the great-est power. Collaborating partners, there-fore, should develop written agreements inadvance about how to allocate available resources and/or how practitioners andtheir agencies will be compensated fortheir time and expertise. The WHO VAW study has developed an effective model for research based onthe partnership between researchers, poli-cymakers and women's organizations thatwork on violence against women. Thegoals of the study explicitly includedstrengthening national capacity to address violence against women by raising aware-ness and fostering collaboration betweenlocal actors. To achieve this, eachnational research team includedresearchers with the technical skillsneeded to carry out the research, as wellas representatives from organizationsinvolved in work on violence againstwomen. In addition, consultative groupswere formed in each country to bringtogether policy makers, researchers, andactivists to oversee the implementation ofthe study. This process has helped estab-lish long-term working relationshipsbetween these groups that in some caseshave continued beyond the study. Boththe researchers and activists agree thatthis model of collaboration has beenimportant, both by increasing the qualityof the data and the interpretation of thefindings, and by ensuring that the resultsare used to inform policy changes. 23 DRAFTING THE PROTOCOL Once all the basic issues regarding studydesign have been resolved, it is time to draft the study protocol.

When appliedto the study of violence, cross-sectional sur-veys are useful for providing informationabout the proportion of women in a com-munity who have experienced or are cur-rently experiencing abuse. In the languageof epidemiology, this figure is known as aprevalence estimate . (See Box 6.1 in Chapter 6 for a description of how preva-lence estimates are calculated.) Cross-sectional surveys can also give valuable insights into elements that definethe context in which violence occurs: Characteristics and dynamics of abuse. How effectively women are beingreached by existing services. The attitudes of men and women withregard to violence.CHAPTER FOUR Quantitative Approaches to Research Topics covered in this chapter: Cross-sectional surveys Cohort studiesCase-control studies Interview in EthiopiaPHOTO BY M. ELLSBERG64 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER FOUR Cross-sectional surveys TheWHO Multi-country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence Against Women was initiated in 1997 with the aim of obtaining reliable and comparable data within and across culturally diverse countries on: The prevalence and frequency of different forms of physical, sexual, and emotional violence against women, particularly that in flicted by intimate partners. The association of violence by intimate partners with a range of health outcomes. Factors that may protect or put women at risk for intimate-partner violence. Strategies and services that women use to deal with the violence they experience. It had, in addition to these, a number of process-oriented objectives: To develop and test new instruments for measuring violence cross-culturally. To increase national capacity amongst researchers and women's organizations working on violence. To increase sensitivity to violence among researchers, policy makers and health providers. To promote a new model of research on domestic violence, involving women's organizations with expertise on violence against wom en and fully addressing safety issues and safeguarding women's well-being. Participating countries The study involves collaboration between WHO, international research organizations (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medic ine and PATH, an expert steering committee of international content experts (researchers and advocates), and country research teams inv olving research institutions and women's health and rights organizations. The countries that participated in the first stage of the WHO multi-c ountry study were: Bangladesh, Brazil, Thailand, Peru, Japan, Tanzania, and Namibia. Studies have also been performed in several other countries using the WHO methodology, including Samoa, Chile, Indonesia, Ethiopia, New Zealand, Serbia and Montenegro, and China. Study methodology The collection of rigorously sound and internationally comparable quantitative data on intimate partner violence has been a maj or focus of the WHO study. Qualitative data were also collected to inform the development and country adaptations of the questionnaire, as well as the inter- pretation of results. In most participating countries, the quantitative component of the study consisted of a cross-sectional p opulation-based house- hold survey conducted in two sites: the capital (or other large city) and one province with rural and urban populations. In eac h of these sites a representative sample of around 1,500 women aged 15 to 49 was selected to participate in face-to-face interviews. Women were as ked about experiences of violence from intimate partners as well as nonpartners. Mechanisms to ensure comparability across countries incl uded: a uniform core questionnaire, detailed documentation of the local adaptations to the core questionnaire (which were kept to a minimum), a standard module for interviewer training, the involvement of the core research team in all interviewer and data-processing training and in piloting activities, and the use of standardized procedures for data processing and analysis. Questionnaire A uniform core questionnaire with structured questions was used as the basis for all country questionnaires, with country modif ications related to either adding country-specific issues or ensuring appropriate response categories. The questionnaire consisted of 12 sections; early sections col- lected information on less sensitive issues, whilst more sensitive issues, including the nature and extent of partner and nonpa rtner violence, are introduced in later sections, after rapport has been established between interviewers and respondents. As in many other surveys of partner vio- lence, estimates of the prevalence of different forms of VAW were obtained by asking female respondents direct questions about their experience of specific acts of physical and sexual violence from any partner. Follow-up questions were asked regarding the timing and freq uency of violence. Women were also asked about experiences of emotionally abusive acts and controlling behaviors by their partners, and violence d uring pregnancy. Questions about women's experience of physical and sexual violence by nonpartners since the age of 15, and of sexual abuse by nonpartners before the age of 15, were also included in the study. Results The range of lifetime physical partner violence found among the sites was 13 to 61 percent of ever-partnered women. The range o f reported sex- ual violence was even greater, from 6 to 58 percent, whereas the range of women reporting either sexual and/or physical violenc e by a partner was 16 to 69 percent. In all of the sites, women who experienced physical and/or sexual violence consistently reported more em otional distress and recent physical problems such as pain, trouble walking, and dizziness.BOX 4.1 THE WHO MULTI-COUNTRY STUDY ON WOMEN'S HEALTH AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN1 (From WHO, 2005.1)A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 65It is often common for cross- sectional surveys to collectsome retrospective information(e.g., \"when did the violencebegin?\"). However, to deter-mine causality with greater pre- cision, it is preferable to study individuals over time,orlongitudinally . Longitudinal studies may be either prospective (forwards) orretrospective (historical). The most common public health research designs forcollecting longitudinal data, cohort studies orcase-control studies , will be described in the next section. COHORT STUDIES: EXPLORING THECONSEQUENCES OFVIOLENCE Cohort studies , also called follow-up or incidence studies , begin with a group of people (a cohort) that has not experi-enced a problem or condition. The peopleare classifiedaccording towhether wholecohort then over time whether with thesuspected risk factorare likely condi-tion disease thanthe group withoutprior exposure. (SeeFigure 4.1 for anexample of how acohort study couldbe applied to aQUANTITATIVE APPROACHES TO RESEARCH to discuss it, because no one has thoughtto ask them about it, or because it is considered as a natural part of culture.Therefore, prevalence data are oftenneeded to convince policy makers of boththe pervasiveness of violence and its seri-ous implications for women's health. Evensurveys carried out in a single region haveproven very useful in many countries indrawing attention to the dimensions of violence. Women's rights activists inCambodia, (described in Box 4.2)Zimbabwe, and Nicaragua used surveyresults with great success to create publicawareness around domestic violence, andto effect changes in national policy as wellas legislation. A cross-sectional survey may not be the most appropriate method to use if the goalis to determine the causes of violence orthe impact of violence on women's physi-cal or emotional well-being. Cross-sectionalstudies provide a snapshot of a conditionand its suspected causal agents (referred toas\"exposures\" or\"risk factors\" in epi- demiology), where both are measured atthe same time. It is usually difficult to assess accurately which came first, exposure to the sus-pected risk factor or the condition. Forexample, many community surveys havefound that women who have been bat-tered tend to have more children than non-battered women. However, these studiesoften do not collect information on whenin the marriage the violence began. Norcan one tell from this kind of data whetherhaving many children increases women'srisk of being abused, or whether it is actu-ally a consequence of abuse and resultsfrom coerced sex or the control many abu-sive partners exert over their partner's useof contraception. It is sometimes possibleto assume that one event occurs beforeanother. (For example, \"injuries due to vio-lence\" by definition must have taken placeafter the violence, not before.) Longitudinal studies follow a group of individuals over time. Longitudinal studies may be either: Prospective, meaning that changes are followed start- ing at the present time and into the future, or Retrospective, or looking at individuals' past history. Cross-sectional surveys Provide a snapshot of a population's characteristics. Can be carried out on a population or community level, or in a service context. Require special sampling techniques to ensure that the findings are representa- tive of the general population from which the sample was selected. Are relatively easy and inexpensive to design and implement, compared with cohort and case-control studies. Can provide retrospective (historical) information. Make it more difficult to determine when events took place, compared with a lon- gitudinal study. Therefore it is important to be careful in concluding whether one condition or event causes or leads to another (also referred to as causality). 66 Researching Violence Against Womenstudy of violence during pregnancy and low birth weight.) Well-known examples of this type of research design include long-term studiesto determine whether smoking causes lungcancer, or whether exercise reduces therisk of heart disease. The likelihood that anindividual who has been exposed to a cer-tain risk factor will contract the disease orcondition can be calculated as the relative risk, which compares the rates or risks of a specified outcome between groups thathave different exposures to the risk factorunder study. For example, relative risks areused to estimate the probability that awoman who is beaten during pregnancywill have a baby with low birth weightcompared to a woman who has not expe-rienced abuse during pregnancy Cohort studies provide the best informa- tion about the causes of health and socialproblems and the most direct measurementof the risk of developing a certain condi- tion or disease. They also permit a researcher to study several outcomes withregard to a single exposure. For example,it would be possible to determine theeffect of violence during pregnancy oninfant birth weight as well as on women'sphysical and mental health. A cohort study design might also be used is to evaluate the effectiveness of anintervention over time. For example, theCHAPTER FOUR Background and methods In 1995, Cambodia became the first Asian country to undertake a representa- tive sample survey of domestic violence. This study, initiated as a joint projectbetween the Ministry of Women's Affairs (MoWA) and a Cambodian NGO, The Project Against Domestic Violence (PADV), surveyed 2,764 Cambodianhouseholds in six provinces and in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and nature of violence inCambodian families, as well as awareness of violence. The survey grew out of an earlier qualitative study entitled Plates in a Basket Will Rattle (see Box 5.5 in Chapter 5). This study revealed the devastating impact of violence on the lives ofCambodian women, but raised questions about how widespread domestic vio- lence actually was and whether men were also victims of partner abuse. In all, 1,374 women and 1,286 men were interviewed (the men were not the partners of the women, but were sampled from nearby villages). The quantitative study used a modified version of the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) as a basis formeasuring abusive behavior (the CTS is described in Chapter 6). In this survey, theCTS was modified to include behaviors that the Khmer staff of MoWA and PADV identified as common in Cambodia. Questionnaires were first written in Khmer,then translated and back-translated several times to ensure that the English and Khmer versions were clear, consistent, and meaningful. The survey used two ques-tionnaires per household. The first instrument was a brief questionnaire that served to gather basic demographic information on all of the residents of the household. The second instrument was an individual-level questionnaire that was used to collect information on the respondent's perceptions of violence and on their individual experiences of specific abusive acts. Prior to the field work, all members of theresearch team underwent a three-week training course on domestic violence issues, interviewing techniques, and the logistics of random selection of households. Findings Sixteen percent of women reported having been physically abused by a spouse, and 8 percent, or one-half of all women reporting abuse, sustained injuries. More than 50 percent of reported injuries were head injuries. In contrast, 3 percent ofmen reported abuse by a spouse and less than 1 percent reported injuries due to abuse. Women living with their natal kin were less vulnerable to spousal abuse,suffering half as much abuse (8.3 percent) as the overall population of women.Thirty-four percent of abused women said they had not sought help from anyone.

This studywould be fairly easyto replicate in othersettings becausewomen are recruited the cohortthrough atten-dance the settingswhere majority pre-natal care, becausethe women in thecohort would belikely to be fairly similar to women in thepopulation in general. However, it is lesssuited to a setting where few womenattend prenatal care, because the womenin the cohort would likely be quite differ-ent from other pregnant women in thecommunity. Also, if women do not givebirth close to where they received prenatalcare, or if most women deliver at home, itmay be difficult to obtain accurate birthweight information. In this case, a case-control design, suchas the one describedin and econom-ical to carry out.They include peopleQUANTITATIVE APPROACHES TO RESEARCH Nicaraguan NGO Puntos de Encuentro is currently carrying out a cohort study of4,500 young people in three sites to findout whether their mass media program hasbeen successful in changing the attitudesand behavior of youth with regard to high-risk sexual practices, use of violence, andstigmatizing attitudes toward persons livingwith HIV/AIDS. The same individuals willbe interviewed at the beginning, middle,and end of a television series, developedby Puntos, called Sexto Sentido (Sixth Sense). The study will compare changes inattitudes and behavior between individualswho watched the program regularly, andthose who never watched the program. 4 The main drawback to cohort studies is that, despite being conceptually simple,they require more resources and time thanother research designs. This is particularlytrue when studying relatively rare condi-tions, such as infant or maternal deaths, orwhere the outcome of interest occurs along time after exposure to the risk factor,as in the effect of smoking on cancer inci-dence. These kinds of studies tend toinvolve very large samples and many yearsof follow-up before results are obtained.

Allow researchers to determine whether individuals who have been exposed to a suspected risk factor for disease are more likely to develop the condition or disease than the group without prior exposure. May study several outcomes in relation to single (or multiple) exposures. May be prospective or retrospective (although prospective cohort studies are more common). Are considered the best way to determine the causes of a disease or condition. May be costly to perform, as cohort studies often require very large samples and follow-up over long periods. Case-control studies Include people with a disease or other condition and a suitable control or reference group of people not affected by the condition or problem. Collect retrospective data on the individ- uals' exposure to potential risk factors. Study only one outcome at a time. Permit the identification of risk factors for disease. Usually require much smaller sample sizes than cohort studies. Are relatively simple and economical to carry out. Interview in Ethiopia PHOTO BY M. ELLSBERG68 Researching Violence Against Womenwith a disease or other condition (such as experiencing violence or depression) and asuitable control or reference group of peo-ple not affected by the condition or prob-lem. The \"cases\" should represent allindividuals from the specified population having the condition or disease being stud-ied. The controls are then selected ran-domly from the same population,excluding those who already have theproblem (see Figure 4.2). Retrospective information is collected from both groups, with particular attentionto the time before the onset of the condi-tion. The frequency and distribution ofsuspected risk factors is then comparedbetween cases and controls, and infer-ences may be made regarding the causalfactors that increase the risk that a particu-lar outcome will occur. The results areexpressed as an odds ratio , which com- municates the odds that a person with thedisease or condition was exposed to therisk factor, compared to someone withoutthe condition. See Box 4.4 for an explana-tion of the differences between odds ratiosand relative risk. In the study of violence, case-control studies may be useful for exploring factorsthat increase women's risk for abuse, or forexamining the effects of violence on otherhealth outcomes. They are particularly use-ful for studying events or diseases thatoccur infrequently in a given population,such as infant mortality, because the over-all sample size needed is much smallerthan in cohort studies. When cases andcontrols are matched according to knownconfounding factors such as age and sex,the design is even more powerful in itsability to predict the outcome. One constraint of case-control studies is that although multiple causes of a condi-tion may be examined, only one outcomecan be studied at a time. For example, tostudy the effects of violence on both birthweight and infant mortality, it would beCHAPTER FOUR Background and methods The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of physical and sexual abuse in a cohort of adult and teen pregnant women and to determine the effectof abuse on the birth weight of their babies. Using three simple screening questionsfor abuse, 1,203 African American, Hispanic, and white urban women in theUnited States were interviewed on their first prenatal visit and in the second andthird trimesters. Infant birth weight was obtained by record review. Findings Abuse during pregnancy was reported by 20.6 percent of teens and 14.2 percent of adult women. Both abused teens and adults were significantly more likely than nonabused women to enter prenatal care during the third trimester (21.9 vs. 7.5 percent for teens; 15.8 vs. 8.7 percent for adults). Among the total sam-ple of 1,203 women, women who were abused during pregnancy were signifi- cantly more likely to deliver infants with low birth weight, and to experience low maternal weight gain, infections, and anemia. They were also more likely to smoke and to use alcohol or drugs. BOX 4.3 ABUSE DURING PREGNANCY: A COHORT STUDY The association between risk factors and outcomes is expressed somewhat differ- ently in case-control studies and cohort studies. Cohort studies use relative risk and case-control studies use odds ratios. Both can be translated into lay terms by referring to the relative likelihood of an out- come occurring in the case of cohort studies (e.g., low birth weight), or the relativelikelihood of being exposed to a risk factor (e.g., violence during pregnancy) in the case of case-control studies. Although this distinction may appear small, it is useful to keep in mind when interpreting research results. For example: A relative risk of 3.0 in a cohort study of violence during pregnancy and lowbirth weight indicates that women who are beaten during pregnancy are threetimes more likely to have low birth weight infants than their nonabused peers. An odds ratio of 2.0 in a case-control study on the causes of low birth weightindicates that infants with a low birth weight are twice as likely to have mothers who were beaten during pregnancy. When an odds ratio or relative risk equals 1.0, it means that there is no associa- tion between two variables, and a value greater than 1.0 indicates risk. A valueless than 1.0 indicates that the exposure has a \"protective\" or preventive effect with regard to the outcome. Both odds ratios and relative risk figures are usually accom- panied by 95 percent confidence intervals (95 percent CI), indicating the likely range for the true ratio. A statistically significant range is one that does not include 1.0. Sometimes a statistical test is performed resulting in a p-value. This gives theprobability that the observed association is simply due to chance. If the p-value isvery small (< 0.05), then we can say there is evidence that the association is real,and not merely due to chance.BOX 4.4 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ODDS RATIO AND RELATIVE RISK(From Parker et al, 1994.5)A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 69necessary to design two different studies, one where the \"cases\" were infants withlow birth weight, and another where thecases were defined as children who diedunder a certain age. Boxes 4.5 and 4.6 describe two exam- ples of case-control studies\u2014a low birthweight study that was carried out in ahospital setting, and a study of child mor-tality risk that was nested as a substudywithin a larger household survey onreproductive and child health. The childmortality study in particular demonstratesthe potential benefits of integratingresearch on violence into other researchprojects. Although violence was not the primary focus of the child mortality study,the integration of a set of questionsregarding mothers' experiences of vio-lence complemented other research effortson violence in the same region. They pro-vided unique insight into violence as acontributing cause of child mortality,which would otherwise have been quitedifficult and costly to obtain.QUANTITATIVE APPROACHES TO RESEARCH FIGURE 4.2 DIAGRAM OF CASE-CONTROL STUDIES PopulationCases (i.e., low birth weight infants) Controls (normal weight infants)Have the exposure (mother abused in pregnancy) Do not have the exposure (mother not abused in pregnancy) Have the exposure (mother abused in pregnancy) Do not have the exposure (mother not abused in pregnancy)Background and methods This study was performed in Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua, in 1996. It differs from the child mortality study (Box 4.6) in that it was carried out in a hospital setting. This design was chosen because of the difficulties in obtaining reliable birth weight informa- tion from women interviewed in a household survey. During a two-month period, all births in the Le\u00f3n Teaching Hospital were moni- tored and 101 infants weighing less than 2,500 grams were selected as cases.Two controls were randomly selected for each case among infants weighing2,500 grams or more. Mothers were interviewed in a special private room before leaving the hospital, usually within 24 hours of delivery. Women's obstetri- cal histories were taken and compared whenever possible with hospital and pre- natal records. Women were also asked about other relevant risk factors for low birth weight (LBW), such as smoking and alcohol use, and experiences of vio- lence ever and during pregnancy, using the Abuse Assessment Screen. Main findings In this study, the following factors among mothers were found to be associatedwith having a LBW infant: mother's young age, pre-eclampsia and bleeding, lack of or inadequate prenatal care, smoking, mother's stress during pregnancy, poverty, and violence during pregnancy. Physical abuse during pregnancy was found in 22 percent of mothers of LBW infants (cases) compared with 5 percent among controls. This association was significant even after adjusting for socio- economic and medical risk factors. The study concluded that after poverty, vio- lence was the second major cause of low birth weight in Le\u00f3n, accounting forabout 16 percent of LBW. This placed violence ahead of smoking, pre-eclamp- sia, or bleeding, all of which are recognized risk factors for LBW.BOX 4.5 DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND LOW BIRTH WEIGHT: A CASE-CONTROL STUDY (From Valladares et al, 2002.6) (Adapted from Persson and Wall, 2003.3)70 Researching Violence Against Women1.

The purpose of thestudy was to determine the impact of physical and sexual violence against women on both infant and under-five mortality risks. The study was obtained from an ongoing demographic surveillance system in Le\u00f3n. A household survey was conducted of 9,500 homes, in which 12,000women ages 15-49 years were asked about their reproductive histories, including information about any children who were born, or who had died in the last twoyears. Through this process, 132 children were identified who had died within the previous two years before the age of five. These children were classified as the cases. For each case, two controls, matched by sex and age at the time of death, were randomly selected from the same population. Specially trained interviewersreturned to the homes of the cases and controls and administered a new question-naire to the mothers. The questionnaire focused on the circumstances leading up tothe death of the child (for cases) or the 12 months prior to the interview (for con- trols), including her experiences of physical and sexual abuse. Because it was not possible to trace all the mothers, a final total of 110 mothers of cases and 203 mothers of controls were interviewed. Findings The study found that 61 percent of mothers of deceased children and 39 percent of those of controls had lifetime experience of physical or sexual abuse. Physicalabuse by a partner during pregnancy was twice as frequent among mothers of children who had died (23 percent vs.13 percent). The risk of under-five mortality,adjusted for relevant socio-economic factors, was two times greater among children whose mothers had experience of either physical or sexual partner abuse. The risk of under-five mortality for a child whose mother had experienced both physical and sexual partner abuse was six times greater than children whose mothers had neverexperienced violence. The study concluded, after adjusting for other risk factors,that violence against mothers could be responsible for as much as one third of child deaths in Le\u00f3n.BOX 4.6 THE IMPACT OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ON CHILD MORTALITY: A CASE-CONTROL STUDY (From \u00c5sling-Monemi et al, 2003.7)5 PHOTO BY HAFM JANSENA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 73process of doing research can initiate a public discussion of violence and open adialogue with key institutional actors. Likewise, if the goal is to better under- stand the mindset and attitudes of abusivemen, it will be more productive to usequalitative techniques to probe how menview their partners, how they justify andinterpret their behavior, and the incidentsor \"transgressions\" that set them off.Qualitative techniques will foster muchmore nuanced understanding of theseissues than will quantitative surveys. For the purposes of this manual, we divide qualitative research into two maintypes of research designs: rapid assess- ments andin-depth qualitative studies . Individuals new to the field of qualitative research will want to seekguidance from someone familiar withthese techniques before pursuing a quali-tative research project. In addition, read-ers are encouraged to consult some ofthe excellent resources on qualitativedata collection and analysis listed inAppendix III.Q ualitative research methods are extremely useful to interested in violence.Qualitative methods\u2014especially rapidassessment techniques\u2014are helpful andevaluating interventions, and engagingcommunity actors via participatoryresearch. They are also useful in design-ing and field-testing questionnaires, andin interpreting quantitative research find-ings. Qualitative methods provide greaterinsight into motivation, meanings, anddynamics of violent relationships. In many cases, a qualitative approach will suit a specific study aim better thanquantitative methods. For example, if theprimary purpose of research is to helpplan an intervention, it may be more con-structive to use available resources tounderstand community attitudes towardviolence and the responses and attitudesof institutional actors\u2014such as the police,health care providers, and the clergy\u2014toward victims. In such cases, the veryCHAPTER FIVE Qualitative Approaches to Research Topics covered in this chapter: Rapid assessments In-depth qualitative studies74 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER FIVE RAPID ASSESSMENTS A rapid assessment is an exploratory study done as a prelude to designing an inter-vention or as a means of supplementingand/or refining quantitative research (forexample, helping to identify local terms used for different diseases in order to design a questionnaire). A rapid assess-ment responds over a relatively shortperiod to a few specific questions withconcrete applications; for example, Whatkinds of services do rape victims want?What words do women use to describeabuse? How do community leaders regardthe use of advocates to accompany womenwhen they report violence to the police? A rapid assessment does not pretend to provide a full, detailed account of allaspects of abuse. Its purpose is to guidethe development of research instruments(e.g., survey questionnaires), to assess localneeds, or to evaluate interventions.Participatory research designs are particu-larly appropriate when the aim is to stimu-late discussion and reflection within acommunity about an issue, and to promotecommunity-based actions. In the last 20 years, rapid assessment techniques have become very popular as ameans to aid project and instrument design, and to evaluate inter-ventions. The field of publichealth research\u2014once domi-nated by Knowledge,Attitudes, and Practices (KAP)surveys and epidemiologicalresearch\u2014has incorpo-rated a broad array of qualita-tive methods borrowed fromthe fields of marketing, popu-lar education, agriculture, andsocial anthropology. Rapid assessments can draw on any number of techniques including focus groups, partici-pant observation, in-depth interviews, ormore participatory techniques such asmapping, pile sorts, community mapping,and seasonal calendars. Within the larger category of rapid assessments are a variety of research tradi-tions, including Rapid Rural Appraisal,Participatory Rural Appraisal, ParticipatoryAction Research, and situation analysis.The diversity of names and methods usedfor these approaches reflects their differenthistorical roots as well as some key con-ceptual differences. One major distinctionis the degree to which the investigator ver-sus the community guides and implementsthe research process. In recent decades,various forms of participatory researchhave evolved as an alternative to investiga-tor-led initiatives. Participatory researchtends to blur the distinction betweenresearch and intervention and can be anexcellent way to raise consciousness aboutviolence and to initiate community workon sensitive topics like violence. The fol-lowing is a brief summary of the mostcommonly used approaches to rapidassessment. Participatory appraisals In the 1970s, researchers in the field ofagricultural development and naturalresource management developed a set ofrapid assessment techniques that provideda quick and reliable alternative to tradi-tional methods for conducting agriculturalresearch. Collectively known as Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) , these methods included such techniques as seasonal cal-endars to determine patterns of rainfall,crop production, and disease; \"transectwalks\" to document soil and vegetationpatterns; and community mapping. Themethods of RRA were primarily adaptedfrom social anthropology and quicklybecame popular among researchersbecause they produced reliable results,often as good as or better than thoseobtained by much more costly and time-consuming quantitative studies. Participatory Rural Appraisal is a growing family of approaches and methods designed to enable local (rural or urban) people to express, enhance, share, and analyze their knowl- edge of life and conditions, to plan and to act. (Chambers, 1994.1)A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 75In the 1980s, RRA was increasingly criti- cized because of its emphasis on extract-ing information from communities for theuse of outsiders. The critiques of RRA ledto the development of a new researchtrend called Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA). PRA emphasized participation ofthe local community in the developmentof the appraisal, the use of diverse meth-ods, and the knowledge generated by thecommunity. In recent years, the methodsof PRA have been used in many otherfields, including urban development.Although the methodology did not origi-nally incorporate a systematic gender per-spective, many of the techniques havebeen modified to give greater visibility togender gaps in access and control ofresources. In contrast to PRA, which developed out of the experience of northern-basedresearchers, Participatory Action Research (PAR) is rooted in the popular education movements of the south, particu- larly those of Latin America. Popular edu-cation, initially conceptualized by PauloFreire in Brazil and later developed bysocial movements in many countries duringthe 1980s, considers research within a par-ticipatory framework of learning andaction, and takes the knowledge and expe-rience of community members as a pointof reference. The educational techniquesused in PAR are designed to stimulategroup reflection on an issue and to moti-vate participants to act collectively toaddress the problem. The PAR process follows a circular logic of research and action; empowerment ofindividuals and the community is achievedprimarily through collective endeavor.Therefore PAR, as well as popular educa-tion, is a much more political process thanPRA, in that individual and collectiveempowerment of participants is an explicitgoal. In fact, the \"success\" of a PAR projectis measured by the social transformations it catalyzes rather than by the informationit generates. PAR is an excellent choice ifthe main goal is social change and thetransfer of skills. If accuracy of the data isQUALITATIVE APPROACHES TO RESEARCH Background and methods Sexual violence against women in the Dadaab refugee camps, located in Northeast Kenya, has been an issue since refugees began arriving from Somalia in 1991. The number of reported rapes (106 in a population of 106,000) in the first nine months of 1998 was higher than the number for all of 1997. CARE and the German technical cooperation agency GTZ conducted an assessment of sexualviolence in the Dadaab refugee camps as part of a wider initiative by CARE to review women's issues in the camps. The assessment was designed to collect information to answer several critical ques- tions to guide future programming, including: Determining the extent of the problem. Determining areas of security concern regarding sexual violence. Identifying what services and programs exist. Obtaining information and perceptions of those most affected by the issue. Obtaining information and perceptions of potential service providers. Analyzing the collected information with agencies and community representa-tives to develop proposal ideas. The assessment was refugee-driven, in the sense that it focused on substantive dis- cussions with many refugee groups to define the problem and causes and to sug-gest solutions to reduce sexual violence. Participatory Learning and Action methodologies, including free listing, community mapping, causal flow diagrams, and pairwise ranking, were used to structure discussion sessions with refugees(examples of how these methods were used in the Dadaab appraisal are pre-sented in Chapter 9). The team also interviewed main agencies involved in protec-tion services and prevention activities. Additionally, a record review was conducted of reported cases of sexual violence in the past three months. The following were among the findings that were discussed with the communities and involved agen-cies to improve security for women at the camps. Areas of vulnerability Groups identified several areas within the camps, including in and around bore holes and water tap stands and places where the living thorn fences that surround the camp had been destroyed. Vulnerability was also linked to time: People stated that they were afraid to leave their homes after dark. Women reported that they felt vulnerable when they left their homes to line up predawn at the hospital to be assured an entry ticket for health services that day. Firewood collection The record review of sexual violence cases showed that over 90 percent of the reported rapes and attempted rapes occurred when women left the camps to col- lect firewood. The firewood issue is the most problematic, because inexpensiveoptions to replace firewood as a fuel are limited for a camp population estimated at about 106,000 people. Many women are now traveling in large groups to col-lect firewood. Sudanese and Ethiopian males collect or purchase firewood to reduce the need to go to the bush in search of fuel. (From Igras et al, 1998.2)BOX 5.1 SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN KENYAN REFUGEE CAMPS: A PARTICIPATORY APPRAISAL76 Researching Violence Against Womencritical, a more traditional approach may be a better choice. The main tenets of participatory research are that: It involves a flexible, iterative processof exploration that stimulates creativity,improvisation, and flexibility in the useof methods to facilitate learning. Community members direct theprocess , in the sense that knowledge is produced on the basis of their ownexperiences. By the same token, com-munity members define the priorities ofthe appraisal, as well as the collection,analysis, and interpretation of data. The role of outsiders is to facilitaterather than direct the learning process and the production of knowledge. Participants, not just the researchersor external agents, own the methodsand the results. The socialization of knowledge and techniques in participa-tory research is greatly encouraged. Diversity is enhanced rather thanaveraged out. Participatory research attempts to reveal differences betweensituations, attitudes, and practicesaccording to social class, gender, andethnicity and tries to learn from casesthat apparently do not conform to theexpected. Triangulation is used to validateresults. This refers to the use of differ- ent methods for studying the same phe-nomena, or using the same method withgroups that represent diversity, forinstance by gender and class, to seewhether results are valid for each group. The entire process, not just the results , is designed to enhanceCHAPTER FIVE Background and methods In 1996, Jijenge!, which means to \"build yourself\" in Kiswahili, was established in Mwanza, Tanzania, in an effort to address the physical and social determinants ofwomen's poor sexual health by promoting sexual health. The programs at Jijenge!include a reproductive health clinic, sexual health and HIV counseling and testing services, advocacy, community awareness, and training, and all work to empowerwomen to proactively claim their rights. In 1997, Jijenge! staff and volunteers decided to undertake a participatory rapid assessment on violence against women. The goals of the project were to initiate public discussion of the topic andto lay the groundwork for a more extensive intervention. The rapid assessment consisted of focus group discussions (FGDs), a baseline sur- vey, and in-depth interviews. Most of the research, conducted by Jijenge!'s Community Awareness Coordinator and the volunteers, was done in the commu- nity, except for a few in-depth interviews and one women's FGD which were heldat Jijenge! for safety reasons. Focus group discussions. Seventy-seven people\u201437 women and 40 men\u2014were involved in the FGDs: two female groups, two male groups, two mixed groups with general community members, and one mixed group with community leaders.The single sex FGDs were extremely useful; participants shared experiences and opinions honestly and the women were particularly supportive of one another. The two mixed groups with general community members were somewhat less fruitful because some women were noticeably inhibited in the company of men.Participation of both women and men in these mixed groups was clearly influencedby perceptions of status and power, and the roles they needed to maintain in mixed company. In-depth interviews. Eighteen in-depth interviews were held with ten women and eight men. The interviews provided rich contextual information that deepened understanding about the complexity of beliefs perpetuating violence and the subse-quent effects on women and men's lives. Selected findings Community members commonly referred to violence as a necessary form of disci-pline. A man, as the head of the household, is believed to have the responsibilityto discipline all family members. In the study, violence\u2014physical, verbal, or emo- tional\u2014emerged as an acceptable way to teach lessons to women and children.Family violence is a common tactic for asserting authority and power over women. Although violence occurs at an alarming rate in this community, it is also believed that violence between a husband and wife is a \"domestic matter\" that should not be raised by an outsider. Some women experiencing violence did not confide in family or friends because they felt that this would label them as a \"bad wife ormother.\" Women accepted responsibility for men's violence, blaming their own behavior instead of their partner's inability to manage his emotions appropriately.This shame and stigma keeps violence underground and prevents community mem- bers from supporting the women experiencing violence or confronting violent men. The findings from this study helped organizers better understand local attitudes toward abuse before designing a program of intervention. (From Michau, 2002.3)BOX 5.2 JIJENGE!

Examples of participatory research stud- ies are presented in Box 5.1 and 5.2. Situation analysis Situation analysis first became popular within family planning research in develop-ing countries. In the 1990s, violenceresearchers appropriated the term, whichthey used to refer to a set of rapid assess-ment techniques designed to evaluateexisting community attitudes and practicesregarding victims of abuse. Situation analy-ses were first used in violence research inseveral Mexican cities; New Delhi, India;and Harare, Zimbabwe. Situation analysesare a useful way to enter a community andbegin working on violence. Situation analyses rely on a combination of focus groups, semistructured interviews,and observation, directed at establishingboth community attitudes and beliefsregarding violence and the attitudes andpractices of key institutional actors, such aspolice, judges, social workers, clergy, andhealth professionals. Generally, situationanalyses include focus groups with key sub-groups in the population (young women,old women, young men, older men, abusedwomen, rape victims, and so on) and inter-views with a quota sample of differentproviders. Questions are geared towardassessing the adequacy of current institu-tional responses to victims of violence andthe degree of support and/or victim-blamingextended to abused women. An example ofa situation analysis performed in Kenya toimprove postexposure HIV prophylaxis torape survivors is described in Box 5.3. Situation analyses can serve as a sort of community \"diagnostic\" that providesinsights into needed areas of reform. Thedata they provide can also help convincecommunity leaders that reforms are indeedBackground Violence is an important risk factor contributing towards vulnerability to HIV and AIDS. Discussions of opportunities and challenges around postexposure prophy- laxis to reduce HIV transmission following sexual violence is growing. Gender-based sexual violence in Kenya is almost invisible, though reportedly moreprevalent than officially acknowledged. Health care workers at primary healthcenters and voluntary counseling and testing sites are reporting increasing num- bers of rape clients. There is increasing demand for VCT services and VCT scale- up as a key Kenyan strategy to fight HIV and provide infrastructure, capacity,and political support for provision of comprehensive postrape services. Objectives A qualitative situation analysis was undertaken to develop a strategy for the provi-sion of comprehensive postrape services in the VCT context. A review of literatureand international experience on sexual violence and service provision including the use of postexposure prophylaxis was undertaken. The study had two main objectives: To establish perceptions of gender-based sexual violence in Kenya. To document and analyze service provision for gender-based sexual violencewithin Kenya. Methodology The study focused on three districts. Nairobi, Thika, and Malindi were selectedbecause of availability of VCT services and to capture geographical, social, and religious diversities. Assessment was done in 10 VCT sites, 16 hospitals,and 8 legal and advocacy support programs. Forty key informants were inter- viewed and 20 FGDs were undertaken. Analysis involved comparing and con-trasting key themes emerging from different participants such as counselors andcommunity members. Different research sites and research methodologies such as focus groups and interviews were triangulated. Findings Sexual violence was seen as shameful, with diverse views on whether rape happens in relationships. Greater participation in discussions on rape from malegroups in comparison to female groups may suggest less social barriers to pub-lic discussions of sexuality for men. Generally, views presented by male groupsseem to edge towards justification and tolerance for rape, in contrast to women's groups that felt the need for concerted efforts to address rape. Most people were unaware of what to do or where to go in the event of sexual vio- lence. Provision of services by the police and at hospitals was seen to be lack- ing and rape survivors were often humiliated and retraumatized. Further, there is no documentation for rape and a weak chain of custody for investigation. Counseling services are nonexistent in public health institutions except in placeswhere VCT services are available. Conclusions The implementation of postrape services within the VCT framework in Kenya must include: Multidisciplinary approaches to developing a regulatory framework. Integration of both counseling and clinical management in health care services. Building capacities for services provision. Development of referral systems. (From Kilonzo et al, 2003.4)BOX 5.3 POSTRAPE SERVICES IN KENYA: A SITUATION ANALYSIS78 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER FIVE In 1995, PAHO began the implementation of a ten-country diagnostic study to document what happens when a woman affected by family violence decides to break the silence and seek assistance in ending the abuse. In Spanish, this process was called the \"ruta cr\u00edtica\" or the \"way out.\" In effect, the study asked, what happens when a woman decides to seek help? To whom does she turn for help? What factors motivate her to act or inhibit her from acting? What kinds of attitudes and responses does she encounter from institutional actors? Altogether, researchers conducted over 500 in-depth interviews with battered women, interviewed more than 1,000 service providers, and completed approximately 50 focus group sessions. Results show many factors\u2014both internal and external\u2014influence a woman's decision to act to stop the violence. In some cases, it takes many years and several attempts at seeking help from several sources. Rarely is there a sin- gle event that precipitates action. Findings suggest that many battered women are resourceful in seeking help and finding ways of mitigating the violence. Battered women identified several factors that act as catalysts for action. An increase in the severity or frequency of the violence may trigger a recognition that the abuser is not going to change. An event may make it clear to herthat she cannot modify the situation with her own internal resources. A primary motivating factor is the realizationthat lives\u2014hers or her children's\u2014are in danger. \"He mistreated the children badly. He only knew how to shout orders. There was a period when he would beat them. The children, particularly my oldest son, had become very disobedient, rebellious and had lost all motivation to study. He didn't go to school...\" \"I finally decided to leave when he burned all my clothes and also burned me.\" \"The moment came when I said to myself that I had to find someone to help me because it was not possi- ble to keep going on in this way. I had become hysterical, problematic, unhappy, mainly because I could see my beaten face every week in the mirror.\" What factors inhibit the process of seeking help? As with the precipitating factors, the obstacles for seeking help are multiple and intertwined. \"One learns to live with the person even though he is an abuser. I don't know, for me he was my compan- ion because I felt alone, without the support of a family. He was my family...\" \"I used to excuse him for that and I believed that through the love I had for him he was going to get better, and that this was not going to keep on.\" However, economic factors appear to weigh more heavily than do emotional considerations: \"The children were very young and I didn't think I could support them on my own. And I didn't want to burden my mother.\" These barriers are reinforced by battered women's feelings of guilt, self-blame, or abnormality. \"I tried to reflect on my own actions. What did I do to provoke him? I considered my personality...\" \"My mother would tell me that I was crazy and that is why I was seeing a psychologist and my brothers and sisters said the same thing.\" \"There came a moment in which I really thought 'Am I crazy?' Then I sought help to make sure that what was happening to me was true.\" Women who sought help rarely began with formal health or police services. They initially relied instead on support from other women in the community, including female family members, neighbors, and health promoters. Manywomen related instances of being ridiculed or treated with indifference by health providers and local authorities. \"I finally told a friend that I trusted. I went to tell her because she is an older lady and she told me that he was wrong, that he was a sadist. She told me that I should get out of the house.\" \"...Almost every time he abused me I would go to my friend's house and she would give me a place to sleep. I would even sleep on the floor, because she was poor. She was the one who finally said, 'This is too much. I am going to help you find help because that man is abusing you too much!'\" (From Sagot, 2000.6)BOX 5.4 \"LA VIOLENCE: A MULTI-COUNTRY QUALITATIVE STUDYA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 79needed. Situation analyses can be particu- larly productive when local communitymembers assist in doing the interviews. Inthe Pan American Health Organization(PAHO) project, members of the localwomen's organization that provides serv-ices for victims of abuse frequently con-ducted interviews. Because of thedemands of assisting victims, many advo-cates had never taken the time toapproach the local forensic doctor, the vil-lage priest, or the chief of police.

It's normal\u2014it can't be helped. But, from time to time, plates break. So do women.\" Background and Methods The study, Plates in a Basket will Rattle\u2014Domestic Violence in Cambodia, is based on in- depth interviews with 50 victims of domestic violence and one interview with the mother of awoman who was killed by her husband. Additional information was gathered from interviews with individuals that an abused woman is likely to encounter in her search for assistance, including judges and court personnel, police officers, district chiefs, village heads, medicalworkers and midwives, and staff from NGOs. The subjects for the study were located primarily by word-of-mouth with the help of local com- munity organizations. The main researcher (a North American) worked with two Cambodiancolleagues to conduct the interviews. Before the research began, they had first to create words in high and low Khmer to refer to \"domestic violence,\" since no words previously existed. Interviews took an average of half a day, and women were compensated for the income theycould have made during this time by trading in the market. (This generally amounted to between 7,500 and 10,000 riels, or between $3 and $5 per woman.) Prior to beginning the interviews, the team made contingency plans in case there was a woman who might be in immediate danger and request assistance. To this end, they con-tacted three local NGOs that offered to provide temporary shelter for victims. Interview information was collected in the form of handwritten notes in Khmer, which were tran- scribed and translated into English immediately after each encounter. Findings The study highlighted the difficult plight of women who were severely beaten by their husbands. It showed howcultural norms, shame, and the lack of viable alternatives kept women in abusive relationships. Many of the women interviewed suffered physical abuse in pregnancy as well as sexual abuse and degrading treatment fromtheir partners. Virtually no public institutions, including the police and health sector, were trained or sensitive to the needs of battered women. The most important outcome of the study was that domestic violence became a public issue in Cambodia. The research helped catalyze a conference on violence, sponsored by UNICEF, and it played a role in the develop- ment of an antiviolence organization called the Project Against Domestic Violence. Many of the findings from thequalitative study proved critical in helping to lay the foundation for the quantitative study carried out subsequently (described in Box 4.2).

It involves extensive datacollection, processing, and analysis. Whilein-depth studies often use many of thesame techniques as rapid assessments for collecting data (e.g., focus groups,observation, and interviews), they are gen-erally conducted over longer periods, usemore respondents, and entail more sys-tematic data analysis. (Chapter 13describes in greater detail some of thebasic techniques for qualitative data analy-sis.) In general, one conducts an in-depthstudy for the following reasons: To advance theoretical understanding of an issue and/or to gain a more completeunderstanding of a phenomenon thancan be gained during a shorter study. To understand cultural norms, beliefs, and behaviors or to capture and analyzecomplex motivations. Such studies frequently rely on detailed interviews that require enormous amountsof time and energy to transcribe, code,and analyze. Many researchers underesti-mate the challenge of coding and inter-preting reams of qualitative data.Performing an in-depth qualitative study isCHAPTER FIVE Background In 1998, the Nicaraguan NGO Puntos de Encuentro embarked on a study designed to gain information useful for designing a public education campaign that called on men to renounce violence in their intimate relationships. Thestudy used qualitative research techniques to generate hypotheses about the type of antiviolence messages that men would accept and find appropriate to their needs and expectations. Methodology The research included three phases: Compilation and content analysis of the workshop transcripts and reports from meetings about men and mas-culinity in Nicaragua, including: 1. Men's views about what it means to be a man in Nicaragua. 2. Images and attitudes men hold about women.3. The advantages and disadvantages of \"being a man.\" 4. Men's memories of how they were raised to become adults (socialization). In-depth interviews with a sample of 12 nonviolent men. Researchers chose to interview nonviolent men basedon the rationale that, rather than looking for \"causes\" of men's violence (and then offer a \"medicine\" with the cam- paign), it would be more productive to study what creates \"health\"\u2014that is, how do we understand men who, in spite of growing up in a violent socio-cultural context, do not become violent themselves? To be considered \"nonviolent,\" men had to be identified by their peers and pass a series of behavioral screens. Men exposed to feminist discourse were explicitly excluded. In-depth interviews with \"ordinary\" men. Selected results The research revealed that large differences exist between nonviolent and \"ordinary\" men. For example, ordinarymen say that their relationships are best when their partner does not complain, or when she does what she is told. On the other hand, nonviolent men held very different expectations for relationships. For them, a \"good relationship\"is one where there is mutuality, reciprocity, and mutual support. Nonviolent men perceived both benefits and costs to this behavior. Among the benefits identified were greater tran- quility and harmony at home; a \"good reputation\" in the community, feeling good about oneself, health and well-being of one's children, and a household that runs more smoothly day to day. Among the costs of \"swimming upstream\" against a machista culture were ridicule and ostracism by other men. Nonviolent men either grew up in very loving homes where they were taught to respect women or in very violent homes, where their own mothers were beaten and they vowed never to be like their fathers.

ESTIMATING THE PREVALENCE OF VIOLENCE It is difficult to compare most interna- tional prevalence data on violencebecause different methods were used toobtain them. Prevalence is defined as theproportion of women who are abused ina given study population. (See Box 6.1 fora more detailed description of how preva-lence figures are calculated.) Therefore,researchers face two major challenges inobtaining accurate prevalence data: howto define \"abuse\" and how to determinethe study population. Researchers haveaddressed these methodological issues inH ow does one decide what criteria to use to define and measure gender-basedviolence? Operationalizing main variables isa key issue in all cross-cultural studies, andespecially in the study of violence. In quali-tative research, it is not usually necessary tofinalize these decisions before initiating datacollection. In fact, a main goal of a qualita-tive study may be to understand what kindsof acts are considered violent by a particu-lar woman or group of women. However,in most quantitative studies, particularlywhen the aim is to estimate the magnitudeof violence in different settings, researchersneed to develop clear definitions that canbe compared across settings. This chapter explores the challenge of measuring violence and emphasizes esti-mating the prevalence of different forms ofabuse across a wide range of settings. Itdescribes some major conceptual issuesCHAPTER SIX The Challenge of Defining and Measuring Violence inQuantitative Research Topics covered in this chapter: Estimating the prevalence of violence The study population: Choosing interview subjectsDefinitions of violenceEnhancing disclosure of violenceCommon tools for measuring violence86 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER SIX many differ ent ways, and there is little con- sensus as to the most appropriate method.A further complication is that surveys donot measure the actual number of womenwho have been abused, but rather, thenumber of women who are willing to dis-close abuse. It is always possible thatresults are biased by either overreporting orunderreporting. In reality, researchers around the world have found no evidence that abuseis overreported.1To be identified as a vic- tim of abuse in most societies is soshameful that few women report abusewhen it has not actually occurred. Womenare far more likely to deny or minimizeexperiences of violence due to shame, fear of reprisals, feelings of self-blame, orloyalty to the abuser. Box 6.2 outlinessome of the most critical issues that canaffect how prevalence data are calculatedand interpreted. THE STUDY POPULATION: CHOOSING INTERVIEWSUBJECTS Study populations used for gender vio- lence research vary greatly. Many studiesinclude all women within a specific agerange (frequently 15-49 or over 18), whileother studies classify women according tomarital status, and interview only womenwho have been married at some point intheir lives, or women who are currentlymarried. The logic underlying differencesin the range of women included rests inthe way researchers define the populationat risk of abuse. Table 6.1 gives anoverview of approaches used in past stud-ies of partner violence. Sometimes, researchers decide not to interview women below a certain agebecause of specific legal requirementsregarding the participation of minors asresearch informants. In some countries, thisdecision depends on the average age ofmarriage. Because many prevalence studiesare embedded in larger studies that focuson women's reproductive health\u2014such asthe Demographic and Health Surveys(DHS)\u2014only women of reproductive ageare included, thereby excluding the experi-ences of older women. 2 Relationship status Some studies further refine the study popu-lation according to the relationship statusPrevalence is defined as the number of persons having a specific characteristic or problem, divided by the number of persons in the study population who are considered to be at risk of having the problem, usually expressed as a percent-age. Incidence refers to the number of new cases of a problem divided by the study population over a specific period. For example, the incidence rate of dia-betes refers to the number (usually expressed as x out of 1000, etc.) of peoplewho are newly diagnosed with diabetes each year in a community, whereas the prevalence is the total proportion of people with diabetes in the community,regardless of how long ago they were diagnosed. The prevalence of violence against women refers to the number of women who have experienced violence divided by the number of at-risk women in the study population. (In the case of some kinds of violence, such as sexual assault, all girls and women may be con- sidered at risk, but in other cases, such as intimate partner violence, only womenwho have ever had an intimate partner would be considered as at risk.) Thiscan be measured as: Period prevalence Women abused during a certain period (usually the last year) X 100 Women at risk in the study population or Lifetime prevalence Women abused at any time in their life X 100 Women at risk in the study population The incidence rate of partner abuse refers to the number of violent events women experience during a specific period, such as one year. In crime studies, inci-dence of violence is generally measured as the number of assaults per inhabi- tant, rather than the number of women being assaulted, so that each beating that a woman receives is counted separately. Thus, the incidence rate can tell you what happened over the last year, but it may not tell you how many people were affected. Although some kinds of violence might be measured as discrete incidents (e.g., a sexual assault by a stranger), many forms of gender-based violence, such aschild sexual abuse and partner violence, may be ongoing processes and not easily captured as discrete events. Furthermore, the effects of a single assault may be long-lived. For this reason it is less practical or useful to measure violencein terms of incidence rates, and the magnitude of gender-based violence is mostcommonly presented in terms of prevalence.BOX 6.1 DEFINING PREVALENCE AND INCIDENCEA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 87of respondents. For example, studies on partner violence often include only womenwho are currently married because experi-ence shows that these women are at great-est risk of current partner abuse. In somecases, researchers exclude from studies women in common-law relationships, orthose who have been married for less thanone or two years (see Table 6.1). We rec-ommend using the broadest criteria possi-ble for defining the study population. Inthe case of wife abuse, this would includeinterviewing all women in a specified agerange, or at least all those who have everhad an intimate partner. Restricting thestudy population further may bias resultsfor the following reasons: The risk of partner abuse is not con-fined to women who are currentlyin formal marriages. Some studies indicate that women in common-lawrelationships suffer a greater risk for vio-lence than do married women. 3 Unmarried women may also be abusedby their boyfriends. Many studies findthat women who are currently separatedare more likely to have been abused atsome point in their lives by a partner,indicating that violence may be animportant reason for women to separatefrom or divorce their partners. 2In some countries, women are at greatest risk ofabuse and even homicide immediatelyafter separating from their partners.Therefore, excluding these women fromthe study population means that valu-able information may be lost, and thestudy results will not reveal a true pic-ture of how violence is affectingwomen's lives. The risk of partner abuse is not con-fined to women who have been in arelationship for a certain length oftime. Some research indicates that wife abuse starts early in a relationship. Inthe Nicaragua survey, for example, 50percent of abused women reported thatthe violence began in the first twoyears of the relationship, and 80 per-cent reported that the violence beganwithin four years. 4This indicates that women are at risk of partner violenceTHE CHALLENGE OF DEFINING AND MEASURING VIOLENCE IN QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH How is the study population identified?

Although partner abuse is one of themost common types of violenceagainst women, women frequentlyexperience other forms of physical,sexual, and emotional abuse duringtheir lives. Many of these experiences are intertwined with wife abuse, where,for example, sexual assault by astranger can increase a woman's vulner-ability to discrimination or abuse by herfamily or spouse. Experiencing multipleforms of abuse can make the effects ofwife abuse particularly devastating.Because these patterns vary across cul-tures and settings, it is a good idea todefine the study population as broadlyas possible. This provides the opportu-nity to look at the patterns of violencethat women experience throughout theirlives, before narrowing the focus in sub-sequent analyses.National versus regional studies Two distinct research trends are emergingas more international data on violenceagainst women become available. First,large-scale surveys primarily designed forother purposes increasingly solicit informa-tion on violence. For example, severalDemographic and Health Surveys andReproductive Health Surveys conducted bythe Centers for Disease Control haveincluded questions on violence in nationalsurveys. 2,6Although many of these surveys use one or two aggregate \"gateway\" ques-tions to measure any type of violence,such as, \"Have you ever been beaten byanyone since you were 15/were married?By whom?\" some of the more recentstudies include a module on domestic vio-lence with more detailed information. The second trend is represented by studies that are primarily designed togather detailed information on women's experiences of violence. Many of thesestudies, such as the prevalence studies inNicaragua, South Africa, and the WHOmulti-country study, have relativelyCHAPTER SIX An example from Nicaragua shows how prevalence estimates for intimate partner violence can vary greatly according to how the study population is defined, and whether the figures include only recent experiences or life- time experiences of violence. In a study of 488 women ages 15-49 in Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua, researchers comparedthe prevalence of lifetime and current violence between different subgroups of the sample and found large differ- ences. 5Only 8 percent of women who had dated but never cohabited with a man reported violence, compared to 52 percent of women who had lived with a partner at least once. Researchers also found important differences between the prevalence of lifetime and current abuse among ever- married women (52 percent versus 27 percent). In the case of recent experiences of violence, not surprisingly, women who were married at the time of the interview had experienced more violence within the last 12 monthsthan separated women. Nonetheless, the fact that 17 percent of women who were no longer married had also recently experienced violence draws attention to the possibility of violence by exspouses. Lifetime and current prevalence of violence according to women's marital status. All women Never partnered Ever partnered Currently Formerly 15-49 with 6.3 FROM THE FIELD: NICARAGUAA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 89Thus, one tradeoff of using multipur- pose surveys to produce prevalence esti-mates on violence is the risk thatviolence will be significantly under-reported. Such underreporting can diluteassociations between potential risk fac- tors and health outcomes, leading toresults that are falsely negative.Underestimating the dimensions of vio-lence could also prevent violence inter-vention programs from receiving thepriority they deserve in the allocation ofresources. Finally, because many of these studieshave not systematically addressed safetyconcerns, women who participate inthem may face increased risk of retalia-tion or other harm. Researchers and advocates should con- sider carefully whether they need national-level data in order to achieve their policyobjectives. In many countries, advocateshave successfully used the results of repre-sentative sample surveys of asingle region, province, or sig-nificant city to raise publicawareness of violence and toguide policy decisions. It isusually more important to havehigh-quality data that are notvulnerable to criticism onmethodological or ethicalgrounds. Rather than expend-ing extra effort to make a study \"national,\"researchers might do well to explore vio-lence in depth among a smaller, more con-densed sample of individuals. When conducting a regional study, it is important to select a study populationdiverse enough to allow comparisonsbetween women of different socio-eco-nomic groups. The study population shouldalso share important characteristics withother parts of the country. The results of aprevalence study carried out in a singleTHE CHALLENGE OF DEFINING AND MEASURING VIOLENCE IN QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH smaller sample sizes and cover a limitedgeographical region, although there areimportant exceptions, such as theNational Surveys on Violence AgainstWomen in Canada (1993), 7the United States (1997),8Sweden,9and Finland (1997).10These studies tend to gather much more information about differenttypes of violence and perpetrators, aswell as information on circumstances andwomen's responses to violence. They alsotend to devote more attention to theinteraction between interviewers andrespondents and issues of safety. There are potential advantages to includ- ing violence questions in national surveysdesigned primarily for other purposes. Forexample: In many cases, national statisticsbureaus conduct the studies, and theresults assume the legitimacy of \"officialstatistics.\" This can be very useful forpurposes of advocacy. Nationally representative data are usefulfor local program planning, and alsopermit in-depth analysis of variationbetween regions. The large data sets generated by thesestudies, including many other reproduc-tive and child health outcomes, can beused to deepen understanding of risk fac-tors and health consequences of violence. There are also drawbacks to this strategy: In general, prevalence estimates have been higher in the more focused studiesthan in the national surveys designedprimarily for other purposes. 11One explanation may be that because thefocused studies emphasize the use ofmethods for enhancing disclosure, theyare able to produce more accurateprevalence estimates. 12Thestudy population should be as broadly defined as possible, and, if possible, should be diverse with respect to ethnicity and socio-economic background, so that the results will be meaningful to a larger segment of the population.90 Researching Violence Against Womenneighborhood of poor urban dwellers or in a small village composed only of members of an ethnic minority may becritically important for design-ing local interventions.However, because such a studydoes not include large sectorsof the population, such as rural or middle class women or women of dif- ferent religious or ethnic backgrounds, it isless useful for understanding how differentwomen experience violence. Moreover,such studies are often dismissed as being too narrow, and have little effect on policy. DEFINITIONS OF VIOLENCE Who defines abuse? The way in which violence is defined has an enormous impact on the final results.Thus, it is crucial to establish from thebeginning how violence will be defined andwho will be considered a \"case of abuse,\"to borrow a term from epidemiology. The following are examples of criteria that have been used in studies of intimatepartner violence: Any kind of physical, sexual, or emo-tional violence by any perpetrator atany time. One or more acts of physical violenceby a partner at any time. Only physical violence of a certain levelof severity, or which has been repeateda certain number of times. Only acts of partner violence occurringin the last year. Economic, as well as physical, sexual,or emotional violence. Any behavior that women themselvesidentify as abusive by virtue of its intentor effect (this may include such diverseacts as infidelity, verbal aggression orhumiliating acts, coerced sex, or refus-ing to pay for household expenses). How does one decide whether to use definitions developed according to criteriaestablished by researchers, or to focus onacts which women themselves view asmost harmful? The danger in relying exclu-sively on women's own definitions ofabuse, referred to in social science as an\"emic\" approach, is that these may vary sogreatly from one woman to the next, andbetween cultures, that it may not be possi-ble to draw meaningful conclusions fromthe results. For example, the question,\"Have you ever been abused by your part-ner?\" is likely to underestimate the trueoccurrence of violence. Many women mayexperience severe physical violence andyet not identify this behavior as abusive,either because they are used to it orbecause such behavior is considered nor-mal in their culture. Other women mayanswer positively, citing verbal offenses orhumiliations as evidence of abuse. Thisinformation may help the researcherunderstand how different women perceiveviolence, but it is less useful in planninginterventions or making cross-culturalcomparisons. One advantage of using externally derived definitions\u2014an \"etic\" approach\u2014is that this enables the researcher to makecomparisons across different groups ofwomen. The most common method is toask women whether they have experi-enced a series of behaviorally specific actsof physical, sexual, or emotional violence,such as hitting, slapping, kicking, or forcedsex. Women who disclose violence arethen asked to specify their relationship tothe perpetrator and the frequency orperiod in which it took place. The draw-back of this approach is that you cannotknow whether these acts have the sameCHAPTER SIX Prevalence studies need to have clearly defined criteria for determining what acts are considered as violence.A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 91meaning in different cultures or to different women. For example, punching a womanwith a fist and kicking her may appearfrom the outside to be roughly equivalent,if \"risk of injury\" is used as the main crite-ria for severity. However, in some cultures, it is particularly demeaning to kick awoman because it implies that she is nobetter than an animal. In another country,an outsider might assume that a partner'srefusal to speak to a woman is less seriousthan physical abuse. Nonetheless, thewoman enduring the abuse might experi-ence the same emotional pain and humilia-tion that she would from a physical blow. Many researchers address this dilemma by combining approaches that ask aboutspecific behaviors and ask women to inter-pret them. A researcher may ask womenabout specific acts, frequency, and perpetra-tors, followed by open-ended questions ask-ing her to describe \"the worst incident\" orany other behavior or experience that sheconsiders abusive. This approach can gener-ate information on violence that researcherscan compare to other settings and to otherwomen's perceptions of their experience. Types of violence Partner violence . The range of violent acts that women may experience is quitevaried, and so is the impact of specific actson their lives. For this reason, it is impor-tant not to define partner violence too nar-rowly. For example, if you ask only aboutexperiences of being hit or beaten, womenmay not mention that they have beenraped, kicked, or burned. Althoughresearchers initially focused primarily onphysical violence, today their work alsoconsiders emotional and sexual abuse.Many studies also include other kinds ofabusive or controlling behavior, such aslimiting decision making power or mobil-ity, or economic violence. While it may be useful to identify women who have experienced abuse, it is importantto present separately the prevalence of eachtype of violence. For cross-cultural compar-isons, aggregating emotional, sexual, andphysical abuse in a single domestic violencefigure is likely to lead to confusion, for thefollowing reasons: Definitions of emotionally abusive actsvary across cultures, which makes it dif-ficult to find a valid definition. Combining these categories may reducethe credibility of the findings, as manypolicy makers consider emotional abuseto be less severe than the other types ofviolence. Different types of violence affectwomen's physical and psychologicalhealth in different ways. Therefore,grouping them together may obscurecertain consequences of violence. You should design your questionnaire so that different types of violence can beappropriately disaggregated. Althoughgrouping some behaviors together canhelp avoid overly long or tedious lists ofquestions, these acts should be similar inseverity or type of violence. Answers tobroad questions such as \"Have you everbeen insulted, beaten, or raped by yourhusband?\" or questions that combine actsof different severity such as \"Has yourhusband ever hit you on the head orpulled your hair?\" will be difficult to interpret. The list of abusive behaviors need not be exhaustive. Their purpose is not todescribe every possible act that a womanmay have experienced. Rather, the aim is tomaximize disclosure and to allow for gen-eral characterizations regarding the mostcommon types and severity of violence. Some countries may have specific types of violence that are not common else-where, such as dowry-related abuse, abuseTHE CHALLENGE OF DEFINING AND MEASURING VIOLENCE IN QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH92 Researching Violence Against Womenby in-laws, and acid throwing in South Asia or group rape in Papua New Guineaand Cambodia. Formative research carriedout before developing the questionnairemay help you identify forms of violencethat are specific to the country setting and that the survey needs to address. Box 6.4presents the definitions used by WHO fordifferent kinds of violence. Rape and sexual coercion. Research on rape also raises important definitionalissues. Definitions of rape and coercionvariously focus on the type of sexual con-tact, the abuse of a trusting relationship,the force or tactic employed, the powerdifferential, or the imposition of will uponanother person, and whether the abuser isan intimate partner. At a minimum, defini-tions of rape used in research shouldinclude notions of force, nonconsent, pen-etration, and the age boundary betweenrape and child sexual abuse. Internationally, traditional legal definitions of rape tend to be limited to penile-vaginalpenetration by force or threat of force. Rapereform initiatives in many countries havewidened this definition to include all formsof nonconsensual sexual penetration (vagi-nal, oral, or anal) obtained by physical forceor by threat of bodily harm. Some jurisdic-tions, including most of the United States,also recognize penetration obtained whenthe victim is incapable of giving consent byvirtue of mental illness, mental retardation,or intoxication. In many settings, penetra-tion by anything other than the penis isclassified as sexual assault rather than rape. Other researchers have operationalized rape differently, relying on notions of\"coercion\" defined variously as: Using physical force or threat of physi-cal force. Using verbal or psychological pressure,including trickery or deceit.Against a woman's will (unwanted asdefined by the woman). Ignoring a woman's refusal. Childhood sexual abuse. As with rape, definitional issues complicate research intothe prevalence of childhood sexual abuse.Definitions of child sexual abuse in theNorth American literature have variedalong several dimensions: whether non-contact abuse (e.g., exhibitionism) isincluded together with sexual touching, themaximum age of the victim, the minimumage of the perpetrator, a minimum age dif-ference between victim and perpetrator(generally five years), and whether onlyincidents experienced as unpleasant orabusive are considered. 13The upper limit on childhood, for example, varies in stud-ies from age 12 to age 18. Some definitionsrequire that the incident be experienced bythe victim as abusive; others define all sex-ual contact between a child and someonesignificantly older as inherently abusive. Research has shown that differences in definition can greatly affect estimates ofprevalence. This effect is demonstratedclearly in the work of Haugaard and Emerywho constructed three definitions of abuse:a broad definition that included all forms ofcontact and noncontact abuse; a narrowdefinition that excluded exhibitionism andany incident that was experienced as posi-tive; and a very narrow definition thatincluded only oral, anal, or vaginal penetra-tion. 13Among the middle class college women in their sample, the prevalence ofchild sexual abuse was 11.9 percent usingthe broadest definition; 9.6 percent usingthe narrow definition; and 1.8 percent usingthe \"intercourse only\" definition. The levelof impact of abuse on the women's healthand lives increased as the definitionbecame more restrictive, although some sig-nificant relationships emerged even whenusing the broadest definition of abuse.CHAPTER SIXA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 93THE CHALLENGE OF DEFINING AND MEASURING VIOLENCE IN QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH Violence against women and girls is defined in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women as occurring in thr ee domains: the family, the community, and perpetrated or condoned by the state. The focus of the WHO VAW study is on intimate partner violence and sexual violence against women. For the purposes of the study, a series of separate definitions were adopted for the different forms of violence included in th e survey: Domestic violence against women Any act or omission by a family member (most often a current or former husband or partner), regardless of the physical location where the act takes place, which negatively effects the well being, physical or psychological integrity, freedom, or right to full developmen t of a woman. Intimate partner violence Any act or omission by a current or former intimate partner which negatively effects the well-being, physical or psychological integrity, freedom, or right to full development of a woman. Physical violence The intentional use of physical force with the potential for causing death, injury, or harm. Physical violence includes, but is not limited to, scratching, pushing, shoving, throwing, grabbing, biting, choking, shaking, poking, hair pulling, slapping, punching, hitting, burning, the use of restraints or one's body size or strength against another person, and the use, or threat to use, a weapon (gun, knife, or object). Severe physical violence Physical violence that is likely to lead to external or internal injuries. Abusive sexual contact Any act in which one person in a power relationship uses force, coercion, or psychological intimidation to force another to car ry out a sexual act against her or his will or participate in unwanted sexual relations from which the offender obtains gratification. Abusive sexu al contact occurs in a variety of situations, including within marriage, on dates, at work and school, and in families (i.e., incest). Other manifesta tions include undesired touching; oral, anal or vaginal penetration with the penis or objects; and obligatory exposure to pornographic material. Forced sex Where one person has used force, coercion, or psychological intimidation to force another to engage in a sex act against her or his will, whether or not the act is completed. Sex act Contact between the penis and vulva, or the penis and the anus, involving penetration, however slight; contact between the mout h and the penis, vulva, or anus; or penetration of the anal or genital opening of another person by a hand, finger, or other object. Psychological abuse Any act or omission that damages the self-esteem, identity, or development of the individual. It includes, but is not limited t o, humiliation, threaten- ing loss of custody of children, forced isolation from family or friends, threatening to harm the individual or someone they ca re about, repeated yelling or degradation, inducing fear through intimidating words or gestures, controlling behavior, and the destruction of poss essions.* Child sexual abuse The use of a child (defined as any person under the legal age of consent) by an adult for sexual purposes, whether or not conse nt is alleged to have been given. It includes, acts of exposure; sexual touching; oral, anal, or vaginal penetration; and the exposing of a chil d to, or involving a child in, pornography or prostitution. Any form of direct or indirect sexual contact between a child and an adult is abusive si nce it is motivated purely by adult needs and involves a child who, by virtue of her/his age and position in life, is unable to give consent. Sexua l activity between children constitutes sexual abuse when it is between siblings or when it is clear, by difference in developmental levels, coerc ion and/or lack of mutuality, that one child is taking advantage of another. * Some of the acts that are perceived as being psychologically abusive may vary between countries. WHO recognizes that there is no accepted definition of psy- chological abuse, and that there are also many other forms of severe psychological abuse, e.g., having children taken away from you, being evicted from your home, and having your wages taken away from you, that were not included in the questions used in the study. (From WHO, 2004.14)BOX 6.4 WORKING DEFINITIONS OF VIOLENCE USED BY WHO MULTI-COUNTRY STUDY ON WOMEN'S HEALTH AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN94 Researching Violence Against WomenThe challenges of deriving appropriate definitions for child sexual abuse are evenmore difficult when contemplating cross-cultural research, in which even definitionsof childhood can be points of contentionand debate. The WHO VAW study choseage 15 as a cutoff point between child-hood and adulthood and asked respon-dents whether before the age of 15 hadanyone ever touched them sexually orforced them to do something sexual thatthey did not want to do. Perpetrators Just as it is crucial to be able to distinguishbetween different types of abuse,researchers also need specific informationabout the number of perpetrators and theirrelationship to the victim. Some researchindicates that women who are victimizedin childhood are more likely to be victim-ized as adults and that women who arevictimized more than once are at greaterrisk for mental and reproductive healthproblems. Watch out for a fairly commonmistake: asking women about the violencethey have experienced and the perpetra-tors, without linking each perpetrator tothe specific form of abuse. This can lead toconfusing results. For example, in theLe\u00f3n, Nicaragua, study, one woman, whowas abused by both her mother and herhusband, said she was beaten, raped, andemotionally abused. However, because ofthe way that the questionnaire was struc-tured, it was not possible to determinefrom the data who did what. Some researchers suggest that providing specific cues about context may be moreeffective than a single general question inhelping a woman remember violentevents. 15Therefore, interviewers may be trained to probe about specific situations in which women might have experienced vio-lence, such as the workplace or school, orviolence by family members. Time frame and frequency To fully understand patterns of abuse,researchers need a time frame by whichthe abuse can be measured. For example,many studies on partner abuse only meas-ure whether women have experienced vio-lence in the last year, or since the start ofthe current relationship, thereby excludingviolence inflicted by former partners, orprior to the last year. This decision maystem from the belief that women are likelyto remember recent events more accuratelythan events in the more distant past. Othertimes, interventions focus on current vic-tims of abuse. Using such a narrow time frame obscures the true impact of partner vio-lence, especially because a history of abusemay be the underlying cause of currentproblems. For example, the Nicaraguastudy found that women who experiencedabuse years before the interview tookplace were much more likely than non-abused women to be experiencing emo-tional distress at the time of the interview. 16 Although women may be less likely torecall single incidents of moderate abuse,research indicates that experiences ofsevere, frequent, or particularly traumaticviolence are not easily forgotten, no matterCHAPTER SIX FIGURE 6.1 DRAWING USED IN WHO VAW STUDY TO ASK WOMEN ANONYMOUSLY ABOUT SEXUAL ABUSEA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 95when they took place.* If no one asks about former experiences of violence,many women with problems related toabuse will be improperly classified as\"nonabused.\" This error will weaken theassociations found between violence andspecific health or social outcomes. To determine how many women have experienced partner abuse, it is generallysufficient to obtain information pertainingto the last year and to lifetime experiencesof abuse. However, where the purpose isto link the \"exposure\" to violence to spe-cific health outcomes, for example, incohort and case-referent studies, moredetailed information is particularly useful.Such information might include, for exam-ple, when the abuse began, how fre-quently it occurred, how long it lasted, andwhether it took place during a specific rel-evant period such as pregnancy or beforethe onset of a health condition. When the aim of the study is to examine experiences of physical or sexual abuse inchildhood, it is important to ask therespondent's age when the abuse started,as well as the age of the perpetrator. Did ithappen one time? A few or many times?How many years did the abuse last? ENHANCING DISCLOSURE OF VIOLENCE Experience shows that in most settings women are willing to talk about theirexperiences of violence, although, as wementioned earlier, most prevalence figuresare probably too low. Experience fromTHE CHALLENGE OF DEFINING AND MEASURING VIOLENCE IN QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH FIGURE 6.2 COMPARISON OF DISCLOSURE OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE USING TWO DIFFERENT METHODS (DIRECT QUESTIONS IN A FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEW AND ANONYMOUS REPORTING) 25 20 15 10 5 0 Direct report Anonymous reportTanzania provinceTanzania city Thailand provinceThailand 071014 5212019 818 89 55411 49 * An exception to this observation may be sexual abuse, where women and men have been known to repress memories of particularly traumatic events experienced in childhood (From WHO, 2005.3)Percentage of women who report sexual abuse before the age of 1596 Researching Violence Against Womeninternational research nonetheless indi- cates that some methods are more effec-tive than others in encouraging women totalk about violence. The following series of issues may affect women'swillingness to discuss experi-ences of violence. How are women asked about violence? The methods used to ask women about violence mayinfluence how comfortablethey are disclosing abuse.Studies in industrialized coun-tries have found that for thepurpose of identifying intimatepartner abuse, either face-to-face interviews or interviewsby telephone give better resultsthan self-administered ques-tionnaires. 17, 18On the other hand, anonymous techniques frequentlyencourage greater disclosure of childhoodsexual abuse. The WHO multi-countrystudy tested the use of different methodsfor eliciting disclosure of child sexualabuse. Women were asked during a face-to-face interview whether they had everbeen touched sexually or made to dosomething sexual against their will beforethe age of 15. At the end of the interview,women were asked to mark on a separatepiece of paper whether they had been sex-ually abused as a child by placing a checknext to either a happy or sad face, regard-less of what they had chosen to reveal dur-ing the face-to-face interview (Figure 6.1).Women were assured that since their namewas not on the paper, no one would everbe able to trace their answer back to them.Then, to preserve the anonymity of therespondents these papers were placedtogether in a large plastic bag. In mostcountries, considerably more women dis-closed violence using this method thanthey did in personal interviews (Figure6.2). Who is asking? As in all research on sensitive topics, dis-closure rates are affected by the skill of theinterviewer, and her or his ability to estab-lish rapport with the informant. Women aremore likely to be willing to share intimateand potentially painful or embarrassingaspects of their lives when they perceivethe interviewer as empathetic, nonjudg-mental, and genuinely interested in theirsituation. It is generally believed thatfemale interviewers are more successful ineliciting personal information from women,although this has rarely been tested. Insome settings, difficulties have beenencountered when using young or unmar-ried women as interviewers, or when usinginterviewers who lack experience dis-cussing sensitive issues. This highlights theimportance of using carefully selected andappropriately trained female interviewers. Although it is often helpful to have field- workers who share some cultural back-ground with informants, it may bepreferable if they do not belong to thesame village or neighborhood, so that therespondent may feel more confident thatthe information she shares will not getback to others. How many times should you ask a woman about violence? It may seem strange at first, and even a lit- tle insulting, to ask women more than onceCHAPTER SIX \"Many women told me that they never talked about this with anyone, not even with the neighbors, friends, or relatives, 'because if I tell her, she might tell her husband or her mother, and word will get around and might reach my husband, which would be terrible. If he found out he would kill me.' So many of them would keep all their suffering inside, for fear that their husbands would mistreat them more...\" Nicaraguan interviewer (Ellsberg, et al, 2001.12) A DHS carried out in Nicaragua used two sets of questions to identify partner abuse. One question asked in general, \"Have you ever been physically beaten ormistreated by anyone?\" Women who responded affirmatively were questionedabout the perpetrator. The next set of questions referred to specific acts such as pushing, slapping, choking, beating, and forced sex. For each act, women wereasked whether their partner had carried out the act within the last year, or at any time during their marriage. While 14 percent of women reported partner abuseusing the first set of more general questions, 29 percent of women reported acts ofphysical or sexual partner abuse in the more specific set of questions. 12BOX 6.5 FROM THE FIELD: NICARAGUAA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 97whether they have experienced violence, as if we did not believe her the first timeround. However, numerous studies haveshown the importance of giving womenmore than one opportunity to disclose vio-lence during an interview. Women may not feel comfortable talking about something sointimate the first time it is mentioned, orthey may not recall incidents that tookplace long ago. This is why studies thatinclude only one or two questions on vio-lence are likely to result in substantialunderreporting of abuse. Researchers havefound that many women initially deny hav-ing experienced violence, but over thecourse of the interview, overcome theirreluctance to talk. For this reason, it is alsowise to avoid using \"gateway\" or \"filter\"questions, where women who reply nega-tively to the first violence question are notasked the more specific questions in thesurvey. Box 6.5 gives an example of howprevalence estimates for violence weredoubled by adding a set of specific ques-tions after an initial general question. The context of the interview The overall framework of the survey andthe items immediately preceding questionson abuse can profoundly affect howwomen interpret and respond to violence-related questions. For example, embeddingquestions on physical assault immediatelyfollowing items on relationships will cuerespondents to the issue of partner abuse,whereas asking a similarly worded ques-tion after items on crime victimization willtend to cue respondents toward assaultsperpetrated by strangers. The issue of context is particularly rele- vant in large-scale surveys in which abuse-related questions are integrated intoquestionnaires designed for other pur-poses. When questions on violence imme-diately follow lengthy discussions onunrelated topics such as family planning,nutrition, or childhood illness, a womanmay be disconcerted and less likely to disclose experiences of violence. In thiscase, it is particularly important to give therespondent a chance to\"switch gears.\" An introductoryparagraph can make it clearthat the interview is shifting toa completely different subject. Questions on violence may themselves be framed in a vari-ety of ways that convey differ-ent messages to the womenbeing interviewed. For exam-ple, one well-known instru-ment, the Conflict Tactics Scale, presents the use of violence as a way of resolving conflict and includes aseries of questions about nonviolent waysto resolve conflicts, such as \"discussing theissue calmly\" or \"sulking.\" This lead-incould be problematic in a country wherephysical assault is not understood as a wayto resolve conflict, but rather as a form ofpunishment or discipline. Other instru-ments describe acts that the partner \"doeswhen he is mad.\" Some researchers have used lead-in questions that allowwomen to describe positiveaspects of the relationship, asa way of showing women thatthey are not interested in onlythe bad things a partner does.The rationale for this approachis that women may be morewilling to disclose abuse ifgiven an opportunity toacknowledge that their rela-tionship is complex, with bothgood and bad parts. Even the timing of the violence ques- tions within the overview interview mayaffect how women respond, particularlywhen the questions are part of a muchlarger study. Asking about violence tooearly may not provide interviewers enoughtime to build rapport with the informant.THE CHALLENGE OF DEFINING AND MEASURING VIOLENCE IN QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH \"...In the first question, they would say that he didn't beat them, but when we got to the other questions, then they would say 'Yes, sometimes he beats me and kicks me or uses a gun,' or whatever.\" Nicaraguan interviewer(Ellsberg, et al, 2001. 12) \"...They would say that they had never told anyone before their situation. But then we got to be so close during the inter- view that she would ask me 'What do you think I should do?' Sometimes we couldn't get off the subject...\" Nicaraguan interviewer(Ellsberg, et al, 2001. 12)98 Researching Violence Against WomenOn the other hand, if questions are placed at the end of a long interview, both theinterviewers and the respondents maybe tired or anxious to finish the interviewand therefore less likely to probe intoexperiences of violence. One important way to ensure confiden- tiality is to interview only one woman perhousehold. When the study is exclusivelyfocused on violence, this is relatively easyto achieve. Chapter 9 describes a few waysto randomly select the woman to be inter-viewed. The situation is more complexwhen other members of the household areto be interviewed on other topics, such asreproductive health. When incorporating amodule on violence in the NicaraguanDHS, researchers selected only one womanper household to answer the violence por-tion of the survey, presented as a sectionon \"Household Relations.\" Interviewerswere instructed to inform her that she wasselected by chance to be asked these ques-tions, and that no one else in the house-hold would know she was being asked. By the same token, both ethical and methodological principles suggest that it isbetter to avoid interviewing women andmen from the same household on violence.It is true that questioning both partners of acouple would enable comparisons betweenwives and husbands, as well as direct infor-mation about life events preceding abusivebehavior by men. However, this methodmay place a woman at risk if her abusivehusband suspects that she has been talkingabout his behavior. In anticipation of hisreaction, she may be reluctant to discloseviolence. Therefore, we recommend thatsurveys not include women and men fromthe same household. If it is necessary tointerview husbands for some other reason,do not ask about violence, and let thewoman know that she is the only onebeing asked about abuse. COMMON TOOLS FOR MEASURING VIOLENCE Intimate Partner Violence TheConflict Tactics Scale (CTS) is one of the best known tools for measuring intimateCHAPTER SIX One of the greatest challenges of a multi-country study is ensuring that cross-coun- try comparability is maintained, and that the same core issues and concepts are being explored and analyzed in the same way in each participating country. At the time the study was carried out, there were still many gaps in knowledge about the prevalence, causes, and consequences of domestic violence against women.The WHO VAW study and future research using the study methodology have the potential to substantially advance current understanding. For this reason, maintain- ing cross-country comparability is a high priority for WHO. For the first phase of the study, to ensure that a high level of teamwork, coordination, and communica- tion was maintained, WHO committed resources to establishing a core researchteam, which regularly met with each country team. They also brought together the different country team members at important points in the study, to ensure that the key developments were finalized together. Several steps were also taken to ensure that there was central coordination of each phase of the study and to maintain cross-country comparability: Careful selection and standardized training of interviewers and supervisorsoccurred at the country level. Core research team members made country visits during the interviewer train-ing and piloting phases of the study. The core questionnaire and study procedures were finalized at a central level with a question-by-question description of the questionnaire, as well as detailedtraining manuals for facilitators, supervisors, interviewers, and data processors. Sampling strategies were carefully reviewed, discussed, adapted, and docu-mented by a member of the core research team. Adaptations to questionnaires were carefully reviewed and documented by a member of the core research team. One data entry system and the same database structure was used in all coun-tries with interactive error checking and compulsory double entry and data vali- dations. Adaptation of the data entry program, as well as training of dataentry and data processing procedures, was done on site by one of the mem- bers of the core research team. During field implementation, standard quality control measures were imple-mented in all countries, such as questionnaire checking on site, regular debrief- ings, and support to the interviewers. Data cleaning was done with support of one member of the core research team to ensure similar procedures were followed in all countries. A standard list of preliminary analyses was identified and conducted in each country. Annual meetings were held with the country research teams to share lessonslearned. BOX 6.6 ENSURING THE COMPARABILITY OF DATA IN THE WHO MULTI-COUNTRY STUDY ON WOMEN'S HEALTH AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN (From WHO, 2004.15)A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 99partner violence, particularly in the United States. The original CTS has several sub-scales that measure acts used in the courseof conflict, including negotiating tactics, andverbal and physical aggression. The physicalaggression subscale of the CTS measures the frequency and severity of specific acts ofphysical violence within the family, includ-ing husband-to-wife, wife-to-husband, andparent to child violence. 19, 20The revised ver- sion, called the CTS2, also includes ques-tions on sexual violence and injuries. 21The CTS approach is particularly useful for inter- national comparisons because it is behav-iorally specific. Therefore it is likely todetect women who have experienced actsof violence but do not necessarily identifythemselves as battered or abused. Althoughit was designed to measure all kinds of vio-lence between husbands and wives, thesubscales can be used independently. Used alone, however, many researchers observe that the CTS has some drawbacks.It provides limited information about thecontext and consequences of abuse, aswell some of the more complex issues ofcontrol and psychological degradation thatmany researchers consider central featuresof wife abuse. 18 A further problem with the CTS is that it frames the occurrence of violencewithin the context of conflict resolution,and includes a subscale of negotiatingtactics for resolving conflict. Feministresearchers question the assumption ofgender neutrality behind the CTS becausethey view male violence as a coercivetactic for maintaining power and domina-tion within a relationship. In an interna-tional setting, the assumption that equalpartners come together to \"negotiate\"conflict is even more problematic, sincemany cultures define women as perpet-ual minors, both socially and legally.Men are granted the right to physicallycorrect or punish their wives much asparents in other cultures are grantedthis right over children.22 Because the focus of the CTS is on the acts themselves, it does not provide infor-mation about the context, or the intentionbehind the use of violence. For example, itdoes not distinguish between violenceused for self-defense and violence used forthe purpose of control or punishment.Therefore, when used to measure bothhusband-to-wife and wife-to-husband vio-lence, the CTS has led to what manyresearchers consider to be misleading con-clusions about the supposed symmetry ofmarital violence. 23Most international research, however, consistently shows thatviolence used by males and females isboth quantitatively and qualitatively differ-ent. 24, 25Whereas female violence is more likely to take place in the context of self-defense, male violence is more likely tolead to injury. Other well-known instruments for meas- uring wife abuse include the Index of Spouse Abuse , which is a 30-item self- report scale designed to measure the sever-ity or magnitude of physical (ISA-P) andnonphysical abuse (ISA-NP). 26More concise instruments such as the Abuse Assessment Screen have been used successfully inTHE CHALLENGE OF DEFINING AND MEASURING VIOLENCE IN QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH Use broad criteria in defining the study population. For studies that address multiple forms of violence, all women from a specific age groupshould be included. For studies of intimate partner violence, considerincluding all women who have ever been married or who are in a com- mon-law relationship. Provide multiple opportunities to disclose. Do not use \"gateway\" or \"filter\" questions. Use behaviorally specific acts to ask about violence. Use at least two orthree questions per type of violence. Be specific about time frames\u2014include at least one recent (last year) andone long-term time frame (since you were 18; since you were married). Ask about specific perpetrators and specific contexts to cue the respondent'smemory. In order to ensure confidentiality and increase disclosure, interview only onewoman per household. Do not interview men and women from the same households about violence.BOX 6.7 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MEASURING VIOLENCE100 Researching Violence Against Womenscreening for abuse, particularly within health services.27The Abuse Assessment Screen, which has only five questions, isan effective tool for measuring physicaland sexual abuse in the last year and dur-ing pregnancy. Another recently developed instrument, theWomen's Experience with Battering Framework (WEB) , is unique because it measures battering based on the subjectiveexperience of the woman, rather than ondiscrete incidences of physical violence. 28, 29 The WEB scale has ten items, based onqualitative research with U.S. batteredwomen, which describe different dimen-sions of the experience of battering, suchas shame and diminished autonomy.Examples of questions are \"I feel ashamedof the things he does to me,\" and \"He hasa look which terrifies me even when hedoesn't touch me.\" However, the WEBFramework has not yet been validatedinternationally to determine whether theexperiences provide a meaningful measureof battering in a cross-cultural context. Two more recently developed instru- ments for international surveys are theDomestic Violence Module of the Demographic and Health Surveys , 2and WHO's instrument for the VAW study. TheDHS module is designed to be included ina larger survey on women's reproductivehealth and can be obtained fromhttp://macroint.com. The WHO question-naire is designed primarily as a stand-alone questionnaire for violence research.This questionnaire, which has beenenriched by the experiences of previousinternational research, collects detailedinformation about acts of physical, sexual,and emotional violence committed bypartners and nonpartners. It includesinformation about the frequency andduration of violence, violence duringpregnancy, health consequences forwomen and their children, women'sresponses to abuse, and access to services for battered women. The study also explores such related issues as com-munity norms regarding violence, deci-sion making within the family, women'sfinancial autonomy, and physical mobil-ity. The full questionnaire is available from the WHO by writing to: genderand-health@who.int. A subset version of the WHO question- naire, called the Violence Against Women Instrument , includes a basic set of questions that may be included in othersurveys for the purpose of measuring vio-lence. In a relatively concise manner, thisinstrument measures experiences of violentacts carried out by a partner, includingemotional abuse, moderate and severephysical violence, and sexual coercion withand without the use of physical force. Itfurther measures the frequency of eachtype of violence during the last year and atany time. This instrument, together withnotes on the use of the instrument, is pre-sented in Appendix I. Sexual coercion/rape Instruments to measure sexual coercionand/or forced sex are less well developedcross culturally than those to measure part-ner violence. Due to the shame associatedwith sexual violation in many settings, it iseven harder for women to speak freelyabout forced sex than it is to admit tobeing beaten. There is general agreement that meas- ures of sexual coercion should include ref-erence to the type of sexual act, the typeof tactic or force used, the relationshipwith the perpetrator, the number of perpe-trators, and whether the acts wereattempted or were in fact completed. Inaddition, researchers should preferablyrefer to specific acts, rather than vagueterms such as \"sexual abuse\" or \"assault.\" In the United States, the most commonly used instrument for measuring sexualaggression is the Sexual ExperiencesCHAPTER SIXA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 101Survey (SES) first developed by Koss.1, 14, 30-32 The revised SES uses ten items to assess different forms and degrees of sexual coer-cion. An example of a question describinga relatively mild level of sexual coercion is\"Have you ever given in to sex play(fondling, kissing or petting, but not inter-course) when you didn't want to becauseyou were overwhelmed by your partner'scontinual arguments and 'pressure'?\" Asample question that refers to more severeaggression asks \"Have you ever had sexualintercourse when you didn't want tobecause you were threatened or becausesomeone used some degree of physicalforce (twisting your arm, holding youdown) to make you?\" Within each item,sexual aggression is treated dichotomously(yes, no), although some investigators havemodified the SES to assess the frequency ofdifferent experiences. Child sexual abuse Individuals researching child sexual abusehave used instruments specific to sexualabuse as well as broader instrumentsdesigned to capture different forms of mal-treatment in childhood. An increasinglypopular instrument known as theChildhood Trauma Questionnaire(CTQ) investigates a variety of forms of trauma that children can experience grow-ing up, and yields separate estimates ofemotional abuse, physical abuse, sexualabuse, emotional neglect, and physicalneglect. 33 In contrast to instruments that inquire about specific acts, the CTQ presentsrespondents with a series of statementsabout childhood experiences that areranked on a five-point scale, withresponse options ranging from \"nevertrue\" to \"very often true.\" Most items arephrased in objective terms (e.g., \"When Iwas growing up, someone touched me ina sexual way or made me touch them.\"),whereas others call for more subjectiveevaluation (\"When I was growing up, Ibelieve I was sexually abused.\") The ques-tionnaire is introduced with the statement\"In this section, we would like to knowabout experiences you may have hadbefore you were 18 years of age.\" Other instruments inquire about a series of specific sexual acts, followed by clarify-ing questions regarding when and withwhom it happened, how it made therespondent feel, and the degree of persua-sion or force used. Violence against women in conflict situations In recent years, researchers have addressed the specific challenges of documenting vio-lence suffered by women in conflict situa-tions. 34, 35A group of organizations involved in the Reproductive Health Response inConflict Consortium has developed a seriesof excellent tools for monitoring and evalu-ating violence against women in conflictsituations. One of these tools is a surveyinstrument that measures different kinds ofviolence against women, including physicaland sexual violence by partners and byothers, including soldiers or paramilitaryforces, and aid workers. 36More information can be found about these instruments athttp://www.rhrc.org/.THE CHALLENGE OF DEFINING AND MEASURING VIOLENCE IN QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH102 Researching Violence Against Women1.

It also gives examples ofhow different strategies have been used tofit the specific needs and circumstances ofresearch projects. SAMPLING CONSIDERATIONS INQUALITATIVE STUDIES There are no hard and fast rules for sample sizes in qualitative research. As Hudelsonpoints out, \"The sample size will dependon the purpose of the research, the specificresearch questions to be addressed, whatwill be useful, what will have credibility,and what can be done with available timeand resources.\" 2 In qualitative sampling, the selection of respondents usually continues until thepoint of redundancy (saturation). This means that when new interviews nolonger yield new information and allpotential sources of variation have beenadequately explored, sampling may stop.For most qualitative studies, 10 to 30 inter-views and/or 4 to 8 focus groups will suf-fice. Table 7.1 summarizes a number ofO ne cannot overemphasize the importance of developing an appropriatesample for the type of research designselected. Although qualitative and quantita-tive research use different approaches forselecting the individuals or groups to bestudied, in all studies it is crucial to planthe sampling strategy carefully. Particularlyin the case of population-based surveys, apoorly selected sample may harm the cred-ibility of a study, even if the rest of thestudy is well executed. Qualitative studies generally focus in depth on a relatively small number ofcases selected purposefully . By contrast, quantitative methods typically depend onlarger samples selected randomly . These tendencies evolve from the underlying pur-pose of sampling in the two traditions ofinquiry. In quantitative research, the goalof sampling is to maximize how represen- tative the sample is so as to be able to generalize findings from the sample to alarger population. In qualitative inquiry, thegoal is to select for information richness soas to illuminate the questions under study. 1 This chapter discusses the major issues that should be taken into account whenCHAPTER SEVEN Developing a Sampling Strategy Topics covered in this chapter: Sampling considerations in qualitative studies Sampling considerations in quantitative research surveys106 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER SEVEN different approaches to qualitative sampling. In qualitative research, the sampling strategy should be selected to help eluci-date the question at hand. For example,researchers with the Nicaraguan organiza-tionPuntos de Encuentro embarked on a project to collect information useful fordesigning a national media campaign thatcalled on men to renounce violence intheir intimate relationships. They wantedto understand the beliefs and attitudes thatexisted in Nicaraguan culture that sup-ported violent behavior toward women.More importantly, they wanted to know ifthere were any \"benefits\" of nonviolencethat could be promoted to encourage mento reconsider their behavior (Box 5.6). Rather than concentrating on collectingType of Sampling Intensity sampling Deviant case sampling Stratified purposeful sampling Snowball or chain sampling (Locate one or two key individuals, andthen ask them to name other likely informants.) Maximum variation sampling (Purposely select a wide range of variation on dimensions of interest.) Convenience sampling (Select who- ever is easiest, closest, etc.) Criterion samplingPurpose To provide rich information from a few select cases that manifest thephenomenon intensely (but are not extreme cases). To learn from highly unusual mani- festations of the phenomenon inquestion. To illustrate characteristics of particu- lar subgroups of interest; to facilitate comparisons. To facilitate the identification of hard-to-find cases. To document diverse variations; can help to identify common patternsthat cut across variations. To save time, money, and effort. Information collected generally has very low credibility. To investigate in depth a particular \"type\" of case; identify all sources of variation.Example Interviewing survivors of date rape to learn more about how coercedsex affects women's sexuality. Interviewing men who do not beat their wives in a culture where wifeabuse is culturally accepted. Interviewing different types of serv- ice providers (police, social work-ers, doctors, clergy) to compare their attitudes toward and treatmentof abuse victims. Finding commercial sex workers to interview about experiences ofchildhood sexual abuse by gettingcases referred through friendship networks. Researching variations in norms about the acceptability of wife beat-ing by conducting focus groups among different sub groups: youngurban women, old urban women, young rural men, old rural men,women who have been abused,women who have not experienced abuse. Forming focus groups based on who is available that day at the local community center, rather than according to clear criteria. Specifically interviewing only abused women who have left their partners within the last year in order to better understand the variety of factors that spur women to leave.TABLE 7.1 TYPES OF SAMPLING STRATEGIES FOR QUALITATIVE STUDIES (From Patton, 1990.3)A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 107information on the norms and attitudes of \"typical\" Nicaraguan men, the researchersdecided to use \"deviant case\" sampling andconcentrate on interviewing men who hadalready had a reputation for being nonvio-lent and renouncing machismo. 4They were interested in finding out from these menwhat benefits, if any, they perceived fromthis choice, and what life-course events,influences, or individuals pushed them inthis direction. The goal was to investigatewhat aspirations and life experiences helpcreate \"healthy\" intimate partnerships. Thefindings were used to design an informa-tion campaign aimed at recruiting moremen to a nonviolent lifestyle. SAMPLING CONSIDERATIONS IN QUANTITATIVERESEARCH SURVEYS In contrast to qualitative research, which generally uses nonprobability or \"purpo-sive\" sampling, quantitative research relieson random sampling of informants. Aprobability or \"representative\" sample is agroup of informants selected from the pop-ulation in such a way that the results maybe generalized to the whole population. When a sample is referred to as ran- dom, it means that specific techniques have been used to ensure that every indi-vidual who meets certain eligibility criteriahas an equal probability of being includedin the study. Failure to adhere to thesetechniques can introduce error or bias into the sample, which may lessen thevalidity of the study. For example, if ahousehold survey on violence only con-ducted interviews during the day, then therespondents most likely to be included inthe study would be women who work athome, and women who worked outsidethe home would be less likely to be inter-viewed. Since women working outside thehome may have different experiences withviolence, the study resultswould be biased towardswomen who work at home.One way to reduce this partic-ular bias would be to return tohomes at night or on week-ends to increase the likelihoodof reaching all women. The way in which the sample is chosen affects its generalizability , or the extent to which the situation found among a particu-lar sample at a particular time can beapplied more generally. There are manytechniques for sampling, each with its owntradeoffs in terms of cost,effort, and potential to gener-ate statistically significantresults. Some strategies, suchas simple random sampling,may not be feasible wherethere is little information avail-able on the population understudy. The following is a briefDEVELOPING A SAMPLING STRATEGY A probability or representative sample is a group of informants selected from the population in such a way that the results may be generalized to the whole population. When a sample is referred to as random , it means that specific statistical techniques have been used to ensure that every individual who meets certain eligibility criteria has an equal probability of being included in the study. PHOTO BY HAFM JANSEN108 Researching Violence Against Womendescription of the more common sampling techniques used. Many people underestimate the chal- lenge of obtaining a well-designed sample.Mistakes are often made due to confusionover the meaning of the term random selection . A random selection does not mean that participants are simply selectedin no particular order. In fact, the tech-niques for obtaining a truly random sampleare quite complex, and inexperiencedresearchers should consult an expert insampling before proceeding. A wellthought-out and tested questionnaire usedon a poorly designed sample will still ren-der meaningless results. Random samples are often confused with convenience or quota samples. Aconvenience sample is when informants are selected according to who is available,in no particular order. In a quota sample a fixed number of informants of a certaintype are selected. Neither strategy willresult in a random sample appropriate forsurvey research. Simple random sampling This sampling technique involves selectionat random from a list of the population,known as the sampling frame . If properly conducted, it ensures that each person hasanequal andindependent chance of being included in the sample.Independence in this case means that theselection of any one individual in no wayinfluences the selection of any other. Theword \"simple\" does not mean that thismethod is any easier, but rather that stepsare taken to ensure that only chance influ-ences the selection of respondents.Random selection can be achieved using alottery method, random number tables(found in many statistical books), or acomputer program such as Epi Info. Toavoid bias, it is very important to includein the sampling frame only individuals whoare eligible to be interviewed by criteriasuch as age, sex, or residence. By the sametoken, if certain individuals are left off theoriginal list due to an outdated census thatdoes not include individuals who haverecently moved into the population area,then these omissions could bias the results,particularly if migration is the result ofcrises such as war, natural disasters, or eco-nomic collapse. In these cases, you willneed to update the sampling list. Systematic sampling In random sampling, each individual orhousehold is chosen randomly. In contrast,systematic sampling starts at a randompoint in the sampling frame, and every nthperson is chosen. For example, if youwant a sample of 100 women from a sam-pling frame of 5,000 women, then youwould randomly select a number betweenone and 50 to start off the sequence, andthen select every fiftieth woman thereafter.Both random and systematic samplingrequire a full list of the population inorder to make a selection. It is also impor-tant to know how the list itself was made,and whether individuals are placed ran-domly or in some kind of order. If individ-uals from the same household or withcertain characteristics are groupedtogether, this may result in a biased sam-ple in which individuals with these charac-teristics are either overrepresented orunderrepresented.CHAPTER SEVEN PHOTO BY HAFM JANSENA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 109clusters (such as villages or neighbor- hoods). Then a random sample of theseclusters is drawn for the survey. This is thefirst stage of sampling. The second stagemay involve either selecting all of the sam-pling units (respondents, households) inthe selected clusters, or selecting a groupof sampling units from within the clusters.Sometimes more than two stages arerequired. Thus, one might randomlychoose districts within a province, andthen randomly select villages from theselected districts as the second stage.Individual respondents would be selectedfrom the clusters as a third stage. At eachstage, simple random, systematic, or strati-fied techniques might be used. It is advis-able to consult a statistician if you areconsidering a multistage sampling scheme. The advantage of multistage sampling is that a sampling frame (e.g., a list of house-holds) is only needed for the selected clus-ters (villages) rather than for the wholestudy population. Also, the logistics will beeasier because the sample is restricted tothe selected clusters and need not coverthe whole study area. An example of amultistage sampling strategy in Peru isdescribed in Box 7.3. The disadvantages of multistage sam- pling are that the sample size needs to besubstantially larger than if the sample wasDEVELOPING A SAMPLING STRATEGY Stratified sampling Stratified sampling may be used together with either simple random sampling or sys-tematic sampling. This ensures that thesample is as close as possible to the studypopulation with regard to certain character-istics, such as age, sex, ethnicity, or socio-economic status. In this case, the studypopulation is classified into strata , or sub- groups, and then individuals are randomlyselected from each stratum. Because strati-fication involves additional effort, it onlymakes sense if the characteristic beingstratified is related to the outcome understudy. For the purpose of analysis it is eas-ier if the number of individuals selectedfrom each stratum is proportional to theiractual distribution in the population. (SeeBox 7.1 on self-weighting samples.) Forexample, in a sample stratified according tourban/rural residence, the proportion ofrural women in the sample would be thesame as the proportion of rural women inthe study population. Aweighted stratified sample may be preferable when there are some groupswhich are proportionately small in thepopulation, but which are relevant for thepurpose of the study, such as individualsfrom a certain geographical region or eth-nic group. Ensuring that these groups areadequately represented might require aninordinately large sample size using simplerandom sampling techniques. In this case,it may be appropriate to oversample, or toselect a disproportionately large number ofrespondents from this stratum. This resultsin a weighted sample that will have to betaken into account in the analysis process. Multistage and cluster sampling Multistage sampling is often used for drawing samples from very large popula-tions covering a large geographical area. Itinvolves selecting the sample in stages, ortaking samples from samples. The popula-tion is first divided into naturally occurringA street map used for locating households in the Japan WHO study. PHOTO BY HAFM JANSEN110 Researching Violence Against Womenselected by simple random sampling. Also, it can be more complicated to get a self-weighting sample. Another difficulty withmultistage sampling can be defining clus-ters if the study area is, for example, alarge urban area. Sometimes these havealready been defined for previous censusesor surveys, but otherwise they have to becreated from a map or based on someother criteria such as school or health cen-ter catchment areas. How large a sample do you need? The ideal sample size for a survey dependson several factors: How sure do you want to be of yourconclusions? Larger sample size gener- ally increases the precision of the results,or the confidence with which one cansay that they represent a reliable meas-ure of the phenomena under study. What are the characteristics of thestudy population? The more variability there is in the population, the larger thesample size needed. How common is the phenomenonunder study? If any of the conditions you want to measure in your study arevery rare, for example, infant mortalityor maternal mortality, then you willneed a very large sample size. What is the purpose of the research?The sample size calculation will alsodepend on whether you simply want tomeasure the prevalence of a conditionin a population or whether you want tomeasure an expected differencebetween two groups. Programs such asEpi Info contain two different formulasfor these two different approaches. What kind of statistical analysis willyou use? This underscores the need to consider how you are going to analyzeyour data from the very beginning. Thesample size must be large enough toprovide for desired levels of accuracy inestimates of prevalence, and to test forthe significance of differences betweendifferent variables. What kind of sampling strategy willbe used? Commonly used sample size formulae and computer packagesassume you are using simple random sampling. If you plan to use multistageor cluster sampling, you may need toincrease your sample size to achieve theprecision you require. Consider asking aCHAPTER SEVEN The way in which the sample is chosen greatly influences the usefulness of the resulting estimates. Suppose that there is a district with only two villages: Village A has 4,000 women, of which 800 (20 percent) have been abused. Village B has 800 women, of which 40 (5 percent) have been abused. The true prevalence of abuse in this district would be calculated as follows: Total cases of violence = (800 + 40) X 100 = 17.5 percent Total number of women (4000 + 800) However, if we decided to determine the prevalence of abuse in this district based on a random sample of 100 women from each village, we would findthe following: 20 out of 100 women in Village A reporting abuse. 5 out of 100 women in Village B reporting abuse. Combining these two figures we would find that 25 out of the 200 women inter- viewed were abused, which would give us a prevalence of 12.5 percent. What has happened here? Our sampling procedure led us to an underestimated prevalence because the num- ber of informants selected from each village was not in proportion to the relative size of each village. Assuming that we knew the relative sizes of the villages, we could perform a weighted analysis where the results from Village A would count five times as much as those from Village B. However, it is usually preferable to obtain a self-weighting sample. One way to do this would be to select five timesmore respondents from Village A than Village B. Another approach is to select the villages with probability proportional to size. This means that if you have a list of vil- lages, a large village like Village A would be five times more likely to be selected for the sample than a village the size of Village B. After the villages were selected, you could then to select an equal number of respondents from each village. (For anexample of how a self-weighting sample was obtained in Peru, see Box 7.3.)BOX 7.1 SELF-WEIGHTING IN CLUSTER SAMPLES (From Morison, 2000.5)A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 111statistician for help in deciding by how much the sample size needs to beincreased. It is better to collect excellent data from fewer respondents than to collect data ofdubious validity and reliability from manyrespondents. Statistical computer packagesor mathematical formulas can be used todetermine sample size for a study. Box 7.2presents a table produced by Epi Info'sSTATCALC program for ideal sample sizecalculations. This program is availableonline at http://www.cdc.gov/epiinfo. If your proposed analysis calls for study- ing particular subgroups of your sample,the sample size will need to be expandedaccordingly. For example, to determine theprevalence of violence, you may need asample of only 300 women. But if youwant to know whether the prevalence ofviolence varies by age, education, or socio-economic group, then you will need asample size sufficiently large to allow forcomparisons among these groups. The initial calculation was made based on a simple random sample from a studypopulation of 100,000 women, where itwas assumed that approximately 30 per-cent of women have experienced violenceand that a 10 percent margin of errorwould be acceptable (5 percent above and5 percent below). If these assumptions areactually true, the table indicates that with asample size of 322 women, one wouldobtain a 95 percent confidence interval forthe true prevalence of 25 percent and 35percent. Note, however, that if the esti-mates used for sample size calculations arevery inaccurate then the required precisionmay not be obtained. The table also shows that differences in the size of the study population do notgreatly influence sample size, whereaschanges in the expected frequency andparticularly the level of precision that isneeded can have an enormous effect on sample size calcula-tions. It should also be noted that thesample size willneed to be increasedif a multistage explore the health consequencesof violence withgreater precision, andto compare the occurrence of violence indifferent sites within each country, theWHO VAW study uses a multistage sam-pling strategy aiming for 3,000 interviewsin two sites; 1,500 in the capital city and1,500 in a province.

This is one of the most common ques- tions asked of statisticians. A frequent but erroneous answer is \"as large as possible\" when it instead should be \"as small as possible.\" It is also important to emphasize that the amount of information that can be gained from a sample depends on its absolute size, not upon the sampling fraction, or its size as a proportion of the population size. It is actually true that 99 out of one million tells you as much about the 1 million as 99 out of one thousand tells you about the one thousand. (From Persson and Wall, 2003.6)112 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER SEVEN Lima 1. The team obtained from the National Institute of Statistics and Information (INEI) a list of selected clusters. INEI had divided Limainto 12,000 clusters with about 50 to 150 houses in each cluster. The team randomly selected 166 clusters, using probability propor-tional to size (assigning a weighted value to the larger clusters togive them a greater likelihood of being selected). INEI provided the team with maps that showed where the clusters were in relation toeach other, and a map of each selected cluster indicating buildingssuch as houses, shops, and warehouses. 2. Because the maps had been made a few years earlier, the Peru team had to update them to take migration into account. A team of enumerators was sent to each cluster a few weeks before fieldworkbegan and went to each building to verify how many households lived there. They also obtained information regarding the number ofeligible women in each household. A total of 21,322 householdswere enumerated in this process. 3. Based on this information, the team estimated that they would need a sample size of 2,000 in order to end up with 1,500 completed interviews after accounting for refusals and households without eligi- ble women. Therefore, 12 households were selected in each of the 166 clusters. The sampling interval varied according to the size of the cluster. In a cluster with 120 households, every tenth household was chosen, in a cluster with 72 households every sixth house was chosen, and so forth. In the clusters with less than 48 households, a different strategy was used. To avoid interviewing women living veryclose to each other (this might undermine confidentiality), a minimum interval of four houses between selected households was estab- lished. This meant that in a cluster with 36 households, only nine women would be interviewed, instead of 12. 4. To choose the households, the team supervisor chose a house in each cluster at random using the same technique to start off the num- bering (for example the northernmost house in a block). Interviewers then followed the sam-pling interval to select thehouses where women would be interviewed.No replacements were allowed in the case ofhouseholds without eligi-ble women. Cusco A multistage sampling strategy was used in Cusco, where there are a few rural towns, and the rest of the popula- tion is dispersed throughout the mountains. The region has 12 provinces, and includes the regional capital, Cusco, where a largepart of the population lives. The other provinces are mostly rural. 1. Four provinces were selected randomly. These included the town of Cusco plus three rural provinces. 2. INEI selected 46 clusters for the town of Cusco and 66 for the three provinces. Each cluster was selected with probability proportional to size. INEI had maps only for the town, and these were updated inthe same fashion as in Lima. In Cusco, 12,558 buildings were enu- merated with 5,619 households. Twenty-three households wereselected to be visited in each cluster. 3. For the rural clusters, only general maps were available indicating where larger towns were located. In the larger towns, the team made a quick inventory of households and sketched a map. Thetotal number of households was divided by 23 to obtain the sam-pling interval. The first household was selected randomly, then the rest were selected systematically. 4. In the rural area, no information was available. To generate detailed maps, the team held meetings with the leaders of rural communities and local women's clubs. The leaders were informed about the gen- eral goals of the study and the approximate dates that fieldworkwould be performed in their communities. The leaders prepared maps of each village, with all houses and landmarks indicated, and then together mapped out the routes that fieldworkers would follow to reach the villages. 5. With the help of the maps, one household was randomly selected, and from this starting point all households were visited following aspiral direction, until 23 households with eligible women were vis- ited. Because households were very dispersed, it was not necessaryto have a minimum sampling interval. If one village did not have 23households in it, then the closest village was visited, following the same procedure until the 23 interviews were completed.BOX 7.3 SAMPLING IN PERU The WHO VAW Study was carried out in two sites in Peru: Lima, the capital, and Cusco, a mountainous region with a mostly Quechu a-speaking population. The research team used two very different sampling strategies for the study. Community leaders mapping out villages in Cusco, Peru Community map with schools, roads marked. (From Guezmes et al, 2002.7)A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 113for missing households, where there is no eligible woman, or where the selectedrespondent is unavailable or refuses to par-ticipate in the study. Obtaining a sampling frame As pointed out earlier, to select a randomsample, it is necessary to have a list ormap of all households or individuals(depending on the sampling unit) in thestudy population. Wherever possible, pre- viously developed sampling frames should be used, for example: Official census data. Voter registration records. Census carried out by the HealthMinistry for immunization or malariacampaigns. Sampling frames developed by otherlarge-scale studies carried out in thecountry (such as Demographic andHealth Surveys or Living StandardsMeasurement Surveys). Each of these options will have to be reviewed carefully to assess the quality ofthe information. In some kinds of officialdata, certain individuals may be left out (forexample, resident foreigners or domesticservants). Moreover, unless the data werecollected quite recently, it will probably benecessary to update the records. Even so,this will be much less time-consuming andcostly than developing your own samplingframe. If there is nothing already availablethen you will have to develop your ownsampling frame. This is often done by enu- merating (listing and mapping) house- holds and/or eligible respondents in theselected clusters. An example of some otherapproaches used in Liberia in a conflict sit-uation is shown in Box 7.4. Who is eligible to be interviewed? Other sections addressed the importance,for safety reasons, of interviewing only onewoman per household. However, eachresearch team will have to consider care-fully what criteria to use for eligibility. Inother words, which women within thehousehold can be considered as a possibleinformant? For example, will domestic ser-vants be included? What about visitingfriends or relatives, or lodgers such as stu-dents who are renting a room in the house? Researchers have resolved these issues in different ways, and each solution has itsown advantages and tradeoffs. For exam-ple, if whether a woman slept in thehousehold the night before is used as abasic criterion, then domestic servants maybe included in their place of work.However, in this case, much of the eco-nomic status information collected aboutthe household will not reflect this woman'sDEVELOPING A SAMPLING STRATEGY A study in Liberia on violence against women during the civil war used several dif- ferent survey sites to maximize the breadth of representation, including marketplaces, high schools, urban communities, and displaced persons camps. Each site required a different sampling strategy. Although each strategy yielded a good approximation of the situation of women from the specific target group sampled, itshould be noted that one cannot combine the three groups to obtain a prevalence estimate for Liberian women as a whole. Sampling older women: In the market places, the sampling unit was a market stall. Surveyors drew a detailed map of the number and location of tables, fromwhich the computed sampling interval and specific tables were randomlyselected. Because lotteries were common in Liberia, the team made colorful\"lucky tickets\" for the tables that had been randomly selected. After introducingherself to a market woman, the interviewer placed the ticket on the table, say-ing \"lucky ticket\" and invited the woman to participate in the survey. Sampling young girls: The team derived a sampling plan for the high schools by obtaining from the teachers the number of girls in attendance that day in grades nine through twelve. After the sampling interval was computed, the girls in each class counted off starting from \"one\" to the sampling interval. If the sam-pling interval was four, for example, every girl who counted off \"four\" was invited to participate in the survey. The sampling was done publicly so thateveryone knew that the girls had not been selected because of any particular experience, thereby preventing any stigma that might be attached to beingselected to participate in a survey about sexual violence. Sampling refugees: The availability of food distribution census data made it easier to sample in the communities and in the displaced persons camps. After calculating the sampling interval, households were systematically chosen byselecting a starting household at random using the last two digits of the serialnumber on a Liberian $5 bill chosen at random. BOX 7.4 CREATIVE SAMPLING IN LIBERIA (From Swiss et al, 1998.8)114 Researching Violence Against Womentrue status. On the other hand, if domestic servants are not considered eligible intheir place of work, then it is important tomake sure that they may have an oppor-tunity to be included in their permanenthouseholds. This places an additional bur- den on interviewers because to avoid hav-ing a high nonresponse rate, it will benecessary to return in some cases on spe-cific days or evenings when the womanwill be home. The key to not introducingbias into the sample is to remember thateligibility criteria must be determined insuch a way that all eligible women withinthe cluster have an equal opportunity tobe chosen as informants, whether at theirhomes, place of work, or school. The WHO VAW study decided to con- sider permanent lodgers and domestic ser-vants who spend fewer than two nightsper week away from the household as eli-gible informants. Women who worked inthe household as domestic servants butspent at least two nights a week awaywould not be included. These womencould potentially be selected to be inter-viewed in their own homes on their daysoff work. To avoid biasing the sample, it is important that interviewers select thewoman to be interviewed using randommethods, and not simply the first womanto answer the door, or the oldest, or theone who seems most available. In theWHO VAW study, this was achieved bychoosing women's names out of a paperbag. In Nicaragua, a random number chartwas used to select the women to inter-view. Box 7.5 describes how to use thesemethods. If you are using a list ofwomen's names generated from a sam-pling frame of individuals, and it is possi-ble to determine whether two women areliving in the same household, then youcan select one woman from each pair byalternating between the older andyounger woman.CHAPTER SEVEN Lottery Make a list of all the women in the household who are eligible to participate in the study according to the study criteria (such as over 15, ever been partnered). Besure to include women even if they are not in the house at the time of the visit. Write the name of each woman on a separate piece of paper and place the papers in a paper bag. Ask someone in the household (perhaps the oldest person) to select a paper from the bag. Advantages of this method are the simplicity of administration and that it makes clear to everyone in the household that the person has been selected by chance, not because of any special characteristics. The dis- advantage of this method is that it is difficult to monitor whether interviewers are using the system correctly. Randomized chart A randomized chart may be helpful for selecting a woman to interview once you have a complete list of all members of the household. This method makes it fairlyeasy to monitor whether fieldworkers are using the procedure correctly, but it is lesstransparent to household members. Check the last digit on the number of the questionnaire. This indicates the row to use. Then, check on the list of household members the total number of women between 15 and 49 who have ever been married or partnered. This indicates the column to use. The number that appears in the intersection of the row and column indicates the number of the woman who should be interviewed.

Finally, decide whether you understand the topic and setting well enough to designa questionnaire. If not, you may want toconduct some formative research to iden-tify areas of inquiry and to refine issues oflanguage. Chapter 9 presents a number ofqualitative techniques for gathering infor-mation before you design a more struc-tured questionnaire. DEVELOPING THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK Before developing your questionnaire it is essential to decide exactly what informa-tion you will need and how you will meas-ure it. One way to do this is to map outvisually all the information in your researchquestions and organize it according to howyou think the variables are related to eachQ uantitative data are generally col- lected using a standardized questionnaire,which may be administered in a face-to-face interview or as a self-administeredquestionnaire. The process of developing awell-conceptualized and user-friendlyinstrument for collecting quantitative datais complex and time-consuming, but cru-cial for successful research. Before starting, clarify what you want to know, according to the goals of yourstudy. Next, consider whether you canobtain all of the answers you seek byquestioning respondents, or if you willneed to use additional techniques such asobservation or analysis of records. Howwill you administer your questionnaire\u2014by phone, in person, by mail, or by com-puter? In making this decision, considerboth the literacy levels of likely respon-dents and the positive or negative influ-ence each option may have on theCHAPTER EIGHT Tools for Collecting Quantitative Data Topics covered in this chapter: Developing the conceptual framework Operationalizing the main variablesFormulating your questions Formatting your questionnaireTranslating the instrumentPre-testing the instrument118 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER EIGHT other. This exercise will be informed by the review you have carried out of relevantliterature and the \"brainstorming\" sessionsthat you have carried out with the researchteam and knowledgeable members of thecommunity. Start out by including as broada range of factors as possible. Figure 8.1 shows how individual char- acteristics of women and their partners,combined with community level characteris-tics such as norms around violence and theexistence of services for abused women,might increase or decrease a woman's riskof being abused by her partner. The charac-teristics of the abuse, whether sexual, physi-cal, or emotional, and its severity andfrequency, are likely to determine whethershe will suffer either physical or emotionalFIGURE 8.1 EXAMPLE OF A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING RISKS AND IMPACT OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE Women's characteristics Age (younger than partner) Urban residence Number of children Works outside home Low education Witnessed violence as a child Partner's characteristics Age discrepancy (higher than respondent) Low education Employment Witnessed violence asa child Uses drugs or alcohol Women's responses Seeks formal help (police, judges) Seeks informal help (friends, family) Defends self physically Leaves relationship tem-porarily or permanentlyViolence against women by intimate partners Type Severity FrequencyHealth consequences Injuries Emotional distress Miscarriages Abortions Physical symptoms Community characteristics Community norms favor violence against women Belief that violence is a \"private family problem\" and others should not interfere No support services for abused womenA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 119health effects from the violence. Finally, the characteristics of the violence, the healtheffects, and community attitudes and theavailability of support services determine theoptions she has for protecting herself. If you are looking at a specific outcome for which there are already known risk fac-tors, these risk factors should be includedin the map. For example, if you want toexamine the relationship between lowbirth weight and violence, it is important tocollect information about a woman's repro-ductive history\u2014such as number of preg-nancies and use of alcohol or tobaccoduring her pregnancy. Each concept included in the map will be translated into one or more variables.These are the components of the researchquestion, conceptually isolated and unam-biguously defined. The variables that repre-sent specific outcomes under study areknown as the outcome ordependent variables , while those variables that help explain the causes of these outcomes areknown as explanatory orindependent variables . Some variables, such as \"vio- lence,\" can be considered as both, depend-ing on whether one is looking at thecauses or consequences of violence. Once you map out all the possible vari- ables, it is time to narrow the focus of thestudy according to what is feasible andmost relevant to the study's objectives.Some of the variables may be outside thescope of the survey. These variablesshould be discarded; there is no point incollecting data that will not yield meaning-ful results. OPERATIONALIZING THE MAIN VARIABLES Once you determine which specific out- comes and background variables toinclude in the questionnaire, it is necessaryto decide how each will be defined andmeasured. In Chapter 6, we discussed howdifferent types of violence might be moreprecisely measured. As an example, Table8.1 presents how the WHO VAW Studyaddressed different issues regarding riskand protective factors and consequencesof violence. FORMULATING YOUR QUESTIONS Once you identify your study variables, it is time to turn them into clearly wordedquestions. Survey questionnaires commonlyuse two types of questions: Closed questions. Respondents are asked to choose from one or more fixedalternatives. These can be yes/no ques- tions (\"Has gories (\"Would you say husband hityou several times, ormany times?\"). Another typeof closed question, thescale item , asks for a response in the form ofdegree of agreement or dis-agreement, or level of inten-sity, (\"How do you feelabout the following statement: Womenshould put up with abuse in order tokeep the family together? Stronglyagree, Agree, Don't know, Disagree,Strongly disagree.\") Open questions. These do not restrict the content or manner of the replyother than the subject area (\"Whom didyou tell about your situation?\" or \"Whowas present the last time you werebeaten?\") The majority of questions in the survey questionnaire will probably be in theform of closed questions. Open-endedquestions are flexible and allow the TOOLS FOR COLLECTING QUANTITATIVE DATA Adependent variable refers to the specific outcome or condi- tion under study (e.g., violence). Anindependent or explanatory variable is one that helps explain the causes of the dependent variable. 120 Researching Violence Against Womeninterviewer to probe a subject in greater depth, but they are also more time-con-suming to administer and analyze. Wetherefore recommend that you limit theuse of open-ended questions when con-ducting large-scale surveys. Piloting andformative research may facilitate the useof open-ended questions by providingsuggestions for standard responses thatcan be precoded and included in thequestionnaire. Use of international instruments For many concepts, such as emotional dis-tress, socio-economic status, or reproduc-tive health outcomes, international questionnaires already exist, and may already be adapted and even validated foruse in your country. Using instruments thathave already been validated makes it easierto compare the findings in your study withother national and international studies. Asthe example from South Africa in Box 8.1shows, it's still important to pre-test theinstruments to be sure that the conceptsare clear and meaningful in your setting.Box 8.2 describes the process of develop-ing the WHO VAW instrument. FORMATTING YOUR QUESTIONNAIRE The way the questionnaire is organized and formatted can make a big difference inhow smoothly the interviews go. The mainissues are:CHAPTER EIGHT Prevalence and characteristics of violence Prevalence during last year Prevalence ever Severity of abuse Type of abuse (physical, sexual, emotional) Frequency during last year Frequency of previous violence Relationship to offender Violence during pregnancy Initiation and duration of violence Background socio-economic information Details of respondent Details of current or most recent partner Age Age Education Education and training Marital status/marital history Marital status Household composition Current or most recent employment Socio-economic status of household Current or most recent employment/sources of income Risk and protective factors for violence against women in families About woman Details of current or most recent partner Female access to and control of resources Expectations, communication, and decision making in relationship History of previous victimization Extent of participation in looking after family and home Indicators of empowerment Use of alcohol and drugs Resistance to violence Employment status Whether witnessed violence between parents as a child Whether witnessed violence between parents as a child Whether can access support outside the household from friends Whether physically aggressive towards other men Whether belongs to any group/association Use of alcohol or drugTABLE 8.1 TOPICS INCLUDED IN THE WHO MULTI-COUNTRY STUDY ON WOMEN'S HEALTH AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN (From WHO, 2004.1)A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 121to continue the survey. In telephone or personal interviews, they help build rap-port with the interviewer. Groupingtogether questions on the same topic alsomakes the questionnaire easier to answer. Whenever possible, place difficult or sensitive questions towards the end of thesurvey. Any rapport that has been built upwill make it more likely people will answerthese questions. If people quit at that pointanyway, at least they will have answeredmost of your questions. If conducting research in a culture that is not your own, don't assume you can pre-dict what will be considered sensitive. InTOOLS FOR COLLECTING QUANTITATIVE DATA The sequence of questions Appropriate answer scales Appropriate skip patterns The sequence of questions Keep two broad issues in mind when con-sidering the order of your questions. Oneis how the order can encourage or discour-age people from completing the survey.The other is how the order of questions orthe order of answer choices could affectyour results. Ideally, the early questions in a survey should be easy and pleasant to answer.These kinds of questions encourage peopleHealth outcomes Reproductive history including pregnancies, live births, miscarriages, and still births Whether she wanted pregnancy with last child Details of last child and use of prenatal services Use of family planning Smoking and alcohol consumption in last month Indicators of physical health problems in last month Indicators of reduced mobility or functioning in last month Indicators of psychological distress in last month Suicidal thoughts and attempted suicides Health care utilization in last month Use of medication in last month Hospitalization and operations in last year Injuries resulting from physical violence Use of health services as a result of injuries Other consequences of violence Impact on women's lives Impact on children's lives Perception of whether affected physical or mental health Reported birth weight for last child under 5 Prevented from working Child aged 5-12 had to repeat year at school Disruption of work/ability to earn money Child aged 5-12 ran away from home Ability to attend community meetings Child has emotional problems (thumb-sucking, bed-wetting) Extent to which children witness physical or sexual violence Women's responses to violence Sources of help and response Actions to prevent or reduce violence Who knows about situation Did she ever defend herself physically Who intervened or tried to stop violence Whether she ever hit first Use of formal and informal services Whether she ever left/frequency left Who got help from/forms of help provided Satisfaction with response Who she would have liked to get more help fromTABLE 8.1 TOPICS INCLUDED IN THE WHO MULTI-COUNTRY STUDY ON WOMEN'S HEALTH AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN (From WHO, 2004.1)122 Researching Violence Against Womenthe WHO VAW study, for example, the questions considered most sensitive varieddramatically by country. In Bangladesh, itwas considered routine to ask womenabout family planning and this was seen asa good rapport-building topic. In Japan, questions about birth control were per-ceived as highly sensitive. The Japan teamurged leaving these questions until later inthe questionnaire. Another strategy for increasing response rates on highly sensitive questions, or in sit-uations where privacy is difficult to achieve,is to allow individuals to respond by point-ing out the appropriate answer on responsecards rather than saying an answer outloud. Keep in mind that this strategy onlyworks with literate populations.CHAPTER EIGHT The questionnaire used in the study was the product of a long process of discussion and consultation. This has involved reviewing existing literature and numerous instruments, and incorporating input from technical experts inspecific areas (including violence against women, reproductive health, mental health, and drug and alcohol use)from members of the expert steering committee, and from experts in the field of conducting large population-basedsurveys (e.g., the DHS). Moreover, to ensure maximum comparability across studies, discussions were also heldwith groups such as the International Network of Clinical Epidemiologists (INCLEN) that were conducting research in related areas. For practical reasons, the questionnaire consists primarily of structured questions with closed responses. In the development phase, the questionnaire was first translated and pre-tested in a limited number of countries on a convenience sample of women. This process was used to explore a range of issues associated with the content ofthe different sections of the questionnaire. At this stage, respondents were not only asked to answer questions from the questionnaire, but also were requested to provide feedback on the clarity and acceptability of the questions asked, and the way in which the questionnaire was being delivered. At the end of this first pre-test, all interviewersmet with the country research team to review the questionnaire, to determine where problems were arising, and toexplore possible solutions. This feedback was used to revise different modules within the questionnaire. Subsequent drafts were informed by qualitative research in the culturally diverse countries and were field-tested again in a second pre-test in the remaining participating countries. This experience resulted in extensive revisions to improve accuracy and cross-cultural comparability, and in the final content and structure. The final revisions to thequestionnaire were made following the fourth research team meeting. The revised questionnaire was then sent toeach country research team for a final pre-test. This resulted in version 9.9, which was used in the first eight coun- tries of the multi-country study. Each country could add only a limited number of relevant country specific questions, and adapted certain response codes to reflect local circumstances. Between 1999 and 2002, the final questionnaire was used in 13 languages during the implementation of the WHO multi-country study in Bangladesh, Brazil, Japan, Namibia, Peru, Samoa, Tanzania, and Thailand. Additional studies in Chile, China, Serbia, New Zealand, Ethiopia, and Indonesia have also used this questionnaire. The questionnaire and a manual with the question-by-question description of the questionnaire isavailable from WHO at genderandhealth@ who.int. A shortened version of the instrument can be found inAppendix I of this guide.BOX 8.2 DEVELOPING THE CORE QUESTIONNAIRE FOR THE WHO MULTI-COUNTRY STUDY ON WOMEN'S HEALTH AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMENBOX 8.1 QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA In 1998, the South African Medical Research Council conducted a survey on vio- lence against women. The survey was applied to a random sample of 750 house-holds per province in three (of nine) rural provinces with women aged 18-49. The questionnaire for the women's survey was developed using instruments from other countries and two South African focus groups. It was tested and refined over a three- month period with abused women, other women, and NGO staff. The final revi-sions were made after a pilot training session for fieldworkers. Mental health questions were particularly difficult. At the outset, researchers consid- ered using a 20-item self-reporting questionnaire that had been tested and calibratedto similar African settings. During testing, however, informants and fieldworkers hadenormous difficulty understanding the questions, and the instrument's length wasproblematic in an already long questionnaire. In addition, scores seemed to beimprobably high. This prompted an investigation of indigenous and lay expressions of mental ill health\u2014a process that yielded several expressions of distress shared among all African linguistic groups in South Africa. Idioms used to describe mental distress include \"the spirit is low\" and, if more severe, \"the spirit/heart is painful.\" These expressions were incorporated into the questionnaire. (From Jewkes et al, 1999.2) (From WHO, 2004.1)A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 123The other way question order can affect results is habituation. This problemapplies to a series of questions that allhave the same answer choices. Afterbeing asked a series of similar questionspeople may give the same answer with- out really considering it. One way toavoid this is by asking some questions sothat positive attitudes or beliefs are sometimes scored with a yes answer or ahigh number on a scale and on otherquestions with a no answer or a lownumber. Box 8.3 presents an example of ques- tions asked in the WHO VAW study aboutwomen's attitudes toward gender roles.TOOLS FOR COLLECTING QUANTITATIVE DATA In this community and elsewhere, people have different ideas about families and what is acceptable behavior for men and women in the home. I am going to read you a list of statements, and I would like you to tell me whether you generally agree or disagree with the statement. There are no right or wrong answers. A good wife obeys her husband even if she disagrees.

Appropriate answer scales Questions related to attitudes, frequency ofevents, or opinions usually require partici-pants to answer based on some form ofscaled response. In the developed world,such scales usually allow for at least fivedistinct answers. Such complex scales,however, can be difficult for some popula-tions to understand and interpret. Moreover,certain cultural patterns and expectationscan influence how individuals reply to dif-ferent response options. For example,researchers in Nicaragua found when usinga five-point scale to measure perceptions ofchildhood experiences that respondentsalmost invariably answered that they \"strongly agreed\" or \"strongly disagreed.\"Almost no responses indicated that they\"somewhat\" agreed or disagreed. In con-trast, in other countries, particularly in Asia,researchers have found that respondentsare reluctant to express a very strong opin-ion, for fear of seeming rude. Therefore,responses tend to be more neutral. 3 Appropriate skip patterns Theskip patterns in a questionnaire determine the order of specific questionsthat will be asked according to answers thatare previously given. They help make theinterview flow smoothly and avoid annoy-ing mistakes, such as asking a woman theage of her children when she has alreadyindicated that she has no children, or ask-ing women who have never had sexualrelations whether they use birth control.Special care should be taken to ensure thatthe skip patterns are correctly placed andthat women are not inadvertently excludedfrom being asked important questions. As an example of how important infor- mation may be lost through errors in skippatterns, the Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua, survey onlyasked questions about problems in preg-nancy to women who had suffered abuse.This made it impossible to compare therates of miscarriages and abortions amongabused and nonabused women. A similarproblem occurred when questions aboutphysical injuries as a result of abuse wereasked of women who had only sufferedemotional and not physical violence. TRANSLATING THE INSTRUMENT Now that you've developed your test instrument, how do you translate it into thelocal language? You need an accurate andprecise translation, but professional transla-tors may not be familiar with the termswomen use to talk about violence and inti-mate relationships. Several steps can enhance your transla- tion efforts. First, involve activists or serviceproviders in translating the test instrument.You may find that formative research helpsyou identify the appropriate terms andexpressions to describe the issues understudy. Researchers often use a techniquecalled back-translation (having someone unfamiliar with the study translate the ques-tionnaire back into English) to ensure thatthe instrument has been properly translated.However, researchers in South Africa andZimbabwe found that back-translationswere not a reliable way to check the accu-racy of questions on violence and its conse-quences. They achieved better results whensomeone who understood the purpose ofthe study and who could compare theEnglish version with its translation checkedthe translated questionnaire. 2Box 8.4 describes the steps that were taken in trans-lating the WHO VAW questionnaire.CHAPTER EIGHTA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 125PRE-TESTING THE INSTRUMENT Before beginning the fieldwork, it is essen- tial to pre-test the questionnaire thor-oughly. The many errors or unforeseensituations you will find are fairly easy tocorrect at this stage, but would be quitecostly to repair later. To pre-test, try thequestionnaire on women who do not livein the research area, but who are similar to the women you are planning to study (thisdoes not have to be a random sample).This step enables you to detect any prob-lems in terms of the content or wording ofquestions as well as interview length. Trythe test on women of different ages andbackgrounds, including women who areknown to be experiencing different formsof abuse. The women's organizations par-ticipating in your advisory group may behelpful in identifying women who are will-ing to be interviewed about their experi-ences of violence. If the questionnaire is to be translated into different languages, pre-test the trans-lated versions too. In addition, askingrespondents to answer questions from thequestionnaire, invite them to provide feed-back: \"Are the questions asked clear andacceptable? How do you feel about howthe interview was conducted?\" At the endof the pre-test, all interviewers should meetwith the research team to review the ques-tionnaire, to pinpoint problems with thequestions and coding categories, and toexplore possible solutions. Box 8.5 givessome examples of the kinds of questionsyou might ask in the pre-testing stage.TOOLS FOR COLLECTING QUANTITATIVE DATA BOX 8.4 TRANSLATING THE WHO QUESTIONNAIRE The working language for the development of the core questionnaire was English. Before pre-testing, each country questionnaire was professionally translated into each of the local languages used by the study population. The formative researchwas used to guide the forms of language and expressions used, with the focusbeing on using words and expressions that are widely understood in the studysites. In settings where there are a number of languages in use, it was necessary to develop questionnaires in each language. The translated questionnaire was first checked by local researchers involved in the study who could compare the English version with its translation. Lengthy oral back-translation sessions with step-by-step discussion of each question were conductedwith people not familiar with the questionnaire but fluent in the language and with people who understood the questionnaire and violence issues. The main purposewas to identify differences in translations that could alter the meaning and to estab- lish cognitive understanding of the items in the questionnaire. Adjustments weremade where needed. Once the translated questionnaire had been finalized duringthe interviewer training, questions were discussed using the manual with explana- tions for each question. Having interviewers from various cultural backgroundsaided in ascertaining whether wording used was culturally acceptable. During the training itself, further revisions to the translation of the questionnaire were made.Finally, usually during the field pilot in the third week of the interviewer training,final modifications to fine tune the translated questionnaire were made. Pitfalls in Translation In a Zimbabwe study, a series of questions were used to define the time frameduring which women had attended health services. In English the question was, \"In the last year (1995), have you attended a clinic or hospital because youwere sick?\" In Shona, the question was translated as, \"In 1995, did you attend...\" Since the survey was conducted in May 1996, this question only obtained information about the previous calendar year. In Nbele, the question was translated as, \"In the last year (12 months) have you attended...\" Therefore, the information obtained from the two translated versions referred to different periods. (From Watts, 1997.4)126 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER EIGHT 1. During the interview, the interviewer should jot down observations about any questions that seem to be problematic. 2. After the interview, take another 15-30 minutes to ask the respondents their own views about the interview: What do you consider the main topics of the survey? Are there any questions you feel are inappropriate, too personal, or that people would not be likely to answer truthfully? Do you feel comfortable with the informed consent process (i.e., were you adequately informed about the nature of the study)? Were there any questions that you did not understand or that you thought were confusing? Is the length of the interview acceptable or too long? (You may want to ask how long they thought the inter- view lasted and compare this to the actual duration.) 3. After each interview, take detailed notes of both your own and your respondent's observations.4. After each researcher/interviewer has performed several interviews, it is useful to sit down and analyze the responses to the questionnaire. The following issues might be explored in this discussion: Are there any questions that are particularly sensitive, or that women seem reluctant to answer? In the Nicaragua survey, a question about the last time a couple had intercourse caused a lot of discomfort among respondents, and women often asked why we wanted to know this. Are there questions women seem to answer almost automatically? Are they telling us what they think we want to hear, rather than drawing from their own experiences? Researchers in some Asian countries have found that women are unlikely to report violence between their parents and in-laws, as it is considered disloyal to speak ill of relatives. Are there questions for which the women give unusual answers, or seem not to understand the purpose of the question? For example, does the interviewer need to explain it several times, or use different language so that the women understand the question? What wording would be easier to understand? Are there questions for which it is difficult to code the response, or where it seems that the questionnaire ismissing important data? In one pre-testing exercise, it became clear that many women have been abused by a spouse prior to their current partner. Therefore it was necessary to collect some basic information about former spouses. Do the skip patterns seem to flow smoothly, so that no women are left out of questions they should be asked?Conversely, are women made to repeat the same answers? Are they asked inapplicable questions? Is there a fairly broad range of responses to most of the questions? Too much uniformity may indicate that women are answering in a way that they believe is expected, or that they don't really understand the question, or that it is simply not a useful or relevant question. If we ask hypothetical questions such as, \"Do you think a woman should accept being beaten in order to keep her family intact?\" do women seem to understand that we are asking about opinions and notexperiences? Women who are not used to this kind of question may find it difficult to respond, and may give answers such as, \"I can't speak for anyone else.\" Are there questions where similarly coded answers might mean two very different things? Do we need to add additional responses or improve the wording of the question to enhance clarity? Do the initial sections allow the interviewer to develop sufficient rapport before asking about violence? Would the questions on violence fit better at an earlier point? Does the order of the questions seem to flow logically and smoothly? Is the questionnaire too long? Do women seem tired or restless by the end of the survey? Does the average duration of the interview correspond to what you have told respondents in the consent form? Consent forms usually give the respondent an estimate of how long the questionnaire will take to complete. If the average interview during the pre-test is substantially longer than what the consent form suggests, then you may have to revise either the estimate or the questionnaire. Is it difficult to achieve privacy? Do the procedures for ensuring confidentiality work? Are there differences in the way that women responded in the versions that are translated into other lan-guages? Are there specific problems with the wording or translations?BOX 8.5 SUGGESTIONS FOR PRE-TESTING THE QUESTIONNAIREA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 127TOOLS FOR COLLECTING QUANTITATIVE DATA 1.

Structured interviews Usestructured interviews when it is important to collect the same informationfrom every informant. Structured interviewsrely on a standardized interview guide thatpermits easy aggregation of responsesacross respondents. Because the structuredinterview guides allow less latitude, inter-viewers need not be as skilled as thosewho conduct unstructured interviews. In structured interviews, the wording and order of interview questions are determinedahead of time. Interviewers are instructedto cover every question included in theguide. For an example of a structured interview guide, see Box 9.1. This excerptfrom an interview guide shows how thePan American Health Organization (PAHO)\"Critical Path\" study collected informationon how different institutions view andrespond to survivors of violence. 1 Semistructured interviews Semistructured interviews use an open framework that allows focused yet conver-sational communication. They are usefulfor collecting information about historicalevents, opinions, interpretations, andmeanings. Unlike a survey questionnaire, in which detailed questions are formulated aheadof time, semistructured interviews startwith more general questions or topics.Relevant topics such as violence or(As the interviewer, introduce yourself, explain the objectives of the study, and request the respondent's consent to be interv iewed.

Work performed by the respondent What does your work as ________consist of? What percentage of the patients you see are women? What are the most frequent reasons women give for coming to the office/ emergency room? Are cases of family violence seen? What are the most common cases? Do you (or your colleagues) routinely ask questions to determine whether the patient might be a victim of family violence? What tests or examinations do you routinely perform when a woman indicates that she has been the victim of violence? How do you decide which tests to perform? What is the procedure for obtaining an official report from the medical examiner? How many people with this type of problem does your institution serve per month? Do you have a way of keeping records on cases? Is there a form and procedure for recording them? Can you explain it to me? (Request a copy of the record form, referral slips, and any other documents that may exist.) Do you (or your colleagues) provide follow-up care to women who have been victims of family violence? Are there mechanisms for referring them to other institutions? Do you think the record-keeping system is adequate to identify women affected by family violence, refer them to the appropriate services, and provide timely follow-up services? Experience with women affected by violence Have you ever come into contact with cases of family violence among your clients? Can you tell me how these experiences originated, what you did, and what the client did? Do you know of other organizations or persons in this community that work on family violence issues? Who are they? What is your relationship with them? Is there coordination with other institutions to address the needs of abused women? What changes in legislation, policy, or staffing would facilitate your work? What changes in the behaviors or attitudes of the personnel with whom you work would facilitate your work?BOX 9.1 STRUCTURED INTERVIEW: GUIDE FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE HEALTH SECTORA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 131women's participation on the community council are initially identified and organ-ized into an interview guide ormatrix . (See Box 9.2 for an example of an inter-view guide used in formative research inthe WHO VAW study.) Not all questions are designed and phrased ahead of time. Most questionsarise naturally during the interview, allow-ing both the interviewer and the personbeing interviewed some flexibility to probefor details or to discuss issues that werenot included in the interview guide. Semistructured interviews require skill on the part of the interviewer, so it is agood idea to carry out some practice inter-views to become familiar with the subjectand the questions. If possible, tape all interviews and then either transcribe them later or developdetailed notes of the conversation basedon the tapes. If you cannot tape the inter-views, take brief notes during the interviewand complete and expand the notes imme-diately after the interview. It is best to ana-lyze the information at the end of each dayof interviewing. This can be done with theinterview team or group. Unstructured interviews Unstructured interviews allow the inter- viewer and respondent the most flexibility.Questions are open-ended, and the inter-viewer lets the respondent lead the conver-sation. The interviewer asks additionalquestions to gain as much useful informa-tion as possible. Unstructured interviews are based on a loosely organized interview plan that laysout the purpose of the interview andincludes a list of topics to be explored. Theflow of the conversation\u2014not what is writ-ten in the guide\u2014determines the timingand sequence of topics. One type of quali-tative inquiry called \"narrative analysis\"particularly relies on unstructured inter-views. In this case, the interviewer attemptsto obtain a detailed story from a respon-dent about a specific event or aspect ofhis/her life. This is a story with a begin-ning, middle, and an end, although itmight not be presented in that order dur-ing the interview. Because unstructured interviews allow a lot of freedom, they require especiallyskilled interviewers. You need to be espe-cially alert for inconsistencies, pieces of thestory that seem to be missing, and newangles that might provide additional infor-mation, and then probe accordingly. Whenconducting in-depth interviews with sur-vivors of violence, beware of the temptationto slip from \"interview\" mode to \"counsel-ing\" mode. Because of their conversationalstyle, in-depth interviews tend to encourageemotional disclosure and intimacy. Thisincreases the need for interviewers to staytrue to their role, monitor their boundaries,and be attentive to levels of distress of therespondent. (See Box 10.4 for a thoroughdiscussion of the role of the interviewer.) TOOLS FOR COLLECTING QUALITATIVE DATA 1. Can you please tell me a little about yourself? Did you go to school?

The downside is thatdata analysis may be more complex andtime-consuming than in the case of struc-tured interviews. FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS Focus group discussions are a powerful method for collecting information relativelyquickly. They are better suited for explor-ing norms, beliefs, practices, and languagethan for seeking information on actualbehaviors or details of individual lives. Thefocus group is a special type of group in terms of its purpose, size, composition,and procedures. A focus group is usuallycomposed of six to ten individuals whohave been selected because they share cer-tain characteristics that are relevant to thetopic to be discussed. In some cases, theparticipants are selected specifically so thatthey do not know each other, but in manycases that is not possible, particularly whenparticipants belong to the same communityor organization. The discussion is carefullyplanned, and is designed to obtain infor-mation on participants' beliefs about andperceptions of a defined area of interest.3-5 Focus groups differ in several important ways from informal discussion groups: Specific, predetermined criteria are usedfor recruiting focus group participants. The topics to be discussed are decidedbeforehand, and the moderator usuallyuses a predetermined list of open-endedquestions that are arranged in a naturaland logical sequence. Focus group discussions may also becarried out using participatory tech-niques such as ranking, story comple-tion, or Venn diagrams (thesetechniques are all described in thischapter). This may be particularly use-ful when working with groups with lit-tle formal education or when talkingabout very sensitive issues. (In theNicaraguan study on a new domesticviolence law, described in the followingpages, however, participatory tech-niques were used successfully in focusgroup discussions with judges andmental health professionals as well aswith rural men and women.) Unlike individual interviews, focusgroup discussions rely on the interac-tions among participants about the top-ics presented. Group members mayinfluence each other by responding toideas and comments that arise duringthe discussion, but there is no pressureon the moderator to have the groupreach consensus. Focus groups have been used success- fully to assess needs, develop interven-tions, test new ideas or programs, improveexisting programs, and generate a range ofideas on a particular subject as back-ground information for constructing morestructured questionnaires.

Data analy- sis consists of several steps. First, writesummaries for each group discussion.Next, write a summary for each \"type\"of group (e.g., a summary of all dis-cussions conducted with young moth- ers). Finally, compare results fromdifferent \"types\" of groups (e.g.,results from groups of young versusolder mothers). The discussions may be taped for tran- scription later, but this substantiallyincreases the time and cost of analysis.One alternative is to take careful notesduring the discussion and to refer to theaudiotapes for specific areas wherethere are doubts. Focus groups give information about groups of people rather than individuals.They do not provide any informationabout the frequency or the distribution ofbeliefs or behavior in the population.When interpreting the data, it is importantto remember that focus groups aredesigned to gather information that reflectswhat is considered normative in that cul-ture. In other words, if wife abuse is cul-turally accepted, then it should not bedifficult to get participants to speak franklyabout it. However, some topics are verysensitive because they imply actions or ori-entations that are either culturally taboo orstigmatizing. For the same reason, focus group respondents should not be asked to revealthe details of their individual, personallives in a focus group setting, especiallywhen the subject matter of the focusgroup deals with sensitive issues such asdomestic violence and sexual abuse. If aresearcher wants information on women'sindividual experiences, then that shouldbe done in private individual interviews.TOOLS FOR COLLECTING QUALITATIVE DATA are not easy to conduct. They requirethorough planning and training of groupmoderators. When planning a focus group, consider the following recommendations:* Focus groups require trained moderators.You will need three types of people:recruiters, who locate and invite partici-pants; moderators, who conduct thegroup discussions; and note-takers, wholist topics discussed, record reactions ofthe group participants, and tape-recordthe entire discussion (if all participantsgive consent). Note-takers also help tran-scribe the taped discussions. Focus groups are usually composed ofhomogeneous members of the targetpopulation. It is often a good idea toform groups of respondents that aresimilar in terms of social class, age, levelof knowledge, cultural/ethnic character-istics, and sex. This will help to createan environment in which participantsare comfortable with each other andfeel free to express their opinions. Italso helps to distinguish opinions thatmight be attributed to these differentcharacteristics among groups. If possible, experienced focus groupleaders suggest conducting at least twogroups for each \"type\" of respondent tobe interviewed. The optimal size group consists of sixto ten respondents. This helps ensurethat all individuals participate and thateach participant has enough time tospeak. However, sometimes, it is notpossible to regulate the size of a group,and successful focus group discussionshave been carried out with many moreparticipants. * (Adapted from Hudelson, 1994.3)134 Researching Violence Against WomenIn many cases, facilitators ask respondents to think about the perspectives andbehavior of their peers, for example,which allows them to draw on their expe-riences in general terms but does not askthem to reveal the details of their own behavior or experiences in a group set-ting. The following example describeshow focus groups were used in Nicaraguain advocacy for a new domestic violencelaw. Box 9.4 presents a sample discussionguide for a focus group discussion onsexual violence performed with membersof a refugee camp. Example of focus group discussion: Evaluating a domestic violence lawin Nicaragua The Nicaraguan Network of Women against Violence used focus group discus-sions in the consultation process for a newdomestic violence law that was presentedbefore the National Assembly. Because thenew law was controversial (it criminalizedinflicting emotional injuries, and estab-lished restraining orders for abusive hus-bands), the purpose of the study was toassess both the political and technical via-bility of the new law. The research team conducted 19 focus groups with over 150 individuals represent-ing different sectors of the population,such as urban and rural men and women,youth, police officers, survivors of violence,judges, mental health experts, and medicalexaminers. The main questions asked by the study were, What kinds of acts were consideredviolent? What kinds of legal measureswere considered to be most effective forpreventing violence? The researchers usedranking, Venn diagrams, and free listingexercises to initiate discussions. A team ofmen and women from member groups ofthe Network were trained as focus groupmoderators, and two team members ledeach group. Focus groups sessions wereaudio-taped and researchers presentedtyped notes and diagrams from each ses-sion. The team did the analysis as agroup, and participants' responses wereorganized according to themes. The studyrevealed a broad consensus on severalissues, the most significant of which werethe gravity of psychological injury and theimportance of protective measures forbattered women. It was widely agreedthat the psychological consequences ofabuse were often much more serious andlong-lasting than physical injuries and thatthe legal definition of injury should takethis into account. One rural woman notedthat harsh and demeaning words canmake you \"feel like an old shoe.\" A judgenoted that \"bruises and cuts will healeventually but psychological damage lastsforever.\" The results of the study werepresented in testimony to the JusticeCommission of the National Assembly,which subsequently ruled unanimously infavor of the law. 6 OBSERVATION Observation, a time-honored form of qual-itative data collection, has its roots in cul-tural anthropology. Researchers mayeither actively participate in the phenome-non being observed (known as partici- pant observation ) or they may observe as \"on-lookers.\" Observation may be either \"structured\" or \"unstructured.\" Even the most unstructuredobservations must have a system for captur-ing information as clearly and faithfully aspossible. Wherever possible, it is best torecord observations on the spot, during theevent. This can take the form of abbreviatednotes that you elaborate on later as youwrite more detailed notes. Records shoulddenote who was present; any unusualdetails of the scene; verbatim comments;and incongruities (it may help to ask your-self questions\u2014\"Why did he do that?\").CHAPTER NINEA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 135Shortly after leaving the field, review these notes and add detail and substance.Getting the full record straight may take aslong as the original observation did.

Example of observation: Justice for rape survivors in Bangladesh The Bangladeshi women's group Narippokko used semistructured observa-tions to document how the courts inDhaka treat abuse victims and rape sur-vivors. Advocates sat for days in opencourt recording the behavior, words, anddemeanor of Bangladeshi judges. Theyrecorded verbatim comments of judgesindicating their bias against rape victimsand noted instances of humiliating anddegrading treatment of women by courtofficials. These data were useful for raisingawareness of the biases inherent in thetreatment of female victims of violence inBangladesh by the courts. 9 Example of observation: Readiness of reproductive health clinics toaddress violence in Latin America The International Planned Parenthood Federation, Western Hemisphere Region,used an observation guide to assess thereadiness of local affiliate centers to inte-grate gender-based violence into reproduc-tive health programs (Box 9.5). Theobservation guide was used at the begin-ning of the project, as part of a situationanalysis, and later on as part of the moni-toring and evaluation program (the fullguide is available in Spanish atwww.ippfwhr.org.) FREE LISTING Free listing is a particularly useful tool for exploring a subject about which theresearcher has little previous knowledge,or when the researcher wants to have asbroad a discussion as possible. The researcher asks participants to gen- erate a list of items that correspond to aparticular topic and then writes them onthe blackboard or chart. Or, the researchermay hand out cards so that participantscan write down their answers and thenstick them up on the wall. Free listing can be an interesting way to compare attitudes or experiences amongdifferent groups of individuals. For exam-ple, in one study, participants in a focusgroup were asked to name as manyCHAPTER NINE Time observation is initiated:_________________________ Characteristics of the clinic: 1. Is there a space dedicated to ob-gyn consultations? 2. Can conversations within the examining room be heard outside the room?3. Can the client be seen from outside the examining room? 4. Are there interruptions during the consultations? 5. Is there any separation (e.g., a screen) between the desk and the examining table?6. Is there a place where children can be watched while the mother is in the consultation? 7. Are there educational materials (e.g., posters, videos, pamphlets) regarding domestic violence inside the examining rooms or waiting rooms? What kind of materials? What subjects are covered in the materials? Time observation is completed: _________________________ BOX 9.5 OBSERVATION GUIDE TO ASSESS READINESS FOR INTEGRATION OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE INTO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CLINICSA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 137different forms of violence as they could. A group of women came up with a list ofmore than 30 types of violence, whereas agroup of men was only able to mentionfive different types. Another advantage of free listing is that it may enable the researcher to detect issues(for example, a type of violence) that hadnot previously been considered, but whichare important for community members.Free listing can be also used as a startingpoint for a subsequent ranking exercise todetermine which acts are considered, forinstance, more severe or more important. Example of free listing: Causes of sexual violence in Kenyanrefugee camps Free listing was used as part of a participa- tory assessment of sexual violence in theDadaab refugee camps in Kenya 7as a way to identify individuals assessments of thedifferent causes of violence (see Box 9.6).Organizers asked groups of refugees to listall the reasons why women get raped. Thenthey synthesized the answers according tohow many groups listed each problem. The responses indicated that refugees clearly associated sexual violence with inse-curity, both inside and outside the camps.Lack of adequate cooking fuel emerged asa significant source of women's vulnerabil-ity because women routinely have to travellong distances outside the camp to collectfirewood. When researchers reviewedrecords of sexual violence cases reported inthe preceding year, they found that 90 per-cent of assaults occurred while womenwere searching for wood, reinforcing theinsights gleaned from the participatoryassessment. This combination of data fromdifferent sources is also an excellent exam-ple of triangulation. Example of free listing: Support groups for survivors in El Salvador In a review of Central American gender-based violence programs, health workers were asked to list the symptoms that awoman might have that lead them to sus-pect that she was living with violence.

RANKING Ranking is a useful technique to help par- ticipants prioritize problems and solutions.The researcher gives participants a series ofcategories or problems (they may be theones that resulted from the process of freelisting) and asks participants to rank themin order of priority, urgency, or severity.This activity may be carried out with differ-ent sectors of the community (such asmen, women, or children) to obtain infor-mation about differences of opinion. It isalso possible to do this activity at thebeginning of a program and at later inter-vals to detect changes in attitudes. Example of ranking: \"What is severe violence?\" in Nicaragua In the participatory study carried out by the Nicaraguan Network of Women againstViolence, a ranking exercise was used toidentify perceptions regarding the severityof different kinds of violence (physical,economic, sexual, and emotional). In thisexercise, the researchers gave each partici-pant a packet of cards with the names ofdifferent acts written on them. Participantswere asked to classify the acts in fivegroups according to severity. Afterwards,they were asked to stick the cards on thewall under signs the moderator led a discussion about why some acts are considered moresevere than others, and what criteria areused to establish severity. She initiated thediscussion around acts that most partici-pants considered serious. The moderatorencouraged group members whoexpressed different opinions to explaintheir views. A list of the acts mentioned onthe cards included: Yelling at or humiliating in public Throwing things Having affairs outside of marriage Demanding sex from your partner whenshe doesn't want it Threatening to hit Threatening to withdraw financial support Destroying objects that belong to thepartner (such as clothes, dishes, radio) Not paying for household expenses Pushing or shoving Slapping Blows with the fist, on any part of thebody except the head, that don't leave ascar Beating up with bruises or swelling Saying constantly that your partner isstupid or worthless Controlling your partner's activities(work, visits, friends) Beating up with wounds or fractures Blows with a fist to the head Blows during pregnancy Threats with a gun or knife The ranking exercise has the advantage of allowing comparisons between differ-ent groups around the same acts. Forpurposes of comparison, one can assessthe average severity assigned to an act ona scale of 0 to 4. In the Nicaraguan study,there was a great diversity of opinion asto whether having sex outside of mar-riage was a form of violence. Whereasmiddle class women felt that adultery wasnot violence, rural women considered itto be very severe violence because itoften led to men becoming economicallyirresponsible at home. There was alsogreat divergence between men andwomen with regard to forced sex inmarriage. While men in general felt thatforcing a wife to have sex should notbe considered violence, most womenCHAPTER NINEA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 139considered forced sex to be severe violence. In the words of one woman, \"If he forces me, I make up excuses, myfeelings change, and I come to hate whatI once loved.\" 6 PAIR-WISE RANKING* Pair-wise ranking allows community members to determine collectively theirmost significant problem or issue. Theybegin by listing problems/issues, and thenthey compare them systematically by pairs.Community members can compare andcontrast the issues they have identified.Each item is successively compared againstthe others and the winning issue or prob-lem is chosen. Once the matrix is com-plete community members can score andthen rank issues/problems from mostimportant to least important. Pair-wiseranking is a powerful tool to help commu-nity members see how different percep-tions of significant reproductive healthproblems can be within a single-sex groupand between women and men. In theDadaab assessment, pair-wise ranking wasused to prioritize issues related to sexualviolence, such as most important causes ofviolence, most important solutions, andbest coping mechanisms. The procedure should be as follows: 1. Once rapport has been established with a group of community members,introduce the pair-wise ranking exercise.First, use free-listing techniques to listpreferences or problems in response tospecific well-phrased questions. Forexample, what are the types of violenceor abuse that women and girls experi-ence in this community? If people iden-tify multiple forms of violence that canbe grouped under the same heading(e.g., a husband calling his wife names,telling her she is stupid, or criticizing herfeelings), encourage them to identify ageneral category that captures thesemultiple forms of violence (i.e., emo-tional violence by husbands). 2. Draw a matrix (see Figure 9.1). As peo- ple identify different types of violenceand abuse, write those types in the hori-zontal column at the top of the matrix.After the participants are satisfied thatthey have listed as many forms of vio-lence as they can, stop and write thesame list in the vertical column, startingthe vertical list with the last categorylisted in the horizontal column. Put an Xin the boxes where the pairs arerepeated. For example, looking at thematrix in Figure 9.1, A, B, and C eachrepresent a type of violence identifiedby community members. The X's repre-sent boxes where no ranking is needed,since other boxes already make thesame comparison of A with C, A with B,TOOLS FOR COLLECTING QUALITATIVE DATA A. Emotional abuse B.

Emotional abuse by husbands of wives X X XFIGURE 9.1 MATRIX FOR PAIR-WISE RANKING EXERCISE * (Adapted from Igras, 19987and RHRCC, 2004.11)140 Researching Violence Against Womenand B with C. Remember that you do not need to prioritize in terms of worsttypes of violence. At this point, youonly need to list different types of vio-lence affecting women and girls in thecommunity. 3. Starting in the upper left-hand corner, ask participants to do the following:\"Compare the problem or issue identi-fied in the first row with the problem orissue identified in the first column.Which is the more important of thetwo?\" Let the group discuss and recordone answer in the cell. 4. Continue comparing problems listed in the rows with the problems listed in thefirst column. Be sure to give the groupplenty of time for discussion. Throughthis discussion, individual ranking crite-ria will emerge and people will begin tounderstand why another person holdsan opinion different from their own. 5. Move on to pair-wise comparisons with the problem in the second column ofthe problems listed in the row. 6. Continue the process of pair-wise rank- ing comparisons until all cells in thematrix have been filled. 7. Tally the result, recording a numerical score (count) in the appropriate column.Then prioritize the problems. First prior-ity goes to the problem that received thehighest score, second priority to thenext, and so on. 8. Discuss the resulting priorities with participants. Most importantly, giventhe discussion and process, ask if par-ticipants feel that the ranking reflectsreality. If a community group is goingto move ahead with a sexual violenceprevention program, will the peoplesupport it? Will they participate? Doesit speak to their needs?\" Remember to record the visual output (charts, etc.), identifying place, dates,names of participants, if possible. Provide anarrative description of the process and thedata. Note: Pair-wise ranking can also beused to rank other issues, such as whatkinds of interventions the community feelsare most important to reduce violenceagainst women and girls. In this case, sam-ple lead questions might be: What do youthink are the most effective methods forreducing sexual violence against women inthis community? What do you think are themost effective methods for reducingdomestic violence against women in thiscommunity? TIMELINES AND SEASONAL CALENDARS Timelines or seasonal calendars are useful for exploring trends over time, and impor-tant events leading up to certain changes.They can be used to measure experiencesat a national level (for example, theevents leading up to specific changes indomestic violence legislation). They arealso useful for diagramming change in acommunity (e.g., when social violencebecame a serious problem) or personalexperiences in the life of an individual(for example, when a woman first startedbeing abused by her husband, and whatactions she subsequently took to over-come the violence). In a timeline, events or trends are charted according to years, months, ordays. Events may be plotted along a line,or a line may be plotted along a verticalaxis to indicate increases in the frequencyor severity of a specific problem. A common method in participatory research is to have community membersdiagram or \"draw\" the timeline or calendarCHAPTER NINEA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 141on the ground using sticks and other natu- ral items (such as leaves, rocks, or flow-ers) to mark key events. Example of seasonal calendars: Sexual violence in Kenyan refugee camps In the Dadaab refugee camp assessment described above, the organizers used sea-sonal calendars to monitor periods whenwomen are most vulnerable to rape. Theyasked community participants to reflect onwhether there are periods or events thatsignal increased or decreased sexual vio-lence. A timeline reproduced the commu-nity members' observations aboutincidence of rape between January 1997and September 1998. The patterns identi-fied through the seasonal calendar closelytrack the ups and downs of rapes reportedto camp authorities. 7 Example of timelines: \"The Road Traveled\" in Central America In the participatory review of gender-based violence programs in Central America (seeBox 9.7), researchers used an exercisecalled \"The Road Traveled.\" The facilitatorgave the following introduction:If we imagine that every process of change is a road that we follow from oneplace to another, we can see that the road isnot usually a straight line. Sometimes thereare curves and bumps. Sometimes there arestreams to cross and stones to climb over.Sometimes we end up someplace far awayfrom where we imagined we would be, andsometimes we take a long journey and endup practically at home again. Sometimes,however, we manage to cross long dis-tances, and find many beautiful thingsalong the way\u2014flowers, and trees to give usfruits and shade. Let's imagine that the work of your group is like a journey. At one end is theplace where you started and the other endis where we are now. Let's recreate thesteps we took along the way to get to wherewe are. When (what year) and how did the jour- ney begin for this group? What were themajor steps that helped you grow, or chal-lenged you? Dates and descriptions are placed along the timeline. Above the line are events thatwere helpful (the \"flowers\"). Below theline are placed the negative events or cir-cumstances (\"the stones\").

CAUSAL FLOW ANALYSIS* Acausal flow analysis (also known as web analysis) shows the relationshipbetween causes and effects of a selectedissue, problem, or desired state. This toolcan be extremely useful in gaining anunderstanding of the underlying causes ofsensitive issues. It is especially good forinvolving community members in settingpriorities and in planning interventions. For a causal flow analysis, the procedure should be along the following lines: 1. Once rapport has been established with a community group of participants, suggesta topic for analysis and try to link it backto comments that group members madeduring the exercise. For example, \"Youmentioned that lack of security was acause of sexual violence. Let's talk aboutthat. Why does sexual violence occur?\" 2. On a flipchart, draw a circle and indicate the topic for discussion, which in thisexample is sexual violence. Ensure thatall of the participants understand thetopic so that they can participate fully. 3. The facilitator then asks participants to list the causes of the problem or situation. 4. Causes are written on the left-hand side of the topic, with arrows drawn into thecenter (i.e., from left to right, or ). Write clearly and recheck the directionof the arrows.CHAPTER NINE FIGURE 9.3 EXAMPLE OF CAUSAL FLOW DIAGRAM Issue FIGURE 9.4 CAUSAL FLOW ANALYSIS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, PREPARED BY A GROUP OF WOMEN IN PARK TOWN, JAMAICA UNEMPLOYMENT ABUSE Domestic violenceDependency on malesSTDsSketelFree mentality More pregnancy Family feud DeathFamily involvement Resolving the problem Fatherless childrenBunIndependenceFree money Police harassmentPregnancy Note: \"free mentality\" refers free time. is a \"loose woman.\" (From Moser (Adapted from Igras, 19987and RHRCC, 2004.11)A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 1435. Once the list of causes has been exhausted, ask participants to list theeffects of the problem. Again, let thegroup discuss as much as necessarybefore beginning to record effects onthe right-hand side of the topic. Thetopic is linked to effects by arrowsdrawn out from the center, (again left toright or ). Recheck the direction of the arrows. This is one of the most commonerrors in drawing causal flow diagrams. 6. Now \"interview\" the diagram by asking open-ended questions about each causeand each effect. The diagrams canbecome quite elaborate and will allowthe facilitator to delve even more deeplyinto an issue. Think about this exercisein terms of unpeeling the outer layers ofan onion to get to the inner core.7. Try limiting the number of causes and effects to 20 or so. Simpler diagramstend to be easier to follow. 8. Record the visual output as shown in Figure 9.3, identifying it as necessary byplace, dates, names of participants, andso on. Include a narrative description ofthe process. Researchers from the World Bank and the University of the West Indies explored theimpact of violence on poor communities inJamaica in a Rapid Urban Appraisal. In oneexercise, young women were asked to ana-lyze the impact that unemployment amongwomen had on young women in their com-munity. They said unemployment leads tostronger dependency on males for money\u2014either through higher rates of teenageTOOLS FOR COLLECTING QUALITATIVE DATA FIGURE 9.5 EXAMPLE OF CAUSAL FLOW ANALYSIS ON CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN DADAAB REFUGEE CAMPS Sexual violence Men coming at night to be with you Young boys with young girls Forced cohabitation (when husband is away or by \"choice\")War and destructionPeople have the right to abuse the childBad community feelingsChild is abused Mother feels guilty over childInsufficient income Bastard childrenMinority men cannot have relations with Somali women Unwanted pregnancyWomen not respected by menMen put pressure on \"easy\" women for sex No medicines at the hospital for sicknessToo many men, too few women Lots to think about, sadnessYoung boys with no ecomonic base, cannot marry Sickness, fear of infection, AIDSTribalismMinority and majority clans don't understand each other Majority clans think they are better than minority clansInsufficient incomes to buy food, fuel Loss of husband, divorce, unmarried womenHusbands say divorceParents worry No one wants to marry youBad impression of the communityMother fights for child (From Igras et al, 1998.7)144 Researching Violence Against Womenpregnancy or through a shift from self- reliance to a reliance on \"free money\" pro-vided by men. This dependency in turn givesrise to an increase in abuse and domesticviolence. Subsequent family involvementmight either resolve the problem or lead to a family feud and deaths through reprisals. Figure 9.4 illustrates the web analysis that emerged from this exercise.Significantly, young women in this commu-nity clearly articulated the associationbetween community violence and intimatepartner abuse, a link that is frequently leftout when outsiders analyze communityviolence. 12Figure 9.5 shows the results of a causal flow exercise carried out in theDadaab refugee camps to explore thecauses and effects of sexual violence. OPEN-ENDED STORIES Open-ended stories are useful for explor-ing people's beliefs and opinions, and foridentifying problems or solutions whiledeveloping a program. The method isespecially appropriate for use with peoplewith less formal education, and helps stim-ulate participation in discussions. In an open-ended story, the beginning, middle, or ending of a relevant story ispurposely left out. The audience discusseswhat might happen in the part of the storythat is missing. Usually, the beginning tellsa story about a problem, the middle tells astory about a solution, and the end tells astory of an outcome. To use this technique, consider the following: It is important to design the whole storyin advance, so that the part that is leftout \"fits\" the complete story. You willneed a storyteller with good communi-cation skills. Depending on the amountof group discussion, telling the storyand filling in the missing part may takeas long as two hours. The storyteller must be able to tell thestory, listen, and respond to the com-munity analysis. Using two facilitatorscan help\u2014one to tell the story and oneto help the community fill in the \"gaps.\" The story and the response need to be captured. Tape recording can be helpful inthis instance. Example of open-ended stories: Forced sex among adolescents in Ghana In Ghana, investigators used a version of the open-ended story technique to dis-cover ways in which adolescents say \"no\"to sex if they do not want to participateand what would happen if the adolescentstried to use condoms. 13By learning how young people react in such situations, theteam hoped to refine its health promotionmaterials to support healthy sexual behav-ior better. In this adaptation, investigators used a storyline approach in which participantsact out a story based on a scene describedby the facilitator. At appropriate moments,the facilitator cut into the story to elicit dis-cussion and to introduce a new element or\"twist\" that might change people's reac-tions. The storyline technique created arelaxed and entertaining atmosphere foryoung people to act out and discuss issuesof sexuality and abuse in a nonthreateningatmosphere. The stories allowed participants to dis- cuss an issue without necessarily implicat-ing themselves in the situation. To helpanimate the characters in the minds of par-ticipants, the facilitators solicited input fromthe group about the names, traits, and per-sonality of the characters. Following is anexample of one of the stories used to dis-cuss forced early marriage: Alhaji married Kande with her parents' blessing. Kande (meaning the only girlamong three boys) is 14 years old andCHAPTER NINEA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 145Alhaji is 50 years old. Alhaji has three wives already but none of them gave birthto a son. So one day he calls Kande anddiscusses his problem and his wish of get-ting a son from her. He also tells her thatsince she is a virgin, she will by all means give birth to a boy. Kande gets frightenedand tells him that she is too young to givebirth now. She also assures him that if hecan wait for two more years, she will givehim a son. Alhaji replies, \"I married you.You can't tell me what to do. Whetheryou like it or not, you are sleeping withme tonight.\" After the drama sketch was played out, the facilitator asked the group if theythought the story was realistic and if similarsituations happened in their area. Afteranalyzing their data, the authors noted,\"These stories seemed to show that, atleast among these participants, coercion,trickery, deceit, force, and financial needare well known and all too common ele-ments of sexuality for youth in Ghana.\" Example of open-ended stories: Rosita's story, Mexico Mexican researchers used a similar approach to explore community attitudestoward women living with abusive part-ners. 14As part of a research and demon- stration project in Ixtacalco, Mexico, theyconducted a series of focus group ses-sions during which they presented partic-ipants with a series of questions basedon the lives of a fictional couple, Victorand Rosita. In this case, the facilitatorread the scenario. Then researchershanded each subgroup of participants acard with a question on it to spur discus-sion (Box 9.8). Example of open-ended stories: Rosita goes to the health clinic In the PAHO review of gender-based vio- lence services in Central America, the storyof Rosita was adapted to talk to healthworkers about how women living with vio-lence are treated in the health center. 10 The story ends when Rosita goes to the health center for a routine visit and thenurse asks her whether she has ever beenmistreated by her husband. The group isasked to imagine how the story endsthrough a discussion of the followingquestions: What will Rosita tell the nurse when sheasks about violence?TOOLS FOR COLLECTING QUALITATIVE DATA BOX 9.8 ROSITA'S STORY Rosita lives with her husband Victor and her two children, a three-year-old son and a five-year old daughter. She finished fifth grade and is a housewife, but for some time nowshe has wanted to leave Victor. He does not give her enough housekeeping money, anddoes not let her work because he gets jeal-ous. When he comes home drunk, he insults her and sometimes he forces her to have sexeven though she doesn't want to. Rosita has tried talking to him, but it's like talking to awall. She has put up with this situation for the last four years and hasn't told anybody. She doesn't know what to do... The facilitator divides the group into four subgroups, and gives a different card to each. Each card describes an alternative that Rosita has and contains a series of questions that the participants are asked to answer to complete the story. Group One Group Three Rosita decides to ask for help: Rosita decides to leave Victor: 1. Where does she go to ask for help? 1. What is going to be the most 2. What do they say to her? difficult challenge for her?3. What does she decide to do? 2. How will it affect her children? 3. What does Rosita need to succeed on her own? Group Two Group Four Rosita asks someone to talk to Victor: Rosita decides to leave Victor but two 1. Who would Victor listen to? weeks later returns to him: What should this person say? 1.

What reasons does Victor give for her children? treating Rosita this way? (From Fawcett et al, 1999.14)146 Researching Violence Against WomenHow will Rosita feel when she is asked about violence? How does the nurse feel about askingRosita about her family life? What will happen to Rosita if she admitswhat is happening to her at home? What type of help would be most use-ful to her?Do you think she will receive this helpat the health center? Is Rosita's situation common for womenin this community? What happens when women come tothis health center asking for help withdomestic violence situations? These questions were used to introduce a more focused discussion on the type ofservices offered to women in Rosita's situa-tion in the participants' health center. Thestory stimulated a very rich discussion ofhow providers detected violence in theirclients, and how they treated them.Examples of providers' comments follow: I used to treat women with musclespasms all the time and I never askedthem any questions. Then I started torealize that many of these cases weredue to violence. Women are waiting for someone toknock on their door, some of them havebeen waiting for many years...They aregrateful for the opportunity to unloadtheir burden. Sometimes taking a Pap smear, I'll seeolder women with injuries, dryness, andbruises from forced sex. GENOGRAMS The genogram is a diagramming technique often used in counseling to record generalinformation about families and/or house-holds (such as names, dates of birth, anddeaths). It is also used to capture more com-plex information, such as relationshipsamong members or patterns of violence.Counselors use the genogram to examinepatterns of abuse within families to explorepossible sources of support.

Thegenogram can aid interpretation because itvisually summarizes complex data. 15 The genogram is drawn in a manner similar to a family tree. Box 9.9 includessome symbols used to represent differentinformation in the genogram. Thegenogram can be used during an interviewto document complicated family and house-hold structures. Such visual representationsof households are especially helpful in situ-ations in which there are multiple mar-riages, in which children from variouspartnerships live under one roof, and incultures where local kinship terms (such assister or auntie) are not specific and canrefer to individuals with various relation-ships to the respondent. Example of genograms: Domestic violence in Zimbabwe In Zimbabwe, the Musasa Project used the genogram to capture data on patterns of TOOLS FOR COLLECTING QUALITATIVE DATA FIGURE 9.7 OPINIONS OF RURAL NICARAGUAN WOMEN ON SERVICES FOR BATTERED WOMEN USING A VENN DIAGRAM \"It's important but difficult for some to get to.\" The Woman's House\"Sometimes yourfamily supports you.

The Health Center148 Researching Violence Against Womenviolence within households.16Because Zimbabweans are accustomed to thinking interms of \"family trees,\" it was relatively easyfor most respondents to relate to thegenogram. The interviewer began the inter-view by drawing the genogram, noting dates of birth, death, relationships, lodgers, andother key data. At the section of the ques-tionnaire where the respondent was askedabout her experiences of violence, the inter-viewer returned to the genogram and identi-fied who perpetrated different forms ofviolence, and whether there were otherswho also experienced, witnessed, or sup-ported acts of violence by other perpetrators. For example, if a woman reported being hit by her husband (Q74), the interviewerwould write V74 (for violence on Question74) next to the husband's square on thegenogram. If he hit her on several occa-sions, the interviewer would add more thanonce. If he had also hit the respondent'sson, and the mother-in-law witnessed theincident, the interviewer would noteexpV74 next to the son's symbol, andsawV74 next to the mother-in-law's symbol. In Figure 9.6, an example taken from the survey, the respondent is married andlives with her husband who is the head ofthe household, their three living children,and her brother-in-law. She had two chil-dren who died\u2014a boy at seven months,and a girl at age 14. Her husband has asecond wife and a three-year-old boy whodo not live with them. He has been violenttoward the respondent, punching her andkicking her. Her father-in-law supportedthe violence. Neighbors saw the respon-dent being humiliated, but did not witnessthe physical assaults. CIRCULAR OR VENN DIAGRAMS Venn diagrams , also known as circular or \"chapati\" diagrams, are useful for analyzing social distance, organizationalstructures, or institutional relationships. The facilitator draws circles of different sizes to represent individuals or organiza-tions that are linked to the problem orcommunity under study. The circles canalso be cut out of colored paper and tapedto a flip chart. The size of the circles indi-cates the item's importance. The item'slocation on the sheet represents howaccessible this person or institution is. Thetechnique may be used in small or largegroups. Another method is to make two dia- grams per group\u2014one that indicates thereal situation, and another that representsthe ideal situation. Through these dia-grams, one can compare how differentgroups perceive a subject. Rural Nicaraguan women in a participa- tory study carried out by the NicaraguanNetwork of Women against Violence pro-duced a Venn diagram to assess the pub-lic's view of the proposed domesticviolence law (Figure 9.7). The diagramindicates the individuals or institutions thatmight be able to help \"Maria,\" a womanwhose husband beats her. The circles indi-cate by size and proximity to Maria howhelpful and accessible each individual orinstitution is perceived to be to her. Thetext accompanying the circles illustrates theviews expressed by women in the group. 6 COMMUNITY MAPPING A community map is an excellent tool forcollecting qualitative data, especially in cul-tures that have a strong visual tradition. Aswith many other participatory techniques,maps can be created on paper with col-ored pens or constructed in the dirt, usingnatural materials such as sticks and peb-bles. Mapping can be used to identify orhighlight many aspects of a community,including geographic, demographic, his-toric, cultural, and economic factors.Following are suggestions for conducting aCHAPTER NINEA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 149mapping exercise by the CARE team's report on the Dadaab refugee camp.7 Visit the community and ask community members to participate: 1. Introduce the purpose of your visit, assess people's interest and availability. 2. Request that someone draw a map of the desired area. 3. Some people will naturally reach for a stick and begin drawing on the ground.Others will look around for paper andpencils. Have materials ready to offer, ifit is appropriate. 4. As the map is beginning to take shape, other community members will becomeinvolved. Give people plenty of timeand space. Do not hurry the process. 5. Wait until people are completely fin- ished before you start asking questions.Then interview the visual output. Phrasequestions so that they are open-endedand nonjudgmental. Probe often, showinterest, let people talk. 6. If there is additional information that would be useful, you may ask focusedquestions once conversation about themap has finished. 7. Record any visual output, whether it was drawn on the ground or sketched onpaper. Be accurate and include identify-ing information (place, date, and partici-pant's names if possible). Example of community mapping: Sexual violence in Kenyan refugee camps The team from CARE used community mapping as part of its rapid assessment ofsexual violence in the Dadaab refugeecamps on the border between Kenya andSomalia.7Participants were asked to make a map of the camp community and toidentify areas of heightened risk forwomen. The women identified several keyareas where they did not feel safe: (1) thebushes around the community well, whereattackers lie in wait for women; (2) thecamp's western border, where bandits caneasily enter through weakened sections ofthe live thorn fences; and (3) the hospital,where women line up before dawn to col-lect coupons guaranteeing them access tothe health center later in the day. Thisexercise allowed NGO organizers to iden-tify ways to improve women's safety. Example of community mapping: Sexual violence in schools in South Africa Researchers in Cape Town, South Africa, asked high school girls to draw a map ofplaces where they felt unsafe. 17The mapTOOLS FOR COLLECTING QUALITATIVE DATA FIGURE 9.8 SCHOOL MAP A map of their school drawn by female high school students to indicate places where they feel unsafe. The main \"unsafe\" zones are the girls' toilets (upper left hand corner), the outer entrance, and the male staff room (lower right hand corner), where male teachers harass girls. The picture next to the staff room shows a man taking a girl by the hand with the caption \"girl is crying.\"17 (From Abrahams, 2003.17)150 Researching Violence Against Women(Figure 9.8) shows that the girls considered the most unsafe places to be: The gates of the school, where formerstudents would come to sell drugs andharass students. The toilets, which, in addition to beingfilthy, were places where girls could beharassed by gangs.The male teachers' staff room, whereteachers would collude to send girls forerrands so that other teachers could sex-ually harass or rape them during theirfree hours. The girls were so afraid togo near the staff room that theyarranged always to do errands in pairsso as to be able to protect each other. ROLE PLAYING Using role-playing can be an effective wayto stimulate group discussion, in much thesame way as incomplete stories do. Example: Role playing used in the Stepping Stones program for HIVprevention in South Africa The South African Medical Research Council adapted the well-known SteppingStones methodology for HIV prevention toinclude activities around domestic violence.One of the exercises used role playing,and was an effective tool for understandingcommunity members' views on domesticviolence. 18The exercise is described below. Different ways that men and women mistreat each other Divide the group into subgroups of four or five people and ask them to develop avery short role-play showing ways in whichmen and women mistreat each other. Present these role-plays to the whole group. After the role-play has finished, askthe characters to stay in role for a few min-utes while you invite the rest of the groupto ask the characters questions. The char-acters should answer these in role. Thesorts of questions that they might ask are: How does she feel when he does this?What does she fear? Why does he do this? How does he feel? Who else is there? Who witnesses it?CHAPTER NINE FIGURE 9.9 DRAWINGS MADE BY CHILDREN AGED 13-16 YEARS HELD IN A HOME FOR ABANDONED CHILDREN AND THOSE WHOSE PARENTS COULD NO LONGER CARE FOR THEM Picture one: \"This girl, her enemy raped her. They were going out first and he said'If you love me you will have sex with me.'She said 'No.' She doesn't have a T-shirt now. He tore off her T-shirt, you see she is only wearing a bra. He took off her shirt and raped her. He slapped her and she scratched him on the neck and he is smil-ing. He is saying, 'Yes I raped her.' So she goes to the doctor and asks the doctor to do some tests. The doctor says she has HIV and AIDS...Her virginity is broken.\" Picture two: \"Mine is a boy who drinks alcohol and he is peeing. He just pees all over and he does not care about people. If he gets drunk he can rape you.\" Picture three: \"This is me and my own brother has raped me. Here I cry and Idon't want to tell my mother.\" A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 151Who is involved in it? How do they feel? What does the woman do? Why does she respond in this way? What do the other people do? Why dothey act in these ways? What can a person do to help him/her-self when he or she experiences suchproblems? Replay the role-play showing some of these strategies. It is important to de-role after this exercise. Go around the group and askparticipants in turn to say their name andmake a statement about themselves fromreal life, e.g., \"I am Matsie and I am notabused by my husband\" or \"I am Zolileand I hit a girlfriend once but do not doit anymore.\" BODY MAPPING Body mapping is used frequently in stud- ies of sexuality and reproductive health togain an understanding of how participantsview their bodies, or what information theyhave about how their bodies function. It isparticularly useful for children who mayhave difficulty expressing their experiencesin words, and for discussing sensitiveand/or traumatic experiences. Example of body mapping: Sexual violence against children in SouthAfrica and Namibia Researchers in South Africa and Namibia conducting interviews with children whohad been sexually abused asked the chil-dren to draw pictures and tell storiesabout them. Examples of the drawingsmade by the children are shown in Figure 9.9. 19PHOTO VOICE Thephoto voice technique, also known as Shoot Back,20is an excellent method for participatory research. Wang, who usedphoto voice with Chinese peasant womento engage them in discussions about theirhealth, notes that \"Photo voice enablespeople to identify, represent, and enhancetheir community through a specific photo-graphic technique. It provides people with cameras to photograph their perceivedhealth and work realities. Photo voice hasthree main goals: to enable people (1) torecord and reflect their personal and com-munity strengths and concerns, (2) to pro-mote critical dialogue and knowledgeabout personal and community issuesthrough group discussions of photographs,and (3) to reach policy makers.\" The steps of photo voice, as presented by Wang, are the following: Conceptualize the problem. Define broader goals and objectives. Recruit policy makers as the audiencefor photo voice findings. Train the trainers. Conduct photo voice training. Devise the initial theme/s for taking pictures. Take pictures. Facilitate group discussion. Allow for critical reflection and dialogue. Select photographs for discussion. Contextualize and storytell. Codify issues, themes, and theories. Document the stories. Conduct the formative evaluation. Reach policymakers, donors, media,researchers, and others who may bemobilized to create change. Conduct participatory evaluation of pol-icy and program implementation.

The photos werealso used subsequently to convince schoolauthorities to improve the sanitary condi-tions of the school. 171. Shrader E, Sagot M. Domestic Violence: Women's Way Out.

WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT RESEARCH ON GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE? Just as violence research raises special issues around respondent safety, the emo-tional sensitivity of the topic raises specialissues for building and sustaining yourfield team. Working on a violence projectcan be extremely taxing, and it is impor-tant\u2014both for ethical reasons and toensure the quality of the data\u2014thatresearchers take active steps to protect theemotional well-being of team members.This means that research plans and budg-ets need to include specific measures foraddressing the emotional consequences ofdoing gender-based violence research.Chapter 11 describes in much greater detailthe kinds of issues that need to beaddressed to protect the safety and well-being of both respondents and interviewersduring fieldwork.B uilding and training your research team is particularly important whenresearching violence against women. Thevalue of good fieldworkers, interviewers,transcribers, and data processors that havebeen sensitized to the issues cannot be over-stated. Experiences worldwide consistentlyindicate that a key to getting reliable, valid,timely data is making sure that field person-nel are appropriately selected and trained. 1 In many ways, the process of selecting and training interviewers for gender-basedviolence research is similar to that for otherresearch projects. Training workshops aredesigned to improve interviewing skills,explain the research protocol, detail thesampling procedures, and practice applyingthe research instruments. Nevertheless,there are several issues that set violenceresearch apart, most notably the need todeal explicitly with violence and genderduring the interviewer-training programand the need to provide emotional supportto project staff throughout the researchprocess. This chapter will deal with boththe issues common to most research proj-CHAPTER TEN Building Your Research Team Topics covered in this chapter: What is special about research on gender-based violence? Building the research field teamTraining fieldworkersRemuneration of interviewers156 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER TEN s Another reality that all projects on vio- lence must confront is the fact that manymembers of the research team themselvesmay have unresolved issues around abuse.The worldwide prevalence of gender-basedabuse means that, almost without excep-tion, any research team will have one ormore members who have been a direct tar-get of violence or come from a familywhere violence was common. Someresearchers have argued that this personalhistory will bias the quality of data. Theytherefore conclude that screening questionsfor hiring should include past history ofabuse. However, several internationalexperiences suggest that these issues,when appropriately addressed, do not adversely affect data quality.1, 2 The reality of researchers' own history of abuse has several implications for gen-der-based violence research. First, it rein-forces the importance of providingemotional support to team members throughout the study. Second, it has impli- cations for the training of interviewers.Many researchers have found that it isextremely helpful to raise this issue explic-itly during interviewer training and to pro-vide an opportunity for women toacknowledge their own experiences ofabuse. Most people learn ways of copingwith painful past experiences, and usuallydo not dwell on them in their everydaylives. However, discussion of violence dur-ing training sessions may awaken disturb-ing images and/or emotions. For manytrainees, simply acknowledging that thesereactions are normal, and providing timelyopportunities to discuss them, will be suf-ficient to help them complete the trainingand participate successfully in fieldwork.In those rare cases where feelings becomeoverwhelming, trainees will have anopportunity to withdraw from the project. Whereas personal experience with abuse may prove problematic for some women,for others it will improve their skill and empathy as interviewers. In fact, womenwho have experienced violence themselvesoften make very good interviewers.Women frequently find that participating ina research project on violence can beempowering and an important route tohealing. An interviewer from the Le\u00f3nstudy in Nicaragua described her experi-ence this way: ...What helped me the most [in my own life] was working on this study. It helped meto be who I am today because I have beenable to help others. I felt that I could helpthem because I had lived through it myself,and I didn't like it, and I wouldn't like foranyone, anyone to live through what I haveDon't skimp on field workers. Look for skills you can't teach: intelligence, reliabil- ity, imagination, curiosity, and sensitivity. Hire people who have a personal and intellectual interest in your study subject: Don't hire people if they are not committed to the issue of violence prevention. Look for field workers everywhere. Don't assume that people who make their liv- ing doing interviews can perform well, or even adequately. Conversely, don't assume that people with little or no experience will not perform well. Do not ask any field worker to conduct more than 100 standardized interviews (including pilot interviews). Interview quality deteriorates rapidly after 100. Anticipate a significant trainee dropout rate. Begin training sessions with manymore field workers than you want to hire. Building a research team should be the goal of your field worker training, not just imparting information or skills. Explain the project and its goals as \"our\" proj- ect and goals; actively solicit the views of team members and use their insights.Include team-building exercises and group dynamics in the training session. Pay your field workers well. Pay them more than they usually receive for equiva-lent work. Distinguish pay during the training period, which merely compensates for theirtime, from pay for carrying out interviews. Pay for specific work produced.Allow for incentive payments for exceptional work. Make sure that field workers know when they perform well; when they don't,don't accept their work. But don't blame people when they make a mistake. Solve problems in ways that teach new skills. Do everything you can to show your field workers how valuable they are. Haveteam dinners. Celebrate birthdays or research milestones. When field workers begin collecting data, spend a day or half day with each. See the problems that your field workers encounter from their perspective, andsolve them. Tell your field workers your findings. Ask for their critique. Pursue leads that theysuggest.

And when a woman told these things, I could under-stand what she was going through...WhenI was carrying out the interviews, I livedthrough each experience as if it were myown, and I could say to them, \"Yes, I lived through this also, I know what this is.\" 2 BUILDING THE FIELD TEAM Building a good field team involves findingthe right people, preparing them well, andsustaining them throughout the researchprocess. This means building personal aswell as professional relationships with fieldstaff. A committed and loyal research teamis the surest insurance for a successfulresearch project. See Box 10.1 for someteam-building tips by a seasoned researcher. Size and composition of the field team The number of fieldworkers needed will depend on several factors, such as howmany and what type of interviews areplanned, how spread out geographicallythe study region is, how many differentlanguages are needed, and whether thefieldwork needs to be completed during acertain period (for example before therainy season begins). Generally, studies relying on qualitative research methods utilize fewer interviewersthan surveys. For a population-based sur-vey, you will probably need at least two tothree field teams with four to six interview-ers per team, as well as a supervisor.Depending on the length and complexityof the questionnaire, it may also be neces-sary to hire a field editor to check ques-tionnaires for errors as they are completed.In many settings, particularly in rural areaswhere transportation is not readily avail-able, each team will also need a driver.The drivers may also escort female inter-viewers in unsafe areas. Depending onhow emotional follow-up for respondentsand interviewers will be addressed, it maymake sense to add a psychologist and/orwomen's advocate to the overall team.Box 10.2 gives an example of the composi-tion of the research team for a survey per-formed in Brazil. Selecting interviewers There are few \"rules\" that can be applied tothe selection of interviewers, except thatgenerally speaking, women should inter-view women and men should interviewmen. An exception to this rule is whenwomen's mobility is so socially constrainedthat it is not feasible for female interviewersto be out in public. It might also be neces-sary to use men to interview women whenthe research requires bilingual interviewers,and few women from the research area arebilingual. This situation occurs frequentlyamong indigenous populations wherewomen are less likely to have receivededucation in the dominant language. If the characteristics of your study popu- lation require using men to interviewwomen, you will need to plan for additionalBUILDING YOUR RESEARCH TEAM s BOX 10.2 THE ORGANIZATION OF FIELDWORK IN BRAZIL The S\u00e3o Paulo research team for the WHO VAW study hired 34 staff members to perform and supervise fieldwork and data entry for a survey of 1500 women.

If, due to budget or timeconstraints, additional training is not possi-ble, you should seriously reconsider con-ducting the research in this particular population. Other criteria\u2014such aswhether respondents would be more trust-ing of individuals from the community orfrom outside of it\u2014are best explored dur-ing formative research. Interviewers for violence research have generally been drawn from four groups:professional interviewers, communitywomen, health workers, and women'sadvocates. Each group has strengths anddrawbacks that should be assessed prior toconducting the workshop.

It is a good idea to invite localwomen's organizations to present or facili-tate these sessions. Begin with the basics. Define the topic and discuss why it is important andinclude exercises that help reveal the cul-tural biases and attitudes commonly heldabout victims of rape or domestic assault.Discuss the physical, psychological, andsocietal ramifications of abusive relation-ships, as well as underlying causes. Talkabout the myths surrounding victimizationand the reasons why women might bereluctant to talk or seek assistance. Theuse of participatory exercises encouragesBUILDING YOUR RESEARCH TEAM with varied backgrounds so that they canexchange experiences, learn from oneanother, and complement one another'sabilities. Table 10.1 discusses some of the advantages and disadvantages of inter-viewers according to past experiencesthat may affect the selection process andfieldwork. In Box 10.3 we describe howfieldworkers were selected in the WHOstudy in Peru. TRAINING FIELDWORKERS There are at least three important goals toaccomplish in the fieldworker trainingsessions: To sensitize your team to issues of gen-der and violence. To instruct them in the use of theresearch protocol and interviewingtechniques. To build a team spirit that motivatesfield staff. At minimum, consider including the fol- lowing six topics in the training sessions:gender-based violence, stress management,review of the research protocol, employ-ment expectations, interviewing tech-niques, and ethics in gender-basedviolence research. In this section we outline what should be covered in each topic. A summary ofthe program and exercises used in theWHO training workshops is included inAppendix II of this manual. Orientation to gender and violence Toward the beginning of the training, youwill need to devote a significant amount oftime to sensitizing the research team togender-based violence issues. These exer-cises are part public education, part supports Interviewers for the WHO VAW study in Peru were selected in two stages. Out of over 100 women who applied for the job, 27 women were chosen to participatein the training program. The criteria and points used for the initial selection were: Relevant academic training (0-3 pts) Age (between 25-50) (0-3 pts) Experience as an interviewer (0-3 pts) Experience in women's health (0-3 pts) Experience with gender-based violence (0-3 pts) Gender training/experience (0-3 pts) Interview (0-10 pts) During the two-week training program, participants were scored on their perform- ance on tests and practice interviews, as well as other skills. All participants were asked to nominate three people they felt would make good supervisors, and theirpreferences were also taken into account. In the end, 18 women were selectedas interviewers and six as supervisors/field editors. The criteria for the final selec- tion were the following: Communication skills (0-4 pts) Nonverbal communication (0-4 pts) Appearance (0-4 pts) Drives (0-2 pts) Works well under pressure (0-2 pts) Works well in teams (0-3 pts) Views on violence (0-3 pts) Speaks Quechua Score on CV (0-10 pts) Interview (0-10 pts)BOX 10.3 SELECTION OF FIELDWORKERS IN PERU160 Researching Violence Against Womenparticipants to examine their own experi- ences and attitudes about violence,although the open sharing of this informa-tion should never be required. Mentionthat virtually all people involved in vio-lence research have had some experiencewith abuse, regardless of nationality, eth-nicity, or background. Interviewers needto be aware of how their personal histo-ries and potential reactions may affecttheir work. Finally, you will want to conduct a brief training in crisis intervention techniques.These skills may be used with respondents as well as members of the research staff.Prior to the workshop, it is wise to developa protocol for dealing with crises, includinga list of community resources, structuredmeetings for staff, and what to do in case a woman is in immediate danger. Emphasizethat the interviewers are part of a research team, not a counseling team, but thatnonetheless they have an ethical obligationto provide assistance when it is called for.You will want to role-play potential situa-tions and conduct group discussions ana-lyzing the dynamics of abuse. Employment expectations Early on in the recruitment of interviewers(and other research team members), candi-dates should be given a job description thatoutlines the responsibilities and remunera-tion of field staff. The job description shouldalso include a description of the evaluationcriteria that will be used to select final can-didates and to evaluate performance. Trainees should understand that partici- pating in the training does not ensureemployment with the project. Only the best,most competent interviewers will be hiredafter the training. All trainees, however,should be compensated for their time dur-ing training, even if they are not hired forthe project. Interviewers hired at the end oftraining should have employment contractsor terms of reference. Sample job descrip-tions for survey interviewers, supervisors,and field editors are provided in Box 10.4.

Therefore, the success of the study depends on the quality of each interviewer's work. In general, the responsibilities of the interviewer include: 1. Locating the households in the sample that are assigned to her and completing the Household Selection Form and Household Questionnaire. 2. Identifying all eligible women in those households.3. Randomly selecting one eligible woman for interview.4. Interviewing one eligible woman in the household in private, using the Individual Questionnaire. 5. Checking completed interviews to be sure that all questions were asked and the responses are neatly and legibly recorded. 6. Returning to households to interview women that could not be con- tacted during her initial visits. THE FIELD SUPERVISOR The supervisor is the senior member of the field team. She is responsi-ble for the well-being and safety of team members, as well as the com- pletion of the assigned workload and the maintenance of data quality.The supervisor receives her assignments from and reports to the fieldcoordinator. The specific responsibilities of the field supervisor are to make the necessary preparations for the fieldwork, to organize anddirect the fieldwork, and to spot-check the data collected using the questionnaire. Preparation for fieldwork Preparing for fieldwork requires that the field supervisor: 1. Obtain sample household lists and/or maps for each area in which her team will be working and discuss any special problems with the field coordinator. 2. Become familiar with the area where the team will be working and determine the best arrangements for travel and accommodations. 3. Contact local authorities to inform them about the survey and to gain their support and cooperation. 4. Obtain all monetary advances, supplies, and equipment necessary for the team to complete its assigned interviews. Careful preparation by the supervisor is important for facilitating the work of the team in the field, for maintaining interviewer morale, and for ensuring contact with the central office throughout the fieldwork.Organization of fieldwork Organizing fieldwork requires that the field supervisor: 1. Assign work to interviewers, taking into account the linguistic com- petence of individual interviewers and ensuring that there is an equitable distribution of the workload. 2. Maintain fieldwork control sheets and make sure that assignments are carried out. 3. Maintain a fieldwork diary, keeping a record of the main events and issues arising. 4. Regularly send completed questionnaires and progress reports to the field coordinator and keep headquarters informed of the team's location. 5. Communicate any problems to the field coordinator/project director. 6. Take charge of the team vehicle, ensuring that it is kept in good repair and that it is used only for project work. 7. Be responsible for coordinating the referral and/or support of respondents identified as requiring support during the survey. 8. Manage the finances provided to cover fieldwork expenses, includ- ing keeping receipts for all expenditures. 9. Support the interviewers as they carry out their work, including holding a daily team meeting with interviewers. 10. Make an effort to develop a positive team spirit. A congenial work atmosphere, along with careful planning of field activities, con- tributes to the overall quality of the survey. THE FIELD EDITOR The specific duties of the field editor are to monitor interviewer perform-ance. Close supervision of interviewers and editing of completed inter- views is essential to ensure that accurate and complete data arecollected. As the collection of high quality data is crucial to the successof the survey, the study will seek to recruit mature responsible women to act as field editors. It is important that those who are selected executetheir duties with care and precision. This is especially important during the initial phases of fieldwork when it is possible to address interviewermistakes before they become habit. Monitoring interviewer performance requires that the field editor:1. Observe the first part of several interviews every day.2. Edit all completed questionnaires in the field. Editing must be com- pleted prior to leaving the sample area. As far as possible, the field supervisor should assist the editor in performing this task so that all interviews are field-edited while still in the sample area. 3. Conduct regular review sessions with interviewers and advise them of any problems found in their questionnaires. 4. Arrange the completed questionnaires and monitoring forms from a sample area (cluster) in order, and pack them to be sent to thecentral office.The following job descriptions were used by the WHO Multi-country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence Against Women i n the training of interviewers, supervisors, and field editors: (From WHO, 2004.4)162 Researching Violence Against Womenthe training, participants should be conver- sant in the protocol's contents and be ableto use it as a reference tool throughout thefieldwork. In reviewing the protocol, it is important to emphasize the importance of accuracyand rigor in identifying and randomizingrespondents and collecting data. You willalso need to review strategies for glitchesin fieldwork. For example, the team willhave to develop strategies about what todo in household sampling when no one ishome or if there are no eligible respon-dents. Other important topics are how toapproach the household and how toobtain informed consent. (Examples ofexercises for establishing contact with thehousehold are presented in Box 10.5.) Depending on the degree of flexibility in the research timetable and the level ofexpertise of your trainees, you may wantto use the training workshop as a chanceto \"pilot test\" the protocol instrument. Youcan solicit suggestions and recommenda-tions for improving the questionnaire fromthe trainees, thereby creating a researchproduct from a group effort. Practice interviews The qualities of a good interviewer includethe ability to: Establish rapport with the interview sub-ject in a short period. Communicate complex ideas effectively,directly, and simply. Apply the research instrument in such away that it sounds like a conversation. Listen to the respondent without beingjudgmental. Guide the respondent in the interviewprocess without pushing her unnaturallyor being rude by cutting her off orignoring her answers. Interviewing is more of an art than a sci- ence, requiring skill and, to a certainextent, innate talent and empathy. Theobjective of the training workshop is toenhance natural skills and talents, throughrole-plays and pilot testing of instruments.Box 10.6 presents some guidelines forinterviewing that were used in a qualitative study on violence in Sri Lanka. After you have reviewed the research protocol, you will want to practice theapplication of the research instrumentsCHAPTER TEN s Interviewer training in Bangladesh and TanzaniaPHOTO BY HAFM JANSEN PHOTO BY HAFM JANSENA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 163using different techniques. Assigning trainees to the roles of interviewer andrespondent is a useful exercise. Therespondent may improvise her answers, oryou can provide her with an outline\"script\" to follow. You may also want to assign roles of other members of thehousehold or allow other trainees toobserve the exercise. Be sure to allowenough time for an interview from start tofinish, as well as time for all participants toevaluate the exercise through verbal feed-back. When survey instruments are beingused, another good exercise is to have oneperson interview a \"respondent\" while asecond person observes the interview andalso records responses to the questions.Afterwards the sets of answers arereviewed by the team together. As trainees become more comfortable with the instrument itself, it may be usefulto practice with people outside theresearch team, for example, with familymembers or friends. It is particularly help-ful to include interviews with women whohave experienced violence. Often, women's centers can identify women whohave attended their centers and who arewilling to be interviewed. Trainees may also pilot test the instru- ments under more realistic conditions byvisiting a community with characteristicssimilar to those of the research communityand applying the questionnaire or otherinterview schedule, using the same criteriafor sampling and respondent selection aswill be used in the study protocol. BUILDING YOUR RESEARCH TEAM s Gaining access to a household in order to talk to the respondent can be very challenging. In this exercise, trainees are divided into small groups and each is given a situation that might be encountered by a fieldworker. They shoulddiscuss how they would handle this situation and then present their conclusions to the plenary group for discussion. Case 1: Maria arrives at a large apartment building where she is supposed to conduct an interview. There is no doorman so she uses the intercom to talk to someone in the household. The person who answers says they do not want to be interviewed and refuses to open the door. Case 2. Elli needs to interview a respondent living in a compound where the watchman informs her that he is not authorized to let her enter and cannot give her any information about the household. Case 3. Wassana goes to a small house in a poor neighborhood. A woman answers the door accompanied by several small children. She looks at Wassana suspiciously and as soon as Wassana starts to explain why she isthere, the woman interrupts her and says she has no time to talk. Case 4. Mieko knocks on the door of a house and a man opens the door. As she begins to explain the purpose of her visit, he interrupts and starts to interrogate her with the following questions: What are you here for? What is this study about? Who sent you? What do you want to know? What are you going to do with the results?BOX 10.5 TRAINING EXERCISES FOR GAINING ACCESS TO A HOUSEHOLD Practice interviews in Bangladesh PHOTO BY HAFM JANSEN164 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER TEN s BOX 10.6 INTERVIEWING TECHNIQUES FOR QUALITATIVE RESEARCH ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN (Notes for interviewers taken from a qualitative study carried out in Sri Lanka) In this research, we are asking women to talk about a subject that is embarrassing and painful to them. Your job is to: Create a relaxed and supportive atmosphere. Collect the information in an unbiased way. Make the experience as empowering for the woman as possible. Create a relaxed and supportive atmosphere. To help the woman relax, you must be relaxed and confident yourself: Check your preparations: interview checklist, notepad and pen, working tape recorder with extra tapes and batteries (and anextension cord if there is a power source), a watch for keeping track of time. Calm yourself by deep breathing, if necessary. Spend a few moments remembering the purpose of the researchand your own personal motivations. Arranging the space: Choose a place where you will have privacy and will not be inter-rupted. Sit facing the woman, on the same level. Put the tape recorder between you and the respondent where youcan see it, but to one side, if possible, so she does not need to lookdirectly at it. (ALWAYS DO A TEST TO MAKE SURE IT IS CLOSE ENOUGH TO RECORD HER VOICE CLEARLY.) Your behavior and appearance: Dress in a way that conforms as closely as possible to local conser- vative standards. Consider also your hairstyle, jewelry, and make up. Avoid fashionable or expensive items, or anything transparent. Act respectfully: She is the expert on the subject for discussion.Avoid acting as if you are an authority figure, even if she seems to expect that. Smile when you meet her for the first time. Do not rush into the interview. Take your time explaining the purpose of the research, why her experiences and views are important, what will happen in the interview, and what confidentiality means. Answer any questions she may have. (BE CAREFUL NOT TO IMPLY THAT SHE WILL RECEIVE DIRECT PERSONAL HELP IN HER OWN CASEBECAUSE OF DOING THE INTERVIEW.) Ask if she is willing to participate in the study. Ask her permission to begin. Your manner of speaking and questioning: Speak calmly and gently, in a pleasant tone of voice. Appear interested in everything she has to say; keep your eyes and attention focused on her while she is speaking. Use words that are easily understood. Don't fiddle with your pen, tap your foot, or exhibit other nervousmannerisms. Use active listening: 1. Encourage her to keep talking by giving verbal and visual cues (e.g., nodding, saying \"hmmm,\" mirroring her facial expressions).2. Show you have understood both the content and her feelings about it by rephrasing what she said (\"So you felt...because...\"). 3. Watch her facial expressions and body language for clues about how she is feeling. Collect the information in an unbiased way. Be thoroughly familiar with the checklists, and use them systematically. Use open-ended questions that encourage the woman to talk, not closed-ended questions that can be answered with one word. Be prepared to reword the question if necessary. Don't use \"leading questions\" that imply a certain answer. Avoid using questions beginning with \"why.\" These tend to make peo-ple feel defensive. Be patient; don't be afraid of silences. Avoid showing by your tone or facial expression that you are shocked by, or don't approve of, something she says. Never interrupt while she is speaking. If there is piece of informationyou need to check and think you might forget, jot it on your pad as she speaks and ask her when she has finished. If the woman strays off the subject, wait for a pause, then ask a question from the checklist. Don't finish her sentences, or put words in her mouth. Don't attempt to do any \"consciousness raising\" during the informa-tion-gathering part of the interview. Even remarks intended to encour- age her, such as \"you didn't deserve that treatment,\" can bias her responses to later questions. Make the experience as empowering for the woman as possible. Encourage the woman to tell her story in her own way, even if it involves a lot of repetition. Often the process of telling her own story to a sympathetic listener brings relief. Avoid the temptation to give advice, even if she asks you to. Butyou can \"brainstorm\" with her to help her come up with her own solutions, if she really wants some input from you. Make sure you are able to answer any of her requests for informa- tion (as opposed to advice) in a way that is locally relevant. If she starts to cry during the interview, don't try to stop her. Crying may provide her with some relief. Acknowledge her distress, and express sympathy for her feelings. There is no need to end the inter-view unless she requests it. After the interview, thank her and remind her that by sharing her views and experiences, she is helping to prevent other women from having to suffer as she did/does. What to do after the interview? Review the session in your mind, and make a written list of: 1. Problems that arose, or items missed.2. New insights. 3. Matters you need to follow up. Spend a few moments getting in touch with your own feelings. If you are feeling upset, don't brush it off. Make sure you discuss it with your colleagues and supervisor. PAT YOURSELF ON THE BACK!!! Your efforts are helping to makeyour community a safer place for women. (From Bradley,1999.5)A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 165When trainees become more skilled with the interview scenario, it is time to focuson specific challenges that may arise dur-ing the fieldwork. For example, you mighthave role-playing exercises where there arefrequent interruptions or where the respon- dent wants to discontinue the interviewbecause she is crying. It is important tostress the importance of leaving enoughtime during the interview to meet respon-dent's needs while maintaining rigor in theresearch methodology. Ethics in gender-based violence research Because ethical issues arise throughout every stage of the research project, theymerit a specific section in the trainingworkshop. It is important to highlight theirsignificance, not only for data collectionbut also for fieldwork preparation, analysis,and dissemination. The research protocol should include a section on the ethics of gender-based vio-lence research, outlining the specific waysthat these issues will be addressed by thestudy. During the training workshop, youwill need to reiterate the importance ofinformed consent and confidentiality, aswell as protocols for dealing with crisesduring interviews with informants, proto-cols for dealing with safety/security issuesfor fieldworkers, and other pertinent ethicalconsiderations. Stress management It is important to address stress-relatedsymptoms among fieldworkers and discusscoping mechanisms for research staff. As you plan your training workshop, keep in mind the varying strengths andtraining needs of different members of theresearch team. Your team may includeinterviewers; transcribers (in qualitativestudies); field supervisors; and administra-tive and support personnel such as drivers,translators, interpreters, or representativesfrom collaborating institutions. Each posi-tion entails different responsibilities, skills,and training needs. The training workshopshould be a team-building effort in whicheveryone is aware of the role he or sheplays and its importance to the study. It may seem that some personnel, such as data processors or transcribers, do notneed training or sensitization in gender-based violence issues. However, experi-ence has shown that even members one ortwo steps removed from direct contactwith respondents may be deeply affectedby the subject matter (see Box 10.7). StressBUILDING YOUR RESEARCH TEAM s A qualitative study of battered women in Belize generated hours of taped interviews from 24 in-depth interviews and three focus groups. A transcriber was hired to pro-duce transcripts of interviews conducted in the study's three languages of Creole,Spanish, and English. During the first few weeks of fieldwork, the transcriber's turnaround time was excel- lent, and the categorization and analysis of the data went smoothly. However, bythe third week the transcriber began to make excuses as to why she wasn't finishing the tapes. She complained of feeling under the weather and occasionally would notreturn phone calls from the supervisor. Eventually, the delayed transcriptions beganto hinder progress in the research, and the supervisor confronted the transcriber with this problem. She revealed that the taped interviews were affecting her deeply, par- ticularly listening to the women's voices describe the horrors of their married life. Weeping uncontrollably, many times she had to stop transcribing and each day she found it increasingly difficult to turn on the tape recorder. From this experience, theresearchers realized the importance of including all team members, not only in the training on violence, but also in stress management activities. (From Shrader, 2000. 6)BOX 10.7 IN THE FIELD: BELIZE Practice interviews in Ethiopia PHOTO BY M. ELLSBERG166 Researching Violence Against Womenmay show up in a number of ways, includ- ing headaches, malaise, reluctance to work,conflictive relationships at home, and soforth. As with fieldworkers, supervisorsneed to be aware of the signs of stressamong research staff and intervene accord-ingly. If resources allow, the ideal work-shop would train all members of theresearch team, at least in the basics of vio-lence against women, stress management,and the contributions of action research toviolence prevention. REMUNERATION OF INTERVIEWERS The system for paying field staff can have important implications, not only for theresearch budget, but also for data quality.The most commonly used approaches arepayment per completed interview and pay-ment for time. Per completed interview With this system, interviewers are paid afixed amount for each questionnaire or setof notes that they complete. This approachtends to maximize the number of question-naires turned in and creates an incentivefor reducing the duration of fieldwork.However, it can also create an incentive toturn in incomplete or poor quality ques-tionnaires. Of greater concern is that it maylead unscrupulous employees to falsifyinterview data. Because women who havebeen abused usually take longer to inter-view, a per-interview approach risks creat-ing a situation where interviewersconsciously or unconsciously discouragedisclosure. Daily or weekly rate of pay This strategy involves remunerating inter-viewers by time worked rather than byproduct delivered. Because there is nobuilt-in incentive to work quickly, inter-viewers are encouraged to take the timethat they need to do quality interviews.This is especially important in studies thatcollect data on sensitive topics. The pri-mary disadvantage of this system is that thelikelihood of running over budget andovertime is greater. One way to offset thisrisk is to offer individual or group incen-tives to meet project timelines and thatreward good work. Based on our field experiences, we rec- ommend that interviewers be paid on adaily or weekly basis, with monetaryincentives for quality work. Additionally,you should consider creating mechanismsfor public recognition of work well doneto ensure that interviewers feel valued.CHAPTER TEN s Ethiopian fieldworkers organized a traditionalcoffee ceremony to celebrate the end of the training workshop.

A great many practical issues need tobe resolved before initiating fieldworksuch as: Preparation of a detailed budget. This includes training, equipment, salaries offieldworkers, transportation, and contin-gencies. The timing of the fieldwork. Does fieldwork coincide with periods duringwhich access to communities will bemore difficult, such as rainy season,elections, or when people are likely tobe away from their homes for harvest-ing crops, seasonal labor, or religious orcultural festivals? Transportation. Arrangements may vary among different regions andbetween urban and rural areas. It isimportant to determine where publicThe process of data collection is the most critical link in the research chain.Mistakes made during this period are themost likely to have repercussions forwomen's safety, as well as for determiningthe usefulness of data. No amount of care-ful analysis can make up for flaws in dataquality. This chapter will outline some ofthe main steps for carrying out fieldworkwith attention both to the safety of womenparticipating in the study and to the qualityof data. ORGANIZING THE FIELDWORK Before beginning data collection, it is criti- cal to make a detailed plan for how basicorganizational and logistical issues will beaddressed. This is particularly important insurvey research, where the numbers ofinterviews are usually much greater, andwhere precision in selecting the rightCHAPTER ELEVEN In the Field Topics covered in this chapter: Organizing the fieldwork Negotiating community accessProtecting the safety and well-being of respondents and fieldworkersFinalizing the procedures and instrumentsManaging nonresponseData quality controlData entry 170 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER ELEVENm transportation may be available, and when it will be necessary to hire vehi-cles, horses, boats, or other modes oftransportation. Food and lodging. Basic necessities for fieldworkers may be difficult to arrangein some areas, whereas in other areasfieldworkers may be able to purchasefood or rent rooms. In many rural areas,fieldworkers may need to carry provi-sions with them and prepare their ownfood or hire someone to cook. Printing of questionnaires, manuals,pamphlets, and other materials.These include supervisor forms, referralsheets, and directories for local servicesfor women. In addition to the basic materials needed for performing interviews, there are many other items that research teams have found useful to take into the field with them,such as: Packets of tissues for interviewers to offer respondents if they cry. Coloring books, balls, and other distractions to keep children busy during interviews. A first aid kit with plenty of aspirin. A petty cash fund to be used to subsidize women's transport to sources of follow-up support. Cash reserves for emergencies. Educational materials about violence. Malaria prophylaxis for interviewers, where necessary. Small gifts for respondents such as posters, calendars, pens, canvas book bags. Phone cards or cellular phones (where appropriate).BOX 11.1 AND DON'T FORGET . . .

In survey research, several computers and printers will probably beneeded in order to enter the data at thesame time as the data collection isbeing performed. Field office. It may be necessary to borrow or rent a space for the period ofthe fieldwork to provide a meetingplace for field staff storage for com-pleted questionnaires and others materi-als, and space to perform data entry.This is especially important due to theneed to maintain the confidentiality ofthe information collected. Payment. You need to plan in advance procedures for making sure that fieldworkers receive their payment while inthe field. If supervisors will be carryinglarge sums of cash, how will the moneybe protected? Breakdowns in financialsystems can be demoralizing to staff andlead to serious disruptions in fieldwork.Communication. It is important to organize a system for maintaining contactbetween fieldworkers and mainresearchers during data collection. Insome areas, telephones may be available,whereas in others, it will be necessary to look for alternative sources of communi-cation, such as radios or cellular phones. Purchasing and preparation of sup-plies. Large amounts of materials need to be prepared in advance for inter-viewers and supervisors such as: Backpacks for carrying materials Identification cards Special vests or T-shirts for interviewers, where appropriate Blank paper Colored pens and pencils Clipboards Tape, clips, staplers Management and transportation ofcompleted questionnaires. A systemIN THE FIELDm Preparing questionnaires in Bangladesh PHOTO BY HAFM JANSEN172 Researching Violence Against Womenmust be developed for ensuring that completed questionnaires arrive intact tothe field office as soon as possible andare stored in a secure location. Keeping track of all these details is an enormous job, and most survey researchersfind that it is helpful to hire a full-time staffperson to coordinate logistics. This shouldinclude sending out advance teams toupdate maps, to find out what arrange-ments are needed regarding food, trans-portation, and lodging, and to identify anypossible obstacles to fieldwork. Investingresources in finding a person who is expe-rienced in conducting community surveyswill save enormous amounts of time andeffort later on, and will ensure that thedata collection proceeds smoothly. NEGOTIATING COMMUNITY ACCESS In addition to discussing plans with the advisory board and obtaining ethical clear-ance, it is important to obtain clearancefrom local authorities in each community.The research should be framed in generalterms, for example, as a study on women'shealth or family relations, to avoid havingthe content of the study become widelyknown beforehand. The same explanationcan be used to describe the survey toother members of the community and inthe households where women will beinterviewed. In some areas, local groupsprovide services for victims of violence.These groups should also be contactedbefore initiating the study to explore thepossibility of referring women with vio-lence-related problems to these services,or coordinating in some other way. In theWHO study in Peru, rural community lead-ers were invited to an informational meet-ing where they helped the research teamto construct community maps for samplingand to plan the route to follow betweencommunities (see Chapter 7). In Thailand,village health workers were recruited toaccompany the interviewers to each housein order to introduce them to the head ofthe household, and to help secure cooper-ation for the study. PROTECTING THE SAFETY AND WELL-BEING OFRESPONDENTS ANDFIELDWORKERS The risk of harm to both respondents and fieldworkers has already been addressed atlength in Chapter 2. This section will addressmore specifically the measures that will helpto ensure the health and safety of respon-dents and interviewers while in the field. Maintaining confidentiality Much of the information provided byrespondents will be extremely personal. Asexperiences in Ethiopia and South Africaillustrate (Box 11.1), the act of revealingdetails of abuse to someone outside thefamily can expose respondents to furtherrisk. For these reasons, it is critical to main-tain the confidentiality of information col-lected during a survey or from qualitativeCHAPTER ELEVENm Sampling households in ThailandPHOTO BY HAFM JANSENA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 173assist with this. The interviewer can forewarn the respondent that she willturn to the alternative questionnaire ifthe interview is interrupted. The logistics of safety. Logistics plan- ning should include consideration ofrespondent and interviewer safety. Thiswill require that sufficient time is bud-geted to accommodate the possibleneed to reschedule interviews. It mayalso be necessary to identify additionallocations (such as a health center)where interviews can be conductedsafely and privately. It is a good ideafor female interviewers to travel in pairswith a male escort in areas known to beunsafe for women alone. This is particu-larly true in circumstances where thereis some likelihood that an interviewmay be interrupted, or where interview-ers may have to conduct interviews inthe evenings. Secure storage of data sources.Where tapes are made of in depthinterviews with survivors of violence,these should be kept in a locked fileand erased following transcription.IN THE FIELD research with survivors of violence. A num-ber of mechanisms should be used to pro-tect the confidentiality of the informationcollected, including: Interviewer emphasis on confiden-tiality. All interviewers should receive strict instructions about the importanceof maintaining confidentiality. No inter-viewers should conduct interviews intheir own community. Do not write the respondent's nameon the questionnaire. Unique codes should be used to distinguish question-naires. Where identifiers are needed tolink a questionnaire with the householdlocation or respondent, they should bekept separately from the questionnaires.Upon completion of the research, theyshould be destroyed, or, if consent wasobtained for follow-up visits, should bekept safely and destroyed after anagreed upon period. In all further analy-sis, the codes should be used to distin-guish questionnaires. Privacy of interviews. Interviews should only be conducted in a privatesetting. The participant should be freeto reschedule (or relocate) the interviewto a time (or place) that may be moresafe or convenient for her. Other fieldstaff (drivers, supervisors) may beenlisted to help distract spouses andother family members if it is difficult toachieve privacy. Training on how to handle inter-ruptions. Interviewers should be trained to terminate or change the sub-ject of discussion if an interview isinterrupted by anyone. A short alterna-tive questionnaire on a less sensitivetopic concerning women's health (suchas menstruation, family planning, orchild spacing) can be developed tom Interviews in Ethiopia PHOTO BY M. ELLSBERG174 Researching Violence Against WomenAgain, no record of the names of the women interviewed should be kept. One interview per household. When the sampling unit for the survey is thehousehold, only one woman per house-hold should be interviewed about herexperiences of violence. This is done toprotect the confidentiality of the inter-view. In households with more thanone eligible woman, the WHO Ethical Guidelines for Researching ViolenceAgainst Women recommend that a sin- gle respondent should be selected ran-domly for interview. Any interviewsconducted with other household mem- bers (either male or female)should not include questionsdirectly exploring their use ofviolence, as this may result inthem concluding that the keyrespondent was also askedabout violence.* Support for respondents Although most women inter-viewed will not require anyspecial help after participatingin the interview, some womenmay be particularly distressed, or may ask the interviewer for help in over-coming their situation. It is important tohave resources set up in advance to dealwith these situations. The research teamshould identify existing resources wherewomen may be referred in each site, forexample, a women's center or shelter, orcommunity clinic where personnel havesome training in helping abused women. Aninterviewer can then provide a woman witha leaflet with the address of the center andtimes when she can be attended to there.Some researchers have found it helpful toput a number of other addresses on thesame piece of paper so that it is not obviousthat these are services for abused women, incase someone else reads the paper. Where few resources exist, it may be necessary either to arrange for the inter-viewers themselves to receive training incrisis intervention or to train other localindividuals to provide such support. In par-ticularly remote areas, it may be easier tohave a trained counselor or women's advo-cate accompany the interview teams andprovide support on an as-needed basis.This may take the form of alerting all par-ticipants that a staff person trained in fam-ily issues will be available to meet withanyone who wishes at a set time andplace. Preferably, this location should be ahealth center, church, or local organizationwhere women can easily go without arous-ing suspicion. In Indonesia, during field-work in a rural area, a psychologist fromthe women's crisis center in the city cameon a weekly basis to visit the field site. Inthe morning, she would meet with any ofthe respondents who had been referred forcounseling by the fieldworkers. In theafternoon, she would hold a group debrief-ing session for fieldworkers, as well asindividual sessions if needed. 1 Finally, educational leaflets may be pro- vided to women, giving additional informa-tion about violence and suggestions forhow to protect themselves and where togo for help if they or someone they knowis being abused. The leaflets should besmall enough to be easily hidden, and careshould be taken to ask women whether itis safe for them to receive the leaflet.CHAPTER ELEVENm \"Sometimes when I offered them the pamphlet the woman would say to me, 'No no, please don't give me the pamphlet, write the address down where I can go and put it on a separate paper, because if my husband found this paper he would kill me.' So I would write the address in my notebook for her...\" Nicaraguan interviewer (Ellsberg et al, 2001.4) * This procedure can lead to a biased sample, as women in households with many eligible women will have a lesser chance of being selected to be interviewed. However, we believe that the risks of interviewing morethan one woman per household outweigh the benefits obtained by a more complete sample. It is possible toadjust for this potential bias in the analysis stage. Experiences in Nicaragua and in the WHO multi-countrystudy indicate that the prevalence estimates of violence were not significantly affected by this measure.A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 175Emotional support for field staff Listening day in and day out to stories of abuse can have emotional and personalconsequences for interviewers. A commonoccurrence recounted by researchers onviolence is that feelings evoked during theresearch begin to invade other areas ofstaff members' lives. For example, it is notunusual for team members involved ingender-based violence research to begin tohave problems in their own relationships,either because they start to recognizeaspects of their own relationships as abu-sive, or because the anger they feeltowards male perpetrators begins to gener-alize to the men in their own life. Thisoccurs so frequently in violence researchthat many researchers openly discuss itduring interviewer training and encourageteam members not to make any major lifedecisions during the course of the project. Emotional support for team members is essential. Not only does it help interview-ers withstand the physical and emotionaldemands of intense fieldwork, but it alsocontributes to the quality of the data col-lection process. A focus group conductedwith interviewers after completing a large-scale health survey that included a moduleon violence illustrates how disturbing anddraining this work can be when appropri-ate support is not provided. 4One woman acknowledged that she had lived throughsimilar experiences herself, and found itparticularly hard to listen to the stories ofabuse. Another interviewer admitted thatshe had dropped out of the study becauseshe was unable to withstand the pressureof listening to women's stories. Sheexplained: ...When we got to the part about vio- lence, [the respondent] started to tell methat she had been raped first by herbrother and her stepfather, but her mothernever believed her, and mistreatedher...She broke down crying, and I was somoved that I didn't know what to do, because as a human being you can't listento a story like this and not be moved. Itried to calm her down and give her someencouraging words, but the image of thesestories affects you, to see how these womensuffer, and especially the feeling that noIN THE FIELDm In the WHO VAW study in rural Ethiopia, researchers visited a village for the pur- pose of piloting the questionnaire.2In this village, women were very reluctant to speak to interviewers alone, and when the subject of violence was brought up,many of them refused to continue the interview. Almost no woman who completedthe interview acknowledged having ever been beaten by her husband (in stark contrast with the study findings that more than half of Ethiopian women in this region had been physically abused by a partner). One woman told an interviewer, \"Do you think I am a fool, that I would talk to you about such things? My husbandwould kill me if I did.\" Eventually, the team learned that a group of people fromthe city had come to talk about domestic violence with the women. They asked women to describe their experiences in a public meeting, and one woman toldhow her husband had beaten her. Later in the day, the husband found out and beat her savagely. Everyone heard her cries but no one came to her rescue. Manywomen thought she had brought the abuse on herself by discussing personal mat-ters in public and shaming her husband. In another study carried out among female high school students in Cape Town, South Africa, the students revealed in the focus group discussions that they had been sexually harassed by male teachers in the school. 3According to the researchers, The learners were grateful to have a sympathetic listener and spent a lot of time discussing these incidents. The girls were clearly victimized and feared these educators and did not want to identify them and neither did they want to be identified as being part of the research group. Plans had to be devised to keep their participation in the research secret from these men. During one incident, a male educator spoke to the researchers enquiring about the research, just out- side the room in which the discussions took place. He appeared more than nor- mally interested and asked to see the room. He was very forceful and opened the door, clearly wanting to see more than the room. It is suspected that he had some idea of what the research was about and he wanted to see which learn- ers were involved. Luckily, none of the learners had arrived yet.BOX 11.2 PROTECTING THE SAFETY OF RESPONDENTS IN GROUP DISCUSSIONS: EXPERIENCES FROM ETHIOPIA AND SOUTH AFRICA. BOX 11.3 HOW TO PREVENT INTERVIEWER BURNOUT 1. Include as part of the research team a part-time psychologist or someone with counseling skills who can provide timely counseling for research staff. 2. Schedule weekly debriefing sessions for research staff to specifically discuss the ways in which the fieldwork is affecting their personal lives and physical andmental health. 3. Rotate job responsibilities among field staff to reduce the intensity of information gathering. 4. Schedule frequent team-building activities such as celebrations of achievements and birthdays to help team members feel comfortable asking for support when they need it.176 Researching Violence Against Womenone supports them, these are experiences that you never forget... ...We spent days thinking about that poor girl and how we left her, without beingable to help her. All we did was give her thepamphlet and leave, and the interviewerswere very upset, because they would thinkabout their daughters, and that tomorrowsomething could happen to them and therewould be no one to help them... 4 Even in situations where support is available, researchers may be surprised bythe intensity of the emotions that areawoken. One of us (Ellsberg) described anearly experience with violence researchthis way:Although I was not involved in the daily interaction with abused women, evensupervising the fieldwork and analyzing thedata turned out to be more painful than Icould possibly have imagined...I foundmyself in tears as I added up the numbersof women who had been kicked in thestomach during pregnancy, or scrollingdown the pages of responses to the question\"How were you affected by the violence?\"where the same words were repeated overand over, \"I cry a lot,\" \"I am very nervous,\"\"I am always afraid.\" ...What sustained us through this period was the sense that women had entrusted uswith their stories and it was our job toCHAPTER ELEVENm It is important to organize regular activities to help field staff relax and \"decompress\" from the stress of interviews (examples from Samoa, Bangladesh and Peru). PHOTO BY HAFM JANSEN PHOTO BY HAFM JANSEN PHOTO BY HAFM JANSENA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 177ensure they were used to help other women. We reminded ourselves that our main con-tribution was to bear witness to women'sexperiences, and that women were alsograteful for the chance to be able to telltheir stories... 5 There are many ways that researchers can provide needed support to teammembers. One strategy is to retain a part-time psychologist or someone with coun-seling skills, trained in gender-basedviolence issues, who can provide timelycounseling to interviewers and otherresearch staff. The counselor can partici-pate in the training workshop as well,assisting in discussions of post-traumaticstress disorder, crisis intervention, andother relevant topics. A second preventive strategy is to sched- ule periodic \"decompression sessions\" ordebriefings for field staff to discuss howthe emotional impact of the research expe-rience is affecting them. These meetings,similar to a \"self-help group,\" should beseparate from meetings for reviewing tech-nical aspects of the research. In these ses-sions, maintaining the confidentiality ofboth respondents and field staff is a pri-mary consideration. The purpose of thedebriefing sessions is to create an opportu-nity for the interviewers to discuss the con-tent of the interviews and their feelingsabout the work. The goal is to reduce thestress of the fieldwork and prevent anynegative consequences. Scheduling weeklysessions should meet the needs of mostresearch teams. This strategy has the addedadvantage of being relatively cost-effective,as opposed to hiring a team psychologistor social worker for crisis intervention orcounseling sessions. A third strategy is to rotate job responsi- bilities, so interviewers have a break fromlistening to heart-wrenching stories.Research team members could temporarilyshift from field interviews to quality con-trol, driving, data entry, clerical and/or administrative tasks. This strategy alsoallows fieldworkers to participate in andunderstand various stages in the processof data collection and preparation. It isimportant to be on the lookout for signsof \"burn out\" among field staff and to takeimmediate steps to reduce their exposureto potentially upsetting situations (Box11.3). A single day's rest can often beenough to allow team members to recu-perate from stress. IN THE FIELDm \"Have faith, women: Protect your health!\"was the message of these canvas totebags given to respon- dents in the PeruWHO study. Thai researchersprepare gifts forrespondentsPHOTO BY HAFM JANSEN178 Researching Violence Against WomenCompensation for respondents The decision to compensate respondents for their participation is a sensitive one,and should be discussed carefully withthe local advisory group to ensure that thestudy is in line with what is consideredappropriate locally. In many settings, it isfelt that offering money to respondentsprovides an incentive for participation thatviolates the ethical principle of voluntaryparticipation. On the other hand, it isimportant to recognize that respondentshave sacrificed valuable time and effort tocooperate with the study. Many researchteams have found ways of compensatingrespondents that do not involve money,such as key chains, canvas bags, calen-dars, and wall clocks with messagesrelated to women's rights. In Japan,respondents were given gift certificates for bookstores. It is important that the messages do not mention violence, as this could put womenat risk. In Peru, canvas bags were printedwith the message \"Have faith, women, pro-tect your health!\" In Brazil, calendars mark-ing important dates for human rights andwomen's issues were distributed.FINALIZING THE PROCEDURES ANDINSTRUMENTS After the questionnaire has been pre-tested and the necessary adjustments have beenmade, the next step is to perform a finalpilot test before actual data collectionbegins. By this time, the questionnaireshould not require substantial revisions.The pilot testing is used mainly to refinethe overall data collection procedures.Usually this phase is carried out as part ofthe process of training field staff. After the interviewers have studied the questionnaire and practiced on each other,they can be sent to perform interviews in aneighborhood that is similar to, but notincluded in, the actual study sample. Thisprocess gives interviewers and supervisorsthe opportunity to practice selecting eligi-ble households and informants, to makesure that questionnaires are being filled outproperly, and to detect any other surveyprocedures that need to be streamlined oradapted. The questionnaires should also beentered by the data entry personnel, andused to test the data entry screens and dataquality tables for errors. MANAGING NONRESPONSE Nonresponse occurs when the selectedwoman is unavailable because she hasmoved away and cannot be located,because she is temporarily away, orbecause she refuses to participate in allor part of the study. A high nonre- sponse rate reduces the validity of the findings because we cannot tell whetherwomen who have experienced violencehave participated to a greater or lesserextent than nonabused women. As aresult, findings may underestimate oroverestimate the prevalence of violence.For example, a survey on violence inLe\u00f3n, Nicaragua, found that severalCHAPTER ELEVENm The Tanzania research team making the final adjustments in the questionnaire PHOTO BY HAFM JANSENA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 179women had left their homes since the time when the sampling frame was devel-oped. Efforts were made to track thewomen down in other cities and to talkto family members regarding the reasonfor the migration. It was found that many of the women had left their homesbecause of domestic violence, and in afew cases, women were currently hidingfrom their abusive spouses. This indicatedthat abuse might be even more commonamong nonrespondents than among theoverall sample of women. Nonresponse may be a great problem in certain areas, such as cities where mostwomen work outside the home or live inapartment buildings. Nonresponse may be classified in differ- ent groups, for example: Household refusal (no one in thehousehold will give information aboutits members). No eligible woman is found in thehousehold. The eligible woman is selected but sheis not available to be interviewed. The eligible respondent refuses to par-ticipate in part or all of the survey.In all surveys, it is important to minimize the degree of nonresponse. Box 11.4 givesexamples of measures that research teamsin the WHO multi-country study took toreduce refusals. It is a good idea to moni-tor the details of nonresponse by cluster,with follow-up procedures implemented inlocations with high levels of nonresponse.It is important to obtain as much informa-tion as possible about nonresponses, toidentify whenever possible why the persondid not participate in the survey, and toassess whether there may be any degree ofbias (such as lower prevalence of abuse)resulting from the incomplete data. IN THE FIELDm N % IRR* Eligible woman refused/absent/didn't complete interview 184 5 5 Individual interviews completed 3255 83 95 Total households with an eligible woman 3439 87 100 No eligible women in household/ household empty/destroyed 502 13 Total households selected 3941 100* Individual response rate (IRR) is calculated as: number of completed interviews/number households with eligible women x 100.TABLE 11.1 CALCULATING RESPONSE RATES Gaining access to a household in Brazil PHOTO BY HAFM JANSEN180 Researching Violence Against WomenFurther, nonresponses should be care- fully documented. Table 11.1 illustrateshow the response rate may be calculatedand presented. In this case, interviewswere completed in 83 percent of the 3,941households selected. However, in 13 per-cent of the households, there were no eli-gible women or the house on the map wasempty or had been destroyed. Because theresponse rate only measures the percent-age of completed interviews out of house-holds with an eligible woman, theindividual response rate is 95 percentrather than 83 percent.DATA QUALITY CONTROL Maintaining control over the quality of dataas it is being collected and entered into thecomputer will avoid many problems lateron. Following are some suggestions forimproving data quality. Standardized training manuals Training manuals for interviewersand supervisors. The instruction man- ual helps ensure that all procedureswith regard to carrying out the inter-views are performed in a uniform way,thereby reducing the possibility of sys-tematic bias in the study. The manualshould outline the roles and responsibil-ities of each member of the field staff,how to select and approach house-holds, and how to deal with unex-pected situations. Question-by-question coding manual.This may be included with the inter- viewer manual if the questionnaire is not too long. It provides additionalinformation about the purpose of eachquestion and how it should be asked,as well as how to code the answers. Supervision The role of supervisors is to ensure thatinterviewers are following the guidelinesof the study, for example in the waythey are asking questions and maintain-ing privacy. Supervisors may observeinterviews occasionally to monitor thequality of the interviews. Either thesupervisors or an editor will review eachquestionnaire before leaving the field tomake sure that it is filled out properly,that the skip patterns are followed, noinformation is missing, and the informa-tion obtained makes sense. This shouldbe done as soon as possible after theinterview is completed. Any mistakesCHAPTER ELEVENm These are some of the measures that were used in the WHO study in Peru, Brazil, and Japan to reduce refusals: Sending letters in advance on official stationary asking for permission to visit,and calling by phone to set up appointments. Sending letters to building managers asking permission for interviewers to enter the building. Meeting with community leaders beforehand to encourage community participa-tion. Visiting households several times if necessary to find the respondent at home,including at night and on weekends. Asking community leaders or village health workers to accompany fieldworkerson the initial visit to a household.BOX 11.4 TECHNIQUES FOR MINIMIZING REFUSALS Checking questionnaire in ThailandPHOTO BY HAFM JANSENA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 181found at this stage should be corrected immediately. Interviewers may need toreturn to a household to obtain missinginformation (unless the respondent didnot want to provide that information). Random repeat interviews Supervisors may randomly repeat parts ofinterviews to make sure that the informa-tion in both the interviews is the same.This is particularly important in the studyof violence, where an interviewer's ownattitudes or behavior may influencewhether a woman will disclose experi-ences of violence. Therefore, the \"inter-viewer effect\" is particularly important tocontrol as much as possible. If supervi-sors will be revisiting households, it isimportant to mention this in the informedIN THE FIELDm Fieldworkers editing questionnaires in SamoaBOX 11.5 ENSURING DATA QUALITY IN THE WHO MULTI-COUNTRY STUDY ON WOMEN'S HEALTH AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN Within each country, a range of mechanisms was used to ensure and monitor the quality of the survey implemen- tation in different settings. This included: The use of a standardized and detailed training package. Clearly explaining the requirements and conditions of employment to each interviewer and supervisor, andmaintaining the option to fire staff who were not performing adequately, or who had negative attitudes towards the topic of study. Compiling details of eligible members of each household during the survey. Possible sampling biases could then be explored by comparing the sample interviewed with the distribution of eligible respondents. Close supervision of interviewers during fieldwork, including having the beginning of the interview observedby the supervisor for a proportion of interviews. Conducting random re-checks of some households, without warning. Several respondents were reinterviewedby the supervisor using a brief questionnaire. This visit was used to assess how the respondent was selected and to assess the respondent's perceptions about the interview (at the time of the original interview respon-dents were asked for permission for the supervisor to return). Continuous monitoring for each interviewer and each team of a number of performance indicators such as the response rate, number of completed interviews, and rate of disclosure of physical violence. Having a questionnaire editor in each team, who reviewed each of the questionnaires once they were com-pleted, identifying inconsistencies and skipped questions. Within any cluster, this enabled any gaps or errorsto be identified and corrected before the team moved on to another cluster. A second level of questionnaire editing was done upon arrival in the central office by \"office editors.\" Extensive validity, consistency, and range checking was conducted at the time of data entry by the check pro-gram that is part of the data entry system. All the survey data were double entered, and inconsistencies were identified and addressed through a com-parison of the two data sets. (From WHO, 2000. 6) PHOTO BY HAFM JANSEN182 Researching Violence Against Womenconsent procedure and to ask for permis- sion to revisit the respondent. Technical debriefing In addition to the emotional debriefingmeetings already referred to in ChapterTen, regular meetings with interviewersduring the fieldwork are important foridentifying and correcting problems in thedata collection. Such problems includeambiguities in questions that are beinginterpreted differently by various interview-ers or questions where large discrepanciesare found. Interviewer observations Whenever possible, interviewers shouldbe encouraged to write detailed observa-tions at the end of the interview. Theseobservations can include informationabout the interview itself, such aswhether anyone interrupted and whetherthe informant seemed nervous or credi-ble. The observations can also provideadditional information about thewoman's history that may help to clearup apparent inconsistencies, or con-tribute valuable insights into the problemunder study. Final debriefing A final debriefing should be carried outwith fieldworkers and supervisors after thedata collection is completed. The purposeis to gather information about the fieldprocess in general, problems that wereencountered that might influence the qual-ity of the data, and the general views ofstaff regarding the veracity of the informa-tion provided by respondents. For exam-ple, it would be useful to hear whetherwomen seemed reluctant to answer thequestions on violence, and whether therewere problems achieving complete privacy.Did it appear that respondents were tellingthe truth about their experiences? In onesuch debriefing, but yes withtheir eyes.\" 4These comments will be extremely valuable later on in helping tointerpret the findings. DATA ENTRY Data entry and analysis is greatly facilitatedby using a computer package designedspecifically for the entry and statisticalanalysis of survey data. We recommend theuse of Epi Info, an epidemiological pack-age developed by the Centers for DiseaseControl (available in DOS or Windows for-mat at http://www.cdc.gov/epiinfo/). Theadvantages of Epi Info are many: It is free, easy to obtain, and has beentranslated into several languages. CHAPTER ELEVENm All WHO VAW study sites used standard- ized data entry screens that were modified in each site to include any addi- tional questions (example from Bangladesh). This woman was raped by her brother, and then beaten and sexually abused by her husband. She finally left him, after 10 years of abuse, but he continued to fol- low her, to threaten her with a machete, and once dragged her by the hair down the street. She went to the police for help, but they said there was nothing they could do. She is still frightened that he will come back to kill her, and she broke down crying during the interview. I gave her a booklet about violence and I referred her to the university mental health clinic. Nicaraguan interviewer (From Ellsberg, 2000.5)BOX 11.6 EXAMPLE OF A FIELDWORKER'S OBSERVATIONSPHOTO BY HAFM JANSENA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 183It is easy to use, and many researchers and data analysts are already familiarwith it. It allows for data entry screens with log-ical checks, and basic statistical analysis.The Windows version also does moreadvanced statistical analysis, such aslogistic regression and life table analysis. Data entered in Epi Info can easily beexported to other statistical programsfor more advanced analysis, such asSPSS or Stata. No matter what data entry system you use, it is important to ensure that the dataare entered correctly. Sloppy data entry canlead to enormous problems later on, thattake months to detect and clean. Wheneverpossible, data entry should be carried out atthe same time as data collection. This willmake it much easier to identify and correctproblems in the data collection before it istoo late. Following are some of the mostcommon methods for controlling the qualityof data entry. Logical controls. Many data processing software packages (including Epi Info)allow you to program logical checksinto the data entry program. Thesechecks can reduce errors by specifyingthe values that can be entered in a spe-cific field (for example, if it is a yes/noquestion, then only the two values rep-resenting yes and no will be accepted).They can also carry out automaticchecks to maintain the internal consis-tency of the data. For example, the pro-gram will check to make sure that awoman's reported age coincides withher birth date, or if she has alreadyIN THE FIELDm A data entry system was developed in Epi Info 6.0 with standardized data entry screens and extensive error check programs. In each country, all information collected on the administration sheet, household selection forms, house-hold questionnaire, and female questionnaire needed to be entered in this system. The system was developed cen-trally. A member of the Core Research Team installed the program in each country, assisted in customizing theprogram to accommodate country adaptations of the questionnaire, and trained data entry staff and the data entry supervisor during one week in use of the program and in all other aspects of data processing. Although some of thequestions and/or answer options differed between countries, a standardized approach to coding was adopted and every deviation of the original question was carefully documented in a central codebook. These procedures helpedensure that the data in each country were essentially entered in the same way, and that decisions about codingwere implemented universally. All data were double entered and double entry errors were identified using the valida- tion module Epi Data. Open-ended questions were initially entered verbatim, and then coded, based on a uniform coding system that was developed after reviewing the responses obtained in each country. Each country team was responsible for the entry,cleaning, and preliminary analysis of the data for their own country. Assistance from the central technical support team was provided where necessary. (From WHO, 2000. 6)BOX 11.7 DATA ENTRY AND PROCESSING IN THE WHO MULTI-COUNTRY STUDY ON WOMEN'S HEALTH AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE Data entry in Tanzania PHOTO BY HAFM JANSEN184 Researching Violence Against Womenindicated that she has no children, the program will automatically skip anyquestions regarding children. Double entry of data. This is the most reliable way to ensure the quality ofdata entry. It involves entering eachquestionnaire twice by different people,and then comparing the data for dis-crepancies. While this is a very reliablemethod, it does increase costs.Therefore, some researchers prefer touse double entry at the beginning ofdata entry, to identify and correct com-mon mistakes. Then, as errors arereduced, data can either be enteredonce, or double entry of data can beperformed randomly on a smaller pro-portion of questionnaires. Data quality tables. Data quality tables are useful for determining refusal ratesand comparing results on specific vari-ables for which information alreadyexists. They can reveal problems occur-ring in specific field teams or with indi-vidual interviewers. In prevalencestudies, it is a good idea to keep trackof the percentage of women disclosingviolence per interviewer, and to performadditional supervision of interviewerswith particularly high or low rates ofdisclosure.1.

There are several waysO nce the fieldwork has been com- pleted, the next task, and arguably the mostrewarding part of the research process, is tounravel the mysteries hidden within the data.This involves transforming endless pages ofwords, numbers, and codes into meaningfulresults to inform theory building or action. One of the common limitations of sur- vey research on violence is the tendency topresent results mostly in the form ofdescriptive statistics, for example, percent-ages of women who are abused and char-acteristics of abuse. While these types offigures are certainly necessary, there is abroad range of statistical techniques fordata analysis that allows researchers toexplore the relationships between violenceand other variables with greater depth andprecision. In this chapter, we show how avariety of statistical techniques may becombined to enrich data analysis.Providing detailed guidance for advancedstatistical analysis is beyond the scope ofthis manual, and we urge researchersneeding further assistance to consult anexperienced statistician during this stage. CHAPTER TWELVE Analyzing Quantitative Data Topics covered in this chapter: Basic analysis of survey data on violence against women Looking at associations between violence and other variablesAssessing the validity of survey resultsInterpreting the results Inspect and clean the data matrix. Display frequencies of the variables. Make cross tabulations to check for inconsistencies. Check graphic distributions of relevant variables. Review basic hypothesis. Plan initial tables. Write down expected results. Carry out additional analysis. Illustrate results in tables and graphs. Interpret results and assess critically. Synthesize results in writing. (Adapted from Persson and Wall, 2003.1)BOX 12.1 STEPS FOR ANALYZING AND INTERPRETING THE DATA188 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER TWELVEY to do this. One way to check data entry is to look over the data matrix frame byframe and make sure that nothing ismissing. Another method is to make frequencies of the basic variables. Look for variablesthat seem to have been miscoded, andcheck for missing values on key variablessuch as age and education. Finally, do cross-tabulations to look for obvious inconsistencies. For example,make sure that all the women who haveanswered questions about the characteris- tics of violence are also coded as having been abused, and that none of the womencoded as not having children haveanswered the questions about children'sage and schooling. Whenever you find inconsistencies or missing data, you will probably need toconsult the original questionnaire to findthe correct answer. Be sure to keep a logof any corrections made to the data file. Assoon as you have a fully updated andcleaned version of the data set, make sev-eral copies and keep them in a safe place! This is certainly the most tedious part of data analysis. Doing it carefully can, how-ever, save you time and anguish later on.Table 12.1 presents an example of what adata matrix looks like. Each row representsa different informant, and the columns rep-resent different variables. Prepare for data analysis In preparing for the data analysis, youshould return to your hypothesis andreview the relationships you are expectingto test. These can be presented in the formof empty tables that serve as your initialanalysis plan. First, look at the frequenciesof variables such as age and education tosee how they are distributed. One way tolook at distribution graphically is by meansof a histogram (Figure 12.1), which meas- ures the frequencies of observations ineach category. This will be helpful later onin finding meaningful ways to recode thedata into smaller categories, such as agegroup and educational attainment. Different ways to describe the occurrence of violence One of the most important findings of a prevalence survey on violence is the per-centage of women who have been abused.However, there are many different ways toquantify and describe the frequency of vio-lence, and you will need to analyze yourdata from several different angles to findthe most meaningful way to describe yourresults. Following are some examples ofthe different ways that data on violencemay be presented. As we mentioned in Chapter 6, the prevalence of violence can be expressed asthe percentage of women interviewed whohave experienced violence during a spe-cific period of time (for example, the last12 months), or as the percentage ofwomen who have ever experienced vio-lence in their lives. It is also useful to break down these fig- ures according to the type of violenceTABLE 12.1 EXAMPLE OF A DATA MATRIX Record Code Abused Age Numchild Educ Poverty Urban 1 MY132 1 15 1411 2 KJ423 1 29 3202 3 MC341 2 31 2212 4 KJ153 2 46 5321 5 MI253 1 24 3111 6 KU124 2 19 2302A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 189(physical, sexual, emotional, or economic) and the perpetrator (in other words, abuseby partner should be presented separatelyfrom abuse by other individuals). It is further useful to look at the over- laps between different types of violence,for example, how many women haveexperienced both partner and nonpartnerabuse, or how many women have experi-enced both sexual and physical violence.These can be illustrated using Venn dia-grams. The diagram in Figure 12.2 wasANALYZING QUANTITATIVE DATAY FIGURE 12.1 HISTOGRAM INDICATING THE AGE DISTRIBUTION OF EVER-MARRIED WOMEN 15-35 YEARS OF AGE Number of women Age of women18- 16-14- 12- 10- 8- 6-4- 2- 0- 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 FIGURE 12.2 OVERLAP BETWEEN SEXUAL, PHYSICAL, AND EMOTIONAL VIOLENCE EXPERIENCED BY 613 WOMEN IN JAPAN Emotional (85.3%) Physical (77.2%) Womenproduced by Yoshihama and Sorenson, and presents the types of abuse that werereported by women in Japan. 2The percent- ages within parentheses represent the pro-portion of abused women who experienceeach type of abuse, whereas the numberswithout parentheses represent the propor-tion of abused women who experiencedspecific combinations of violence. In thisexample, 57 percent of abused womenexperienced all three types of abuse. Most women who suffer abuse experi- ence several different acts of violence, aswell as repeated incidents of violence. Toenable readers to visualize the range ofabusive behaviors, it may be helpful todescribe the percentage of abused womenwho have experienced specific acts of vio-lence. These may be presented as lifetimeexperiences, or as in Figure 12.3, from theCHAPTER TWELVEY FIGURE 12.3 DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC ACTS OF VIOLENCE EXPERIENCED BY NICARAGUAN WOMEN DURING THE LAST 12 MONTHS AND PRIOR TO THE LAST 12 MONTHS Forced to have sex using threats Forced to have sex using physical violence Choked or burned Kicked or dragged Hit with fist or instrument Slapped or threw something Pushed or shoved 01 0 2 03 0 4 0 5 0 6 07 0 8 09 0 % of abused women who have experienced violence Current (last 12 months) Former10.4 9.7 9 10.9 25.3 22.4 33.719.9 21.1 15.4 21 42.3 37.1 44.3 FIGURE 12.4 WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES OF PARTNER VIOLENCE IN LE\u00d3N, NICARAGUA, ACCORDING TO SEVERITY AND TIME FRAME 360 ever-married women 188 ever abused 172 never abused 97 current abuse 91 former abuse 68 severe 29 moderate 64 severe 27 moderateActs of Violence (From Rosales et al, 1999.3) (From Ellsberg et al, 1999.4)A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 191be critically important later on for looking at the relationship between violence andspecific health outcomes.

Aftercompleting this descriptive analysis, werecommend developing a scale thatenables you to group women accordingto their experience of violence, for exam-ple: never abused, former moderateabuse, former severe abuse, current mod-erate abuse, and current severe abuse.This kind of detailed information aboutwhat kind of violence women suffer willY Moderate Severe Violence Violence Total Frequency % (N) % (N) % (N) Once 18 (17) 22 (21) 40 (38) Occasional (3-5 times) 10 (10) 28 (27) 38 (37)Frequent (6-20 times) 2 (2) 9 (9) 11 (11) Very frequent (more than 20 times) 0 11 (11) 11 (11)Total 30 (29) 70 (68) 100 (97)TABLE 12.2 FREQUENCY OF VIOLENCE IN LE\u00d3N, NICARAGUA, DURING THE LAST 12 MONTHS ACCORDING TO SEVERITY (N=97) FIGURE 12.5 THE PREVALENCE OF VIOLENCE AMONG 360 EVER-MARRIED WOMEN IN LE\u00d3N, NICARAGUA, ACCORDING TO SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS, URBAN/RURAL RESIDENCE, AND NUMBER OF CHILDREN Percent women abused physically70- Ellsberg et al, 1999.4)192 Researching Violence Against Womenviolence and possible risk or protective factors or specific health outcomes. Simplystated, this involves comparing differentgroups of women to find out whetherthere is more violence among women withcertain characteristics, or whether womenwho have experienced violence have agreater frequency of certain kinds of prob-lems. Figures 12.5 and 12.6 show howthese differences might be presented bymeans of a bar graph. You will certainlywant to look at the associations betweenexperience of violence and such back-ground factors as age, urban rural resi-dence, socio-economic status, education,and number of live children. You shouldalso look at how each of these variables isrelated to the others. It may be helpful tomap the associations out visually, as shownin Figure 12.7. In order to determine whether the preva- lence of violence actually varies accordingto different characteristics such as age oreducation, you will need to perform testsforstatistical significance . When used by researchers, the word significance refers notto the importance or size of the difference,but to the likelihood that the associationsare real and not simply due to chance. Twoof the most common tests for statistical sig-nificance are chi-square (X 2) and the Student's T test, and most computer pack-ages can perform them automatically. Eachtest is appropriate for different kinds ofdata. Therefore, you should consult a statis-tician to determine the most appropriatestatistical tests for your data. For example, initial analysis of survey data in Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua, found that lifetimeexperience of physical violence was signifi-cantly associated with poverty, living in theurban area, and having a mother ormother-in-law who was also abused. Noassociations were found between violenceand a woman's age or education. However,both age and low education were associ-ated with a high number of children, andlow education was associated with povertyand living in the rural area (Figure 12.7). InFigures 12.8 and 12.9, bar graphs showfindings from a study in Central Java,Indonesia. Figure 12.8 shows thatCHAPTER TWELVEY FIGURE 12.6 THE PERCENTAGE OF EVER-MARRIED NICARAGUAN WOMEN WHO REPORT THAT THEY HAVE CONSIDERED OR ATTEMPTED SUICIDE RELATED TO EXPERIENCES OF VIOLENCE (N=8507) 25- 20-15-10- 5-0- Thought of commiting suicide Tried to commit suicide All women Women with violence Women without violence8.4 4.89.817.1 4.5 2.4 (From Rosales et al, 1999.3)PercentA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 193ANALYZING QUANTITATIVE DATAY FIGURE 12.7 VISUAL MAPPING EXERCISE TO SHOW ASSOCIATIONS FOUND BETWEEN BACKGROUND VARIABLES AND THE RISK OF WIFE ABUSE IN LE\u00d3N, NICARAGUA Lines with arrows between variables indicate significant associations.Mother-in-law abusedUrban/rural residence Mother abused Number of children PovertyWoman's education Woman's ageLifetime experiences of violence FIGURE 12.8 PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS AMONG WOMEN ACCORDING TO EXPERIENCES OF SEXUAL AND PHYSICAL PARTNER VIOLENCE IN CENTRAL JAVA, INDONESIA Ulcers Vaginal discharge Dizziness Aches and pains Intestinal problems Lower abdominal pain 01 0 2 03 0 4 05 0 6 07 0 * p<.05 **p<.001No violence Violence10* 15 20 18 42** 60 30** 43 8** 17 7** 15 Percentages are given for women who had experienced each symptom in the previous four weeks according to whether they had ever been physically or sexually abused by an intimate partner.

ASSESSING THE VALIDITY OF SURVEY RESULTS Once you have found what seem to be the most important results from your data, andyou have performed basic statistical testsbetween variables (for example, violenceand ill health), you need to assess theirvalidity . This means you need to deter- mine to what degree the study measuredwhat it was supposed to, and whether thefindings mean what they are supposed to.Internal validity refers to the extent towhich variations in a specific outcome (for example, the risk of violence) may beattributed to variations in an independentvariable (for example women's age or edu-cation). External validity refers to the degree to which results from a given study may be used to draw conclusions about a larger population. If a study is performedon a randomly selected population, itshould be possible to generalize the resultsof the study to the general population fromwhich the sample was drawn. Another important question is Are the findings consistent? That is, do they make sense, according to what is known aboutthe subject locally and internationally? Ifthey differ greatly from previous findings,are there any additional data to support thenew results? Are there any aspects of datacollection, sampling, design, or analysisthat might have altered the results by intro-ducing bias? Has the analysis taken intoaccount possible sources of confounding?The following pages present different waysto address these issues. The effects of confounding in data analysis In studying the association between risk factors and a specific problem, confound- ingcan occur when another characteristic exists in the study population and is asso-ciated with both the problem and the riskfactor under study. Confounding can have a very impor- tant effect on study results, and can cre-ate the appearance of a cause-effectrelationship that in reality does not exist.Age and social class are often con-founders in epidemiological studies. Inthe study of risk factors for violence, con-founding variables can give misleadingimpressions about what risk factors influ-ence the occurrence of violence.Stratified analysis andmultivariate analysis are two ways to control for the effects of confounding variables.CHAPTER TWELVEY FIGURE 12.9 HUSBAND'S CHARACTERISTICS ACCORDING TO USE OF VIOLENCE (AS REPORTED BY WIFE) IN CENTRAL JAVA, INDONESIA Alcohol use Son preference Low education Fights with men Has other women 0 1 02 0 3 04 05 06 0 ** p<.001 42** 49 2** 6 2** 13 Percentages are given for the proportion of men with each characteristic, according to whether or not they have ever used physical or sexual violence against their wives.5Husband characteristics Percent of men (From Hakimi et al, 2002.5)A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 195Stratification involves analyzing data separately using defined categories of theconfounding factor, such as age groups.For example, some studies using bivari- ate analysis (analysis using only two variables) have found that pregnant women were more likely to be abused than non-pregnant women. However,after analyzing the same data stratified byage groups, it turned out that this associa-tion was confounded by age. It turnedout that being young was the real riskfactor for violence rather than pregnancy.It just happened that younger womenwere more likely to be pregnant thanolder women. This explained theincreased prevalence of violence amongpregnant women. Violence can also be analyzed as a con- founding variable for other risk factors, asshown in the following example of a studyon mental distress. Preliminary resultsfound that women who had been marriedat least once in their lives had twice asmuch emotional distress as women whohad never been married (Table 12.3). Thiswould imply that marriage is an importantrisk factor for mental distress. However, when the prevalence of mental distress among ever-married women wasanalyzed separately according to whetherwomen had experienced wife abuse, alarge difference was found between thetwo groups. Thirty-one percent of abusedwomen suffered mental distress, comparedto only seven percent of women who hadnever been abused, which is even less thanthe prevalence of distress among never-married women (Table 12.4). Since wife abuse is associated with mar- riage (by definition only ever-partneredwomen can experience wife abuse) and itis also associated with mental distress, ithas a confounding effect on the associationbetween marriage and mental distress(Figure 12.10). Therefore, after stratifiedanalysis it becomes evident that it is wife abuse and not marriage itself that accountsfor the increase in mental distress amongmarried women. This analysis is further strengthened by comparing women's current mental dis-tress according to the severity of violencethey experienced and when it took place,as shown in Figure 12.11. Breaking downthe analysis this way demonstrates thatwomen who were severely abused in thelast 12 months were over ten times morelikely to be distressed than women whohad never been abused. Further, itrevealed that the severity of abusewas more important than when it tookplace, since women experiencing severeANALYZING QUANTITATIVE DATAY Selection of women Percentage of emotional distress All women (n=488) 17% Ever-married women (n=360) 20%Never-married women (n=128) 10%TABLE 12.3 PREVALENCE OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS ACCORDING TO MARITAL STATUS AMONG NICARAGUAN WOMEN Experience of wife abuse Prevalence of emotional distress Never abused (n=172) 7% Ever abused (n=188) 31%TABLE 12.4 PREVALENCE OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS AMONG EVER-MARRIED NICARAGUAN WOMEN ACCORDING TO EXPERIENCES OF WIFE ABUSE FIGURE 12.10 THE CONFOUNDING EFFECT OF VIOLENCE ON THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MARRIAGE AND MENTAL DISTRESS Marriage Violence Mental Distress(From Ellsberg et al, 1999.6) (From Ellsberg et al, 1999.6)196 Researching Violence Against Womenviolence formerly were still more likely to be currently distressed than women whohad suffered only minor abuse, eventhough it took place more recently. The use of multivariate analysis to adjust for confounding factors When it appears that there are several variables confounding an association, thenit is no longer practical to use stratifiedanalysis, as it would be excessively com-plex to perform. For example, in Figure12.7, we saw that in the Le\u00f3n study therewere several variables, such as poverty,living in the urban area, and number ofchildren, which were associated with therisk of violence. It was further shown thatthese three variables are associated witheach other as well as with women's levelof education. Could it be that poverty isthe true underlying factor influencingwomen's risk of violence, and thereforethat urban women and women with manychildren are found to have greater levelsof violence, simply because they are morelikely to be poor? How can we unravelthe complex relationships between thesevariables? Multivariate analysis techniques, such aslogistic regression modeling , are useful for examining the relationshipsbetween several explanatory factors and aspecific outcome variable. Logistic regression helps to uncover the degree to which several explanatory variables arerelated and to control for confoundingvariables. In Table 12.5 (next page), thesame relationships presented in Figure12.7 are examined using crude or unad-justed odds ratios as well as multivariateor adjusted odds ratios. The 95 percentconfidence intervals are used to assessthe statistical significance of the associa-tion by indicating that there is a 95 CHAPTER TWELVEY FIGURE 12.11 PREVALENCE OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS ACCORDING TO EXPERIENCES OF VIOLENCE AMONG NICARAGUAN WOMEN Percentages are given for the proportion of ever-married women who experienced emotional distress in the four weeks prior to the survey, according to whether they had experienced physical partner violence. Violence was classified by severity and by whether it took place within the 12 months previous to the study, or earlier. In the right hand columns, crude (unadjusted) odds ratios and their corresponding confi- dence intervals are given. Intervals where the lower and upper figures do not include 1.0 are considered statistically significant.

If the rangebetween the lower and upper figure inthe confidence interval does not includeone, then it can be said that there is a 95percent probability that the association is not due to chance. When comparing the crude and multi- variate odds ratios for each variable, onecan see that they do not vary much inmost of the cases. The associationbetween violence and poverty, havingmore than four children, and a history offamily violence in the husband's familyare all maintained. Living in the urbanarea, which had a confidence intervalslightly below one in the crude analysis,becomes significant in the multivariatemodel, while a history of family violencein the wife's family becomes insignificant.After performing the multivariate analy-sis, it is possible to say that althoughpoverty, urban/rural residence, and highparity are all related, their effect onwomen's risk of violence is independentand should not be interpreted as theresult of confounding.

However, additional insight may be revealed by the creative use ofmore advanced statistical techniques. For example, life table orsurvival analysis was used to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship betweenviolence and high parity in Nicaragua.Many international studies have found asimilar association. 7One interpretation for this is that having many children placesadditional stress on a marriage andincreases a woman's likelihood of beingbeaten by her husband. However, using life table analysis , a statistical technique which measures theprobability of events occurring over time,it was possible to determine that violencebegan early on in relationships, in manycases well before women had startedbearing children. Figure 12.12 shows that50 percent of violence begins within twoyears of marriage, while 80 percent ofabuse starts within four years. Thisimplies that high parity, instead of beinga risk factor for abuse, is more likely tobe a result of violence, because batteredwomen are less likely to be able to con-trol the timing of sex or the use of birthcontrol. The same techniques were applied to the likelihood of a woman leaving anabusive relationship, and it was foundthat 70 percent of women eventually didleave their abusers, although somewomen stayed as long as 25 years ormore before separating. Stratifying thisanalysis according to age groups showsthat younger women are more likely tohave left an abusive relationship withinfour years, compared to womenbetween 35-49 years (Figure 12.13). Thisindicates that younger women are lesslikely to tolerate abuse than olderwomen. In order to use survival analysistechniques, it is necessary to collectdetailed data regarding each of aCHAPTER TWELVEY FIGURE 12.13 THE PROBABILITY OF LEAVING AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP OVER TIME, BASED ON A WOMAN'S CURRENT AGE GROUP Number of years from onset of violence to leaving100- 70- 60- 50- 40-30- 20-10- 0- 02 468 1 0 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 2 0 2 2 2 4 2 6Percentage of women leaving This figure shows that 50% of young women (ages 15-25) leave a relationship within four years of violence starting, whereas 20 years was the median time of older women.15-24 25-34 35-49p<.01 (From Ellsberg, 2000.10)A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 199woman's relationships: when did it start, how long did it last, was there violence,and if so, when did the first and lastincidents of violence take place. Thesetypes of analyses are somewhat compli-cated to perform and interpret, so it is important to consult with an experi-enced statistician. INTERPRETING THE RESULTS The process of data analysis will often take longer than you initially expect.However, you can plan data analysis instages, so that initial findings, such asprevalence and descriptive characteristics,can be made available as soon as possibleto the communities and local institutionsthat have been supporting the research,and that will be anxiously awaiting results.Further analysis can be performed over alonger period to explore some of the moreinteresting findings in greater depth. Box12.2 presents guidelines for writing upresearch results for publication in scientificjournals. Chapter 14 will discuss in detailhow research results may be tailored to fitthe needs of different groups. When interpreting and writing up the results of data analysis, it is important tobe cautious. Each research design yieldsdifferent kinds of data, with their respec-tive limitations. Be careful not to drawconclusions that are not supported by thedata, as overstating your results can seri-ously undermine the credibility of theresearch. People are more likely to listento your findings when you are openabout whatever limitations the study hadin terms of design, data collection, oranalysis. Some examples of common pit-falls are the following: Inferring causal relationships fromcross-sectional data. Cross-sectional sur-veys can highlight associations betweentwo variables, but unless you havegood information about when differentconditions or events occurred it is diffi-cult to know with certainty what camefirst. A good example of how causalrelationships can be misinterpreted isthe relationship between parity and vio-lence presented in the last section. It isa good idea when presenting resultsfrom cross-sectional surveys to talkabout \"associations\" rather than causes.The discussion section can assesswhich variables are most likely to becauses or outcomes, based on yourconceptual framework and other stud- ies on the subject.

Candies in Hell: Research and Action for Researchers and Activists 203z meant to acquaint the reader with the process and to direct interested parties touseful texts in the field. Generally, projectsinvolving qualitative data analysis shouldproceed under the direction of someonetrained in qualitative research. We have found the framework of researchers Miles and Huberman helpfulin understanding qualitative analysis. 1 Analysis, according to them, consists of\"three concurrent flows of activity: datareduction, data display, and conclusiondrawing or verification.\" Ulin and col-leagues offer a slightly revised version of the Miles and Huberman frameworkthat identifies four separate flows of activ-ity\u2014data reading, coding, reducing, anddisplaying\u2014all informing a constantprocess of interpretation. 2As emphasized in Figure 13.1, this constant interplay ofactivity is an iterative process that begins inthe field and continues at your desk onceall the data are collected. Below we describe each of these processes briefly before exploring dataIn this chapter, we concentrate on mak- ing sense of textual data in the form ofexpanded field notes, transcripts ofrecorded interviews, or naturally occurringtexts such as newspaper accounts, popularliterature, or policy documents. APPROACHES TO QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS There are as many different ways to ana- lyze qualitative data as there are means tocollect it. Generally, however, all forms ofanalysis involve organizing the data accord-ing to specific criteria, reducing it to amore manageable form, displaying it in aform to aid analysis, and interpreting it. Analyzing reams of written text is as complex and time-consuming as analyzingquantitative data\u2014if not more so. Goodqualitative analysis is part art and part sci-ence, and hundreds of books have beenwritten on the topic. This chapter is notintended to substitute for these texts or to\"teach\" qualitative data analysis. Rather it isCHAPTER THIRTEEN Analyzing Qualitative Data Topics covered in this chapter: Approaches to qualitative analysis Data codingUsing a computer for coding and categorizingData reduction and data displaysEnsuring rigor in qualitative research204 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER THIRTEENz coding and interpretation in greater depth. Data immersion is the process of read- ing and rereading each set of notes or tran-scripts until you are intimately familiar withthe content. Early readings of the data canhelp guide future data collection. Are yougetting the kinds of data that youexpected? Does your reading suggest newavenues of inquiry? Repeated readings arealso the first step toward identifying emerg-ing themes, possible relationships amongthemes or categories, and unusual or con-tradictory responses. Data coding means attaching labels or codes to different segments of text that are associated with different issues. Codingis a way to help separate information intocategories or themes so that informationfrom different sources can be easily sortedand compared. With key themes coded inthis way, you can later search and retrieveinteresting segments and look at them asseparate files. Data can either be coded byhand (by writing codes into the margins ofthe text) or with the aid of a computer.Computers have helped revolutionizequalitative data analysis by greatly easingthe task of sorting text segments by the-matic code. Data display is defined as an organ- ized assembly of information that allowsconclusions to be drawn and actions to betaken. 1Most frequently qualitative data is displayed as narrative text, which tends tooverload people's information-processingcapabilities. Matrices, graphs, networks,and charts can present information inmore compact form that make the datamore accessible. Many of these techniquesare presented later in this chapter. Data reduction involves selecting, focusing, simplifying, abstracting, andtransforming the \"raw\" data of field notesor transcriptions into typed summariesorganized around themes or patterns basedon the original objectives of the research.Data reduction continues until the finalreport is written. Interpretation/conclusion drawing refers to the process of deciding whatthings mean, noting themes, regularities,patterns, and explanations. The researchermay begin to draw conclusions in draftform throughout the entire data collectionFIGURE 13.1 THE PROCESS OF QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS Reading InterpretingCoding Reducing DisplayingIn the field In the field (From Miles & Huberman, 19941and Ulin, et.al, 2002.2)A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 205exercise, but eventually these become more explicit and firm at the point whenthe \"final report\" is written. Conclusionsmust also be verified as analysis proceeds.As researchers try to explain what the datamean, they should continually examinetheir explanations for plausibility and valid-ity\u2014do their explanations make sensewithin the context of the study? It is oftenpossible to test the validity of conclusionsby presenting preliminary findings andinterpretations back to project stakeholdersand/or members of the population beingresearched. Researchers can then incorpo-rate this feedback into the final version oftheir written report.DATA CODING Although most qualitative research usessome process of coding to organize data,there are no standard rules about how todo so. As Ulin and colleagues observe: Researchers differ on how to derive codes, when to start and stop coding, andthe level of detail they want. Someresearchers develop codes that closely matchthe ideas or language found in the textualdata. They want to avoid imposing wordsor concepts that might prevent them fromseeing their data in a new way. Others bor-row terms from the social science literaturethat represent more abstract conceptsANALYZING QUALITATIVE DATAz Transcribe and organize the information into files\u2014one for each interview, focus group, or observation session. Immerse yourself in the data. Get a sense of the whole. Read through all of the transcripts several times. Perhaps jot down some ideas as they come to mind. Pick one transcript or document\u2014the most interesting, the shortest, the one on the top of the pile. Go through it, ask- ing yourself: What is this about? Read both for content and to identify emergent themes and insights into underlyingmeaning. Write thoughts in the margin or in your field notebook. When you have completed this task for several documents, make a list of all the topics you encountered. Follow the trail of issues, intuitions, and ideas that arise from reading the data. Cluster together similar topics. Form these topicsinto columns that might be arrayed as major topics, unique topics, and leftovers. 1. Develop preliminary coding categories. Start by listing all the issues, perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, and other important aspects identified during the preceding stage. Once the principal coding categories have been identified, review the list and see if any categories overlap or are repeated. Then assign a codeand, if so desired, code by color. 2. Now take this list and go back to your data. Write the codes next to the appropriate segments of the text. Try out this preliminary organizing scheme on several transcripts to see whether new categories and codes emerge. 3. Make a final decision on the abbreviation for each category and alphabetize these codes. 4. In the margin of each transcript, write the code assigned to each category found in the text (or use a com- puter to assign codes to particular segments of text). 5. Assemble the data belonging to each category in one place and perform a preliminary analysis.6. Look for the most important relationships between the data. Also look for relationships between different analysis categories. In other words, look for the most important relationships between people, events, ideas, perceptions, behavior patterns, and other aspects of the data. 7. Discovering what is significant should lead to a search for similarities and differences. Look for the most common and recurrent norms and patterns in behavior, ideas, perceptions, attitudes, and expressions.Also look for the most salient differences. 8. Consider using one or more data display techniques to help make sense of your data\u2014for example, matrices, decision trees, or flow charts. (Adapted from Creswell,1994 3and Shrader and Sagot, 2000.4)BOX 13.1 WHERE TO START: AN APPROACH TO QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS206 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER THIRTEENz The following is an example of data coding and organization using the software OpenCode developed by Ume\u00e5 University, Sweden. OpenCode allows the researcher to apply an unlimited number of codes to specific pieces of text, which may then be reorganized according to specific themes, or sets of codes. In this example, we used two interviews from Nicaraguan women, Ana Cristina and Maria, bo th of whom had been abused by their former husbands. In the interviews, both women described the characteristics of the violence, its effe ct on them and their families, different strategies they had used for coping with the violence, different sources of family and social support (or lack thereof), and finally how they made the decision to separate from their abusive partners. BOX 13.2 AN EXAMPLE OF DATA CODING USING OPENCODE Each interview was coded separately, and more than 100 different codes were generated at this stage. Some of the codes were rel ated to specific language or feelings that the respondents used (e.g., \"bitterness,\" \"sadness\") whereas others were thematic categori es such as \"effects on children\" or \"disengagement.\" After both interviews were coded, we organized the data into common themes, using the program' s \"search\" option. The second figure shows a piece of text where Ana Cristina describes how her children were affected by her husband's violence, as well as how their suffering influenced her own views towards the marriage. It appeared that the desire to protect her children was a si gnificant factor in Ana Cristina's decision to leave her husband. To see whether similar themes might also be relevant for Maria, we conducted a se arch of both interviews using the criteria \"effect_on_children\" AND \"separation.\" The text that appears in the next figure shows that both women felt that their children's suffering was a major influence on th eir decision to leave. In further analysis, we looked for commonalities and differences in other types of motivations mentioned for leaving (for examp le, the existence or lack of family support, economic resources, self-esteem) The same results could certainly have been accomplished by cutting and pasting text, but the use of the computer software was particularly useful for looking at a single piece of text from different perspectives, and in different combina- tions of codes. A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 207relationships among codes. Because this approach allows conceptual categories toemerge from the text rather than from themind of the researcher, it is especially wellsuited for theory building. 5 For more applied research projects, it is possible to code segments using cate-gories that correspond to well-recognizedphenomena or concepts. For example,when coding an interview from a womanliving with abuse, it is easy to imaginecodes emerging that correspond to differ-ent feelings, coping strategies, responsesto abuse, and reactions of others. Evenwhen working with more categoricalANALYZING QUALITATIVE DATA important to their field. These have theadvantage of being understood by a wideraudience. Whether borrowed or emergent,labels allow you to assemble under oneconcept many seemingly disparate pieces oftext and to search for connections. 2 In part, these different approaches to coding evolve from the theoretical under-pinnings of different types of qualitativeresearch. Grounded theory , an approach to qualitative research pioneered in thelate 1960s by Glaser and Straus, empha-sizes coding that sticks close to the textand then constructs increasingly abstractcategories and domains by analyzing thez BOX 13.2 AN EXAMPLE OF DATA CODING USING OPENCODE Using computer software (OpenCode) to organize text by common themes.208 Researching Violence Against Womenlabels, one's coding system will necessar- ily evolve over time as new insights andways to organize the data emerge. Figure 13.1 describes one approach to tackling qualitative analysis, following theconceptual approach outlined by Milesand Huberman and Ulin and colleagues.It begins with data immersion andincludes developing and applying morecategorical labels to segments of text. Forvery simple projects, it may be possibleto organize segments of text according tothe various research questions of interestand then begin to look for similarities,differences, themes, and relationships. Byits very nature, one's approach to qualita-tive analysis will vary based on complex-ity of the research question being askedand the resources and time available foranalysis.CHAPTER THIRTEENz Forms of Violence Physical Psychological Sexual EconomicMotivating Factors Internal Fear that her daughter will be taken away.

Here is wherecomputers can come in handy. Whenusing a computer for text-based analysis,the investigator still must \"code\" the data\u2014that is associate a code word with piecesof the text that represent a certain theme.But the computer allows the investigator tosearch and organize large volumes of dataaccording to predefined codes and combi-nations of codes. Many computer programs are available for use in coding and analyzing data, andall are different. Examples of some of themore common programs used for qualita-tive data analysis include HyperQual,NUDIST, Ethnograph, and QUALPRO.Generally these programs allow the investi-gator to attach one or more codes to differ-ent text segments. Data can then be sortedand resorted according to different themesand coding categories. A number of popu-lar qualitative software programs are avail-able commercially through Scolari Softwareat: http://12.22.103.11/. We especially recommend considering one of three free \"share-ware\" programsthat have been explicitly developed toassist researchers in the field of publichealth. The first, known as OpenCode, is aversatile, but highly accessible, programthat can be downloaded from the web siteof Ume\u00e5 University, Sweden, athttp://www.umu.se/phmed/epidemi/forskning/open_code.html. The second is CDCEZ Text, a simple program designed by theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) to facilitate analysis of open-endedresponses to structured questionnaires.CDC has also developed a third program,called AnSWR, which is designed for morecomplex qualitative projects. Both CDCprograms can be downloaded fromhttp://www.cdc.gov/hiv/software. There are also potential drawbacks to using computers, and the time and cost of using computers must be weighed against the potential benefits. For exam-ple, it is time-consuming to set up andcode data by computer and the investiga-tor must invest time, money, and energyinto acquiring and learning a new software program. Clearly, for manysmall projects, it is best to conduct theanalysis manually using highlighters and colored pens. DATA REDUCTION AND DATA DISPLAYS* Data reduction means distilling the infor- mation to make visible the most essentialconcepts and relationships. The reductionprocess usually begins after all the datahave been collected, coded, and theresearcher is thoroughly familiar with thematerial. The goal of data reduction is to getthe bigger picture from the data and beginto discern distinctions between primary andsecondary themes. 2While coding helps break down the data into smaller parts, datareduction is the process of abstracting backout from the particular to the conceptual. To get a wider perspective on the data, it is often helpful to use one ormore visual devices known as data dis-plays. Data display is a nonnarrative wayof analyzing and presenting qualitativedata. The analysis may be intra-case (that is, analysis of the data related to a single respondent) or inter-case (comparativeanalysis of the data from two or morerespondents). As with any other aspect of qualitative analysis, it is necessary todocument the processes followed, theANALYZING QUALITATIVE DATAz * Information in this section is reprinted with permission from Shrader and Sagot, 2000.4210 Researching Violence Against Womenconclusions generated, and the way in which the analysis influenced the subse-quent stages of the fieldwork. Matrices, decision trees, and tax- onomies are examples of different datadisplay tools that can be useful for aidinganalysis as well as in presenting results.Following is a presentation of these threemethods using examples from the \"RutaCr\u00edtica\" study, a multi-country study quali-tative study on women's responses to vio-lence performed by the Pan AmericanHealth Organization in ten Latin Americancountries. (See Box 5.4 for a descriptionof the study.) Keep in mind that it is notnecessary to display data in every wayCHAPTER THIRTEENz FIGURE 13.2 SAMPLE DECISION TREE: MAKING THE DECISION TO SEEK HELP Is my life in danger?

Matrices A matrix is a table that displays the intersec-tion of two or more concepts. It consists ofcells, which may be filled with summarytext, graphs, or other explanatory informa-tion. The matrix is very useful for summariz-ing a great deal of information or presentingcomparative information on a single sheet. Table 13.1, for example, represents a datamatrix used to summarize the factors thatemerged as critical to either motivating awoman affected by violence to seek outsidehelp or inhibiting her from seeking help.This particular matrix is taken from thePanama country report of the Ruta Cr\u00edticastudy. It illustrates the complexity and detailthat can be included in a single table. Decision trees A decision tree is a graphic representationthat depicts the sequence of decisions thatleads to an action. In general, the decisionsare formulated as a dichotomous question,i.e., one that is answered with \"yes\" or\"no.\" Arrows indicate the consequent ques-tion, depending on the answer given. Asimple decision tree shows the sequenceof decisions made by a person; a complexdecision tree shows the combined deci-sions of one or more persons. Figure 13.2 illustrates a simple decision tree derived from Ecuador data of PAHO'sRuta Cr\u00edtica study. The figure illustratesthe thinking and decisions characteristicof an abused woman's process of decid-ing whether to seek outside help for theviolence. Flow charts Also known as an explanatory network,flow charts show the relationship betweentwo or more elements, emphasizing direc-tionality, causality, or temporary associa-tion. Geometric figures and arrows usuallyare used to indicate temporary or causalrelationships between the concepts. Figure13.3 presents a sample flow chart showingthe path followed by a woman who seeksto escape from a violent relationship. Thechart includes an analysis of the timeelapsed between one violent incident andthe next one, as well as the time it takes tocarry out the trial. It reveals that thisrespondent was the victim of three seriousincidents of violence before finally obtain-ing the desired result\u2014for him to stopdrinking and beating her. Taxonomies A taxonomy attempts to summarize con-cepts in a hierarchy that goes from thegreatest level of generalization to the great-est level of specificity. Taxonomies are use-ful for showing the relationship betweenmany separate concepts, joining conceptsthat share one or more characteristics incumulative stages. Figure 13.4 presents an example of a taxonomy developed by the U.S. Centersfor Disease Control to describe severalforms of interpersonal violence. ENSURING RIGOR IN QUALITATIVE RESEARCH Ensuring rigor, while equally important in qualitative as in quantitative research, isaddressed somewhat differently by the twotraditions. Lincoln and Guba suggest thatthe four issues that must be addressed inany systematic enquiry into humans andhuman behavior are truth value, applica-bility, consistency, and neutrality. 6(See Table 13.2.) Whereas quantitative researchtends to use such criteria as external andinternal validity, reliability, and objectivityto assess whether research has been car-ried out and interpreted using acceptedscientific standards of rigor, qualitativeresearch tends to assess the trustworthi-ness of research in terms of credibility,ANALYZING QUALITATIVE DATAz212 Researching Violence Against Womentransferability, dependability, and con- firmability. The naturalistic research tradi-tion does not assume that there is a singletruth that may be revealed by inquiry.Instead it affirms that many truths mayexist at the same time, and these may bediscovered by research, and at the sametime modified by the research endeavoritself. Different standards are thereforeneeded to assess the rigor of qualitativeresearch. Table 13.2 presents a comparisonof how different aspects of rigor areaddressed in the different traditions. Lincoln and Guba also propose alterna- tive criteria and techniques for establish-ing trustworthiness within a naturalisticCHAPTER THIRTEENz FIGURE 13.3 SAMPLE FLOW CHART: ITINERARY OF A WOMAN LIVING WITH VIOLENCE Violent incident Justice of the Peace (3 times) Violent incident Health unit (nurse) Public prosecutor Family court Temporary asylum Hearing/sentencing Violent incident Family court3-4 weeks 3 weeks Escorting Financial support Psychological support 3 weeks without beating her or drinkingFrom data presented in the final report of the critical path study in El Salvador. 5 months between serious violent incidents5 months between serious violent incidents Results (From Shrader & Sagot, 2000.4)A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 213framework. In place of validity, credibility is suggested as a criterion for determiningthe truth value of a qualitative study.According to Sandelowski, A qualitative study is credible when it presents such faithful descriptions or inter-pretations of a human experience that thepeople having that experience would imme-diately recognize it from those descriptionsor interpretations as their own. A study isalso credible when other people (otherresearchers or readers) can recognize theexperience when confronted with it afterhaving only read about it in a study. 8 There are a variety of techniques that may enhance credibility of a study. For example: Prolonged engagement in the field. The researcher should be involved in acommunity or study site long enough to bethoroughly oriented to the cultural and his-torical context, and to be able to detectand take into account possible distortionsdue to misinformation or his or her ownsubjective responses to the data. Triangulation. The use of multiple sources, methods, and investigators toexplore the same topic can increase credi-bility. For example, if the goal of a study isto assess the quality of care given to sur-vivors of abuse in a community clinic, itmight be useful to compare the views ofhealth care providers with women whohave used the services. The use of multiplesources might reveal important differences,not only as to the overall level of client sat-isfaction, but also in the way that clientsand providers define quality of care. A mixof methods, for example, combining anANALYZING QUALITATIVE DATAz FIGURE 13.4 SAMPLE TAXONOMY: PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVES TOWARD VIOLENCE This taxonomy was adapted from a typology used by Rosenberg et al. of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Atlanta, Georgia. (Cited in Shrader and Sagot, 2000.4)Intentional injuries Interpersonal Researching Violence Against Womenexit survey of clients with in-depth inter- views, focus groups, or reviews of medicalcharts, might provide additional insight.Having two different researchers codeinterview transcripts and compare resultsafterwards is another form of triangulationthat may increase the credibility of thefindings. Negative case analysis. This refers to seeking cases actively that appear to beexceptions to the general pattern, as a wayof testing and refining hypotheses. Themethod relies on the analysis of \"outliers\"to improve the credibility of the findings. Member checking. Member checking refers to the process by which data, conclu-sions, and interpretations are presented tomembers of the groups from which thedata were collected. It is a powerful tech-nique for establishing credibility. Memberchecking may be performed throughout theresearch process, through both formal andinformal sessions. It allows stakeholders theopportunity to react to the data and to cor-rect errors in the collection and interpreta-tion of data. Most importantly, it helps toestablish the meaningfulness of the findingsand interpretations. In a review of CentralAmerican health programs addressing gen-der-based violence, the preliminary resultswere presented to representatives from thedifferent countries that participated in theoriginal focus group discussions. The pur-pose of the session was to correct factualerrors, as well as to hear reactions to theoverall conclusions of the study. Not onlydid the discussion strengthen the interpreta-tion of the findings, but it also createdownership of the findings among the partic-ipants. The study results were disseminatedand discussed widely among the programs,and many of the recommendations wereimplemented. Qualitative research refers to the trans- ferability of findings instead of externalvalidity or generalizability. In surveyresearch, the ability to generalize findingsto a broader population depends largelyon how representative the sample is withregard to demographic characteristics andother key variables. Since qualitativeresearch relies on purposive rather thanrandom sampling, there is no expectationthat findings from one small group ofstudy participants can be statistically repre-sentative of a larger population. Theorygenerated from qualitative research maywell be generalizable to a broader popula-tion. As Dahlgren and colleagues argue,qualitative researchers aim for analyticalgeneralizations, taking into account that, Each subject has been selected to con- tribute to the theory that is being developed,and the knowledge gained from this theoryshould fit all scenarios that may be identi-fied in a larger population. Hence the theoryis applicable also beyond the study sample toall similar situations, questions and prob-lems, regardless of demographic characteris-tics. In this way, qualitative researchers areCHAPTER THIRTEENz Aspect Truth value ApplicabilityConsistency NeutralityQualitative criteria Credibility TransferabilityDependability ConfirmabilityQuantitative criteria Internal validity External validityReliability ObjectivityQuestion asked Have we reallymeasured whatwe set out to measure? How applicable are our results toother subjects andother contexts? Would our find- ings be repeatedif our researchwere replicated in the same context with the samesubjects? To what extent are our findings affected bypersonal interests and biases?TABLE 13.2 CRITERIA ASSESSING THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF RESEARCH FINDINGS ACCORDING TO QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE RESEARCH TRADITIONS (From Dalgren, et al, 2003.7)A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 215no less able to generalize beyond their sam- ple than are epidemiologists.7 In quantitative research, consistency or reliability of results is a key aspect of trust-worthiness. If another researcher con-ducted the same study using the same orsimilar methods on the same or similar population, would the same results be obtained? Reliability is enhanced in quanti-tative research by such measures as accu-rate instruments and equipment,well-trained fieldworkers, and uniform datacollection procedures. In contrast, qualita-tive research is based on the premise thatresearchers and study participants are inti-mately related, and their interactioninevitably shapes the research process.Therefore, there is no pretense that thesame results could be achieved with differ-ent researchers and participants. Accordingly, qualitative research is assessed by its dependability, or the degreeto which the researcher can describe andaccount for the way data were collected,interpreted, and how changing conditionswere addressed throughout the process.The research process may be documentedby means of an audit trail , including field notes, raw data (such as transcripts anddiagrams) and process notes (procedures,designs, and strategies.) An audit trailshould allow another to follow the \"deci-sion trail\" used by the researcher. 6 Finally, quantitative and qualitative tra- ditions diverge on the issue of neutrality.Quantitative researchers aspire to main-tain an objective attitude during theresearch process, and to avoid lettingtheir feelings or subjective views influ-ence the data collection or statisticalanalysis. Qualitative researchers arguethat subjectivity is unavoidable, and thatthe interaction between participants andresearchers actually enriches qualitativeresearch. The neutrality of the data ratherthan that of the researcher is sought,using the criteria of confirmability. Audittrails also help establish confirmability. Ifthe research can be confirmed the auditorshould be able to find conclusionsgrounded in the data. 6 1. Miles M, Huberman AM. Qualitative Data Analysis: An Expanded Sourcebook. 2nd ed.

Fortunately this approach is being supplanted by a newethic of research in whichresearchers and advocates joinforces to ensure that researchfindings are used for socialchange. This section includesseveral examples of how dif-ferent research teams haveused their findings strategi-cally to change laws, influ-ence policy, design serviceprograms, and place the issueof violence against women onthe public agenda. The first step is to make a list of differ- ent constituent groups and individuals thatshould be made aware of the researchfindings. The study's advisory group willbe particularly helpful in this regard. Next strategize about the different meansand venues available for reaching theseR esearch is a means to an end. A researcher's task is only complete once thefindings from a research project are putinto the hands of the individuals andorganizations positioned to use them. Forviolence research, this generally includespolicy makers, legislators, advocacygroups, the academic community, serviceproviders, and the respondents themselves. This chapter briefly highlights some cre- ative ways that different research teamshave approached these challenges. OUTREACH TO KEY CONSTITUENCIES Research can either be a positive force for change or it can sit on a shelf, advancingonly the career paths of individual investi-gators. The field of international violenceresearch is filled with examples of both. In the past, it was not uncommon for women's groups and others working onviolence to be totally unaware that researchon violence had been conducted in theircountry, often by foreign investigators orCHAPTER FOURTEEN From Research to Action Topics covered in this chapter: Outreach to key constituencies Matching your message to your audienceSharing findings with the communityReaching beyond your borders Example of a Stakeholder List Ministry of Health Office of Women's Affairs Members of Parliament, especially Women's Commissions Local women's groups/net- works Local rape crisis center Local journalists School of Public Health Department of Justice Local radio\u2014call-in show School of Social Work Catholic diocese Municipal authorities218 Researching Violence Against WomenCHAPTER FOURTEENo audiences. Also recognize that the type of message and style of presentation that willbe persuasive to different audiences willlikely vary. (See Matching Your Message toYour Audience, below.) Let's Create Love and Peace in Intimate Relationships : National dissemination of research findingsin Thailand It may be possible to reach a number of tar- get groups at once by holding a stakeholdermeeting or a symposium at which the resultsare presented and discussed. Members ofthe Thai research team of the WHO multi-country study, for example, worked with theTask Force to End Violence Against Womenand the Coalition for Women's Advancementto organize a month-long program of activi-ties on violence against women in Thailand.The month was kicked off with a press con-ference to present the Thai findings from theWHO multi-country study and to highlightcurrent activities of organizations working toeliminate violence and gender discriminationin Thailand.To unify the campaign and project a posi- tive image, the researchers developed aneye-catching logo and printed 20,000 stickerswith the slogan \"Let's create love and peacein intimate relationships.\" In addition, theteam distributed over 2,000 fact sheets and posters about violence against women (seeFigure 14.1). The key activity of the monthwas a two-day national seminar, held at theNational Women's Council in Bangkok, andattended by more than 400 people. On thefirst day, the research team made an officialpresentation of the research and its findings.On the second day, six women with directexperiences of violence shared their ownstories of pain and survival followed by pre-sentations by other researchers and well-known experts in the field. Outside theseminar room, various concerned organiza-tions set up exhibit booths to advertise theirorganizations and services. The research team evaluated the impact of the activities throughout the ensuing months,including tracking coverage of the findings inthe media. Overall, the research findings werepresented at events in more than 20 provinces.Significantly, findings on the prevalence offorced sex in marriage also proved critical toa legislative campaign to amend Article 276of Thailand's criminal code that gave immu-nity to men who rape their wives. Silence for the Sake of Harmony: Engaging local leaders in the dis-semination of results in Indonesia The SEHATI Research Project, a partner- ship between Gadjah Mada University andRifka Annisa Women's Crisis Center (bothin Indonesia), Ume\u00e5 University in Sweden,and PATH, carried out a prevalence studyin Central Java that showed that one in tenwomen had been physically abused by anintimate partner. To reach a wider audi-ence, researchers asked the Queen of theProvince of Yogyakarta in Central Java tohost the launch of their report. The launchwas attended by local authorities, media, FIGURE 14.1 LET'S CREATE LOVE AND PEACE IN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS WAS THE MESSAGE TIED TO THE DISSEMINATION OF STUDY RESULTS IN THAILANDA Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 219and religious and community leaders. The Queen also wrote a preface to the vio-lence report, lending legitimacy to thisonce taboo area of research. A similar ses-sion was held in Jakarta, the capital ofIndonesia, hosted by the Minister ofHealth and the Minister of Women'sEmpowerment, both of whom also wroteprefaces for the report (Figure 14.2). MATCHING YOUR MESSAGE TO YOURAUDIENCE A key to achieving impact is to tailor your message to the various audiences that youseek to influence. The language, style, andmessage that may be persuasive to onegroup may be wholly unconvincing\u2014orunintelligible\u2014to another. The way thedata are presented also should vary. Fortechnical, academic, or policy audiences, itis important to follow scientific conventionand to include all required backgroundinformation so that others can evaluate thefindings, such as sample size, measures ofsignificance, and margins of error. Forother audiences, this information is merelyconfusing and detracts from the message. Candies in Hell: Using research for social change in Nicaragua A good example of how the same informa- tion can be adapted to different audiencescomes from the Nicaraguan Network ofWomen Against Violence. The Networkcollaborated with researchers from theUniversity of Nicaragua in Le\u00f3n andSweden's Ume\u00e5 University to conduct in-depth interviews of battered women and ahousehold survey on the rate of domesticviolence among women in Le\u00f3n.

The samepresentations were later repeated for anational audience at the public healthCHAPTER FOURTEENo FIGURE 14.3 PRESENTING RESEARCH RESULTS IN DIFFERENT WAYS FOR DIVERSE AUDIENCES IN NICARAGUA (From Ellsberg et al, 19972and Ellsberg et al, 1999.3) A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 221Several activities were also undertaken to reach legislators and to use the resultsof the study to push for new domestic vio-lence legislation. The results were includedin the Preamble of the Draft Penal CodeReforms for the Prevention and Sanction of Family Violence, which was drafted andpresented to the National Assembly by theNational Network of Women AgainstViolence. But more significantly, the find-ings were translated into simple languageand incorporated into a national petitioncampaign asking legislators to approve thedomestic violence bill pending before theNational Assembly. Network members held\"petition-signing parties\" and reproducedthe petition as a full-page, tear-out ad inthe national newspaper. In a few months,more than 16,000 signatures were obtainedand presented in great packages to parlia-mentarians. They were so overwhelmed bythe public pressure, especially since it wasan election year, that they voted unani-mously to pass the law (Figure 14.4). SHARING FINDINGS WITH THE COMMUNITY One step often overlooked in research is the process of communicating findingsback to the community. Traditionallyresearch has been an \"extrac-tive\" process whereby resultsand insights derived from theresearch seldom make theirway back to the originalrespondents. In recent years,there has been a move toward\"giving something back\" to thecommunity in addition to shar-ing the results of research withpolicy makers, opinion leaders,and front-line providers. As the quote fromthe respondent in Papua New Guineamakes clear, community members appreci-ate the opportunity to see what comes ofthe time they invest with researchers.FROM RESEARCH TO ACTION school in Managua. Here, the emphasis wason the health consequences of abuse andthe potential role of health workers inresponding to the problem. These meetings helped launch several initiatives, including the production of aspecialized manual for health workers onresponding to abuse and the developmentof educational material on violence forincorporation into medical school andnursing curricula. To reach community members, espe- cially women, the Network published thefindings in the form of a popular bookletentitled Ya No Quiero Confites en el Infierno (I No Longer Want Candies in Hell). The booklet told the story of AnaCristina, one of the informants in the study,and the booklet's margins included easy-to-understand statistics drawn from the survey. The booklet included basic infor-mation about where women could get help as well as questions to guide groupdiscussions (see Figure 14.3). The prevalence data were also men- tioned in a pocket-sized card urging bat-tered women to get help, under the title\"You are not alone: recent studies haveshown that one out of every two womenhas been beaten by her husband, and oneout of every four is beaten each year.\"o \"I would like to ask if you find something to help us or to help us know more, can you please come again? Do not take our stories without coming back and telling us what you have learned.\" Woman from Papua NewGuinea222 Researching Violence Against WomenSometimes this process of sharing can take the form of directly communicatingthe findings back to the community viaworkshops or focus groups. Sharing pre-liminary results with community memberscan be an excellent way to test the validityof findings\u2014do they ring true to thosewho participated in the research?Respondents may also be able to offerinsights that are helpful in interpreting sur-prising or unexpected findings. Community Theater: Disseminating research findings in Liberia, Uganda, and Kenya Investigators have also used a variety of innovative techniques to communicate theessence of research findings back to low-lit-eracy populations. In Liberia, for example,researchers studying sexual coercion duringwar translated their findings into dramavignettes to communicate their results backto rural women. Based on survey findings,the researchers derived a profile that repre-sented the average experiences of thewomen surveyed. Local health promotersthen worked with researchers to develop astoryline that reflected the experiences ofthe majority of women in the survey. Thehealth promoters acted out the experiencesthat women discussed in the survey andthen the community discussed the \"results.\" 4 Similar techniques were used in Uganda bythe organizations CEDOVIP and RaisingVoices (See Figure 14.5). In Kenya, theater was used to communi- cate findings of a study carried out by theKenya Adolescent Reproductive HealthCHAPTER FOURTEENo FIGURE 14.4 PETITION TO THE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, CITING THE LE\u00d3N RESEARCH AND ASKING FOR A NEW DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAW TO BE PASSED These letters were distributed in community meetings, parties, and through the newspapers.

The project was launched to bring reproductive health education andsupport to communities in Vihiga andBusia districts. Dozens of parents, teachers,religious and political leaders, health clinicstaff, and hundreds of young people, cho-sen for their capacity to speak candidly totheir peers, were recruited by KARHP toreach out with information on sexual vio-lence, sexually transmitted diseases, andother reproductive health issues. Like most development programs, KARHP used baseline and diagnostic stud-ies to evaluate its effect on the communi-ties it serves. But the question was how tocommunicate those findings to the relativestakeholders\u2014people and organizations ina position to interpret, even improve onhow such information relates to our work.Using a new dissemination methodology,KARHP found two innovative ways: 1.

The team then selected two local youth theatre groups\u2014 Visions 3000 based in Kakamega and Mwangaza in MambaleFROM RESEARCH TO ACTIONo FIGURE 14.5 UGANDAN COMMUNITY THEATER GROUP PERFORMS A PLAY ON THE LINK BETWEEN HIV AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN A KAMPALA MARKET Dancers and drummers opening a street theater performance inKampala, Uganda.

To prepare, theactors were provided with a presentationof the major findings, general informa-tion on adolescent reproductive health,and tips on communication skills. A the-ater consultant worked with both groupsto develop \"storylines\" for skits thatrequired audience participation. Both the skits and the summary report were then presented in three locations inwestern Kenya to an audience thatincluded government staff, religious lead-ers, village elders, local groups, and com-munity members. Not only was theinformation shared with the community,but the researchers had an opportunity tovet their findings and ask the community ifthe skits represented their communities.These research dissemination sessionshelped the community to articulate theirsituation and own the problems. Then,with everyone sharing a joint understand-ing of the situation, the community wasactively engaged in designing interventionsto respond to the challenges that youngpeople face today. 5 Reaching communities through traditional art: The Jijenge! mural campaign against violence in Tanzania 6, 7 In a similar effort, staff members at Jijenge!, a women's health center in Mwanza,Tanzania, took great pains to convey backto the community the results of its needsassessment on domestic violence. (See Box5.2 for a description of the participatorystudy.) This was done through a workshopwith the community volunteers and aseries of community street meetings. Aspart of its multifaceted media campaignagainst violence, Jijenge! also appropriatedthe folk-art tradition of mural painting as ameans to communicate important messagesabout family violence and gender issues. Aseries of bright and colorful murals wasdesigned and painted on small walls out-side kiosks, shops, and buildings all overMwanza municipality. The images and sim-ple yet controversial messages wereintended to stimulate dialogue. Two pri-mary characters\u2014a woman and man intheir early to mid-30s\u2014were created andused in most of the murals. These charac-ters are shown in conversation with eachother and the audience (Figure 14.6). Onemural, for example, shows the womanwith her arm around her husband and thehusband confidently stating, \"I don't beatmy wife, we talk about our problemsinstead.\" A rights statement such as\"Women have a right not to be beaten!\"appears in each mural to relate practicallife choices to the broader framework ofwomen's rights. The murals address manyissues concerning violence against women,including emotional well-being, solidarityamong women, and causal factors of CHAPTER FOURTEENo CEDOVIP activists carry out informal discussions with men under a mural painting on domestic violence in Kampala, Uganda.

Similar techniques are nowused successfully by the Ugandan organi-zations CEDOVIP and Raising Voices,which grew out of the Jijenge! experiencein Tanzania. A disaster that men can prevent: A multimedia campaign targetingNicaraguan men In other cases, research is used explicitly as part of a communication for socialchange strategy. For example, findingsfrom the study on men's violence inNicaragua (see Box 5.6) were incorporatedinto a mass media campaign using televi-sion and radio commercials, bumper stick-ers, T-shirts, community workshops, andbillboards. The messages targeted men,and referring to Hurricane Mitch that hadrecently devastated the region, suggestedthat \"Violence against women is one disas-ter that we men can prevent\" (Figure 14.7). Matlakala's Story: Communication for social change in South Africa Another example of how effective researchcan be in social change efforts is provided by Soul City in South Africa. The Soul CityInstitute for Health and DevelopmentCommunication produces a prime time tel-evision drama, a radio drama in nine lan-guages, and full-color information bookletsto promote social change around a varietyof health and social issues. Soul City'sfourth series focused on gender-based vio-lence, including domestic violence andsexual harassment. In order to develop thestoryline about a woman named Matlakala,formative research was carried out withaudience members and experts in the fieldof gender-based violence. The story alsoincorporated findings from a survey onviolence recently carried out in threeprovinces by the South African MedicalResearch Council. 8Partnerships were estab- lished between Soul City and organizationsactive in the field, such as the NationalNetwork on Violence Against Women, acoalition of 1,500 activists and communica-tion organizations from rural and urbanareas. These partnerships aimed to ensurethat the messages developed conveyedappropriate and accurate information onFROM RESEARCH TO ACTIONo FIGURE 14.6. MURALS PAINTED ON COMMUNITY WALLS IN TANZANIA AND UGANDA TO ENCOURAGE COMMUNITY DISCUSSION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 226 Researching Violence Against Womenwomen's rights, raising awareness of the topic and promoting changes in attitudes,social norms, and practices around gender-based violence to help connect audiencesto needed services, including through atoll-free helpline; to promote individualand community action; to create an envi-ronment conducive to legislative change;and to develop training materials on gen-der-based violence for various audiences. The Soul City series on violence then enlisted independent researchers to evalu-ate the program through three studies: A national survey carried out before theshow started, and nine months later,that included face-to-face interviewswith 2,000 respondents. A sentinel site study conducted severaltimes in a rural and an urban site, witha cohort sample of 500 respondents atbaseline, twice during the time that SoulCity's fourth series was on the air, andpost intervention. A national qualitative impact assessmentcomposed of 31 focus group interviewsand 30 semistructured interviews withcommunity leaders. The evaluation found an association between exposure to Soul City media andincreases in knowledge and awareness ofthe population regarding domestic vio-lence and domestic violence legislation.The results of the evaluation were pre-sented in numerous documents and peer-reviewed journals, as well as on aneasy-to-read fact sheet (Figure 14.8). 9-11 Even more importantly, the show and theresearch findings helped create a positiveCHAPTER FOURTEENo FIGURE 14.7 MEDIA CAMPAIGN FOR MEN CARRIED OUT BY PUNTOS DE ENCUENTRO FOUNDATION IN NICARAGUA BASED ON FINDINGS OF QUALITATIVE RESEARCH ON MALE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 227social environment for reforming domestic violence legislation. Elsewhere, researchers have turned to the Internet to publicize findings ofdomestic violence research and seek inputand feedback from a broader constituency.The Thai team of the WHO multi-countrystudy posted the results of their survey on a local Thai-language web page that included a \"bulletin board\" where viewers could post their own comments and ques-tions. The web page received thousands ofhits and comments during its first monthof operation.FROM RESEARCH TO ACTIONo FIGURE 14.8 COMMUNICATION MATERIALS IN ENGLISH AND ZULU AND AN EVALUATION FACT SHEET PRODUCED BY SOUL CITY IN SOUTH AFRICA 228 Researching Violence Against WomenREACHING BEYOND YOUR BORDERS In addition to local outreach, it is also important to consider reaching audiencesbeyond local borders. Given the generallack of data available on violence againstwomen, every research study is a poten-tially important addition to the globalknowledge base. Consider publishing your results in the academic literature, especially in a peer-reviewed journal indexed in one of thecomputerized services such as IndexMedicus, Psych-Lit, or POPLINE. Then,individuals who search for articles on vio-lence will be able to access your findings. Additionally, the Center for Communication Programs at Johns Hopkins University inBaltimore, Maryland, and the United NationsDevelopment Fund for Women (UNIFEM)have joined forces to produce a centraldepository for information on violenceagainst women, including documents, jour-nal articles, training materials, posters, andTV and radio programs. Materials forwardedto the Center will be entered into theCenter's online service, known as POPLINE,and will be featured on the Center's EndViolence Against Women web site(http://www.endvaw.org). Individuals cansearch for materials using key words, andcopies will be sent to developing countrypractitioners free of charge.

Finally there are two questions that explore whether the woman herselfused violence against the most recent part-ner who used violence against her, andwhether this aggression was offensive or inself-defence (904 and 905). The instrumentdoes not aim to document every abusiveaction that a woman may experience, butrather aims to assess whether the respon-dent is likely to be experiencing 'severe'and/or 'moderate' levels of abuse in herrelationship. The questions on injury con-tribute to providing a crude measure of theseverity of the violence. They should not beinterpreted as a measure of the healtheffects of violence as, in practice, the healtheffects of violence are far more wide-rang-ing than immediate injury. The questionsabout whether the respondent was everphysically violent herself toward her partnerand whether this violence was offensive orin self-defence, provide information criticalto interpreting the context of the violence. Because of the complexity of defining and measuring emotional abuse in a waythat is relevant and meaningful across cul-tures, the questions regarding emotional vio-lence should be considered as a startingpoint, rather than a comprehensive measureof all forms of emotional abuse. Researchersare encouraged to add questions referring toWHO VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN INSTRUMENT This instrument consists of two sets of ques- tions designed to capture information criticalto assessing the prevalence, frequency andseverity of different forms of violence againstwomen, perpetrated both by intimate part-ners and others. The first set of questionsfocuses on violence by intimate partners onlyand should be used in its entirety to measureviolence by intimate partners. The second setaddressing violence by others, can be addedonto the first set if violence against women isexplored in a broader context. Violence against women by intimate partners The first set of questions focuses on vio- lence perpetrated against women by theirintimate partners (questions 703 to 706, 709,801, 802, 904 and 905 in the core question-naire). These questions on partner violenceexplore aspects of controlling behaviours,emotional abuse, physical violence, and sex-ual violence (703-706) as well as physicalviolence during pregnancy (709) by currentor former intimate partners. This sectionalso has questions for women who havesuffered physical violence by an intimatepartner, that assess the degree of injury (801APPENDIX ONE The WHO Multi-country Study on Women's Healthand Domestic ViolenceAgainst Women 232 Researching Violence Against WomenAPPENDIX ONE1 locally relevant forms of abuse. Because so little is presently known about measuringemotional violence across cultures, theWHO Multi-country study does not includeemotional violence when reporting theprevalence of violence by intimate partners. Instead, the study reports lifetime and 12month prevalence of physical, sexual, andphysical or sexual violence by intimatepartners. In the WHO study, this section of the instrument is applied primarily to womenwho have had an intimate partner withwhom they have co-habitated. In countrieswhere it is common that women have inti-mate partnerships without co-habitating,the instrument can be used to capture \"dat-ing\" violence with only minor accommoda-tions in language. Violence against women by others than intimate partners The second part of the instrument includes a set of questions (questions 1001-1003 and1201 in the core questionnaire) designed toaddress other types of violence that womenhave experienced outside of the context ofan intimate partner relationship. Questions1001-1003 enable the collection of minimaldata on the prevalence of sexual abuse inchildhood and on the prevalence of physicaland sexual violence in adulthood by peopleother than intimate partners. These questionsdo not capture physical, emotional or othertypes of neglect or maltreatment in child-hood. Question 1201 offers the respondentthe opportunity to report childhood sexualabuse in a linked concealed way. This sec-tion of the instrument may be asked of allwomen, regardless of relationship status. USE OF WHO STUDY PROTOCOL AND QUESTIONNAIRE The WHO Study questionnaire, together with the protocol and other supportingmaterials such as the training manuals anddata entry system, have been developed topermit the collection of standardised data,and thus facilitate cross-cultural compar-isons. To this end, wide dissemination andutilisation of the questionnaire is encour-aged. While recognising that some adapta-tion to local conditions may be necessary,these should be minimal, in order toensure that as far as possible, comparabil-ity can be maintained. This is particularlythe case for the questions that make upthe Violence Against Women Instrument. Those using the WHO Study protocol and/or questionnaire are requested toacknowledge the WHO source documentsin all publications and/or documents thatarise from study (as detailed below). In addi-tion, WHO will make available to interestedparties all manuals, accompanying documen-tation and data entry programs developedfor use in the WHO Multi-country Study inexchange for a copy of the final, cleaneddata set, for cross-national comparison. Some researchers may wish to generate prevalence estimates comparable to theWHO Multi-country Study, but may notwant to fully replicate the study. In order toensure that the prevalence data obtained iscomparable to the WHO study, investigatorsshould, at a minimum, incorporate theWHO Violence Against WomenInstrument (either the first section on part- ner violence alone, or also the questions onexperiences of violence by others). Again,for comparison purposes, the sample shouldenable the disaggregation of data to obtainprevalence estimates for a representativesample of ever-partnered women 15-49. In addition to the WHO Violence Against Women Instrument , researchers may choose to incorporate other questionsand/or entire sections from the WHO corequestionnaire. In such cases theresearchers should acknowledge the WHOquestionnaire in the following manner: \"This study adheres to the WHO A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 233ethical guidelines for the conduct of violence against women research anduses the WHO Violence Against WomenInstrument as developed for use in theWHO Multi-country Study on Women'sHealth and Domestic Violence AgainstWomen. Additionally it incorporatesquestions/sections from the WHO studyquestionnaire (describe which ques-tions/section were used).\" For copies of the various documents mentioned above, as well as further information on the studyand on arrangements to replicate the study can beobtained from Dr Claudia Garcia-Moreno, StudyCoordinator (garciamorenoc@who.int) or from DrHenriette Jansen, Epidemiologist to the Study(jansenh@who.int).APPENDIX ONE1 WHO VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN INSTRUMENT Incorporated in the Core Questionnaire Version 10 WHO Multi-country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence Against Women 20 September 2003 Hello, my name is *.

Step 2 Ask the group \"Are all these acts of violence the same?\" \"What kinds of dif-ferences are there between them?\"\"What kinds of violence are more likelyto happen to women and girls than tomen and boys?\" What do you think arethe effects on the health of women andgirls of this kind of violence?\" If cardsare used, they can be grouped together,according to the types of violence (emo-tional, verbal, economic, sexual, orphysical), or according to which types ofviolence are suffered primarily bywomen and girls, which are mostlyexperienced by men and boys, andwhich are suffered equally by men andwomen. Step 3 Present overheads and distribute handouts on the definitions and charac-teristics of gender-based violence, wifeabuse and sexual coercion. ACTIVITY 2: MYTHS AND TRUTHS ABOUT VIOLENCE(30 MINUTES) Step 1 Place three signs up around the room with the words \"I AGREE,\" \"I DIS-AGREE,\" and \"I DON'T KNOW.\" Step 2 Read out loud the following state- ments and ask participants to move tothe sign that represents their opinionabout the statement. Ask a few partici-pants on each side to explain their opin-ion. The facilitator may ask questions tostimulate discussion, but it is not neces-sary to provide \"correct\" answers, asthese will be discussed in greater depthlater on. On a flipchart the facilitator canwrite down the number of people agree-ing and disagreeing with each statement. 1APPENDIX TWO Exercises for Sensitizing Interviewers on Violence Goal: To encourage participants to think about different kinds of actsthat can constitute violence, and torecognize that violence can be physi-cal, verbal, emotional, sexual, andeconomic. Goal: To challenge existing beliefsabout violence and to identify areasof consensus and disagreementwithin the group. A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 241Men are violent by nature. Violence is usually due to alcohol. Sometimes violence is a way of show- ing affection. Boys who witness their father's violencetowards their mothers are more likely tobe violent when they grow up. A woman should put up with violencein order to keep her family together. Some women like to be beaten. Violence against women exists in everysociety in the world. Violence is never justified. Girls who are sexually abused in child-hood are more likely to drink and usedrugs when they are older. Nobody deserves to be beaten. Violenceis always the responsibility of the per-son who uses it. ACTIVITY 3: WHAT CAUSES VIOLENCE AGAINSTWOMEN? (1 HOUR) Step 1 Place a circle or square at the center of a blackboard or large sheet of paper,with the words \"violence against women\"in the middle. Ask participants to brain-storm possible causes of violence. Thesecan be immediate causes (for example\"alcohol\" or such as \"educationalsystem,\" etc. Either write the answers onthe board or ask each participant to writethe causes on cards and place them on theboard with tape. All the problems consid-ered as \"causes of violence\" should beplaced on one side of the center circle,either above or to the side. Step 2 For each problem identified, ask the group if it is related (either as acause or a result) to any other problemalready listed. If so, draw an arrowbetween the two boxes, indicating thedirection(s) of the relationship. Step 3 After completing this side of the web, ask the group to name importanteffects or consequences of violence.These can be any kind of problem,health, economic, or social \u2014 resultingfrom violence. It is a good idea to tryto discuss effects on individual womenfirst, and then on families, communi-ties, and society as a whole next.Again, for each problem, ask thegroups to examine possible relation-ships between different problems andto draw arrows between these issues,indicating the direction(s) of the relationship. ACTIVITY 4: WHY DOESN'T SHE JUST LEAVE? (45 MINUTES) Step 1 Show the group a small bird cage and ask them to imagine that inside is awomen living with violence. The barson the cage represent the different bar-riers that women confront when tryingto overcome abuse. Ask, \"What aresome of the different reasons that keepwomen in abusive relationships?\" Writethe different answers on the flipchart. Step 2 Have participants read the story Candies in Hell in small groups ofthree to four and discuss the followingquestions:APPENDIX TWO1 Goal: To identify the issues at the levelof both an individual and society thatperpetuate violence against women,and to examine the consequences ofviolence, not only for victims, but alsofor families and communities. Goal: To understand some of the rea-sons that women stay in abusive rela-tionships and the barriers that theyface in seeking help.242 Researching Violence Against WomenIs Ana Cristina's story familiar to you? Has something like this ever happenedto any one you know? Why do you think that Ana Cristinastayed in the marriage after her husbandbegan to beat her? What do you think about the reactionsof Ana Cristina's family and the police? What do you think that the expression\"Candies in Hell\" means?\" What advice would you give AnaCristina if she were your friend? Step 3 Have participants discuss in the larger group what they have learned andsummarize their discussion. Presentoverheads on women's experiences ofviolence and the stages of violent rela-tionships. CANDIES IN HELL: THE STORY OF ANA CRISTINA Ana Cristina was married at the age of 15 to a man in his late 30's. Her husband wasa soldier and that quickly earned him therespect and approval of Ana Cristina'smother. Shortly after the marriage, hebegan to beat Ana Cristina savagely andcontinued to do so regularly throughout thesubsequent five years. She learned to listenfor him at night and be ready to escapewith the children if necessary. ... I had to sleep in other people's houses to avoid getting beaten when he came home. Iwould have to climb over the back wall withmy daughters when he arrived, and he wouldshoot at me. I escaped many times from hisbullets. I don't know why I'm still alive... ...When I didn't want to have sex with my husband he simply took me by force...When he came home drunk he would beatme, and do what he wanted with me. ThenI fought with him, but what could I doagainst a man who was stronger than me?I couldn't do anything, so I had to put upwith it and suffer......He used to tell me, \"You're an animal, an idiot, you are worthless.\" That made mefeel even more stupid. I couldn't raise myhead. I think I still have scars from this,and I have always been insecure ...I wouldthink, could it be that I really am stupid? I accepted it, because after a point ... he haddestroyed me by blows and psychologi-cally... ...When he beat me, my daughterswould get involved in the fight. Then hewould throw them around in his fury andthis hurt me, it hurt me more than when hebeat me... ...Once, when I was recovering, because he had beaten me and he had left my eyesswollen and black, my daughter came up tome and said, \"Mommy, you look like amonster\" and she began to cry... It hurt meso much. It wasn't so much the blows I had,but what really hurt me were her sobbingand the bitterness that she was feeling. ...He was so jealous, my grandmother used to say, \"If you stay with him he's goingto put blinders on you like the horses thatpull carriages.\" I couldn't look at anyoneon the street, nor have either men orwomen friends, nor greet anyone. And if aman looked at me, he would smack meright there on the street. ...My mother would say to me, \"Do you think you're the only one to live throughthis?\" She told me not to leave, and mymother-in-law also told me that I shouldput up with it, ...\" You have to maintainyour marriage, remember that you are hiswife and he is the father of your children.\" ...Once I went to the police for help, but since he was in the military they let him goright away and gave him a ride back to myhouse. That time he kicked down mydoor... ... After that, I didn't know what to do. I felt trapped, a prisoner and I couldn'tescape... ...After the blows he always came back to court me, bought me clothes and afterwardshe always said, \"forgive me, I won't do itAPPENDIX TWO1A Practical Guide for Researchers and Activists 243again,\" but then he always did the same afterwards. And then my grandmotherwould say to me \"Child, what are yougoing to do with candies in hell?\" Alternative exercise: After reading the story and discussing it ingroups, ask participants to write a letter ora poem to Ana Cristina. This is a verygood exercise for identifying stereotypicalreactions on the part of participants and for encouraging empathy for survivors of vio-lence. Following is a letter written to AnaCristina by a field worker in Peru duringher training: Ana Cristina - you have the right to live with dignity and to be happy Dear Ana Cristina,My name is Rosalia Amada. I am a social worker. I am grateful for thechance to get to know you and accom-pany you on your journey to rebuildyourself. You are a very brave woman. Iknow it must have been difficult to shareyour story and remind yourself of oldwounds that must still hurt so much. You have taken the first step, by recog- nizing the violence against you. You arelike so many women in Peru whodecided to live. Ana Cristina, you arebeautiful because you are freeing your-self daily from resignation, fear, andmanipulation. No one has the right todestroy our dreams, don't ever forget that. You are the star of your own journey to freedom.
