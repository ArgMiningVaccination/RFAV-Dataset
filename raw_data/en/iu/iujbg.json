Sections 5, 67 and 68 of this bill exempt naprapaths from provisions 10 governing homeopathic physicians, dieticians and cosmetologists, respectively. 11 Naprapaths would also be exempt from provisions governing certain other 12 professions. (NRS 630.047, 637B.080, 640A.07 0, 640B.145, 640C.100, 644A.150) 13 Section 13 of this bill creates and prescribes the membership of the 14 Naprapathic Practice Advisory Board.

Section 14 of this bill prescribes certain 17 requirements relating to the operations of the Advisory Board. Section 15 of this 18 bill requires the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, with the advice of the 19 Advisory Board, to adopt regulations governing the licensure of naprapaths, the 20 practice of naprapathy and the approval of programs of education in naprapathy. 21 Section 14 requires the Advisory Board to advise the State Board of Osteopathic 22 Medicine on the adoption of those regulations. 23 Section 63 of this bill makes it a felony for an unlicensed person to engage in 24 or hold himself or herself out to engage in the practice of naprapathy. Sections 16 25 and 63 of this bill create certain exceptions to that criminal penalty. Sections 2-4, 26 6, 7, 35 and 64 of this bill clarify that providers of wellness services and certain 27 providers of health care who are not also licensed as naprapaths are prohibited from 28 engaging in the practice of naprapathy. Section 66 of this bill provides that 29 structural integration, as conducted by massage therapists, does not include the 30 practice of naprapathy. 31 Section 17 of this bill prescribes the qualifications to obtain a license to 32 practice naprapathy, which include passing a test in the practice of naprapathy 33 prepared, caused to be prepared or designated by the State Board of Osteopathic 34 Medicine. Section 20 of this bill requires the Board to prepare, cause to be prepared 35 or designate such a test. Sections 18 and 19 of this bill prescribe the qualifications 36 and procedure to obtain a license by endorsement to practice naprapathy. Section 37 33 of this bill exempts applicants for licensure by endorsement from the standard 38 licensure procedures used by the Board.

Section 38 40 of this bill prescribes procedu res governing: (1) placing such a license on inactive 41 status; and (2) returning such a license to active status from inactive status or after 42 retiring. Section 39 of this bill prescribes the maximum fees that the Board is 43 authorized to charge to issue or renew a license to practice naprapathy. Section 22 44 of this bill requires each licensed naprapath to conspicuously display his or her 45 license and diploma from a program of education in naprapathy at each place where 46 the licensee engages in the practice of naprapathy. Section 23 of this bill requires a 47 naprapath who determines that the diagnosis or treatment of a patient is beyond the 48 scope of practice or the skill, training and competence of the naprapath to refer the 49 patient to an appropriate provider of health care. 50 Sections 25-32, 34 and 36-62 of this bill make various changes so that 51 naprapaths are regulated similarly to other professions licensed by the Board. 52 Specifically, sections 25-28 and 40 of this bill prescribe grounds for discipline 53 against a naprapath. Section 41 of this bill authorizes the Board to inspect the 54 premises where a licensed naprapath practices naprapathy to determine whether a 55 violation of provisions of law governing osteopathic medicine or naprapathy has 56 occurred. Sections 42 and 43 of this bill require the insurer of a naprapath or a 57 naprapath to r eport to the Board certain information relating to malpractice 58 litigation or sanctions against the naprapath. Section 44 of this bill requires the 59 Board to conduct an investigation upon receiving such a report of: (1) a judgment 60 rendered or award made against a naprapath regarding an action or claim for 61 malpractice; or (2) the settlement of such a claim or action.

Section 58 of this bill prescribes the procedure 68 to remove the suspension of or limitation on a license to practice naprapathy or 69 reinstate a revoked license to practice naprapathy. 70 Existing law defines the term \"p rovider of health care\" as a person who 71 practices any of certain professions related to the provision of health care. (NRS 72 629.031) Existing law imposes certain requirements upon providers of health care, 73 including requirements for billing, standards for a dvertisements and criminal 74 penalties for acquiring certain debts. (NRS 629.071, 629.076, 629.078) Section 1 of 75 this bill includes naprapaths in the definition of \"provider of health care,\" thereby 76 subjecting naprapaths to those same requirements. Section 8 of this bill requires a 77 naprapath to report misconduct by a person licensed or certified by the State Board 78 of Nursing to the Executive Director of that board. 79 Existing law establishes a privilege for confidential communications between a 80 patient and a physi cian, dentist or chiropractor or person participating in the 81 diagnosis or treatment of the patient under the direction of such a provider.

Section 76 of this bill requires a naprapath to report the 90 abuse, neglect, exploitation, isolation or abandonment of an older person or 91 vulnerable person in the same manner as other providers of health care. A 92 naprapath would also be required to report the abuse, neglect or commercial sex ual 93 exploitation of a child. (NRS 432B.220, 432C.110) Sections 65, 69-71, 73, 74 and 94 77-87 of this bill make revisions to treat naprapaths in the same manner as other 95 similar providers of health care in other certain respects. 96 THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS: Section 1.
