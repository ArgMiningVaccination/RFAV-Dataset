This week there has been enormously wide coverage in the press for one of the [ worst papers on acupuncture](http://aim.bmj.com/content/early/2017/01/03/acupmed-2016-011208.full) that I've come across. As so often, the paper showed the opposite of what its title and press release, claimed. For another stunning example of this sleight of hand, try [Acupuncturists show that acupuncture doesn't work, but conclude the opposite: journal fails](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/05/31/acupuncturists-show-that-acupuncture-doesnt-work-but-conclude-the-opposite-journal-fails/), published in the British Journal of General Practice). Presumably the wide coverage was a result of the hyped-up press release issued by the journal, BMJ Acupuncture in Medicine. That is not the British Medical Journal of course, but it is, bafflingly, published by the BMJ Press group, and if you [ subscribe to press releases](http://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/) from the real BMJ. you also get them from Acupuncture in Medicine. The BMJ group should not be mixing up press releases about real medicine with press releases about quackery. There seems to be something about quackery that's clickbait for the mainstream media. As so often, [the press release](http://www.dcscience.net/bmj-press-release-acupuncture-colic-1.pdf) was shockingly misleading: It said Acupuncture may alleviate babies' excessive crying Needling twice weekly for 2 weeks reduced crying time significantly This is totally untrue. Here's why. | | Luckily the Science Media Centre was on the case quickly: The paper made the most elementary of all statistical mistakes. It failed to make allowance for the The paper lists 24 different tests of statistical significance and focusses attention on three that happen to give a P value (just) less than 0.05, and so were declared to be \"statistically significant\". If you do enough tests, some are bound to come out \"statistically significant\" by chance. They are false postives, and the conclusions are as meaningless as \"green jelly beans cause acne\" in And that's before you even get to the problem of the weakness of the evidence provided by P values close to 0.05. There's at least a 30% chance of such values being false positives, even if it were not for the jelly bean problem, and a lot more than 30% if the hypothesis being tested is implausible. I leave it to the reader to assess the plausibility of the hypothesis that a good way to stop a baby crying is to stick needles into the poor baby. If you want to know more about P values try One of the people asked for an opinion on the paper was [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22george+lewith%22), the well-known apologist for all things quackish. [He described the work](http://www.dcscience.net/Science-Media-Centre-Roundup-acupuncture-Jan-2017.pdf) as being a \"good sized fastidious well conducted study ..... The outcome is clear\". Thus showing an ignorance of statistics that would shame an undergraduate. On the Today Programme, I was interviewed by the formidable John Humphrys, along with the mandatory member of the flat-earth society whom the BBC seems to feel obliged to invite along for \"balance\". In this case it was professional acupuncturist, Mike Cummings, who is an associate editor of the journal in which the paper appeared. Perhaps he'd read the Science media centre's assessment before he came on, because he said, quite rightly, that \"in technical terms the study is negative\" \"the primary outcome did not turn out to be statistically significant\" to which Humphrys retorted, reasonably enough, \"So it doesn't work\". Cummings' response to this was a lot of bluster about how unfair it was for NICE to expect a treatment to perform better than placebo. It was fascinating to hear Cummings admit that the press release by his own journal was simply wrong. Listen to the interview here Another obvious flaw of the study is that the nature of the control group. It is not stated very clearly but it seems that the baby was left alone with the acupuncturist for 10 minutes. A far better control would have been to have the baby cuddled by its mother, or by a nurse. That's what was used by [Olafsdottir et al (2001)](http://www.dcscience.net/Olafsdottir-2001.pdf) in a study that showed cuddling worked [just as well as another form of quackery](http://www.dcscience.net/2009/06/18/british-chiropractic-association-produces-its-plethora-of-evidence/), chiropractic, to stop babies crying. Manufactured doubt is a potent weapon of the alternative medicine industry. It's the same tactic as was used by the tobacco industry. You scrape together a few lousy papers like this one and use them to pretend that there's a controversy. For years the tobacco industry used this tactic to try to persuade people that cigarettes didn't give you cancer, and that nicotine wasn't addictive. The main stream media obligingly invite the representatives of the industry who convey to the reader/listener that there is a controversy, when there isn't. Acupuncture is no longer controversial. It just doesn't work -see [Acupuncture is a theatrical placebo: the end of a myth](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/05/30/acupuncture-is-a-theatrical-placebo-the-end-of-a-myth/). Try to imagine a pill that had been subjected to well over 3000 trials without anyone producing convincing evidence for a clinically useful effect. It would have been abandoned years ago. But by manufacturing doubt, the acupuncture industry has managed to keep its product in the news. Every paper on the subject ends with the words \"more research is needed\". No it isn't. Acupuncture is pre-scientific idea that was moribund everywhere, even in China, [until it was revived by Mao Zedong](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/05/30/acupuncture-is-a-theatrical-placebo-the-end-of-a-myth/) as part of the appalling Great Proletarian Revolution. Now it is big business in China, and 100 percent of the clinical trials that come from China are positive. if you believe them, you'll truly believe anything. Follow-up 29 January 2017 Soon after the Today programme in which we both appeared, the acupuncturist, Mike Cummings, [posted his reaction](http://blogs.bmj.com/aim/2017/01/26/acupuncture-for-infantile-colic/) to the programme. I thought it worth posting the original version in full. Its petulance and abusiveness are quite remarkable. I thank Cummings for giving publicity to the video of our appearance, and for referring to my [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Colquhoun#Missed_short_events). I leave it to the reader to judge my competence, and his, in the statistics of clinical trials. And it's odd to be described as a \"professional blogger\" when the 400+ posts on dcscience.net don't make a penny -in fact they cost me money. In contrast, he is the salaried medical director of the British Medical Acupuncture Society. It's very clear that he has no understanding of the [ error of the transposed conditiona](https://aeon.co/essays/it-s-time-for-science-to-abandon-the-term-statistically-significant)l, nor even the mulltiple comparison problem (and neither, it seems, does he know the meaning of the word 'protagonist'). I ignored his piece, but several friends complained to the BMJ for allowing such abusive material on their blog site. As a result a few changes were made. The \"baying mob\" is still there, but the Wikipedia link has gone. I thought that readers might be interested to read the original unexpurgated version. It shows, better than I ever could, the weakness of the arguments of the alternative medicine community. To quote Upton Sinclair: \"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.\" It also shows that the BBC still hasn't learned the lessons in Steve Jones' excellent \" [Review of impartiality and accuracy of the BBC's coverage of science](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/our_work/editorial_standards/impartiality/science_impartiality.html)\". Every time I appear in such a programme, they feel obliged to invite a member of the flat earth society to propagate their make-believe. | | Acupuncture for infantile colic - misdirection in the media or over-reaction from a sceptic blogger? 26 Jan, 17 | by Dr Mike Cummings So there has been a big response to this paper press released by BMJ on behalf of the journal Acupuncture in Medicine. The response has been influenced by the usual characters - retired professors who are professional bloggers and vocal critics of anything in the realm of complementary medicine. They thrive on oiling up and flexing their EBM muscles for a baying mob of fellow sceptics (see my 'stereotypical mental image' here). Their target in this instant is a relatively small trial on acupuncture for infantile colic.[1] Deserving of being press released by virtue of being the largest to date in the field, but by no means because it gave a definitive answer to the question of the efficacy of acupuncture in the condition. We need to wait for an SR where the data from the 4 trials to date can be combined. So what about the research itself? I have already said that the trial was not definitive, but it was not a bad trial. It suffered from under-recruiting, which meant that it was underpowered in terms of the statistical analysis. But it was prospectively registered, had ethical approval and the protocol was published. Primary and secondary outcomes were clearly defined, and the only change from the published protocol was to combine the two acupuncture groups in an attempt to improve the statistical power because of under recruitment. The fact that this decision was made after the trial had begun means that the results would have to be considered speculative. For this reason the editors of Acupuncture in Medicine insisted on alteration of the language in which the conclusions were framed to reflect this level of uncertainty. DC has focussed on multiple statistical testing and p values. These are important considerations, and we could have insisted on more clarity in the paper. P values are a guide and the 0.05 level commonly adopted must be interpreted appropriately in the circumstances. In this paper there are no definitive conclusions, so the p values recorded are there to guide future hypothesis generation and trial design. There were over 50 p values reported in this paper, so by chance alone you must expect some to be below 0.05. If one is to claim statistical significance of an outcome at the 0.05 level, ie a 1:20 likelihood of the event happening by chance alone, you can only perform the test once. If you perform the test twice you must reduce the p value to 0.025 if you want to claim statistical significance of one or other of the tests. So now we must come to the predefined outcomes. They were clearly stated, and the results of these are the only ones relevant to the conclusions of the paper. The primary outcome was the relative reduction in total crying time (TC) at 2 weeks. There were two significance tests at this point for relative TC. For a statistically significant result, the p values would need to be less than or equal to 0.025 - neither was this low, hence my comment on the Radio 4 Today programme that this was technically a negative trial (more correctly 'not a positive trial' - it failed to disprove the null hypothesis ie that the samples were drawn from the same population and the acupuncture intervention did not change the population treated). Finally to the secondary outcome - this was the number of infants in each group who continued to fulfil the criteria for colic at the end of each intervention week. There were four tests of significance so we need to divide 0.05 by 4 to maintain the 1:20 chance of a random event ie only draw conclusions regarding statistical significance if any of the tests resulted in a p value at or below 0.0125. Two of the 4 tests were below this figure, so we say that the result is unlikely to have been chance alone in this case. With hindsight it might have been good to include this explanation in the paper itself, but as editors we must constantly balance how much we push authors to adjust their papers, and in this case the editor focussed on reducing the conclusions to being speculative rather than definitive. A significant result in a secondary outcome leads to a speculative conclusion that acupuncture 'may' be an effective treatment option... but further research will be needed etc... Now a final word on the 3000 plus acupuncture trials that DC loves to mention. His point is that there is no consistent evidence for acupuncture after over 3000 RCTs, so it clearly doesn't work. He first quoted this figure in an editorial after discussing the largest, most statistically reliable meta-analysis to date - the Vickers et al IPDM.[2] DC admits that there is a small effect of acupuncture over sham, but follows the standard EBM mantra that it is too small to be clinically meaningful without ever considering the possibility that sham (gentle acupuncture plus context of acupuncture) can have clinically relevant effects when compared with conventional treatments. Perhaps now the best example of this is a network meta-analysis (NMA) using individual patient data (IPD), which clearly demonstrates benefits of sham acupuncture over usual care (a variety of best standard or usual care) in terms of health-related quality of life (HRQoL).[3] 30 January 2017 I got an email from the BMJ asking me to take part in a BMJ Head-to-Head debate about acupuncture. I did one of these [ before, in 2007](http://www.dcscience.net/2007/03/17/debate-in-the-bmj/), but it generated more heat than light (the only good thing to come out of it was the joke about leprechauns). So here is my polite refusal. | | Hello Thanks for the invitation, Perhaps you should read the piece that I wrote after the Today programme Why don't you do these Head to Heads about genuine controversies? To do them about homeopathy or acupuncture is to fall for the \"manufactured doubt\" stratagem that was used so effectively by the tobacco industry to promote smoking. It's the favourite tool of snake oil salesman too, and th BMJ should see that and not fall for their tricks. Such pieces night be good clickbait, but they are bad medicine and bad ethics. All the best David This is my version of a [post which I was asked to write for the Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/rio-2016-cupping-michael-phelps-swimming-what-is-it-does-it-work-no-gwyneth-paltrow-cups-marks-a7182411.html). It's been published, though so many changes were made by the editor that I'm posting the original here ( [below](#indy)). Superstition is rife in all sports. Mostly it does no harm, and it might even have a placebo effect that's sufficient to make a difference of 0.01%. That might just get you a medal. But what does matter is that superstition has given rise to an army of charlatans who are only to willing to sell their magic medicine to athletes, most of whom are not nearly as rich as Phelps. So much has been said about cupping during the last week that it's hard to say much that's original. Yesterday I did six radio interviews and two for TV, and today Associated Press TV came to film a piece about it. Everyone else must have been on holiday. The only one I've checked was the piece on the BBC News channel. That one didn't seem to go too badly, so it's here BBC news coverage It starts with the usual lengthy, but uninformative, pictures of someone being cupped, The cupper in this case was actually a chiropractor, [Rizwhan Suleman](http://www.gcc-uk.org/chiropractor-search/?postcode=&surname=suleman). Chiropractic is, of course a totally different form of alternative medicine and its value has [been totally discredited](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=chiropractic+colic) in the wake of the Simon Singh case. It's not unusual for people to sell different therapies with conflicting beliefs. Truth is irrelevant. Once you've believed one impossible thing, it seems that the next ones become quite easy. The presenter, Victoria Derbyshire, gave me a fair chance to debunk it afterwards. Nevertheless, the programme suffered from the usual pretence that there is a controversy about the medical value of cupping. There isn't. But despite Steve Jones' excellent report to the BBC Trust, the media insist on giving equal time to flat-earth advocates. The report, ( [Review of impartiality and accuracy of the BBC's coverage of science](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/our_work/editorial_standards/impartiality/science_impartiality.html)) was no doubt commissioned with good intentions, but it's been largely ignored. Still worse, the BBC News Channel, when it repeated the item (its cycle time is quite short) showed only [Rizwhan Suleman](http://www.gcc-uk.org/chiropractor-search/?postcode=&surname=suleman) and cut out my comments altogether. This is not false balance. It's no balance whatsoever. A formal complaint has been sent. It is not the job of the BBC to provide free advertising to quacks. After this, a friend drew my attention to a much worse programme on the subject. The Jeremy Vine show on [BBC Radio 2](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07mjrn6), at 12.00 on August 10th, 2016. This was presented by Vanessa Feltz. It was beyond appalling. There was absolutely zero attempt at balance, false or otherwise. The guest was described as being am \"expert\" on cupping. He was [Yusef Noden](http://www.londonhijamaclinic.com/practitioners/), of the London Hijama Clinic, who \"trained and qualified with the Hijama & Prophetic Medicine Institute\". No doubt he's a nice bloke, but he really could use a first year course in physiology. His words were pure make-believe. His repeated statements about \"withdrawing toxins\" are well know to be absolutely untrue. It was embarrassing to listen to. If you really want to hear it, here is an audio recording. The [Jeremy Vine show](http://www.dcscience.net/Cupping.m4a) This programme is one of the worst cases I've heard of the BBC mis-educating the public by providing free advertising for quite outrageous quackery. Another complaint will be submitted. The only form of opposition was a few callers who pointed out the nonsense, mixed with callers who endorsed it. That is not, by any stretch of the imagination, fair and balanced. It's interesting that, although cupping is often associated with Traditional Chinese Medicine, neither of the proponents in these two shows was Chinese, but rather they were Muslim. This should not be surprising as neither cupping nor acupuncture are exclusively Chinese. Similar myths have arisen in many places. My first encounter with this particular branch of magic medicine was when I was asked to make a [podcast for \"Things Unseen\"](http://www.thingsunseen.co.uk/podcasts/complementary-medicine-a-matter-of-faith/), in which I debated with a Muslim hijama practitioner and an Indian Ayurvedic practitioner. It's even harder to talk sense to practitioners of magic medicine who believe that god is on their side, as well as believing that selling nonsense is a good way to make a living. An excellent history of the complex emergence of similar myths in different parts of the world has been published by Ben Kavoussi, under the title \" [Acupuncture is astrology with needles](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/astrology-with-needles/)\". Now the original version of my [blog for the Independent.](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/rio-2016-cupping-michael-phelps-swimming-what-is-it-does-it-work-no-gwyneth-paltrow-cups-marks-a7182411.html) Cupping: Michael Phelps and Gwyneth Paltrow may be believers, but the truth behind it is what really sucks The sight of Olympic swimmer, Michael Phelps, with bruises on his body caused by [cupping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupping_therapy) resulted in something of a media feeding-frenzy this week. He's a great athlete so cupping must be responsible for his performance, right? Just as cupping must be responsible for the complexion of an earlier enthusiast, Gwyneth Paltrow. The main thing in common between Phelps and Paltrow is that they both have a great deal of money, and neither has much interest in how you distinguish truth from myth. They can afford to indulge any whim, however silly. And cupping is pretty silly. It's a pre-scientific medical practice that started in a time when there was no understanding of physiology, much like bloodletting. Indeed one version does involve a bit of bloodletting. Perhaps bloodletting is the best argument against the belief that it's ancient wisdom, so it must work. It was a standard part of medical treatment for hundreds of years, and killed countless people. It is desperately implausible that putting suction cups on your skin would benefit anything, so it's not surprising that there is no worthwhile empirical evidence that it does. The Chinese version of cupping is related to acupuncture and, unlike cupping, acupuncture has been very thoroughly tested. Over 3000 trials have failed to show any benefit that's big enough to benefit patients. [Acupuncture is no more than a theatrical placebo](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/05/30/acupuncture-is-a-theatrical-placebo-the-end-of-a-myth/). And even its placebo effects are too small to be useful. At least it's likely that cupping usually does no lasting damage.. We don't know for sure because in the world of alternative medicine there is no system for recording bad effects (and there is a vested interest in not reporting them). In extreme cases, it can [leave holes in your skin](http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/popular-treatment-known-as-cupping-therapy-leaves-man-with-seven-holes-in-his-back/news-story/33b979706858045dc7fcce1523772084) that pose a serious danger of infection, but most people probably end up with just broken capillaries and bruises. Why would anyone want that? The answer to that question seems to be a mixture of wishful thinking about the benefits and vastly exaggerated claims made by the people who sell the product. It's typical that the sales people can't even agree on what the benefits are alleged to be. If selling to athletes, the claim may be that it relieves pain, or that it aids recovery, or that it increases performance. Exactly the same cupping methods are sold to celebs with the claim that their beauty will be improved because cupping will \" [boost your immune system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBnZdxCUXbk&feature=youtu.be)\". This claim is universal in the world of make-believe medicine, when the salespeople can think of nothing else. There is no surer sign of quackery. It means nothing whatsoever. No procedure is known to boost your immune system. And even if anything did, it would be more likely to [cause inflammation and blood clots](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/boost-your-immune-system/) than to help you run faster or improve your complexion. It's certainly most unlikely that sucking up bits of skin into evacuated jars would have any noticeable effect on blood flow in underlying muscles, and so increase your performance. The [salespeople would undoubtedly benefit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBnZdxCUXbk&feature=youtu.be) from a first year physiology course. Needless to say, they haven't tried to actually measuring blood flow, or performance. To do that might reduce sales. As [Kate Carter said recently](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/aug/08/does-cupping-do-olympic-athletes-any-good) \"Eating jam out of those jars would probably have a more significant physical impact\". The problem with all sports medicine is that tiny effects could make a difference. When three hour endurance events end with a second or so separating the winner from the rest, that is an effect of less than 0.01%. Such tiny effects will never be detectable experimentally. That leaves the door open to every charlatan to sell miracle treatments that might just work. If, like steroids, they do work, there is a good chance that they'll harm your health in the long run. You might be better off eating the jam. Here is a very small selection of the many excellent accounts of cupping on the web. There have been many good blogs. The mainstream media have, on the whole, been dire. Here are three that I like, | | In July 2016, Orac posted in ScienceBlogs. \" | | Photo Timothy Caulfield, wrote \" [Olympic debunk](http://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/august-2016/olympic-debunk/)!\". He's Chair in Health Law and Policy at the University of Alberta, and the author of Is Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong about Everything. \"The Olympics are a wonderful celebration of athletic performance. But they have also become an international festival of sports pseudoscience. It will take an Olympic-sized effort to fight this bunk and bring a win to the side of evidence-based practice.\" Jennifer Raff wrote [Pseudoscience is common among elite athletes outside of the Olympics too...and it makes me furious](https://violentmetaphors.com/2016/08/09/pseudoscience-is-common-among-elite-athletes-outside-of-the-olympics-too-and-it-makes-me-furious/). She works on the genomes of modern and ancient people at the University of Kansas, and, as though that were not a full-time job for most people, she writes blogs, books and she's also \"training (and occasionally competing) in Muay Thai, boxing, BJJ, and \"I'm completely unsurprised to find that pseudoscience [is common]among the elite athletes competing in the Olympics. I've seen similar things rampant in the combat sports world as well.\" What she writes makes perfect sense. Just don't bother with the comments section which is littered with Trump-like post-factual comments from anonymous conspiracy theorists. Follow-up Of all types of alternative medicine, acupuncture is the one that has received the most approval from regular medicine. The benefit of that is that it's been tested more thoroughly than most others. The result is now clear. It doesn't work. See the evidence in [Acupuncture is a theatrical placebo](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/05/30/acupuncture-is-a-theatrical-placebo-the-end-of-a-myth/). This blog has [documented many cases](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=acupuncture) of misreported tests of acupuncture, often from people have a financial interests in selling it. Perhaps the most egregious [spin came from the University of Exeter](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/05/31/acupuncturists-show-that-acupuncture-doesnt-work-but-conclude-the-opposite-journal-fails/). It was published in a normal journal, and endorsed by the journal's editor, despite showing clearly that acupuncture didn't even have much placebo effect. Acupuncture got a boost in 2009 from, of all unlikely sources, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The judgements of NICE and the benefit / cost ratio of treatments are usually very good. But the guidance group that they assembled to judge treatments for low back pain was atypically incompetent when it came to assessment of evidence. They recommended acupuncture as one option. At the time I posted \" [NICE falls for Bait and Switch by acupuncturists and chiropractors: it has let down the public and itself](http://www.dcscience.net/2009/05/25/nice-falls-for-bait-and-switch-by-acupuncturists-and-chiropractors-it-has-let-down-the-public-and-itself/)\". That was soon followed by two more posts: [NICE fiasco, part 2. Rawlins should withdraw guidance and start again](http://www.dcscience.net/2009/05/28/nice-fiasco-part-2-rawlins-should-withdraw-guidance-and-start-again/)\", and \" [The NICE fiasco, Part 3. Too many vested interests, not enough honesty](http://www.dcscience.net/2009/06/03/the-nice-fiasco-part-3-too-many-vested-interests-not-enough-honesty/)\". At the time, NICE was being run by Michael Rawlins, an old friend. No doubt he was unaware of the bad guidance until it was too late and he felt obliged to defend it. Although the 2008 guidance referred only to low back pain, it gave an opening for acupuncturists to penetrate the NHS. Like all quacks, they are experts at [bait and switch](http://www.dcscience.net/2009/05/25/nice-falls-for-bait-and-switch-by-acupuncturists-and-chiropractors-it-has-let-down-the-public-and-itself/). The penetration of quackery was exacerbated by the privatisation of physiotherapy services to organisations like Connect Physical Health which have little regard for evidence, but a good eye for sales. If you think that's an exaggeration, read \" [Connect Physical Health sells quackery to NHS](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/06/10/connect-physical-health-sells-quackery-to-nhs/)\". When David Haslam took over the reins at NICE, I was optimistic that the question would be revisited (it turned out that he was aware of this blog). I was not disappointed. This time the guidance group had much [more critical members](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/GID-CGWAVE0681/documents/low-back-pain-and-sciatica-gdg-membership2). The new [draft guidance on low back pain ](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/GID-CGWAVE0681/consultation/html-content)was released on 24 March 2016. The final guidance will not appear until September 2016, but last time the final version didn't differ much from the draft. Despite modern imaging methods, it still isn't possible to pinpoint the precise cause of low back pain (LBP) so diagnoses are lumped together as non-specific low back pain (NSLBP). The [summary guidance](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/GID-CGWAVE0681/documents/short-version-of-draft-guideline) is explicit. \"1.2.8 Do not offer acupuncture for managing non-specific low back 7 pain with or without sciatica.\" The evidence is summarised section 13.6 of [the main report](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/GID-CGWAVE0681/documents/draft-guideline) (page 493). Because low back pain is so common, and so difficult to treat, many treatments have been proposed. Many of them, including acupuncture, have proved to be clutching at straws. It's to the great credit of the new guidance group that they have resisted that temptation. Among the other \"do not offer\" treatments are - imaging (except in specialist setting) - belts or corsets - foot orthotics - acupuncture - ultrasound - TENS or PENS - opioids (for acute or chronic LBP) - antidepressants (SSRI and others) - anticonvulsants - spinal injections - spinal fusion for NSLBP (except as part of a randomised controlled trial) - disc replacement At first sight, the new guidance looks like an excellent clear-out of the myths that surround the treatment of low back pain. The positive recommendations that are made are all for things that have modest effects (at best). For example \"Consider a group exercise programme\", and \"Consider manipulation, mobilisation\". The use of there word \"consider\", rather than \"offer\" seems to be NICE-speak -an implicit suggestion that it doesn't work very well. My only criticism of the report is that it doesn't say sufficiently bluntly that non-specific low back pain is largely an unsolved problem. Most of what's seen is probably a result of that most deceptive phenomenon, [regression to the mean](http://www.dcscience.net/2015/12/11/placebo-effects-are-weak-regression-to-the-mean-is-the-main-reason-ineffective-treatments-appear-to-work/). One pain specialist put it to me thus. \"Think of the billions spent on back pain research over the years in order to reach the conclusion that nothing much works - shameful really.\" Well perhaps not shameful: it isn't for want of trying. It's just a very difficult problem. But pretending that there are solutions doesn't help anyone. Follow-up | | \"Statistical regression to the mean predicts that patients selected for abnormalcy will, on the average, tend to improve. We argue that most improvements attributed to the placebo effect are actually instances of statistical regression.\" \"Thus, we urge caution in interpreting patient improvements as causal effects of our actions and should avoid the conceit of assuming that our personal presence has strong healing powers.\" In 1955, Henry Beecher published \" [The Powerful Placebo](http://www.dcscience.net/beecher-placebo-1955.pdf)\". I was in my second undergraduate year when it appeared. And for many decades after that I took it literally, They looked at 15 studies and found that an average 35% of them got \"satisfactory relief\" when given a placebo. This number got embedded in pharmacological folk-lore. He also mentioned that the relief provided by placebo was greatest in patients who were most ill. Consider the common experiment in which a new treatment is compared with a placebo, in a double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT). It's common to call the responses measured in the placebo group the placebo response. But that is very misleading, and here's why. The responses seen in the group of patients that are treated with placebo arise from two quite different processes. One is the genuine psychosomatic placebo effect. This effect gives genuine (though small) benefit to the patient. The other contribution comes from the get-better-anyway effect. This is a statistical artefact and it provides no benefit whatsoever to patients. There is now increasing evidence that the latter effect is much bigger than the former. How can you distinguish between real placebo effects and get-better-anyway effect? The only way to measure the size of genuine placebo effects is to compare in an RCT the effect of a dummy treatment with the effect of no treatment at all. Most trials don't have a no-treatment arm, but enough do that estimates can be made. For example, a Cochrane review by [Hr\u00f3bjartsson & G\u00f8tzsche (2010)](http://www.dcscience.net/Hrobjartsson-Gotzsche-Cochrane-placebo.pdf) looked at a wide variety of clinical conditions. Their conclusion was: \"We did not find that placebo interventions have important clinical effects in general. However, in certain settings placebo interventions can influence patient-reported outcomes, especially pain and nausea, though it is difficult to distinguish patient-reported effects of placebo from biased reporting.\" In some cases, the placebo effect is barely there at all. In a non-blind comparison of acupuncture and no acupuncture, the responses were essentially indistinguishable (despite what the authors and the journal said). See \" [Acupuncturists show that acupuncture doesn't work, but conclude the opposite](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/05/31/acupuncturists-show-that-acupuncture-doesnt-work-but-conclude-the-opposite-journal-fails/)\" So the placebo effect, though a real phenomenon, seems to be quite small. In most cases it is so small that it would be barely perceptible to most patients. Most of the reason why so many people think that medicines work when they don't isn't a result of the placebo response, but it's the result of a statistical artefact. Regression to the mean is a potent source of deception The get-better-anyway effect has a technical name, regression to the mean. It has been understood since Francis Galton described it in 1886 (see [Senn, 2011](http://www.dcscience.net/Senn-2011-Francis-Galton-and-Regression-to-the-Mean.pdf) for the history). It is a statistical phenomenon, and it can be treated mathematically (see references, below). But when you think about it, it's simply common sense. You tend to go for treatment when your condition is bad, and when you are at your worst, then a bit later you're likely to be better, The great biologist, Peter Medawar comments thus. | | \"If a person is (a) poorly, (b) receives treatment intended to make him better, and (c) gets better, then no power of reasoning known to medical science can convince him that it may not have been the treatment that restored his health\" (Medawar, P.B. (1969:19). The Art of the Soluble: Creativity and originality in science. Penguin Books: Harmondsworth). This is illustrated beautifully by measurements made by [McGorry et al., (2001)](http://www.dcscience.net/mcgorry-2001-spine.pdf). Patients with low back pain recorded their pain (on a 10 point scale) every day for 5 months (they were allowed to take analgesics ad lib). The results for four patients are shown in their Figure 2. On average they stay fairly constant over five months, but they fluctuate enormously, with different patterns for each patient. Painful episodes that last for 2 to 9 days are interspersed with periods of lower pain or none at all. It is very obvious that if these patients had gone for treatment at the peak of their pain, then a while later they would feel better, even if they were not actually treated. And if they had been treated, the treatment would have been declared a success, despite the fact that the patient derived no benefit whatsoever from it. This entirely artefactual benefit would be the biggest for the patients that fluctuate the most (e.g this in panels a and d of the Figure). Figure 2 from [McGorry et al, 2000](http://www.dcscience.net/mcgorry-2001-spine.pdf). Examples of daily pain scores over a 6-month period for four participants. Note: Dashes of different lengths at the top of a figure designate an episode and its duration. The effect is illustrated well by an analysis of 118 trials of treatments for non-specific low back pain (NSLBP), by [Artus et al., (2010)](http://www.dcscience.net/artus-rheumatology-2010.pdf). The time course of pain (rated on a 100 point visual analogue pain scale) is shown in their Figure 2. There is a modest improvement in pain over a few weeks, but this happens regardless of what treatment is given, including no treatment whatsoever. FIG. 2 Overall responses (VAS for pain) up to 52-week follow-up in each treatment arm of included trials. Each line represents a response line within each trial arm. Red: index treatment arm; Blue: comment \"symptoms seem to improve in a similar pattern in clinical trials following a wide variety of active as well as inactive treatments.\", and \"The common pattern of responses could, for a large part, be explained by the natural history of NSLBP\". In other words, none of the treatments work. This paper was brought to my attention through the blog run by the excellent physiotherapist, Neil O'Connell. [He comments](http://www.bodyinmind.org/research-into-back-pain-treatments/) \"If this finding is supported by future studies it might suggest that we can't even claim victory through the non-specific effects of our interventions such as care, attention and placebo. People enrolled in trials for back pain may improve whatever you do. This is probably explained by the fact that patients enrol in a trial when their pain is at its worst which raises the murky spectre of regression to the mean and the beautiful phenomenon of natural recovery.\" O'Connell has discussed the matter in recent paper, [O'Connell (2015)](http://www.dcscience.net/OConnell-Phys-Ther-2015.pdf), from the point of view of manipulative therapies. That's an area where there has been resistance to doing proper RCTs, with many people saying that it's better to look at \"real world\" outcomes. This usually means that you look at how a patient changes after treatment. The hazards of this procedure are obvious from Artus et al.,Fig 2, above. It maximises the risk of being deceived by regression to the mean. As O'Connell commented \"Within-patient change in outcome might tell us how much an individual's condition improved, but it does not tell us how much of this improvement was due to treatment.\" In order to eliminate this effect it's essential to do a proper RCT with control and treatment groups tested in parallel. When that's done the control group shows the same regression to the mean as the treatment group. and any additional response in the latter can confidently attributed to the treatment. Anything short of that is whistling in the wind. Needless to say, the suboptimal methods are most popular in areas where real effectiveness is small or non-existent. This, sad to say, includes low back pain. It also includes just about every treatment that comes under the heading of alternative medicine. Although these problems have been understood for over a century, it remains true that | | \"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.\" Responders and non-responders? One excuse that's commonly used when a treatment shows only a small effect in proper RCTs is to assert that the treatment actually has a good effect, but only in a subgroup of patients (\"responders\") while others don't respond at all (\"non-responders\"). For example, this argument is often used in studies of anti-depressants and of manipulative therapies. And it's universal in alternative medicine. There's a striking similarity between the narrative used by homeopaths and those who are struggling to treat depression. The pill may not work for many weeks. If the first sort of pill doesn't work try another sort. You may get worse before you get better. One is reminded, inexorably, of Voltaire's aphorism \"The art of medicine consists in amusing the patient while nature cures the disease\". There is only a handful of cases in which a clear distinction can be made between responders and non-responders. Most often what's observed is a smear of different responses to the same treatment -and the greater the variability, the greater is the chance of being deceived by regression to the mean. For example, [ Thase et al., (2011)](http://www.dcscience.net/Thase-2011-true-effect-of-antidep.pdf) looked at responses to escitalopram, an SSRI antidepressant. They attempted to divide patients into responders and non-responders. An example (Fig 1a in their paper) is shown. The evidence for such a bimodal distribution is certainly very far from obvious. The observations are just smeared out. Nonetheless, the authors conclude \"Our findings indicate that what appears to be a modest effect in the grouped data - on the boundary of clinical significance, as suggested above - is actually a very large effect for a subset of patients who benefited more from escitalopram than from placebo treatment. \" I guess that interpretation could be right, but it seems more likely to be a marketing tool. Before you read the paper, check the authors' conflicts of interest. The bottom line is that analyses that divide patients into responders and non-responders are reliable only if that can be done before the trial starts. Retrospective analyses are unreliable and unconvincing. Some more reading [Senn, 2011](http://www.dcscience.net/Senn-2011-Francis-Galton-and-Regression-to-the-Mean.pdf) provides an excellent introduction (and some interesting history). The subtitle is \"Here Stephen Senn examines one of Galton's most important statistical legacies - one that is at once so trivial that it is blindingly obvious, and so deep that many scientists spend their whole career being fooled by it.\" The examples in this paper are extended in [Senn (2009), \"Three things that every medical writer should know about statistics\"](http://www.dcscience.net/Senn-2009-Three-things-medical-writers.pdf). The three things are regression to the mean, the error of the transposed conditional and individual response. You can read slightly more technical accounts of regression to the mean in McDonald & Mazzuca (1983) \" [How much of the placebo effect is statistical regression](http://www.dcscience.net/McDonald-Mazucca-1983-reg-to-mean.pdf)\" (two quotations from this paper opened this post), and in Stephen Senn (2015) \" [Mastering variation: variance components and personalised 1988 Senn published some [corrections to the maths](http://www.dcscience.net/Senn-McDonald-correction.pdf) in McDonald (1983). The trials that were used by [Hr\u00f3bjartsson & G\u00f8tzsche (2010)](Hr\u00f3bjartsson-G\u00f8tzsche-Cochrane-placebo.pdf) to investigate the comparison between placebo and no treatment were looked at again by [Howick et al., (2013)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062599), who found that in many of them the difference between treatment and placebo was also small. Most of the treatments did not work very well. Regression to the mean is not just a medical deceiver: it's everywhere Although this post has concentrated on deception in medicine, it's worth noting that the phenomenon of regression to the mean can cause wrong inferences in almost any area where you look at change from baseline. A classical example concern concerns the [effectiveness of speed cameras](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/reality-check/2013/jun/07/reality-check-do-speed-cameras-reduce-serious-road-accidents). They tend to be installed after a spate of accidents, and if the accident rate is particularly high in one year it is likely to be lower the next year, regardless of whether a camera had been installed or not. To find the true reduction in accidents caused by installation of speed cameras, you would need to choose several similar sites and allocate them at random to have a camera or no camera. As in clinical trials. looking at the change from baseline can be very deceptive. Statistical postscript Lastly, remember that it you avoid all of these hazards of interpretation, and your test of significance gives P = 0.047. that does not mean you have discovered something. There is still a risk of at least 30% that your 'positive' result is a false positive. This is explained in [Colquhoun (2014),\"An investigation of the false discovery rate and the misinterpretation of p-values\"](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/3/140216). I've [suggested that one way to solve](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/3/140216#comment-1889100957) this problem is to use different words to describe P values: something like this. | | P > 0.05 very weak evidence P = 0.05 weak evidence: worth another look P = 0.01 moderate evidence for a real effect P = 0.001 strong evidence for real effect But notice that if your hypothesis is implausible, even these criteria are too weak. For example, if the treatment and placebo are identical (as would be the case if the treatment were a homeopathic pill) then it follows that 100% of positive tests are false positives. Follow-up 12 December 2015 It's worth mentioning that the question of responders versus non-responders is closely-related to the classical topic of bioassays that use quantal responses. In that field it was assumed that each participant had an individual effective dose (IED). That's reasonable for the old-fashioned LD50 toxicity test: every animal will die after a sufficiently big dose. It's less obviously right for ED50 (effective dose in 50% of individuals). The distribution of IEDs is critical, but it has very rarely been determined. The cumulative form of this distribution is what determines the shape of the dose-response curve for fraction of responders as a function of dose. Linearisation of this curve, by means of the probit transformation used to be a staple of biological assay. This topic is discussed in Chapter 10 of [Lectures on Biostatistics](http://www.dcscience.net/Lectures_on_biostatistics-ocr4.pdf). And you can read some of the history on my blog about [Some pharmacological history: an exam from 1959](http://www.dcscience.net/2014/02/06/some-pharmacological-history-an-exam-from-1959/). A constant theme of this blog is that the NHS should not pay for useless treatments. By and large, NICE does a good job of preventing that. But NICE has not been allowed by the [Department of Health](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5778) to look at quackery. I have the impression that privatisation of many NHS services will lead to an increase in the provision of myth-based therapies. That is part of the \" [bait and switch](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5360)\" tactic that quacks use in the hope of gaining respectability. A prime example is the \" [College of Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5295)\", financed by Capita and [replete with quacks](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632), as one would expect since it is the reincarnation of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. One such treatment is acupuncture. Having very recently reviewed the evidence, we concluded that \" [Acupuncture is a theatrical placebo: the end of a myth](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=6060)\". Any effects it may have are too small to be useful to patients. That's the background for an interesting case study. A colleague got a very painful frozen shoulder. His GP referred him to the Camden & Islington NHS Trust physiotherapy service. That service is now provided by a private company, [Connect Physical Health](http://www.connectphc.co.uk/). That proved to be a big mistake. The first two appointments were not too bad, though they resulted in little improvement. But at the third appointment he was offered acupuncture. He hesitated, but agreed, in desperation to try it. It did no good. At the next appointment the condition was worse. After some very painful manipulation, the physiotherapist offered acupuncture again. This time he refused on the grounds that \"I hadn't noticed any effect the first time, because there is no evidence that it works and that I was concerned by her standards of hygiene\". The physiotherapist then became \"quite rude\" and said that she would put down that the patient had refused treatment. The lack of response was hardly surprising. [NHS Evidence](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Frozen-shoulder/Pages/Treatment.aspx) says \"There is no clinical evidence to show that other treatments, such as [transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation](TENS), Shiatsu massage or [acupuncture]are effective in treating frozen shoulder.\" In fact it now seems beyond reasonable doubt that [acupuncture is no more than a theatrical placebo](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=6060). According to Connect's own web site [\"Our services are evidence-based\"](http://www.connectphc.co.uk/community-nhs-services/advice-information/list-of-services/nhs-patients). That is evidently untrue in this case, so I asked them for the evidence that acupuncture was effective. I'd noticed that in other places, Connect Physical Health also offers the obviously [fraudulent craniosacral](http://www.ebm-first.com/craniosacral-therapy.html) therapy (for example, [here](http://connectphc.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/craniosacral-could-this-treatment.html)) and discredited chiropractic quackery. So I asked them about the evidence for their effectiveness too. This is what they said. | | Many thanks for your comments via our web site. In response, we thought you might like to access the sources for some of the evidence which underpins our MSK services: Integrating Evidence-Based Acupuncture into Physiotherapy for the Benefit of the Patient - you can obtain the information you require from The General Chiropractic Council We have also attached a copy of the NICE Guidelines. So, no Cochrane reviews, no NHS Evidence. Instead I was referred to the very quack organisations that promote the treatments in question, the Acupuncture Association of Chartered Physiotherapists, and the totally discredited General Chiropractic Council. The NICE guidelines that they sent were nothing to do with frozen shoulder. They were the guidelines for low back pain which [caused such a furore](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1542) when they were first issued (and which, in any case, don't recommend chiropractic explicitly). When I pointed out these deficiencies I got this. | | Your email below has been forwarded to me. I am sorry if you feel that that that information we pointed you towards to enable you to make your own investigations into the evidence base for the services provided by Connect Physical Health and your hospital did not meet with your expectations. ' ' ' Please understand that our NHS services in Camden were commissioned by the Primary Care Trust. The fully integrated MSK service model included provision for acupuncture and other manual therapy provided by our experienced Chartered Physiotherapists. If you have any problems with the evidence base for the use of acupuncture or manual therapy within the service, which has been commissioned on behalf of the GPs in Camden Borough, then I would politely recommend that you direct your observations to the clinical commissioning authorities and other professional bodies who do spend time evidencing best practice and representing the academic arguments. I am sure they will be pleased to pick up discussions with you about the relative merits of the interventions being procured by the NHS. Health 35 Apex Business Village Cramlington Northumberland NE23 7BF So, \"don't blame us, blame the PCT\". A second letter asked why they were shirking the little matter of evidence. | | In response to your last email, I would like to say that Connect does not wish to be drawn into a debate over two therapeutic options (acupuncture and craniosacral therapy) that are widely practiced [sic] within and outside the NHS by very respectable practitioners. You will be as aware, as Connect is, that there are lots of treatments that don't have a huge evidence base that are practiced in mainstream medicine. Connect has seen many carefully selected patients helped by acupuncture and manual therapy (craniosacral therapy / chiropractic) over many years. Lack of evidence doesn't mean they don't work, just that benefit is not proven. Furthermore, nowhere on our website do we state that ALL treatments / services / modalities that Connect offer are 'Evidence Based'. We do however offer many services that are evidence based, where the evidence exists. We aim to offer 'choice' to patients, from a range of services that are safe and delivered by suitably trained professionals and practitioners in line with Codes of Practice and Guidelines from the relevant governing bodies. Connect's service provision in Camden is meticulously assessed and of a high standard and we are proud of the services provided. This response is so wrong, on so many levels, that I gave up on Mr Philpott at this point. At least he admitted implicitly that all of their treatments are not evidence-based. In that case their web site needs to change that claim. If, by \"governing bodies\" he means jokes like the GCC or the CNHC then I suppose the behaviour of their employees is not surprising. Mr Philpott is evidently not aware that \"craniosacral therapy\" has been censured by the Advertising Standards Authority. Well he is now, but evidently doesn't seem to give a damn. Next I wrote to the PCT and it took several mails to find out who was responsible for the service. Three mails produced no response so I sent a Freedom of Information Act request. In the end I got some \"Connect PHC provide the Community musculoskeletal service for Camden. The specification for the service specifically asks for the provision of evidence based management and treatments see paragraph on Governance page 14 of attached.. Patients are treated with acupuncture as per the NICE Guidelines (May 2009) for the management of low back pain ... . .. Chiropractors are not employed in the service and craniosacral therapy is not provided as part of the service either.\" Another letter, pointing out that they were using acupuncture for things other than low back pain got no more information. They did send a copy of the [contract with Connect](/MSK-SERVICE-Specification-CAMDEN-Draft-14final-01-06-09.pdf). It makes no mention whatsoever of alternative treatments. It should have done, so part of the responsibility for the failure must lie with the PCT. The [contract](/MSK-SERVICE-Specification-CAMDEN-Draft-14final-01-06-09.pdf) does, however, say (page 18) The service to be led by a lead clinician/manager who can effectively demonstrate ongoing and evidence-based development of clinical guidelines, policies and protocols for effective working practices within the service In my opinion, Connect Physical Health are in breach of contract Another example of Connect ignoring evidence The Connect Physical Health web site has [an article](http://www.connectphc.co.uk/blog/in-kneed-advice) about osteoarthritis of the knee Physiotherapy can be extremely beneficial to help to reduce the symptoms of OA. Treatments such as mobilizations, rehab exercises, acupuncture and taping can help to reduce pain, increase range of movement, increase muscle strength and aid return to functional activities and sports. There is little enough evidence that physiotherapy does any of these things, but at least it is free of mystical mumbo-jumbo. Although at one time the claim for acupuncture was thought to have some truth, the [2010 Cochrane review](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001977.pub2/abstract) concludes otherwise Sham-controlled trials show statistically significant benefits; however, these benefits are small, do not meet our pre-defined thresholds for clinical relevance, and are probably due at least partially to placebo effects from incomplete blinding. This conclusion is much the same as has been reached for acupuncture treatments of almost everything. Two major meta-analyses come to similar conclusions. Madsen G\u00f8tzsche & Hr\u00f3bjartsson (2009) and Vickers et al (2012) both conclude that if there is an effect at all (dubious) then it is too small to be noticeable to the patient. (Be warned that in the case of Vickers et al. you need to read the paper itself because of the spin placed on the results in the abstract.). These papers are discussed in detail in our [recent paper](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=6060). Why is Connect Physical Health not aware of this? Their head of operations told me (see above) that \"Connect does not wish to be drawn into a debate [about acupuncture and craniosacral therapy]\". That outlook was confirmed when I left a comment on their [osteoarthritis post](http://www.connectphc.co.uk/blog/in-kneed-advice). This is what it looked like almost a month later. Guess what? The comment has never appeared.. The attitude of Connect Physical Health to evidence is simply to ignore it if it gets in the way of making money, and to censor any criticism. What have Camden NHS done about it? The patient and I both complained to Camden NHS in August 2012. At first, they simply forwarded the complaints to Connect Physical Health with the unsatisfactory results shown above. It took until May 2013 to get any sort of reasonable response. That seems a very long time. In fact by the time the response arrived the PCT had been renamed a Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) because of the vast top-down reorganisation inposed by Lansley's [Health and Social Care Act](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5058). On 8 May 2013, this response was sent to the patient, Here is part of it. | | I have received your email of complaint from the NHSNCL complaints department regarding your care. You raise some very clear concerns and I will attempt to address these in order. 1) The fact that you felt pressurised into having acupuncture is a concern as everybody should be given a choice. As part of the informed consent relating to acupuncture you should have been told about the treatment, it's [sic] benefits and risks and then you sign to confirm you are happy to proceed. I understand that this was the case in your situation but I have reinforced that the consent is important and must be adhered to by the provider Connect Physical Health. There are clear standards of clinical practice that all Chartered Physiotherapists must follow which I will discuss further with the Connect Camden team Manager Nick Downing. I do disagree with you around acupuncture; there is no conclusive evidence for acupuncture in frozen shoulder but I have referenced a systematic review which concludes the studies were too small to draw any conclusions although shoulder function was significantly improved at 4 weeks (Green S et al. Acupuncture for shoulder pain. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2005; 18: CD005319). There is a growing body of evidence supporting the use of acupuncture and until such time as there is specific evidence against it I don't think we would be absolutely against the practice of this modality alongside other treatments. .Best wishes Strategy and Planning Directorate This response raises more questions than it answers. For example, what is \"informed consent\" worth if the therapist is his/herself misinformed about the treatment? It is the eternal dilemma of alternative medicine that it is no use referring to well-trained practitioners, when their training has inculcated myths and untruths. There is not a \"growing body of evidence supporting the use of acupuncture\". Precisely the [opposite is true](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=6060). And the statement \"until such time as there is specific evidence against it I don't think we would be absolutely against the practice of this modality alongside\" betrays a basic misunderstanding of the scientific process. So I sent the writer of this letter a reprint of our paper, \" [Acupuncture is a theatrical placebo: the end of a myth](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=6060)\" (the blog version alone has had over 12,000 page views). A few days later we had an amiable lunch together and we had a constructive discussion about the problems of deciding what should be commissioned and what shouldn't. It seems to me to be clear that CCGs should take better advice before boasting that they commission evidence-based treatments. Postscript Stories like this are worrying to the majority of physiotherapists who don't go in for mystical mumbo-jumbo of acupuncture. One of the best is Neil O'Connell who blogs at [BodyInMind](http://www.bodyinmind.org/?s=O%27Connell). He tweeted Physio fail, sigh RT [@david_colquhoun]: Yet more [#acupuncture]. Sold to the NHS by private contractor [@ConnectPHC] [http://t.co/HylkwMCVTh] \u2014 Neil O'Connell (@NeilOConnell) [June 10, 2013] It isn't clear how many physiotherapists embrace nonsense, but the [Acupuncture Association of Chartered Physiotherapists](http://www.aacp.org.uk/) has around 6000 members, compared with 47,000 chartered physiotherapists (AACP), so it's a smallish minority. The AACP claims that it is \"Integrating Evidence-Based Acupuncture into Physiotherapy\". Like most politicians, the term \"evidence-based\" is thrown around with gay abandon. Clearly they don't understand evidence. Follow-up 12 June 2013 The Advertising Standards Authority has, one again, [upheld complaints against the UCLH Trust](http://asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2013/6/University-College-London-Hospitals/SHP_ADJ_166633.aspx), for making false claims in its advertising. This time, appropriately, it's about acupuncture. Just about everything in their advertising leaflets was held to be unjustifiable. They've been in trouble before about false claims for homeopathy, hypnosis and craniosacral \"therapy\". Of course all of these embarrassments come from one very small corner of the UCLH Trust, the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine (previously known as the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital). Why is it tolerated in an otherwise excellent NHS Trust? Well, the patron is the Queen herself (not Charles, aka the Quacktitioner Royal), She seems to exert more power behind the scenes than is desirable in In a constitutional monarchy 29 June 2013 I wrote to Dr Gill Gaskin about the latest ASA judgement against RLHIM. She is the person at the UCLH Trust who has responsibility for the quack hospital. She previously [refused to do anything about the craniosacral nonsense](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4213) that is promoted there. This time the ASA seems to have stung them into action at long last. I was told | | In response to your question about proposed action: All written information for patients relating to the services offered by the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine are being withdrawn for review in the light of the ASA's rulings (and the patient leaflets have already been withdrawn).

Anesthesia Analgesia is the official journal of the International Anesthesia Research Society. In 2012 its editor, Steven Shafer, proposed a head-to-head contest between those who believe that acupuncture works and those who don't. I was asked to write the latter. It has [now appeared](http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/) in June 2013 edition of the journal [ [download pdf](/Colquhoun-Novella-A&A-2013.pdf)].

Acupuncture is an interesting case, because it seems to have achieved greater credibility than other forms of alternative medicine, despite its basis being just as bizarre as all the others. As a consequence, a lot more research has been done on acupuncture than on any other form of alternative medicine, and some of it has been of quite high quality. The outcome of all this research is that acupuncture has no effects that are big enough to be of noticeable benefit to patients, and it is, in all probablity, just a theatrical placebo. After more than 3000 trials, there is no need for yet more. Acupuncture is dead. Acupuncture is a theatrical placebo David Colquhoun (UCL) and Steven Novella (Yale) Anesthesia & Analgesia, June 2013 116:1360-1363. Pain is a big problem. If you read about pain management centres you might think it had been solved. It hasn't. And when no effective treatment exists for a medical problem, it leads to a tendency to clutch at straws. Research has shown that acupuncture is little more than such a straw. Although it is commonly claimed that acupuncture has been around for thousands of years, it hasn't always been popular even in China. For almost 1000 years it was in decline and in 1822 Emperor Dao Guang [ issued an imperial edict](http://www.acupuncturecentre.org/aboutacupuncture.html) stating that acupuncture and moxibustion should be banned forever from the Imperial Medical Academy. Acupuncture continued as a minor fringe activity in the 1950s. After the Chinese Civil War, the Chinese Communist Party ridiculed traditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture, as superstitious. Chairman Mao Zedong later revived traditional Chinese Medicine as part of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of 1966 ( [Atwood, 2009](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/acupuncture-anesthesia-a-proclamation-from-chairman-mao-part-iv/)). The revival was a convenient response to the dearth of medically-trained people in post-war China, and a useful way to increase Chinese nationalism. It is said that Chairman Mao himself preferred Western medicine. His personal physician quotes him as saying \"Even though I believe we should promote Chinese medicine, I personally do not believe in it. I don't take Chinese medicine\" Li {Zhisui Li. [Private Life Of Chairman Mao](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sAOHE8xK4OEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Zhisui+Li.+Private+Life+Of+Chairman+Mao&source=bl&ots=AbdotZK5iY&sig=iFIopKsMyfvL8DbvMPJzDmYmJbo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OvFvUMX_BKa00QWIo4DwCw&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Zhisui%20Li.%20Private%20Life%20Of%20Chairman%20Mao&f=false): Random House, 1996}. The political, or perhaps commercial, bias seems to still exist. It has been reported by [Vickers et al. (1998)](http://www.dcscience.net/Vickers_1998_Controlled-Clinical-Trials.pdf) (authors who are sympathetic to alternative medicine) that \"all trials [of acupuncture] originating in China, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan were positive\"(4). Acupuncture was essentially defunct in the West until President Nixon visited China in 1972. Its revival in the West was largely a result of a single anecdote promulgated by journalist James Reston [in the New York Times](http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0D11FA395C1A7493C4AB178CD85F458785F9), after he'd had acupuncture in Beijing for post-operative pain in 1971. Despite his eminence as political journalist, Reston had no scientific background and evidently didn't appreciate the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, or the idea of regression to the mean. After Reston's article, acupuncture quickly became popular in the West. Stories circulated that patients in China had open heart surgery using only acupuncture ( [Atwood, 2009](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/acupuncture-anesthesia-a-proclamation-of-chairman-mao-part-i/)). The Medical Research Council (UK) sent a delegation, which included Alan Hodgkin, to China in 1972 to investigate these claims , about which they were skeptical. In 2006 the claims were repeated in 2006 in a BBC TV program, but Simon Singh (author of Fermat's Last Theorem) [discovered that the patient](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3344833/Did-we-really-witness-the-amazing-power-of-acupuncture.html) had been given a combination of three very powerful sedatives (midazolam, droperidol, fentanyl) and large volumes of local anaesthetic injected into the chest. The acupuncture needles were purely cosmetic. Curiously, given that its alleged principles are as bizarre as those on any other sort of pre-scientific medicine, acupuncture seemed to gain somewhat more plausibility than other forms of alternative medicine. The good thing about that is that more research has been done on acupuncture than on just about any other fringe practice. The outcome of this research, we propose, is that the benefits of acupuncture, if any, are too small and too transient to be of any clinical significance. It seems that acupuncture is little or no more than a theatrical placebo. The evidence for this conclusion will now be discussed. Three things that are not relevant to the argument There is no point in discussing surrogate outcomes such as fMRI studies or endorphine release studies until such time as it has been shown that patients get a useful degree of relief. It is now clear that they don't. There is also little point in invoking individual studies. Inconsistency is a prominent characteristic of acupuncture research: the heterogeneity of results poses a problem for meta-analysis. Consequently it is very easy to pick trials that show any outcome whatsoever. Therefore we shall consider only meta-analyses. The argument that acupuncture is somehow more holistic, or more patient-centred, than medicine seems us to be a red herring. All good doctors are empathetic and patient-centred. The idea that empathy is restricted to those who practice unscientific medicine seems both condescending to doctors, and it verges on an admission that empathy is all that alternative treatments have to offer. There is now unanimity that the benefits, if any, of acupuncture for analgesia, are too small to be helpful to patients. Large multicenter clinical trails conducted in Germany { [Linde et al., al, 2005](/Witt-2005-Lancet.pdf)), and in the United States { [Cherkin et al, 2009](http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=414934#qundefined)) consistently revealed that verum (or true) acupuncture and sham acupuncture treatments are no different in decreasing pain levels across multiple chronic pain disorders: migraine, tension headache, low back pain, and osteoarthritis of the knee. If, indeed, sham acupuncture is no different from real acupuncture the apparent improvement that may be seen after acupuncture is merely a placebo effect. Furthermore it shows meridians don't exist, so the \"theory\" memorized by qualified acupuncturists is just myth. All that remains to be discussed is whether or not the placebo effect is big enough to be useful, and whether it is ethical to prescribe placebos. Some recent meta-analyses have found that there may be a small difference between sham and real acupuncture. [Madsen G\u00f8tzsche & Hr\u00f3bjartsson {2009)](http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.a3115?view=long&pmid=19174438) looked at thirteen trials with 3025 patients, in which acupuncture was used to treat a variety of painful conditions. There was a small difference between 'real' and sham acupuncture (it didn't matter which sort of sham was used), and a somewhat bigger difference between the acupuncture group and the no-acupuncture group. The crucial result was that even this bigger difference corresponded to only a 10 point improvement on a 100 point pain scale. A consensus report ( [Dworkin, 2009](/Dworkin-Pain-2009.pdf)) that a change of this sort should be described as a \"minimal\" change or \"little change\". It isn't big enough for the patient to notice much effect. The acupuncture and no-acupuncture groups were, of course, not blind to the patients and neither were they blind to the practitioner giving the treatment. It isn't possible to say whether the observed difference is a real physiological action or whether it's a placebo effect of a rather dramatic intervention. Interesting though it would be to know this, it matters not a jot, because the effect just isn't big enough to produce any tangible benefit. Publication bias is likely to be an even greater problem for alternative medicine than it is for real medicine, so it is particularly interesting that the result just described has been confirmed by authors who practise, or sympathise with, acupuncture. [Vickers et al. (2012)](/vickers-acupuncture-2012.pdf) did a meta-analysis for 29 RCTs, with 17,922 patients. The patients were being treated for a variety of chronic pain conditions. The results were very similar to those of [Madsen et al.{2009)](http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.a3115?view=long&pmid=19174438). Real acupuncture was better than sham, but by a tiny amount that lacked any clinical significance. Again there was a somewhat larger difference in the non-blind comparison of acupuncture and no-acupuncture, but again it was so small that patients would barely notice it. Comparison of these two meta-analyses shows how important it is to read the results, not just the summaries. Although the outcomes were similar for both, the spin on the results in the abstracts (and consequently the tone of media reports) was very different. An even more extreme example of spin occurred in the CACTUS trial of acupuncture for \" 'frequent attenders' with medically unexplained symptoms\" ( [Paterson et al., 2011](/paterson-acu-BJGP-2011.pdf)). In this case, the results showed very little difference even between acupuncture and no-acupuncture groups, despite the lack of blinding and lack of proper controls. But by ignoring the problems of multiple comparisons the authors were able to pick out a few results that were statistically significant, though trivial in size. But despite this unusually negative outcome, the result was trumpeted as a success for acupuncture. Not only the authors, but also their university's PR department and even the Journal editor issued highly misleading statements. This gave rise to [a flood of letters](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/rcgp/bjgp/2011/00000061/00000589) to the British Journal of General Practice and [much criticism on the internet](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4439). From the intellectual point of view it would be interesting to know if the small difference between real and sham acupuncture found in some, but not all, recent studies is a genuine effect of acupuncture or whether it is a result of the fact that the practitioners are never blinded, or of publication bias. But that knowledge is irrelevant for patients. All that matters for them is whether or not they get a useful degree of relief. There is now unanimity between acupuncturists and non-acupuncturists that any benefits that may exist are too small to provide any noticeable benefit to patients. That being the case it's hard to see why acupuncture is still used. Certainly such an accumulation of negative results would result in the withdrawal of any conventional treatment. Specific conditions Acupuncture should, ideally, be tested separately for effectiveness for each individual condition for which it has been proposed (like so many other forms of alternative medicine, that's a very large number). Good quality trials haven't been done for all of them. It's unlikely that acupuncture works for rheumatoid arthritis, stopping smoking, irritable bowel syndrome or for losing weight. And there is no good reason to think it works for addictions, asthma, chronic pain, depression, insomnia, neck pain, shoulder pain or frozen shoulder, osteoarthritis of the knee, sciatica, stroke or tinnitus and many other conditions ( [Ernst et al., 2011](/Ernst-2011-AcupunctAlleviatePainRiskReview.pdf)). In 2009, the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) did recommend both [acupuncture and chiropractic for back pain](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1516). This exercise in clutching at straws caused something of [a furore](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1593). In the light of NICE's judgement the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based medicine updated its analysis of acupuncture for back pain. [Their verdict was](http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/painpag/Chronrev/Other/acuback.html) \"Clinical bottom line. Acupuncture is no better than a toothpick for treating back pain.\" The paper by [Artus et al. (2010)](http://www.dcscience.net/artus-rheumatology-2010.pdf) is of particular interest for the problem of back pain. Their Fig 2 shows that there is a modest improvement in pain scores after treatment, but much the same effect, with the same time course is found regardless of what treatment is given, and even with no treatment at all. They say \"we found evidence that these responses seem to follow a common trend of early rapid improvement in symptoms that slows down and reaches a plateau 6 months after the start of treatment, although the size of response varied widely. We found a similar pattern of improvement in symptoms following any treatment, regardless of whether it was index, active comparator, usual care or placebo treatment\". It seems that most of what's being seen is regression to the mean. And that is very likely to be the main reason why acupuncture sometimes appears to work when it doesn't. Although the article by Wang et al (2012) was written to defend the continued use of acupuncture, the only condition for which they claim that there is any reasonably strong evidence is for post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV). It would certainly be odd if a treatment that had been advocated for such a wide variety of conditions turned out to work only for PONV. Nevertheless, let's look at the evidence. The main papers that are cited to support the efficacy of acupuncture in alleviation of PONV are all from the same author: [Lee & Done (1999)](/Lee-Done-1999.pdf), and two Cochrane reviews, [Lee & Done (2004)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003281.pub2/full), updated in [Lee & Fan (2009)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003281.pub3/full). We need only deal with this latest updated meta-analysis. Although the authors conclude \"P6 acupoint stimulation prevented PONV\", closer examination shows that this conclusion is very far from certain. Even taken at face value, a relative risk of 0.7 can't be described as \"prevention\". The trials that were included were not all tests of acupuncture but included several other more or less bizarre treatments (\"acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, transcutaneous nerve stimulation, laser stimulation, capsicum plaster, an acu-stimulation device, and acupressure\"). The number needed to treat varied from a disastrous 34 to a poor 5 for patients with control rates of PONV of 10% and 70% respectively. The meta-analysis showed, on average, similar effectiveness for acupumcture and anti-emetic drugs. The problem is that the effectiveness of drugs is in doubt because an update to the Cochrane review has been delayed ( [Carlisle, 2012](/carlisle-PONV-2012.pdf)) by the discovery of major Japanese anesthetist, Yoshitaka Fujii ( [Sumikawa, 2012](http://www.anesth.or.jp/english/pdf/news20120629.pdf)). It has at all ( [Bandolier, 2012](http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/band71/b71-8.html); [Henzi, 1999](http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/83/5/761.full.pdf)). Of the 40 trials (4858 participants) that were included; only four trials reported adequate allocation concealment. Ninety percent of trials were open to bias from this source. Twelve trials did not report all outcomes. The opportunities for bias are obvious. The authors themselves describe all estimates as being of \"Moderate quality\" which is defined this: \"Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate\". That being the case, perhaps the conclusion should have been \"more research needed\". In fact almost all trials of alternative medicines seem to end up with the conclusion that more research is needed. Conclusions It is clear from meta-analyses that results of acupuncture trials are variable and inconsistent, even for single conditions. After thousands of trials of acupuncture, and hundreds of systematic reviews ( [Ernst et al., 2011](/Ernst-2011-AcupunctAlleviatePainRiskReview.pdf)), arguments continue unabated. In 2011, Pain carried [an editorial](/Hall-Pain-editorial-on-Ernst-2011.pdf) which summed up the present situation well. \"Is there really any need for more studies? Ernst et al. (2011) point out that the positive studies conclude that acupuncture relieves pain in some conditions but not in other very similar conditions. What would you think if a new pain pill was shown to relieve musculoskeletal pain in the arms but not in the legs? The most parsimonious explanation is that the positive studies are false positives. In his seminal article on why most published research findings are false, [Ioannidis (2005)]points out that when a popular but ineffective treatment is studied, false positive results are common for multiple reasons, including bias and low prior probability.\" Since it has proved impossible to find consistent evidence after more than 3000 trials, it is time to give up. It seems very unlikely that the money that it would cost to do another 3000 trials would be well-spent. A small excess of positive results after thousands of trials is most consistent with an inactive intervention. The small excess is predicted by poor study design and publication bias. Further, [Simmons et al (2011)](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/11/1359.full) demonstrated that exploitation of \"undisclosed flexibility in data collection and analysis\" can produce statistically positive results even from a completely nonexistent effect. With acupuncture in particular there is documented profound bias among proponents ( [Vickers et al., 1998](/Vickers_1998_Controlled-Clinical-Trials.pdf)). Existing studies are also contaminated by variables other than acupuncture - such as the frequent inclusion of \"electroacupuncture\" which is essentially transdermal electrical nerve stimulation masquerading as acupuncture. The best controlled studies show a clear pattern - with acupuncture the outcome does not depend on needle location or even needle insertion. Since these variables are what define \"acupuncture\" the only sensible conclusion is that acupuncture does not work. Everything else is the expected noise of clinical trials, and this noise seems particularly high with acupuncture research. The most parsimonious conclusion is that with acupuncture there is no signal, only noise. The interests of medicine would be best-served if we emulated the Chinese Emperor Dao Guang and issued an edict stating that acupuncture and moxibustion should no longer be used in clinical practice. No doubt acupuncture will continue to exist on the High Streets where they can be tolerated as a voluntary self-imposed tax on the gullible (as long as they don't make unjustified claims). | | REFERENCES | | 1.

Since this page was posted on May 30, it has had over 20,000 page views. Not bad. 26 July 2013. The Observer had a large [double-page spread about acupuncture](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jul/26/acupuncture-sceptics-proof-effective-nhs?commentpage=1). It was written by David Derbyshire, largely on the basis of this article. 26 December 2013 Over christmas the flow of stuff that misrepresents the \"thousands of years\" of Chinese medicine has continued unabated. Of course one expects people who are selling Chinese herbs and acupuncture to lie. All businesses do. One does not expect such misrepresentation from [British Columbia](http://www.vancouversun.com/health/help+with+medicine+school/9314243/story.html), [Cardiff University School of medicine](http://yottafire.com/2013/12/combining-chinese-western-medicine-lead-new-cancer-treatments/), or from [Yale University](http://tyglobalist.org/in-the-magazine/glimpses/traditional-chinese-medicine-finding-a-modern-niche-for-ancient-cures/#comment-8777). I left a comment on the Yale piece. Whether it passes moderation remains to be seen. Just in case, here it is. One statement is undoubtedly baseless \"\"If it's still in use after a thousand years there must be something right,\" It's pretty obvious to the most casual observer that many beliefs that have been round for a thousand years have proved to be utterly wrong. In any case, it's simply not true that most \"Traditional\" Chinese medicine has been around for thousands of years. Acupuncture was actually banned by the Emperor Dao Guang in 1822. The sort of Chinese medicine that is sold (very profitably) to the west was essentially dead in China until it was revived by Mao as part of the great proletarian cultural revolution (largely to stir up Chinese nationalism at that time). Of course he didn't use it himself. This history has been documented in detail now, and it surprises me to see it misrepresented, yet again, from a Yale academic. Of course there might turn out to be therapeutically useful chemicals in Chinese herbs (it has happened with artemesinin). But it is totally irresponsible to pretend that great things are coming in the absence of good RCTs in human patients. Yale should be ashamed of PR like this. And so should Cardiff University. It not only makes the universities look silly. It corrupts the whole of the rest of these institutions. Who knows how much more of their PR is mere puffery. 18 January 2014. I checked the [Yale posting](http://tyglobalist.org/in-the-magazine/glimpses/traditional-chinese-medicine-finding-a-modern-niche-for-ancient-cures/#comment-8777) and found that the comment, above, had indeed been deleted. There is little point in having comments if you are going to delete anything that's mildly critical. It is simply dishonest. The Scottish Universities Medical Journal asked me to write about the regulation of alternative medicine. It's an interesting topic and not easy to follow because of the veritable maze of more than twenty overlapping regulators and quangos which fail utterly to protect the public against health fraud. In fact they mostly promote health fraud. The paper is [now published](http://sumj.dundee.ac.uk/data/uploads/epub-article/016-sumj.epub.pdf), and here is a version with embedded links (and some small updates). We are witnessing an increasing commercialisation of medicine. It's really taken off since the passage of the Health and Social Security Bill into law. Not only does that mean having NHS hospitals run by private companies, but it means that \"any qualified provider\" can bid for just about any service. The problem lies, of course, in what you consider \"qualified\" to mean. Any qualified homeopath or herbalist will, no doubt, be eligible. University College London Hospital advertised for a spiritual healer. The \"person specification\" specified a \"quallfication\", but only HR people think that a paper qualification means that spiritual healing is anything but a delusion. The vocabulary of bait and switch First, a bit of vocabulary. Alternative medicine is a term that is used for medical treatments that don't work (or at least haven't been shown to work). If they worked, they'd be called \"medicine\". The anti-malarial, artemesinin, came originally from a Chinese herb, but once it had been purified and properly tested, it was no longer alternative. But the word alternative is not favoured by quacks. They prefer their nostrums to be described as \"complementary\" -it sounds more respectable. So CAM (complementary and alternative medicine became the politically-correct euphemism. Now it has gone a stage further, and the euphemism in vogue with quacks at the moment is \"integrated\" or \"integrative\" medicine. That means, very often, integrating things that don't work with things that do. But it sounds fashionable. In reality it is designed to confuse politicians who ask for, say, integrated services for old people. Put another way, the salespeople of quackery have become rather good at bait and switch. The wikepedia definition is as good as any. Bait-and-switch is a form of fraud, most commonly used in retail sales but also applicable to other contexts. First, customers are \"baited\" by advertising for a product or service at a low price; second, the customers discover that the advertised good is not available and are \"switched\" to a costlier product. As applied to the alternative medicine industry, the bait is usually in the form of some nice touchy-feely stuff which barely mentions the mystical nonsense. But when you've bought into it you get the whole panoply of nonsense. Steven Novella has [written eloquently](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/the-bait-and-switch-of-unscientific-medicine/) about the use of bait and switch in the USA to sell chiropractic, acupuncture, homeopathy and herbal medicine: \"The bait is that CAM offers legitimate alternatives, the switch is that it primarily promotes treatments that don't work or are at best untested and highly implausible.\". The \"College of Medicine\" provides a near-perfect example of bait and switch. It is the direct successor of the Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health. The Prince's Foundation was a consistent purveyor of dangerous medical myths. When it collapsed in 2010 because of a financial scandal, a company was formed called \"The College for Integrated Health\". [A slide show](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), not meant for public consumption, said \"The College represents a new strategy to take forward the vision of HRH Prince Charles\". But it seems that too many people have now tumbled to the idea that \"integrated\", in this context, means barmpottery. Within less than a month, the new institution was renamed \"The College of Medicine\". That might be a deceptive name, but it's a much better bait. That's why I described the College as a [fraud and delusion](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632). Not only did the directors, all of them quacks, devise a respectable sounding name, but they also succeeded in recruiting some respectable-sounding people to act as figureheads for the new organisation. The president of the College is Professor Sir Graham Catto, emeritus professor of medicine at the University of Aberdeen. Names like his make the bait sound even more plausible. He claims not to believe that homeopathy works, but seems quite happy to have a homeopathic pharmacist, Christine Glover, on the [governing council of his college](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council). At least half of the governing Council can safely be classified as quacks. So the bait is clear. What about the switch? The first thing to notice is that the whole outfit is skewed towards private medicine: see [ The College of Medicine is in the pocket of Crapita Capita](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5295). The founder, and presumably the main provider of funds (they won't say how much) is the huge outsourcing company, Capita. This is company known in Private Eye as Crapita. Their inefficiency is legendary. They are the folks who messed up the NHS computer system and the courts computer system. After swallowing large amounts of taxpayers' money, they failed to deliver anything that worked. Their latest failure is the [court translation service](http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/mar/02/interpreters-courts-protest-privatised-contract).. The president (Catto), the vice president (Harry Brunjes) and the CEO (Mark Ratnarajah) are all employees of Capita. The second thing to notice is that their conferences and courses are a bizarre mixture of real medicine and pure quackery. Their 2012 conference had some very good speakers, but then it had [ a \"herbal workshop\" with Simon Mills](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5360) (see a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=lGhp0PNHVnc)) and David Peters (the man who tolerates [dowsing as a way to diagnose](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4541) which herb to give you). The other speaker was Dick Middleton, who represents the huge herbal company, Schwabe (I debated with him [on BBC Breakfast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3RZ6K0Ng0c&feature=player_embedded)), In fact the College's [Faculty of Self-care](/COM-Self-care.pdf) appears to resemble a marketing device for Schwabe. Why regulation isn't working, and can't work There are various levels of regulation. The \"highest\" level is the statutory regulation of osteopathy and chiropractic. The General Chiropractic Council (GCC) has exactly the same legal status as the General Medical Council (GMC). This ludicrous state of affairs arose because nobody in John Major's government had enough scientific knowledge to realise that chiropractic, and some parts of osteopathy, are pure quackery, The problem is that organisations like the GCC function more to promote chiropractic than to regulate them. This became very obvious when the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) decided to sue Simon Singh for defamation, after he described some of their treatments as [\"bogus\", \"without a jot of evidence\"](http://jackofkent.blogspot.co.uk/2010/02/good-day-in-court.html). In order to support Singh, several bloggers assessed the \"plethora of evidence\" which the BCA said could be used to justify their claims. When, 15 months later, the BCA produced its \"plethora\" it was shown within 24 hours that the evidence was pathetic. The demolition was summarised by lawyer, David Allen Green, in [The BCA's Worst Day](http://jackofkent.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/bcas-worst-day-yet.html). In the wake of this, over 600 complaints were made to the GCC about unjustified claims made by chiropractors, thanks in large part to heroic work by two people, [Simon Perry](http://adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/500-chiropractors-reported-to-trading.html) and [Allan Henness](http://www.zenosblog.com/2009/06/omnibus-complaint-to-the-general-chiropractic-council/). Simon Perry's [Fishbarrel](http://adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/fishbarrel-easy-way-to-report.html) (browser plugin) allows complaints to be made quickly and easily -try it). The majority of these complaints were rejected by the GCC, apparently on the grounds that chiropractors could not be blamed because the false claims had been endorsed by the GCC itself. My own complaint was based on phone calls to two chiropractors, [I was told](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1542) such nonsense as \"colic is down to, er um, faulty movement patterns in the spine\". But my complaint never reached the Conduct and Competence committee because it had been judged by a preliminary investigating committee that there was no case to answer. The impression one got from this (very costly) exercise was that the GCC was there to protect chiropractors, not to protect the public. The outcome was a disaster for chiropractors, wno emerged totally discredited. It was also a disaster for the GCC which was forced to admit that it hadn't properly advised chiropractors about what they could and couldn't claim. The recantation culminated in the [GCC declaring, in August 2010](http://www.gcc-uk.org/files/link_file/Guidance_on_claims_made_for_the_chiropractic_VSC_18August10.pdf), that the mythical \"subluxation\" is a \"historical concept \" \"It is not supported by any clinical research evidence that would allow claims to be made that it is the cause of disease.\". Subluxation was a product of the fevered imagination of the founder of the chiropractic cult, D.D. Palmer. It referred to an imaginary spinal lesion that he claimed to be the cause of most diseases. .Since 'subluxation' is the only thing that's distinguished chiropractic from any other sort of manipulation, the admission by the GCC that it does not exist, after a century of pretending that it does, is quite an admission. The President of the BCA himself [admitted in November 2011](http://chiropracticreport.com/portal/images/back_issues/No_%206%20-%20Nov%202011.pdf) \"The BCA sued Simon Singh personally for libel. In doing so, the BCA began one of the darkest periods in its history; one that was ultimately to cost it financially,\" As a result of all this, the deficiencies of chiropractic, and the deficiencies of its regulator were revealed, and advertisements for chiropractic are somewhat less misleading. But this change for the better was brought about entirely by the unpaid efforts of bloggers and a few journalists, and not at all by the official regulator, the GCC. which was part of the problem. not the solution. And it was certainly not helped by the organisation that is meant to regulate the GCC, the Council for Health Regulatory Excellence (CHRE) which did nothing whatsoever to stop the farce. At the other end of the regulatory spectrum, voluntary self-regulation, is an even worse farce than the GCC. They all have grand sounding \"Codes of Practice\" which, in practice, the ignore totally. The Society of Homeopaths is just a joke. When homeopaths were caught out recommending [sugar pills for prevention of malaria](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2855), they did nothing (arguably such homicidal advice deserves a [jail sentence](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1661)). The Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) is widely know in the blogosphere as Ofquack. I know about them from the inside, having [been a member of](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3311) their Conduct and Competence Committee, It was set up with the help of a \u00a3900,000 grant from the Department of Health to the Prince of Wales, to oversee voluntary self-regulation. It fails utterly to do anything useful.. The CNHC code of practice, paragraph 15 , states \"Any advertising you undertake in relation to your professional activities must be accurate. Advertisements must not be misleading, false, unfair or exaggerated\". When [Simon Perry made a complaint](http://adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/cnhc-wishes-to-place-on-formal-record_27.html) to the CNHC about claims being made by a CNHC-registered reflexologist, the Investigating Committee upheld all 15 complaints. But it then went on to say that there was no case to answer because the unjustified claims were what the person had been taught, and were made in good faith. This is precisely the ludicrous situation which will occur again and again if reflexologists (and many other alternative therapies) are \"accredited\". The CNHC said, correctly, that the reflexologist had been taught things that were not true, but then did nothing whatsoever about it apart from toning down the advertisements a bit. They still register reflexologists who make outrageously false claims. Once again we see that no sensible regulation is possible for subjects that are pure make-believe. The first two examples deal (or rather, fail to deal) with regulation of outright quackery. But there are dozens of other quangos that sound a lot more respectable. European Food Standards Agency (EFSA). One of the common scams is to have have your favourite quack treatment classified as a food not as a medicine. The laws about what you can claim have been a lot laxer for foods. But the EFSA has done a pretty good job in stopping unjustified claims for health benefits from foods. Dozens of claims made by makers of probiotics have been banned. The food industry, needless to say, objects very strongly to be being forced to tell the truth. In my view, the ESFA has not gone far enough. They recently [issued a directive](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:136:FULL:EN:PDF) about claims that could legally be made. Some of these betray the previously high standards of the EFSA. For example you are allowed to say that \"Vitamin C contributes to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue\" (as long as the product contains above a specified amount of Vitamin C. I'm not aware of any trials that show vitamin C has the slightest effect on tiredness or fatigue, Although these laws do not come into effect until December 2012, they have already been [invoked by the ASA](http://www.asa.org.uk/ASA-action/Adjudications/2012/6/Natures-Best-Health-Products-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_179089.aspx) has a reason not to uphold a complaint about a multivitamin pill which claimed that it \"Includes 8 nutrients that can contribute to the reduction in tiredness and fatigue\" The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). This is almost the only organisation that has done a good job on false health claims. Their [Guidance on Health Therapies & Evidence](http://www.asa.org.uk/Resource-Centre/Hot-Topics/~/media/Files/ASA/Misc/Guidance%20on%20Health%20Therapies%20and%20Evidence%20QA%20%28Sept%202011%29.ashx) says \"Whether you use the words 'treatment', 'treat' or 'cure', all are likely to be seen by members of the public as claims to alleviate effectively a condition or symptom. We would advise that they are not used\" \"Before and after' studies with little or no control, studies without human subjects, self-assessment studies and anecdotal evidence are unlikely to be considered acceptable\" \"Before and after' studies with little or no control, studies without human subjects, self-assessment studies and anecdotal evidence are unlikely to be considered acceptable\" They are spot on. The ASA's [Guidance for Advertisers of Homeopathic Services](http://www.asa.org.uk/Resource-Centre/Hot-Topics/~/media/Files/CAP/CAP/Guidance%20for%20Advertisers%20of%20Homeopathic%20Services%20September%20%28Sept%202011%29.ashx) is wonderful. \"In the simplest terms, you should avoid using efficacy claims, whether implied or direct,\" \"To date, the ASA has have not seen persuasive evidence to support claims that homeopathy can treat, cure or relieve specific conditions or symptoms.\" That seems to condemn the (mis) [labelling allowed by the MHRA](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=28) as breaking the rules.. Sadly, though, the ASA has no powers to enforce its decisions and [only too often they are ignored](http://www.asa.org.uk/~/media/Files/ASA/Misc/3rd%20Letter%20to%20Homeopathy%20Adv%203.ashx). The [Nightingale collaboration](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/) has produced an [excellent letter](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/images/stories/POS_advertising_of_homeopathic_products.pdf) that you can hand to any pharmacist who breaks the rules The ASA has also [judged against claims](http://nightingale-collaboration.org/news/111-working-within-the-qcranial-paradigmq.html) made by \"Craniosacral therapists\" (that's the lunatic fringe of osteopathy). They will presumably uphold complaints about [similar claims](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4213) made (I'm ashamed to say) by UCLH Hospitals. The private examination company Edexcel sets [exams in antiscientific subjects](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=454), so miseducating children. The teaching of quackery to 16 year-olds has been approved by a maze of quangos, none of which will take responsibility, or justify their actions. So far [ I've located no fewer than eight](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=454) of them. The Office of the Qualifications and Examinations Regulator (OfQual), Edexcel, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), Skills for Health, Skills for Care, National Occupational Standards (NOS), private exam company VTCT and the schools inspectorate, Ofsted.. Asking any of these people why they approve of examinations in imaginary subjects meets with blank incomprehension. They fail totally to protect tha public from utter nonsense. The Department of Education has failed to do anything about the miseducation of children in quackery. In fact it has encouraged it by, for the first time, giving taxpayers' money to a Steiner (Waldorf) school (at Frome, in Somerset). Steiner schools are run by a secretive and cult-like body of people ( [read about it](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Steiner+Waldorf)). They teach about reincarnation, karma, gnomes, and all manner of nonsense, sometimes with unpleasant racial overtones. The [teachers are trained ](http://www.james-gray.org/heavenly-beings-and-astral-forces/)in Steiner's Anthroposophy, so if your child gets ill at school they'll probably get homeopathic sugar pills. They might well get measles or mumps too, since Steiner people don't believe in vaccination. Incredibly, the University of Aberdeen came perilously close to appointing a [chair in anthroposophical medicine.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5261) This disaster was aborted [by bloggers](http://www.james-gray.org/heavenly-beings-and-astral-forces/), and a last minute intervention [from journalists](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5261). Neither the university's regulatory mechanisms. nor any others, seemed to realise that a chair in [mystical barmpottery](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3528) was a bad idea. Trading Standards offices and the Office of Fair Trading. It is the statutory duty of Trading Standards to enforce the Consumer Protection Regulations (2008) This European legislation is pretty good. it caused a lawyer to write \" [Has The UK Quietly Outlawed \"Alternative\" Medicine?\". ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=790) Unfortunately Trading Standards people have consistently refused to enforce these laws. The whole organisation is a mess. Its local office arrangement fails totally to deal with the age of the internet. The situation is so bad that a group of us decided to put them to the test. The results were published in the Medico-Legal Journal, Rose et al., 2012. [\"Spurious Claims for Health-care Products](http://www.dcscience.net/Rose-medico-legal-2012.pdf): An Experimental Approach to Evaluating Current UK Legislation and its Implementation\". They concluded \"EU directive 2005/29/EC is largely ineffective in preventing misleading health claims for consumer products in the UK\" Skills for Health is an enormous quango which produces HR style \"competences\" for everything under the son. They are mostly quite useless. But those concerned with alternative medicine are not just useless. [They are positively harmful.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=215'#sfh) Totally barmy. There are competences and National Occupational Standards for every lunatic made-up therapy under the sun. When I phoned them to discover who'd written them, I learned that the had been drafted by the Prince of Wales' Foundation for Magic Medicine. And when I joked by asking if they had a competence for talking to trees, I was told, perfectly seriously, \"You'd have to talk to LANTRA, the land-based organisation for that.\" That was in January 2008. A lot of correspondence with the head of Skills for Health got nowhere at all. She understood nothing and it hasn't improved a jot. This organisation costs a lot of taxpayers' money and it should have been consigned to the \"bonfire of the quangos\" (but of course there was no such bonfire in reality). It is a disgrace. The Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) is supposed to ensure the quality of university courses. In fact it endorses courses in nonsense alternative medicine and so does more harm than good. The worst recent failure of the QAA was in the case of the University of Wales: see [Scandal of the University of Wales and the Quality Assurance Agency](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3675). The university was making money by validating thousands of external degrees in everything from fundamentalist theology to Chinese Medicine. These validations were revealed as [utterly incompetent](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259) by bloggers, and later by BBC Wales journalist Ciaran Jenkins (now working for Channel 4). The mainstream media eventually caught up with bloggers. In 2010, BBC1 TV (Wales) produced an excellent TV programme that [exposed the enormous degree validation scam](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3675) run by the University of Wales. The programme can be seen on YouTube ( [Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ix4HTi9LWE), and [Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG2kBeDer-0)). The programme also exposed, incidentally, the uselessness of the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) which did nothing until the scam was exposed by TV and blogs. Eventually the QAA sent nine people to Malaysia to investigate a dodgy college that had been revealed by the BBC. The trip cost \u00a391,000. It could have been done for nothing if anyone at the QAA knew how to use Google. The outcome was that the University of Wales stopped endorsing external courses, and it was soon shut down altogether (though bafflingly, its vice-chancellor, Marc Clement was promoted). The credit for this lies entirely with bloggers and the BBC. The QAA did nothing to help until the very last moment. Throughout this saga Universities UK (UUK), has maintained its usual total passivity. They have [done nothing whatsoever](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=42) about their members who give BSc degrees in anti-scientific subjects. (UUK used to known as the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals). Council for Health Regulatory Excellence (CHRE), soon to become the PSAHSC, Back now to the CHRE, the people who failed so signally to sort out the GCC. They are being reorganised. Their [consultation document](http://www.chre.org.uk/_img/pics/library/120416_-_standards_for_consultation_-_PDF.pdf) says \"The Health and Social Care Act 20122 confers a new function on the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (the renamed Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence). From November 2012 we will set standards for organisations that hold voluntary registers for people working in health and social care occupations and we will accredit the register if they meet those standards. It will then be known as an 'Accredited Register'. \" They are trying to decide what the criteria should be for \"accreditation\" of a regulatory body. The [list of those interested](http://www.chre.org.uk/voluntaryregisters/421/) has some perfectly respectable organisations, like the [British Psychological Society](http://www.bps.org.uk/). It also contains a large number of crackpot organisations, like [Crystal and Healing International, as well as joke regulators like the CNHC](http://crystalandhealinginternational.co.uk). They already oversee the Health Professions Council (HPC) which is [due to take over Herbal medicine ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4117)and Traditional Chinese Medicine, with predictably disastrous consequences. Two of the proposed criteria for \"accreditation\" appear to be directly contradictory. Para 2.5 makes the whole accreditation pointless from the point of view of patients 2.5 It will not be an endorsement of the therapeutic validity or effectiveness of any particular discipline or treatment. Since the only thing that matters to the patient is whether the therapy works (and is safe), accrediting of organisations that ignore this will merely give the appearance of official approval of crystal healing etc etc. This appears to contradict directly A.7 The organisation can demonstrate that there either is a sound knowledge base underpinning the profession or it is developing one and makes that explicit to the public. A \"sound knowledge base\", if it is to mean anything useful at all, means knowledge that the treatment is effective. If it doesn't mean that, what does it mean? It seems that the official mind has still not grasped the obvious fact that there can be no sensible regulation of subjects that are untrue nonsense. If it is nonsense, the only form of regulation that makes any sense is the law. Please fill in the consultation. My completed return [can be downloaded](CHRE-consultation.docx) as an example, if you wish. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) should be a top level defender of truth. Its strapline is \"We enhance and safeguard the health of the public by ensuring that medicines and medical devices work and are acceptably safe.\" The MHRA did something (they won't tell me exactly what) about one of the [most cruel scams that I've ever encountered, Esperanza Homeopathic Neuropeptide](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/05/29/the-esperanza-scandal-office-of-trading-standards-useless-mhra-a-bit-better/), peddled for multiple sclerosis, at an outrageous price ( \u00a36,759 for 12 month's supply). Needless to say there was not a jot of evidence that it worked (and it wasn't actually homeopathic). Astoundingly, Trading Standards officers refused to do anything about it. The MHRA admit (when pushed really hard) that there is precious little evidence that any of the herbs work, and that homeopathy is nothing more than sugar pills. Their answer to that is to forget that bit about \"ensuring that medicines ... work\" Here's the MHRA's [Traditional Herbal Registration Certificate](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/par/documents/websiteresources/con134892.pdf) for devils claw tablets. The wording \"based on traditional use only\" has to be included because of European legislation. Shockingly, the MHRA have allowed them to relegate that to small print, with all the emphasis on the alleged indications. The pro-CAM agency NCCAM rates devil's claw as \"possibly effective\" or \"insufficient evidence\" for all these indications, but that doesn't matter because the MHRA requires no evidence whatsoever that the tablets do anything. They should, of course, added a statement to this effect to the label. They have failed in their duty to protect and inform the public by allowing this labelling. But it gets worse. Here is the MHRA's [homeopathic marketing authorisation for the homeopathic medicinal product Arnicare Arnica 30c pillules](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/par/documents/websiteresources/con049307.pdf) It is nothing short of surreal. | || | Since the pills contain nothing at all, they don't have the slightest effect on sprains, muscular aches or bruising. The wording on the label is exceedingly misleading. If you \"pregnant or breastfeeding\" there is no need to waste you doctor's time before swallowing a few sugar pills. \"Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one\". Since the pills contain nothing, it doesn't matter a damn. \"If you overdose . . \" it won't have the slightest effect because there is nothing in them And it gets worse. The MHRA-approved label specifies ACTIVE INGREDIENT. Each pillule contains 30c Arnica Montana No, they contain no arnica whatsoever. | || | It truly boggles the mind that men with dark suits and lots of letters after their names have sat for hours only to produce dishonest and misleading labels like these. When [this mislabeling](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=28) was first allowed, it was condemned by [just about every scientific society](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=30), but the MHRA did nothing.

Conclusions The regulation of alternative medicine in the UK is a farce. It is utterly ineffective in preventing deception of patients. Such improvements as have occurred have resulted from the activity of bloggers, and sometime the mainstream media. All the official regulators have, to varying extents, made things worse. The CHRE proposals promise to make matters still worse by offering \"accreditation\" to organisations that promote nonsensical quackery. None of the official regulators seem to be able to grasp the obvious fact that is impossible to have any sensible regulation of people who promote nonsensical untruths. One gets the impression that politicians are more concerned to protect the homeopathic (etc, etc) industry than they are to protect patients. Deception by advocates of alternative medicine harms patients. There are adequate laws that make such deception illegal, but they are not being enforced. The CHRE and its successor should restrict themselves to real medicine. The money that they spend on pseudo-regulation of quacks should be transferred to the MHRA or a reformed Trading Standards organisation so they can afford to investigate and prosecute breaches of the law. That is the only form of regulation that makes sense. Follow-up The shocking case of the continuing sale of \"homeopathic vaccines\" for meningitis, rubella, pertussis etc was highlighted in an [excellent TV programme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZf9mUzI4RI) by BBC South West. The failure of the MHRA and the GPC do take any effective action is a yet another illustration of the failure of regulators to do their job. I have to agree with Andy Lewis when [he concludes](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2013/01/why-does-the-mhra-not-close-down-these-homeopaths.html) \"Children will die. And the fault must lie with Professor Sir Kent Woods, chairman of the regulator.\" Since writing about anti-scientific degrees in [Nature (March 2007)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19), much has been revealed about the nonsense that is taught on these degrees. New Year's day seems like a good time to assess how far we've got, five years on. At the beginning of 2007 [UCAS](http://www.ucas.com/) (the universities central admission service) offered 45 different BSc degrees in quackery, at 16 universities. Now there are only 24 such degrees. If you exclude chiropractic and osteopathy, which all run at private colleges, with some sort of \"validation\" from a university, there are now only 18 BSc/MSc courses being offered in eight universities. Degrees in homeopathy, naturopathy and \"nutritional therapy\", reflexology and aromatherapy have vanished altogether from UCAS. In the race to provide BScs in anti-science, Middlesex University has now overhauled the long-standing leader, Westminster, by a short head. | | Michael Driscoll, vice-chancellor of Middlesex | | Let's see what's gone. The University of Central Lancashire (UCLAN) was the first to see sense. In August 2008 they [announced closure of their \"BSc\" degree in homeopathy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=249). On September 2008 they announced [ an internal review ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=252)of their courses in homeopathy. herbalism and acupuncture. The report of this review [closed down all of them in July 2009.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899) I first asked for their teaching materials in July 2006. I finally got them in December 2010, after winning an appeal to [the Information Commissioner](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1364), and then winning an appeal against that decision at an [ Information tribunal](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2485) . By the time I got them, the course had been closed for over two years. That is just as well, because it turned out that UCLAN's students were [being taught dangerous nonsense](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2628). No wonder they tried so hard to conceal it. Salford University was the next to go. They [shut down their courses](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885) in complementary medicine, homeopathy and acupuncture. In January 2009 they announced \" they are no longer considered \"a sound academic fit\" \". Shortly afterwards. a [letter appeared in The Times](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=984) from three heavyweights (plus me) congratulating the vice-chancellor on his decision. University of Westminster For many years, Westminster was the biggest supplier of BSc degrees in quackery. At the beginning of 2007 they offered 14 different BSc degrees in homeopathy, naturopathy, nutritional therapy, \"complementary therapies\", (western) herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine with acupuncture. Some of their courses were so bizarre that some of the students and even staff sent me slides which taught things like \"amethysts emit high Yin energy\". Like UCLAN, Westminster also [held an internal review](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=984). Unlike UCLAN it came to the absurd conclusion that all would be well if they injected more science into the courses. The incompetence of the review meant that those who wrote it hadn't noticed that if you try to put science into homeopathy or naturopathy, the whole subject vanishes in a puff of smoke. Nevertheless Westminster closed down entry to BSc homeopathy in March 2009 (though the subject remained as part of other courses). Three years after the [Nature article](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19), all five BSc homeopathy degrees had shut their doors. During 2011, Westminster shut down Naturopathy, Nutritional therapy, Therapeutic bodywork and Complementary Medicine. See, for example, [More dangerous nonsense from the University of Westminster: when will Professor Geoffrey Petts do something about it?](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4361) [Professor Geoffrey Petts of the University of Westminster says they \"are not teaching pseudo-science\". The facts show this is not true](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4683) [University of Westminster shuts down naturopathy, nutritional therapy, but keeps Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4704) Now Westminster has only four courses in two subjects. They still teach some dangerous and untrue things, but I suspect the writing is on the wall for these too. I have seen a document, dated 11 April 2011, which states \"The following courses have been identified as 'at risk' (School definition) and will be discussed at the APRG and University Review Group2, due to poor recruitment and high cost of delivery: Integrated Health Scheme: BSc BSc Herbal Medicine\" All but Chinese medicine and Herbal medicine have already gone. Almost there. University of Wales Since my first [post in 2008](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259) about the validation scam operated by the University of Wales, and some good investigations by BBC Wales TV, the outcome was the most spectacular so far. The entire [institution collapsed](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education-news/2011/12/29/can-education-heed-the-lessons-of-2011-91466-30025844/).

Manchester Metropolitan gets the booby prize for actually starting a new course, just as all around are closing theirs. Dr Peter Banister, who was on the committee that approved the course (but now retired), has told me \" I am sceptical in the current economic climate whether it will prove to be successful\". Let's hope he's right. But well done Westminster. Your position as the leader in antiscientific degrees has now been claimed by Middlesex University. Their \"degrees\" [ in Ayurveda](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/search/index.aspx?q=ayurveda) mark out Middlesex University as the new King of Woo. Over to you, Professor Driscoll. As vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, the buck stops with you. Both still teach Chinese and herbal medicine, which are potentially dangerous. There is not a single product from either that has marketing authorisation from the MHRA, though the MHRA has betrayed its trust by allowing misleading labelling of herbal medicines without requiring any evidence whatsoever that they work, see, for example [Why degrees in Chinese medicine are a danger to patients](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043) [More quackedemia. Dangerous Chinese medicine taught at Middlesex University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923) [Why does the MHRA refuse to label herbal products honestly? Kent Woods and Richard Woodfield tell me](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4269) Sub-degree courses In contrast to the large reduction in the number of BSc and MSc degrees, there has actually been an increase in two year foundation degrees and HND courses in complementary medicine, at places right near the [ bottom of the academic heap](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?v=wide). The subject is sinking to the bottom. With luck it will vanish entirely from universities before too long. Research-intensive Universities Although all of the degrees in magic medicine are from post-1992 universities, the subject has crept into more prestigious universities. Of these, the [University of Southampton](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4582) is perhaps the worst, because of the presence of [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956), and his defender, Stephen Holgate. Others have staunch defenders of quackery, including the University of Warwick, University of [Edinburgh](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#cumming) and [St Batholomew's](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=555). Why have all these courses closed? One reason is certainly the embarrassment caused by exposure of what's taught on the courses. Professors Petts (Westminster) and Driscoll (Middlesex) must be aware that googling their names produces references to this and other skeptical blogs on the front page. Thanks to some plain brown emails, and, after a three year battle, the Freedom of Information Act, it has been possible to show here the nonsense that has been foisted on students by some universities. Not only is this a burden on the taxpayer, but, more importantly, some of it is a danger to patients. When a course closes, it is often said that it is because of falling student numbers (though UCLAN and Salford did not use that excuse). Insofar as that is true, the credit must go to the whole of the skeptical movement that has grown so remarkably in the last few years. Ben Goldacre's \"ragged band of bloggers\" have produced a real change in universities and in society as a whole. The people who should have done the job have either been passive or an active hindrance. The list is long.

This contradicts the statement from UoW. Watch this space. 3 January 2012. Thanks to [Neil O'Connell](http://bodyinmind.com.au/research-into-back-pain-treatments/) for drawing my attention to a paper [in Pain](/white-2011-acupuncture-placebo-rct.pdf). The paper is particularly interesting because it comes from the [Southampton group](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4582) which has previously been sympathetic to acupuncture. Its authors include [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956). It shows, yet again that there is no detectable difference between real and sham acupuncture treatment. It also shows that the empathy of the practitioner has little effect: in fact the stern authoritarian practitioner may have been more effective. Patients receiving acupuncture demonstrated clinically important improvements from baseline (i.e., a 29.5% reduction in pain), but despite this, acupuncture has no specific efficacy over placebo for this group of patients. The clinical effect of acupuncture treatment and associated controls is not related to the use of an acupuncture needle, nor mediated by empathy, but is practitioner related and may be linked to the perceived authority of the practitioner.\" Sadly. the trial didn't include a no-treatment group, so it is impossible to say how much of the improvement is regression to the mean and how much is a placebo effect. The authors admit that it could be mostly the former. Surely now the misplaced confidence in acupuncture shown by some medical and university people must be in tatters. In yet another sign that even acupuncture advovates are beginning to notice that it doesn't work, a recent article [Paradoxes in Acupuncture Research: Strategies for Moving Forward](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2011/180805/), shows some fascinating squirming. 3 January 2012. The [Daily Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/degree-courses/8989183/Lie-back-and-relax-reflexology-and-aromatherapy-degrees-are-dropped.html) has carried a piece about closure of university courses, written by Michael Hanlon. On [31 January](#310112) they carried a much longer piece. 3 January 2012. It is a great pity that some physiotherapists seem to have fallen hook, line and sinker for the myths of acupuncture. Physiotherapists are, by and large, the respectable face of manipulative therapy. Their evidence base is certainly not all one would wish, but at least they are free of the outrageous mumbo humbo of chiropractors. Well, most of them are, but not the [Acupuncture Association of Chartered Physiotherapists](http://www.aacp.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=137&Itemid=149) (AACP), or, still worse, The [Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Energy Medicine](http://www.energymedphysio.org.uk/), a group that is truly away with the fairies. These organisations are bringing a very respectable job into disrepute. And the Health Professions Council, which is meant to be their regulator, has, like most regulators, done nothing whatsoever to stop it. 5 January 2012. Times Higher Education gives a history of the demise of the University of Wales, [Boom or Bust](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=418612). It's a useful timeline, but like so many journalists, it's unwilling to admit that bloggers were on to the problem long before the BBC, never mind the QAA. There was also a leader on the same topic, [Perils of the export business](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=418588&c=2). It again fails to take the QAA to task for its failures. Interviews for [Deutsche Welle](http://www.dw-world.de/) and [Middle East Broadcasting Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_Broadcasting_Center) TV. 17 January 2012 Another question answered. I just learned that the [ludicrous course in Nutritional Therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259), previously validated by the University of Wales (and a contributor to its downfall), is now being validated by, yes, you guessed, [Middlesex University](http://www.chinese-medicine.co.uk/studying/qualified-nutritional-therapist-graduates.htm). Professor Driscoll seems determined to lead his univerity to the bottom of the academic heap. His new partnership with the Northern college of Acupuncture is just [one of a long list](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/business/partners/uk/index.aspx) of validations that almost rivals that of the [late University of Wales](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4766). The course has, of course, an [enthusiastic testimonial](http://www.chinese-medicine.co.uk/studying/qualified-nutritional-therapist-graduates.htm), from a student. It starts I work full time as a team leader for a pension company but I am also a kinesiologist and work in my spare time doing kinesiology, reiki and Indian head massage. Evidently she's a believer in the barmiest and totally disproved forms of magic medicine. And Middlesex University will give her a Master of Science degree. I have to say I find it worrying that she's a team leader for a pension company. Does she also believe in the value of worthless derivatives. I wonder? 18 January 2012. the story has gone international, with an interview that I did for Deutsche Welle, [UK universities drop alternative medicine degree programs](http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15673133,00.html). I'm quoted as saying \"They're dishonest, they teach things that aren't true, and things that are dangerous to patients in some cases\". That seems fair enough. There is also an [interesting item](http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5789488,00.html) from July 2010 about pressure to drop payment for homeopathy by German health insurance 31 January 2012 The Daily Telegraph carried a prominent 1200 word account (the title wasn't mine). The [published version](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/9051103/Complementary-medicine-courses-in-universities-how-I-beat-the-varsity-quacks.html) was edited slightly. There's been no official announcement, but four more of Westminster's courses in junk medicine have quietly closed. For entry in 2011 they offer |University of Westminster (W50)||qualification| |Chinese Medicine: Hon BSc/MSci| |Nutritional Therapy (B400)||3FT Hon BSc| But Medicine: BSc| |Herbal Medicine with Foundation Year (B340)||4FT/5FT Hon BSc/MSc| At the end of 2006, Westminster was offering 14 different BSc degrees in seven flavours of junk medicine. In [October 2008](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=404104), it was eleven. This year it's eight, and next year only four degrees in two subjects. Since \"Integrated Health\" was 'merged' with Biological Sciences in May 2010, two of the original courses have been dropped each year. This September there will be a final intake for Nutrition Therapy and Naturopathy. That leaves only two, Chinese Medicine (acupuncture and (Western) Herbal Medicine. The official reason given for the closures is always that the number of applications has fallen. I'm told that the number of applications has halved over the last five or six years. If that's right, it counts as a big success for the attempts of skeptics to show the public the nonsense that's taught on these degrees. Perhaps it is a sign that we are emerging from the endarkenment. Rumour has it that the remaining degrees will eventually close too. Let's hope so. Meanwhile, here is another helping hand. There is already quite a bit here about the dangers of Chinese medicine, e.g. [here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329#tcm) and, especially, [here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043). A [submission to the Department of Health](http://www.dcscience.net/pittilo-consultation-response.pdf) gives more detail. There has been a lot on [acupuncture](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=acupuncture) here too. There is now little doubt that it's no more than a theatrical, and [not very effective](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4439), placebo. So this time I'll concentrate on Western herbal medicine. Western Herbal Medicine Herbal medicine is just a branch of pharmacology and it could be taught as such. But it isn't. It comes overlaid with much superstitious nonsense. Some of it can be seen in slides from [Edinburgh Napier University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3200) (the difference being that Napier closed that course, and Westminster hasn't) Even if it were taught properly, it wouldn't be appropriate for a BSc for several reasons. First, there isn't a single herbal that has full marketing authorisation from the MHRA. In other words, there isn't a single herb for which there is good evidence that it works to a useful extent. Second, the fact that the active principals in plants are virtually always given in an unknown dose makes them potentially dangerous. This isn't 1950s pharmacology. It's 1920s pharmacology, dating from a time before methods were worked out for standardising the potency of natural products (see [Plants as Medicines](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=205)). Third, if you are going to treat illness with chemicals, why restrict yourself to chemicals that occur in plants? It was the herbal medicine course that gave rise to the most virulent [internal complaints](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4541) at the University of Westminster. These complaints revealed the use of pendulum dowsing by some teachers on the course and the near-illegal, and certainly dangerous, teaching about herbs [in cancer](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043). Here are a few slides from Principles of Herbal Medicine(3CT0 502). The vocabulary seems to be stuck in a time warp. When I first started in the late 1950s, words like tonic, carminative, demulcent and expectorant were common Over the last 40 years all these words have died out in pharmacology, for the simple reason that it became apparent that there were no such actions. But these imaginary categories are still alive and well in the herbal world. There was a lecture on a categories of drugs so old-fashioned that I've never even heard the words: \"nervines\". and \"adaptogens\". | | | || | The \"tonics\" listed here seem quite bizarre. In the 1950s, \"tonics\" containing nux vomica (a small dose of strychnine) and gentian (tastes nasty) were common, but they vanished years ago, because they don't work. None of those named here even get a mention in | | The only 'relaxant' here for which there is the slightest evidence is Valerian. I recall tincture of Valerian in a late 1950s pharmacy. It smells terrible, According to Not much, for something that's been around for centuries. And None of this near-total lack of evidence is mentioned on the slides. | | What about the 'stimulants'? Rosemary? No evidence at all. Tea and coffee aren't medicine (and not very good stimulants for me either). | | Ginseng, on the other hand, is big business. That doesn't mean it works of course. | | Thymoleptics - antidepressants are defined as \"herbs that engender a feeling of wellbeing. They uplift the spirit, improve the mood and counteract depression\". Oats, Lemon balm, Damiana, Vervain. Lavender and Rosemary are just old bits of folklore | | | | The only serious contender here is St John's Wort. At one time this was the prize exhibit for herbalists. It has been shown to be as good as the conventional SSRIs for treatment of mild to moderate depression. Sadly it has turned out that the SSRIs are themselves barely better than placebos. [NCCAM says](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/stjohnswort/ataglance.htm) - There is scientific evidence that St. John's wort may be useful for short-term treatment of mild to moderate depression. Although some studies have reported benefits for more severe depression, others have not; for example, a large study sponsored by NCCAM found that the herb was no more effective than placebo in treating major depression of moderate severity. \"Adaptogens\" are another figment of the herbalists' imaginations. They are defined in the lecture thus. | || | Well, it would be quite nice if such drugs existed. Sadly they don't. - The evidence for using astragalus for any health condition is limited. High-quality clinical trials (studies in people) are generally lacking. Another lecture dealt with \"stimulating herbs\". No shortage of them, it seems. Well at least one of these has quite well-understood effects in pharmacology, ephedrine, a sympathomimetic amine. It isn't used much because it can be quite dangerous, even with the controlled dose that's used in real medicine. In the uncontrolled dose in herbal medicines it is downright dangerous. | || | | || | This is what [NCCAM says](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/ephedra/) about Ephedra - An NCCAM-funded study that analyzed phone calls to poison control centers found a higher rate of side effects from ephedra, compared with other herbal products. - Other studies and systematic reviews have found an increased risk of heart, psychiatric, and gastrointestinal problems, as well as high blood pressure and stroke, with ephedra use. - According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there is little evidence of ephedra's effectiveness, except for short-term weight loss. However, the increased risk of heart problems and stroke outweighs any benefits. It seems that what is taught in the BSc Herbal Medicine degree consists largely of folk-lore and old wives' tales. Some of it could be quite dangerous for patients. A problem for pharmacognosists While talking about herbal medicine, it's appropriate to mention a related problem, though it has nothing to do with the University of Westminster. My guess is that not many people have even heard of pharmacognosy. If it were not for my humble origins as an apprentice pharmacist in Grange Road, Birkenhead (you can't get much more humble than that) I might not know either. Pharmacognosy is a branch of botany, the study of plant drugs. I recall inspecting powered digitalis leaves under a microscope. In Edinburgh, in the time of the great pharmacologist John Henry Gaddum, medical students might be presented in the oral exam with a jar of calabar beans and required to talk about their anticholinesterase effects of the physostigmine that they contain. The need for pharmacognosy has now all but vanished, but it hangs on in the curriculum for pharmacy students. This has engendered a certain unease about the role of pharmacognists. They often try to justify their existence by rebranding themselves as \"phytotherapists\". There are even journals of phytotherapy. It sounds a lot more respectable that herbalism. At its best, it is more respectable, but the fact remains that there no herbs whatsoever that have well-documented medical uses. The London School of Pharmacy is a case in point. Simon Gibbons (Professor of Phytochemistry, Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry). The School of Pharmacy) has chosen, for reasons that baffle me, to throw in his lot with the reincarnated Prince of Wales Foundation known as the \" [College of Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632)\". That organisation exists largely (not entirely) to promote various forms of quackery under the euphemism \"integrated medicine\". On [their web site](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/perspectives-medicines-natural-resource) he says \"Western science is now recognising the extremely high value of herbal medicinal products . . .\", despite the fact that there isn't a single herbal preparation with efficacy sufficient for it to get marketing authorisation in the UK. This is grasping at straws, not science. The true nature of the \"College of Medicine\" is illustrated, yet again, by their \" [innovations network](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/innovations-network)\". Their idea of \"innovation\" includes the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital and the Royal London Hospital for Integrated medicine, both devoted to promoting the utterly discredited late-18th century practice of giving people pills that contain no medicine. Some \"innovation\". It baffles me that Simon Gibbons is willing to appear on the same programme as Simon Mills and [ David Peters](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22David+Peters%22), and [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956). Mills' ideas can be judged by [watching a video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6720250368336924437#) of a talk he gave in which he 'explains' \"hot and cold herbs\". It strikes me as pure gobbledygook. Make up your own mind. He too has rebranded himself as \"phytotherapist\" though in fact he's an old-fashioned herbalist with no concern for good evidence. David Peters is the chap who, as Clinical Director of the University of Westminster's ever-shrinking School of Quackery, tolerates dowsing as a way to select 'remedies'. The present chair of Pharmacognosy at the School of Pharmacy is Michael Heinrich. He, with Simon Gibbons, has written a book [Fundamentals of pharmacognosy and phytotherapy](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BEV_6SGtZJIC&pg=PA172&lpg=PA172&ots=phB98jokgG&dq=%22Simon+Gibbons%22+quack&output=html). As well as much good chemistry, it contains this extraordinary statement \"TCM [traditional Chinese medicine] still contains very many remedies which were selected by their symbolic significance rather than their proven effects; however this does not mean that they are all 'quack'remedies! There may even be some value in medicines such as tiger bone, bear gall, turtle shell, dried centipedes, bat dung and so on. The herbs, however, are well researched and are becoming increasingly popular as people become disillusioned with Western Medicine.\" It is irresponsible to give any solace at all to the wicked industries that kill tigers and torture bears to extract their bile. And it is simple untrue that \"herbs are well-researched\". Try the test, A simple test for herbalists. Next time you encounter a herbalist, ask them to name the herb for which there is the best evidence of benefit when given for any condition. Mostly they refuse to answer, as was the case with [Michael McIntyre](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4269) (but he is really an industry spokesman with few scientific pretensions). I asked Michael Heinrich, Professor of Pharmacognosy at the School of Pharmacy. Again I couldn't get a straight answer. Usually, when pressed, the two things that come up are St John's Wort and Echinacea. Let's see what The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) has to say about them. NCCAM is the branch of the US National Institutes of Health which has spent around a billion dollars of US taxpayers' money on research into alternative medicine, For all that effort they have failed to come up with a single useful treatment. Clearly [they should be shut down](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=123). Nevertheless, as an organisation that is enthusiastic about alternative medicine, their view can only be overoptimistic. For St John's Wort . [NCCAM says](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/stjohnswort/ataglance.htm) - There is scientific evidence that St. John's wort may be useful for short-term treatment of mild to moderate depression. Although some studies have reported benefits for more severe depression, others have not; for example, a large study sponsored by NCCAM found that the herb was no more effective than placebo in treating major depression of moderate severity. For Echinacea [NCCAM say](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/echinacea/ataglance.htm)s - Study results are mixed on whether echinacea can prevent or effectively treat upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold. For example, two NCCAM-funded studies did not find a benefit from echinacea, either as Echinacea purpurea fresh-pressed juice for treating colds in children, or as an unrefined mixture of Echinacea angustifolia root and Echinacea purpurea root and herb in adults. However, other studies have shown that echinacea may be beneficial in treating upper respiratory infections. If these are the best ones, heaven help the rest. Follow-up Almost all the revelations about what's taught on university courses in alternative medicine have come from [post-1992 universities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_universities). (For readers not in the UK, post-1992 universities are the many new univerities created in 1992, from former polytechnics etc, and [Russell group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_group) universities are the \"top 20\" research-intensive universities) It is true that all the undergraduate courses are in post-1992 universities, but the advance of quackademia is by no means limited to them. The teaching at [St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical School](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1143), one of the oldest, was pretty disgraceful for example, though after protests from their own students, and from me, it is now better, I believe. Quackery creeps into all universities to varying extents. The good ones (like Southampton) don't run \"BSc\" degrees, but it still infiltrates through two main sources, The first is via their HR departments, which are run by people who tend to be (I quote) \" [credulous and moronic](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=226)\" when it comes to science. The other main source is in teaching to medical students. The General Medical Council says that medical students must know something about alterantive medicine and that's quite right, A lot of their patients will use it. The problem is that the guidance is shockingly vague . \"They must be aware that many patients are interested in and choose to use a range of alternative and complementary therapies. Graduates must be aware of the existence and range of such therapies, why some patients use them, and how these might affect other types of treatment that patients are receiving.\" (from [Tomorrow's Doctors, GMC]) In many medical schools, the information that medical students get is quite accurate. At UCL and at King's (London) I have done some of the familiarisation myself. In other good medical schools, the students get some shocking stuff. [St Bartholomew's Hospital](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=555) medical School was one example. [Edinburgh University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#cumming) was another. But there is one Russell group university where alternative myths are propagated more than any other that I know about. That is the University of Southampton. In general, Southampton is a good place, I worked there for three years myself (1972 - 1975). The very first noise spectra I measured were calculated on a PDP computer in their excellent Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, before I wrote my own programs to do it. But Southanpton also has a The Complementary and Integrated Medicine Research Unit . Oddly the unit's web site, [http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk), is not a university address, and a search of the university's web site for \"Complementary and Integrated Medicine Research Unit\" produces no result. Nevertheless the unit is \"within the School of Medicine at the University of Southampton\" Notice the usual euphemisms 'complementary' and 'integrated' in the title: the word 'alternative' is never used. This sort of word play is part of the [bait and switch](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/personalized-medicine-bait-and-switch/) approach of alternative medicine. The unit is [quite big](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/people.php): ten research staff, four PhD students and two support staff It is headed by [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956). Teaching about alternative medicine to Southampton medical students. The whole medical class seems to get quite a lot compared with other places I know about. That's 250 students (210 on the 5-year course plus another 40 from the 4-year graduate-entry route). Year 1: Lecture by David Owen on 'holism' within the Foundation Course given to all 210 medical students doing the standard (5-year) course. Year 2: Lecture by Lewith (on complementary medicine, focusing on acupuncture for pain) given within the nervous systems course to the whole medical student year-group (210 students). Year 3 SBOM (scientific basis of medicine) symposium: The 3-hour session (\"Complementary or Alternative Medicine: You Decide\"). I'm told that attendance at this symposium is often pretty low, but many do turn up and all of them are officially 'expected' to attend. There is also an optional CAM special study module chosen by 20 students in year 3, but also a small number of medical students (perhaps 2 - 3 each year?) choose to do a BMedSci research project supervised by the CAM research group and involving 16-18 weeks of study from October to May in Year 4. The CAM research group also supervise postgraduate students doing PhD research. As always, a list of lectures doesn't tell you much. What we need to know is what's taught to the students and something about the people who teach it. The other interesting question is how it comes about that alternative medicine has been allowed to become so prominent in a Russell group university. It must have support from on high. In this case it isn't hard to find out where it comes from. Here are some details. Year 1 Dr David Owen [David Owen](http://www.thenaturalpractice.com/practitioners/index/?practitioner=1) is not part of Lewith's group, but a member of the Division of Medical Education headed by Dr Faith Hill (of whom, more below). He's one of the many part-time academics in this area, being also a founder of [The Natural Practice](http://www.thenaturalpractice.com/) . Owen is an advocate of homeopathy (a past president of the Faculty of Homeopathy). Homeopathy is, of course, the most barmy and discredited of all the popular sorts of alternative medicine. Among those who have discredited it is the head of the alt med unit, [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3695) himself (though oddly he [still prescribes it](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956)). And he's also a member of the [British Society of Environmental Medicine](http://www.ecomed.org.uk/) (BSEM). That sounds like a very respectable title, but don't be deceived. It is an organisation that promotes all sorts of seriously fringe ideas. All you have to do is notice that the star speaker at their 2011 conference was none other than used-to-be a doctor, Andrew Wakefield, a man who has been responsible for the death of children from measles by causing an unfounded scare about vaccination on the basis of data that turned out to [ have been falsified](http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452). There is still a [letter of support](http://www.ecomed.org.uk/the-gmc-and-dr-andrew-wakefield) for Wakefield on the BSEM web site. The BSEM [specialises in](http://www.ecomed.org.uk/practitioners) exaggerated claims about 'environmental toxins' and uses phony allergy tests like [ kinesiology](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/05/how-applied-kinesiology-can-be-used-to-justify-any-quack-treatment.html) and the [Vega test](http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/south/series2/food_sensitivity_allergy_vega_tests.shtml) that misdiagnose allergies, but provide en excuse to prescribe expensive but unproven nutritional supplements, or expensive psychobabble like \"neuro-linguistic programming\". Other registered \"ecological physicians\" include the infamous D [r Sarah Myhil](http://www.skepticat.org/2010/04/dr-myhill/)l, who, in 2010, was the subject of a [damning verdict by the GMC](http://www.drmyhill.co.uk/wiki/GMC%27s_full_verdict), and Southampton's George Lewith. If it is wrong to expose medical students to someone who believes that dose-response curves have a negative slope (the smaller the dose the bigger the effect -I know, it's crazy), then it is downright wicked to expose students to a supporter of Andrew Wakefield. David Owen's appearance on Radio Oxford, with the indomitable Andy Lewis appears on his [Quackometer blog](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/06/debating-homeopathy-on-bbc-oxford-radio.html). Year 2 Dr George Lewith Lewith is a mystery wrapped in an enigma. He's participated in some research that is quite good by the (generally pathetic) standards of the world of alternative medicine. In 2001 he showed that the [ Vega test did not work](http://www.dcscience.net/Lewith-Vega-test-01.pdf) as a method of allergy diagnosis. \"Conclusion Electrodermal testing cannot be used to diagnose environmental allergies\", published in the BMJ .[ [download reprint](http://www.dcscience.net/Lewith-Vega-test-01.pdf)]. In 2003 reprint](http://www.dcscience.net/Brien-Lewith-2003.pdf)] that showed homeopathic pills with no active ingredients had no effects: The conclusion was \"\"Ultramolecular homeopathy has no observable clinical effects\" (the word ultramolecular, in this context, means that the belladonna pills contained no belladonna). In 2010 he again concluded that homeopathic pills were no more than placebos, as described in [Despite the spin, Lewith's paper surely signals the end of homeopathy (again)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3695). [ [download reprint](http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/11/08/rheumatology.keq234.full.pdf)] What i cannot understand is that, despite his own findings, his private practice continues to prescribe the Vega machine and continues to prescribe homeopathic pills. And he continues to preach this subject to unfortunate medical students. Lewith is also one of the practitioners [recommended by BSEM](http://www.ecomed.org.uk/practitioners). He's a [director of](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263) the \"College of Medicine\". And he's also an advisor to a charity called Yes To Life. (see [A thoroughly dangerous charity: YesToLife promotes nonsense cancer treatments](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4239)). 3rd year Student Selected Unit The teaching team includes: - David Owen - Principal Clinical Teaching Fellow SoM, Holistic Physician - George Lewith - Professor of Health Research and Consultant Physician - Caroline Eyles - Homeopathic Physician - Susan Woodhead - Acupuncturist - Elaine Cooke - Chiropractic Practitioner - Phine Dahle - Psychotherapist - Keith Carr - Reiki Master - Christine Rose - Homeopath and GP - David Nicolson - Nutritionalist - Shelley Baker - Aromatherapist - Cheryl Dunford - Hypnotherapist - Dedj Leibbrandt - Herbalist More details of the teaching team [here](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/teachingteam.php). There is not a single sceptic among them, so the students don't get a debate, just propaganda. In this case. there's no need for the Freedom of Information Act. The [ handouts](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/handouts.php). and the [powerpoints](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/presentations.php) are on their web site. They seem to be proud of them Let's look at some examples Chiropractic makes an interesting case, because, in the wake of the [Singh-BCA libel case](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1980), the claims of chiropractors have been [scrutinised as never before](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1775) and most of their claims have turned out to be bogus. There is a close relationship between Lewith's unit and the Anglo-European Chiropractic College (the 3rd year module includes a visit there). In fact the handout provided for students, [Evidence for Chiropractic Care ](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/pdf/evidence_for_chiropractic_care.pdf), was written by the College. It's interesting because it provides no real evidence whatsoever for the effectiveness of chiropractic care. It's fairly honest in stating that the view at present is that, for low back pain, it isn't possible to detect any difference between the usefulness of manipulation by a physiotherapist, by an osteopath or by a chiropractor. Of course it does not draw the obvious conclusion that this makes chiropractic and osteopathy entirely redundant -you can get the same result without all the absurd mumbo jumbo that chiropractors and osteopaths love, or their high-pressure salesmanship and superfluous X-rays. Neither does it mention the sad, but entirely possible, outcome that none of the manipulations are effective for low back pain. There is, for example, no mention of the fascinating paper by Artus et al [ [download reprint](http://www.dcscience.net/artus-rheumatology-2010.pdf)]. This paper concludes \"symptoms seem to improve in a similar pattern in clinical trials following a wide variety of active as well as inactive treatments.\" This paper was brought to my attention through the blog run by the exellent physiotherapist, Neil O'Connell. [He comments](http://bodyinmind.com.au/research-into-back-pain-treatments/) \"If this finding is supported by future studies it might suggest that we can't even claim victory through the non-specific effects of our interventions such as care, attention and placebo. People enrolled in trials for back pain may improve whatever you do. This is probably explained by the fact that patients enrol in a trial when their pain is at its worst which raises the murky spectre of regression to the mean and the beautiful phenomenon of natural recovery.\" This sort of critical thinking is conspicuously absent from this (and all the other) Southampton handouts. The handout is a superb example of bait and switch: No nonsense about infant colic, innate energy or imaginary subluxations appears in it. Acupuncture is another interesting case because there is quite a lot of research evidence, in stark contrast to the rest of traditional Chinese medicine, for which there is very little research. | | There is a The message is simple and totally uncritical. It works. | | In fact there is now a broad consensus about acupuncture. (1) Real acupuncture and sham acupuncture have been found to be indistinguishable in many trials. This is the case regardless of whether the sham is a retractable needle (or even a toothpick) in the \"right\" places, or whether it is real needles inserted in the \"wrong\" places. The latter finding shows clearly that all that stuff about meridians and flow of Qi is sheer hocus pocus. It dates from a pre-scientific age and it was wrong. (2) A non-blind comparison of acupuncture versus no acupuncture shows an advantage for acupuncture. But the advantage is usually too small to be of any clinical significance. [ In all probability it is a placebo effect](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3136) -it's hard to imagine a more theatrical event than having someone in a white coat stick long needles into you, like a voodoo doll. Sadly, the placebo effect isn't big enough to be of much use. Needless to say, none of this is conveyed to the medical students of Southampton. Instead they are shown crude ancient ideas that date from long before anything was known about physiology as though they were actually true. These folks truly live in some alternative universe. Here are some samples from the acupuncture [powerpoint show](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/presentations/Acupuncture%20presentation%20Susan%20Woodhead.pdf) by Susan Woodhead. Well this is certainly a \"different diagnostic language\", but no attempt is made to say which one is right. In the mind of the acupuncurist it seems both are true. It is a characteristic of alternative medicine advocates that they have no difficulty in believing simultaneously several mutually contradictory propositions. As a final exmple of barminess, just look at the acupuncture points (allegedly) on the ear The fact that it is a favoured by some people in the Pentagon as [battlefield acupuncture](http://blogs.forbes.com/sciencebiz/2010/02/15/battlefield-acupuncture-pseudoscience-for-wounded-troops/), is more reminiscent of the mad general, Jack D. Ripper, in [Dr Strangelove](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1KvgtEnABY&feature=related) than it is of science. There is an equally uncritical [handout on acupuncture](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/pdf/_compmed_handouts_acupuncture.pdf) by Val Hopwood. It's dated March 2003, a time before some of the most valuable experiments were done. The handout says \"sham acupuncture is generally less effective than true acupuncture\", precisely the opposite of what's known now. And there are some bits that give you a good laugh, always helpful in teaching. I like \"There is little doubt that an intact functioning nervous system is required for acupuncture to produce analgesia or, for that matter, any physiological changes\" and Modern techniques: These include hybrid electro-acupuncture . . . and Ryadoraku [sic] therapy and Vega testing. Vega testing!! That's been disproved dozens of times (not least by George Lewith). And actually the other made-up nonsense is spelled [Ryodoraku](http://www.ryodoraku.eu/). It's true that there is a short paragraph at the end of the handout headed \"Scientific evaluation of acupuncture\" but it doesn't cite a single reference and reads more like excuses for why acupuncture so often fails when it's tested properly. Homeopathy. Finally a bit about that most boring of topics, the laughable medicine that contains no medicine, homeopathy. Caroline Eyles is a member for the Society of Homeopaths, the organisation that did nothing when its members were caught out in the murderous practice of recommending homeopathy for prevention of malaria. The Society of Homeopaths also [endorses Jeremy Sherr](http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2007/11/01/jeremy-sherr-fellow-of-the-society-of-homeopaths-wants-to-cure-aids-and-malaria-with-homeopathy/), a man so crazy that he believes he can cure AIDS and malaria with sugar pills. The homeopathy [handout](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/pdf/_compmed_handouts_homeopathy.pdf) given to the students has 367 references, but somehow manages to omit the references to their own boss's work showing that the pills are placebos. The handout has all the sciencey-sounding words, abused by people who don't understand them. \"The remedy will be particularly effective if matched to the specific/particular characteristics of the individual (the 'totality' of the patient) on all levels, including the emotional and mental levels, as well as just the physical symptoms. 'Resonance' with the remedy's curative power will then be at it's [sic] best.\" The handout is totally misleading about the current state of research. It says \"increasing clinical research confirms it's [sic] clinical effectiveness in treating patients, including babies and animals (where a placebo effect would be hard to justify).\" | | The | | Anyone who has to rely on the utterly discredited [Jacques Benveniste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Benveniste) as evidence is clearly clutching at straws. What's more interesting about this slide the admission that \"reproducibility is a problem -oops, an issue\" and that RCTs (done largely by homeopaths of course) have \"various methodological flaws and poor external validity\". You'd think that if that was the best that could be produced after 200 yours, they'd shut up shop and get another job. But, like aging vicars who long since stopped believing in god, but are damned if they'll give up the nice country rectory, they struggle on, sounding [increasingly desperate](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/07/1887.html). How have topics like this become so embedded in a medical course at a Russell group university? The details above are a bit tedious and repetitive. It's already established that hardly any alternative medicine works. Don't take my word for it. Check [the web site](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/atoz.htm) of the US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) who, at a cost of over $2 billion have produced nothing useful. A rather more interesting question is how a good university like Southampton comes to be exposing its medical students to teaching like this. There must be some powerful allies higher up in the university. In this case it's pretty obvious who thay are. Professor Stephen Holgate FBMS FMed Sci CBE has to be the primary suspect, He's listed as one of Southampton's [Outstanding Academics](http://www.soton.ac.uk/research/outstanding_academics/index.html). His work is nothing to do with alternative medicine but he's been a long term supporter of the late unlamented Prince of Wales' Foundation, and he's now [on the advisory board](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/professor-stephen-holgate) of it's successor, the so called \"College of Medicine\" (for more information about that place see the [new \"College of Medicine\" arising from the ashes of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), and also [Don't be deceived. The new \"College of Medicine\" is a fraud and delusion](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632) ). His description on that site reads thus. \"Stephen Holgate is MRC Clinical Professor of Immunopharmacology at the University of Southampton School of Medicine and Honorary Consultant Physician at Southampton University Hospital Trust. He is also chair of the MRC's Populations and Systems Medicine Board. Specialising in respiratory medicine, he is the author of over 800 peer-reviewed papers and contributions to scientific journals and editor of major textbooks on asthma and rhinitis. He is Co-Editor of Clinical and Experimental Allergy, Associate Editor of Clinical Science and on the editorial board of 25 other scientific journals.\" Clearly a busy man. Personally I'm deeply suspicious of anyone who claims to be the author of over 800 papers. He graduated in medicine in 1971, so that is an average of over 20 papers a year since then, one every two or three weeks. I'd have trouble reading that many, never mind writing them. Holgate's long-standing interest in alternative medicine is baffling. He's published on the topic with George Lewith, who, incidentally, is [one of the directors](http://www.dcscience.net/blREX+0L0198-7358_6-05180774.pdf) of the \"College of Medicine\".. It may be unkind to mention that, for many years now, I've been hearing rumours that Holgate is suffering from an unusually bad case of [Knight starvation](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=13#quote). The Division of Medical Education appears to be the other big source of support for. anti-scientific medicine. That is very odd, I know, but it was also the medical education people who were responsible for mis-educating medical students at. [St. Bartholomew's](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=555) and at [ Edinburgh university](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#cumming). Southampton's [Division of Medical Education](http://www.som.soton.ac.uk/research/medicaleducation/) has a mind-boggling 60 academic and support staff. Two of them are of particular interest here. Faith Hill is director of the division. [Her profile](http://www.som.soton.ac.uk/about/staff/listing/profile.asp?fhill) doesn't say anything about alternative medicine, but her interest is clear from a 2003 paper, [Complementary and alternative medicine: the next generation of health promotion?](http://www.dcscience.net/Faith-Hill-CAM.pdf). The research consisted of reporting anecdotes from interviews of 52 unnamed people (this sort of thing seems to pass for research in the social sciences). It starts badly by misrepresenting the conclusions of the [House of Lords report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=199) (2000) on CAM. Although it comes to no useful conclusions, it certainly shows a high tolerance of nonsensical treatments. Chris Stephens is Associate Dean of Medical Education & Student Experience. His sympathy is shown by a paper he wrote In 2001, with David Owen (the homeopath, above) and George Lewith: [Can doctors respond to patients' increasing interest in complementary and alternative medicine?](http://www.bmj.com/content/322/7279/154.full?ijkey=cef1ed0dd3a181def66f02738144eb35ba3f229c&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha). Two of the conclusions of this paper were as follows. \"Doctors are training in complementary and alternative medicine and report benefits both for their patients and themselves\" Well, no actually. It wasn't true then, and it's probably even less true now. There's now a lot more evidence and most of it shows alternative medicine doesn't work. \"Doctors need to address training in and practice of complementary and alternative medicine within their own organisations\" Yes they certainly need to do that. And the first thing that Drs Hill and Stephens should do is look a bit more closely about what's taught in their own university, I hope that this post helps them, Follow-up 4 July 2011. A correspondent has just pointed out that Chris Stephens is a [member of the General Chiropractic Council](http://www.gcc-uk.org/page.cfm?page_id=8). The GCC is a truly pathetic pseudo-regulator. In the wake of the Simon Singh affair it has been kept busy fending off well-justified complaints against untrue claims made by chiropractors. The [ GCC is a sad joke](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2010/11/chiropractors-at-war-with-their-regulator-the-gcc.html), but it's even sadder to see a Dean of Medical Education at the University of Southampton being involved with an organisation that has treated little matters of truth with such disdain. A rather unkind tweet from (ex)-chiropractor @RichardLanigan. \"Chris is just another light weight academic who likes being on committees. Regulatory bodies are full of them\" One wonders about the standards of peer review at the British Journal of General Practice. The June issue has a paper, \" [Acupuncture for 'frequent attenders' with medically unexplained symptoms: a randomised controlled trial (CACTUS study)](/paterson-acu-BJGP-2011.pdf)\". It has lots of numbers, but the result is very easy to see. Just look at their Figure. There is no need to wade through all the statistics; it's perfectly obvious at a glance that acupuncture has at best a tiny and erratic effect on any of the outcomes that were measured. But this is not what the paper said. On the contrary, the conclusions of the paper said | | Conclusion The addition of 12 sessions of five-element acupuncture to usual care resulted in improved health status and wellbeing that was sustained for 12 months. How on earth did the authors manage to reach a conclusion like that? The first thing to note is that many of the authors are people who make their living largely from sticking needles in people, or advocating alternative medicine. The authors are Charlotte Paterson, Rod S Taylor, Peter Griffiths, Nicky Britten, Sue Rugg, Jackie Bridges, Bruce McCallum and Gerad Kite, on behalf of the CACTUS study team. The senior author, [Gerad Kite MAc ](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/alternativemedicine/5055611/Acupuncture-Guy-of-the-needles.html), is principal of the London Institute of Five-Element Acupuncture London. The first author, [Charlotte Paterson](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=CACTUS+trial&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a#hl=en&pq=paterson%20acupuncture&xhr=t&q=%22Charlotte%20Paterson%22%20acupuncture&cp=1&pf=p&sclient=psy&cr=countryUK|countryGB&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&biw=1027&bih=751&tbs=ctr:countryUK|countryGB&source=hp&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=%22Charlotte+Paterson%22+acupuncture&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=4556e706bf640e28), is a well known advocate of acupuncture. as is [Nicky Britten](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Britten+acupuncture&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a#hl=en&pq=britten%20acupuncture&xhr=t&q=%22Nicky%20Britten%22%20acupuncture&cp=15&pf=p&sclient=psy&client=firefox-a&hs=ZN0&rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&source=hp&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=%22Nicky+Britten%22+acupuncture&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=4556e706bf640e28&biw=1027&bih=751). The conflicts of interest are obvious, but nonetheless one should welcome a \"randomised controlled trial\" done by advocates of alternative medicine. In fact the results shown in the Figure are both interesting and useful. They show that acupuncture does not even produce any substantial placebo effect. It's the authors' conclusions that are bizarre and partisan. Peer review is indeed a broken process. That's really all that needs to be said, but for nerds, here are some more details. How was the trial done? The description \"randomised\" is fair enough, but there were no proper controls and the trial was not blinded. It was what has come to be called a \"pragmatic\" trial, which means a trial done without proper controls. They are, of course, much loved by alternative therapists because their therapies usually fail in proper trials. It's much easier to get an (apparently) positive result if you omit the controls. But the fascinating thing about this study is that, despite the deficiencies in design, the result is essentially negative. The authors themselves spell out the problems. \"Group allocation was known by trial researchers, practitioners, and patients\" So everybody (apart from the statistician) knew what treatment a patient was getting. This is an arrangement that is guaranteed to maximise bias and placebo effects. \"Patients were randomised on a 1:1 basis to receive 12 sessions of acupuncture starting immediately (acupuncture group) or starting in 6 months' time (control group), with both groups continuing to receive usual care.\" So it is impossible to compare acupuncture and control groups at 12 months, contrary to what's stated in Conclusions. \"Twelve sessions, on average 60 minutes in length, were provided over a 6-month period at approximately weekly, then fortnightly and monthly intervals\" That sounds like a pretty expensive way of getting next to no effect. \"All aspects of treatment, including discussion and advice, were individualised as per normal five-element acupuncture practice. In this approach, the acupuncturist takes an in-depth account of the patient's current symptoms and medical history, as well as general health and lifestyle issues. The patient's condition is explained in terms of an imbalance in one of the five elements, which then causes an imbalance in the whole person. Based on this elemental diagnosis, appropriate points are used to rebalance this element and address not only the presenting conditions, but the person as a whole\". Does this mean that the patients were told a lot of mumbo jumbo about \"five elements\" (fire earth, metal, water, wood)? If so, anyone with any sense would probably have run a mile from the trial. \"Hypotheses directed at the effect of the needling component of acupuncture consultations require sham-acupuncture controls which while appropriate for formulaic needling for single well-defined conditions, have been shown to be problematic when dealing with multiple or complex conditions, because they interfere with the participative patient-therapist interaction on which the individualised treatment plan is developed. 37-39 Pragmatic trials, on the other hand, are appropriate for testing hypotheses that are directed at the effect of the complex intervention as a whole, while providing no information about the relative effect of different components.\" Put simply that means: we don't use sham acupuncture controls so we can't distinguish an effect of the needles from placebo effects, or get-better-anyway effects. \"Strengths and limitations: The 'black box' study design precludes assigning the benefits of this complex intervention to any one component of the acupuncture consultations, such as the needling or the amount of time spent with a healthcare professional.\" \"This design was chosen because, without a promise of accessing the acupuncture treatment, major practical and ethical problems with recruitment and retention of participants were anticipated. This is because these patients have very poor self-reported health (Table 3), have not been helped by conventional treatment, and are particularly desperate for alternative treatment options.\". It's interesting that the patients were \"desperate for alternative treatment\". Again it seems that every opportunity has been given to maximise non-specific placebo, and get-well-anyway effects. There is a lot of statistical analysis and, unsurprisingly, many of the differences don't reach statistical significance. Some do (just) but that is really quite irrelevant. Even if some of the differences are real (not a result of random variability), a glance at the figures shows that their size is trivial. My conclusions (1) This paper, though designed to be susceptible to almost every form of bias, shows staggeringly small effects. It is the best evidence I've ever seen that not only are needles ineffective, but that placebo effects, if they are there at all, are trivial in size and have no useful benefit to the patient in this case.. (2) The fact that this paper was published with conclusions that appear to contradict directly what the data show, is as good an illustration as any I've seen that peer review is utterly ineffective as a method of guaranteeing quality. Of course the editor should have spotted this. It appears that quality control failed on all fronts. Follow-up In the first four days of this post, it got over 10,000 hits (almost 6,000 unique visitors). Margaret McCartney has written about this too, in [The British Journal of General Practice does acupuncture badly](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=981). The Daily Mail exceeds itself in [an article by Jenny Hope](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1392181/Accupuncture-help-millions-patients-unexplained-symptoms.html) whch says \"Millions of patients with 'unexplained symptoms' could benefit from acupuncture on the NHS, it is claimed\". I presume she didn't read the paper. The Daily Telegraph scarcely did better in [Acupuncture has significant impact on mystery illnesses](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/alternativemedicine/8544735/Acupuncture-has-significant-impact-on-mystery-illnesses.html). The author if this, very sensibly, remains anonymous. Many \"medical information\" sites churn out the press release without engaging the brain, but most of the other newspapers appear, very sensibly, to have ignored ther hyped up press release. Among the worst was [Pulse](http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=35&storycode=4129678&c=2), an online magazine for GPs. At least they've publish the comments that show their report was nonsense. The Daily Mash has given this paper a well-deserved spoofing in [Made-up medicine works on made-up illnesses](http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3882&Itemid=77). Brubaker, of the Institute for Studies, said: \"To truly assess the efficacy of acupuncture a widespread double-blind test needs to be conducted over a series of years but to be honest it's the equivalent of mapping the DNA of pixies or conducting a geological study of Narnia.\" \" There is no truth whatsoever in the rumour being spread on Twitter that I'm Professor Brubaker. Euan Lawson, also known as Northern Doctor, has done another excellent job on the Paterson paper: [BJGP and acupuncture - tabloid medical journalism](http://northerndoctor.com/2011/06/02/bjgp-and-acupuncture-tabloid-medical-journalism/). Most tellingly, he reproduces [the press release](http://www.rcgp.org.uk/news/press_releases_and_statements/acupuncture_frequent_attenders.aspx) from the editor of the BJGP, Professor Roger Jones DM, FRCP, FRCGP, FMedSci. \"Although there are countless reports of the benefits of acupuncture for a range of medical problems, there have been very few well-conducted, randomised controlled trials. Charlotte Paterson's work considerably strengthens the evidence base for using acupuncture to help patients who are troubled by symptoms that we find difficult both to diagnose and to treat.\" Oooh dear. The journal may have a [new look](http://www.rcgp.org.uk/news/press_releases_and_statements/new_look_for_bjgp.aspx), but it would be better if the editor read the papers before writing press releases. Tabloid journalism seems an appropriate description. Andy Lewis at Quackometer, has written about this paper too, and put it into historical context. In [Of the Imagination, as a Cause and as a Cure of Disorders of the Body](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/06/of-the-imagination-as-a-cause-and-as-a-cure-of-disorders-of-the-body.html). \"In 1800, John Haygarth warned doctors how we may succumb to belief in illusory cures. Some modern doctors have still not learnt that lesson\". It's sad that, in 2011, a medical journal should fall into a trap that was pointed out so clearly in 1800. He also points out the disgracefully inaccurate [Press release](http://www.pcmd.ac.uk/news.php?id=215) issued by the Peninsula medical school.

He assured me that the matter would be discussed at a meeting of the editorial board of the journal. Tonight he sent me the result of this meeting. | | Subject: BJGP Dear Prof Colquhoun We discussed your emails at yesterday's meeting of the BJGP Editorial Board, attended by 12 Board members and the Deputy Editor The Board was unanimous in its support for the integrity of the Journal's peer review process for the Paterson et al paper - which was accepted after revisions were made in response to two separate rounds of comments from two reviewers and myself - and could find no reason either to retract the paper or to release the reviewers' comments Some Board members thought that the results were presented in an overly positive way; because the study raises questions about research methodology and the interpretation of data in pragmatic trials attempting to measure the effects of complex interventions, we will be commissioning a Debate and Analysis article on the topic. In the meantime we would encourage you to contribute to this debate throught the usual Journal channels Roger Jones Professor Roger Jones MA DM FRCP FRCGP FMedSci FHEA FRSA It is one thing to make a mistake, It is quite another thing to refuse to admit it. This reply seems to me to be quite disgraceful. 20 July 2011. The proper version of the story got wider publicity when Margaret McCartney wrote about it [in the BMJ](/McCartney-BMJ-on-BJGP.pdf). The first [rapid response](http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4606/reply#bmj_el_267995) to this article was a lengthy denial by the authors of the obvious conclusion to be drawn from the paper. They merely dig themselves deeper into a hole. The second response was much shorter (and more accurate). | | Thank you Dr McCartney Richard Watson, General Practitioner The fact that none of the authors of the paper or the editor of BJGP have bothered to try and defend themselves speaks volumes. Like many people I glanced at the report before throwing it away with an incredulous guffaw. You bothered to look into it and refute it - in a real journal. That last comment shows part of the problem with them publishing, and promoting, such drivel. It makes you wonder whether anything they publish is any good, and that should be a worry for all GPs. 30 July 2011. The [British Journal of General Practice](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/rcgp/bjgp/2011/00000061/00000589) has published nine letters that object to this study. Some of them concentrate on problems with the methods. others point out what I believe to be the main point, there us essentially no effect there to be explained. In the public interest, I am posting the responses here [ [download pdf file](/Bjgp-acupuncture-letter-july-2011.pdf)] Thers is also a response from the editor and from the authors. Both are unapologetic. It seems that the editor sees nothing wrong with the peer review process. I don't recall ever having come across such incompetence in a journal's editorial process. Here's all he has to say. | | The BJGP Editorial Board considered this correspondence recently. The Board endorsed the Journal's peer review process and did not consider that there was a case for retraction of the paper or for releasing the peer reviews. The Board did, however, think that the results of the study were highlighted by the Journal in an overly-positive manner. However,many of the criticisms published above are addressed by the authors themselves in the full paper. If you subscribe to the views of Paterson et al, you may want to [buy a T-shirt](http://controversy.wearscience.com/design/elements/) that has a revised version of the periodic table. 5 August 2011. A meeting with the editor of BJGP Yesterday I met a member of the editorial board of BJGP. We agreed that the data are fine and should not be retracted. It's the conclusions that should be retracted. I was also told that the referees' reports were \"bland\". In the circumstances that merely confirmed my feeling that the referees failed to do a good job. Today I met the editor, Roger Jones, himself. He was clearly upset by my comment and I have now changed it to refer to the whole editorial process rather than to him personally. I was told, much to my surprise, that the referees were not acupuncturists but \"statisticians\". That I find baffling. It soon became clear that my differences with Professor Jones turned on interpretations of statistics. It's true that there were a few comparisons that got below P = 0.05, but the smallest was P = 0.02. The warning signs are there in the Methods section: \"all statistical tests were .... deemed to be statistically significant if P < 0.05\". This is simply silly -perhaps they should have read [ Lectures on Biostatistics](http://www.dcscience.net/Lectures_on_biostatistics-ocr4.pdf). Or for a more recent exposition, the [XKCD cartoon](http://flowingdata.com/2011/04/08/statistical-significance-on-xkcd/) in which it's proved that green jelly beans are linked to acne (P = 0.05). They make lots of comparisons but make no allowance for this in the statistics. Figure 2 alone contains 15 different comparisons: it's not surprising that a few come out \"significant\", even if you don't take into account the likelihood of systematic (non-random) errors when comparing final values with baseline values. Keen though I am on statistics, this is a case where I prefer the eyeball test. It's so obvious from the Figure that there's nothing worth talking about happening, it's a waste of time and money to torture the numbers to get \"significant\" differences. You have to be a slavish believer in P values to treat a result like that as anything but mildly suggestive. A glance at the Figure shows the effects, if there are any at all, are trivial. I still maintain that the results don't come within a million miles of justifying the authors' stated conclusion \"The addition of 12 sessions of five-element acupuncture to usual care resulted in improved health status and wellbeing that was sustained for 12 months.\" Therefore I still believe that a proper course would have been to issue a new and more accurate press release. A brief admission that the interpretation was \"overly-positive\", in a journal that the public can't see, simply isn't enough. I can't understand either, why the editorial board did not insist on this being done. If they had done so, it would have been temporarily embarrassing, certainly, but people make mistakes, and it would have blown over. By not making a proper correction to the public, the episode has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre and the reputation oif the journal will suffer permanent harm. This paper is going to be cited for a long time, and not for the reasons the journal would wish. Misinformation, like that sent to the press, has serious real-life consequences. You can be sure that the paper as it still stands, will be cited by every acupuncturist who's trying to persuade the Department of Health that he's a \"qualified provider\". There was not much unanimity in the discussion up to this point, Things got better when we talked about what a GP should do when there are no effective options. Roger Jones seemed to think it was acceptable to refer them to an alternative practitioner if that patient wanted it. I maintained that it's unethical to explain to a patient how medicine works in terms of pre-scientific myths. I'd have love to have heard the \"informed consent\" during which \"The patient's condition is explained in terms of imbalance in the five elements which then causes an imbalance in the whole person\". If anyone had tried to explain my conditions in terms of my imbalance in my Wood, Water, Fire, Earth and Metal. I'd think they were nuts. The last author. Gerad Kite, runs a private clinic that sells acupuncture for all manner of conditions. You can find his view of science on his [web site](http://www.geradkite.com/content/content.php?pageID=7). It's condescending and insulting to talk to patients in these terms. It's the ultimate sort of paternalism. And paternalism is something that's supposed to be vanishing in medicine. I maintained that this was ethically unacceptable, and that led to a more amicable discussion about the possibility of more honest placebos. It was good of the editor to meet me in the circumstances. I don't cast doubt on the honesty of his opinions. I simply disagree with them, both at the statistical level and the ethical level. 30 March 2014 I only just noticed that one of the authors of the paper, Bruce McCallum (who worked as an acupuncturist at Kite's clinic) appeared in a 2007 Channel 4 News piece. I was a report on the pressure to save money by stopping NHS funding for [\"unproven and disproved treatments\"](http://dcscience.net/?p=135). McCallum said that scientific evidence was needed to show that acupuncture really worked. Clearly he failed, but to admit that would have affected his income. Watch the video (McCallum appears near the end). The long-awaited government decision concerning statutory regulation of herbalists, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and acupuncture came out today. [Get the Department of Health (DH) report [pdf]](http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_124338.pdf) It is not good news. They have opted for statutory regulation by the Health Professions Council (HPC). This is much what was recommended by the disgraceful [Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Pittilo), about which I wrote a [commentary in the Times](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/law/columnists/article2047617.ece) (or [free version here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=251)), and [A very bad report: gamma minus for the vice-chancellor](http://dcscience.net/?p=235). The DH report is merely an analysis of responses to the consultation, but the [MHRA says](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Medicinesregulatorynews/CON108795) \"The Health Professions Council (HPC) has now been asked to establish a statutory register for practitioners supplying unlicensed herbal medicines. The proposal is, following creation of this register, to make use of a derogation in European medicines legislation (Article 5 (1) of Directive 2001/83/EC) that allows national arrangements to permit those designated as \"authorised healthcare professionals\" to commission unlicensed medicines to meet the special needs of their patients.\" The MHRA points out that this started 11 years ago with the publication of the [ House of Lords report (2000)](http://dcscience.net/?p=199). Both that report, and the government's response to it, set the following priorities. Both state clearly \"... we recommend that three important questions should be addressed in the following order . . - (1) does the treatment offer therapeutic benefits greater than placebo? - (2) is the treatment safe? - (3) how does it compare, in medical outcome and cost-effectiveness, with other forms of treatment? The report of DH and the MHRA's response have ignored totally two of these three requirements. There is no consideration whatsoever of whether treatments work better than placebo (point one) and there is no consideration whatsoever of cost-effectiveness (point 3). These two important recommendations in the Houss of Lords report have simply been brushed under the carpet. Needless to say, herbalists are head over heels with joy at this sign of official endorsement (here is [one reaction](http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=312229)) Here are my first reactions. The post will be updated soon. The DH report is, in a sense, democratic. They have simply counted the responses, for and against each proposal. They seem to be quite unaware that most of the responses come from High Street herbailsts whose main aim is to gain respectability. The response of the Academy of Royal Medical Colleges counts as one vote, just the same as the owner of a Chinese medicine shop. This is not how health policy should be determined. Some intervention of the brain is needed, but that isn't apparent in the report. At present [the HPC regulates](http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/professions/) Arts therapists, biomedical scientists, chiropodists/podiatrists, clinical scientists, dietitians, occupational therapists, operating department practitioners, orthoptists, paramedics, physiotherapists, prosthetists/orthotists, radiographers and speech & language therapists. I shudder to think what all these good people will think about being lumped together with people who practice evidence-free medicine (or, worse, forms of medicine where there is good evidence that they don't work). The vast majority of herbalists, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and acupuncture has no good evidence that it works, In the case of soem herbal medicines and acupuncture, there is good evidence that they don't work. Yet the HPC has, as [one of its criteria](http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/newprofessions/criteria/), that aspiring to be regulated by them requires \"practise based on evidence of efficacy\" The Department of Health seems to have quietly forgotten about this criterion. It cannot possibly be met. The HPC has already expressed its willingness to go along with this two-faced approach (see [Health Professions Council ignores its own rules: the result is nonsense](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1284) ) Another mistake made by the Department of Health regards the value of \"training\". The report (page 11) says Would statutory regulation lessen the risk of harm? (Q2) Again, the vast majority of respondents thought it would. Reasons given were that statutory regulation would ensure that herbal practitioners and acupuncturists are carefully and thoroughly trained. That training is subject to accreditation, evaluation and periodic review by independent educational and training professionals, and disciplinary oversight by a regulating body. Incompetent or unscrupulous practitioners could be struck off the register and prevented from practising. Although it is pointed out to them in several responses, the Department of Health seems quite incapable of understanding a simple and obvious truth. Spending three years training people to learn things that are not true, safeguards nobody. On the contrary, it endangers the public. Training in nonsense is obviously a nonsense. At the end of the report is a list of organisations who responded, As expected, they are predominantly trade bodies that have a vested interest in allowing thinks to be sold freely regardless of whether they work or not. The first four are Alliance of Herbal Medicine Practitioners. European herbal and Traditional Medicine Practitioners Association (ETMPA), Association Chinese Medicine Practitioners (UK) (ACMP) and Acupuncture Society. And so on. More coming soon. Follow-up 16 February 2011. Later the same day, we see one reason why Michael Mcintyre, chair of the European Herbal Practitioners Association, got what he wanted to promote his trade. They had evidently hired a PR Agency, Cogitamus, to push their case. Now they are [ crowing about their victory](http://www.cogitamus.co.uk/?p=290). And of course his profits were not harmed by the free publicity that was given to his cause [ by the BBC](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2813), The pinheads in the Department of Health are more easily persuaded by a PR agency than by any number of people who know a lot more about it, and who have no profit motive. 17 February 2011. The herbal problem was front page news in the London free paper, the Metro: [Chinese medicine and herbal ban to see Britain defy EU laws](http://www.metro.co.uk/news/855767-chinese-medicine-and-herbal-ban-to-see-britain-defy-eu-laws) The Daily Telegraph covered the story: [Herbal medicine to be regulated, says Andrew Lansley](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8328791/Herbal-medicine-to-be-regulated-says-Andrew-Lansley.html). The comments featured some pretty mad rants from herbalists, to which I tried to reply. The Metro article elicited a fine bit of abuse from a Lynda Kane. I'm constantly amazed at the downright viciousness of cuddly holistic therapists when they get found out. I guess it is just another bad case of cognitive dissonance. I can't resist a few quotations. Sir, \"I have just come across your asinine comments quoted in the London Metro newspaper re the EU herbal medicine directive. For a supposed scientist your mis-informed, closed-minded, unsubstantiated bigotry leaves me speechless\" \"As a scientist myself, I abide by the virtues of open-minded neutrality and accepting the hypothesis until proven otherwise by null-hypothesis based research.\" \"How many of the innumerable studies on the efficacy of herbal medicine have you read? \" \"Perhaps in your 'day' professors could say whatever they liked and be listened to. That day is long gone, as you must know from the various law-suits you have been party to.\" I love the idea that statistics allow you to accept any hypothesis whatsoever until someone shows it to be wrong. This would be funny if it were not so sad (and rather painful). As always I replied politely and referred her to [NCCAM's Guide to Herbs](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm), so she can check up on that plethora of evidence that she seems to think exists. This is Lynda Kane of [energyawareness.org](http://energyawareness.org/). I can recommend her web site, if you want some truly jaw-dropping woo. She'll sell you a \"White Jade Energy Egg - may provide up to 5 times as much protection from wifi and from other peoples' energies - costs \u00a347.00\". Hmm, sounds good. How does it work? Easy. \"The human energy or \"qi\" field is shaped like an egg. It is being attacked by many forms of natural and man-made environmental stress 24 hours a day.\" I guess that's OK according to Ms Kane's interpretation of statistics which allows you to accept any hypothesis whatsoever until someone shows it to be wrong. Anyone for Trading Standards or the ASA? 17 February 2011. The excellent Andy Lewis has posted on similar problems \" [How to Spot Bad Regulation of Alternative Medicine](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/02/how-to-spot-bad-regulation-of-alternative-medicine.html)\" .20 July 2013 Nothing visible happened after this announcement. Until the government's resident medical loon, David Tredinnick MP forced [a debate on the matter](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#130709h0001.htm_spnew0). His introduction to the debate was his usual make-believe. Sadly it made much of [an exhibit at the Royal Society ](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=6105#030713)Summer Science exhibition -a bit of bait and swich by aromatherapists. After ploughing your way through pages of nonsense, you get to the interesting bit. At 10.38 am, The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, Dr Daniel Poulter, announced what was happening. It seems that there may, after all, have been some effect of all the [sensible submissions](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2007) which pointed out the impossibility of regulating nonsense. The question of regulation has, yet again, been postponed. \"To ensure that we take forward the matter effectively, we want to bring together experts and interested parties from all sides of the debate to form a working group that will gather evidence and consider all the viable options in more detail,\" One wonders who will be on this working group? If they don't choose the right people, it could be [as bad as the Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=6105#030713). It wasn't reassuring to read \" we want to set up a working group and to work with my hon. Friend [Tredinnick], and herbalists and others, to ensure that the legislation is fit for purpose.\" The mainstream media eventually catch up with bloggers. BBC1 TV (Wales) produced an excellent TV programme that exposed the enormous degree validation scam run by the University of Wales. It also exposed the uselessness of the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA). Both these things have been written about repeatedly here for some years. It was good to see them getting wider publicity. Watch the video of the programme ( [Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ix4HTi9LWE), and [Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG2kBeDer-0)) \"Week In Week Out - University Challenged.\" \"The programme examines how pop stars and evangelical Christians are running colleges offering courses validated by the University of Wales.\" (I make a brief appearance, talking about validation of degrees in Chinese Medicine). In October 2008 I posted [Another worthless validation: the University of Wales and nutritional therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259). With the help of the Freedom of Information Act, it was possible to reveal the mind-boggling incompetence of the validation process used by the University of Wales. McTimoney College of Chiropractic The Chiropractic \"degrees\" from the McTimoney College of Chiropractic are also validated by the University of Wales by an equally incompetent, or perhaps I should say bogus, procedure. More details can be found at [The McTimoney Chiropractic Association would seem to believe that chiropractic is \"bogus\"](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1686), and in a later post, [Not much Freedom of Information at University of Wales, University of Kingston, Robert Gordon University or Napier University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2351). Andy Lewis has also written about chiropractic in [The University of Wales is Responsible for Enabling Bogus* Chiropractic Claims to be Made](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/06/university-of-wales-is-responsible-for.html). Sadly the BBC programme did not have much to say about these domestic courses, but otherwise it was excoriating. In particular it had extensive interviews with Nigel Palastanga, whose astonishing admission that courses were validated withour seeing what was taught on them was [revealed here two years ago](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259). After that revelation, the vice-chancellor UoW, promoted Palastanga to be pro-vice-chancellor in charge of Learning, Teaching and Enhancement (I know, you couldn't make it up). In the documentary Palastanga said \"It's a major business. We earn a considerable amount of money.\" That was obvious two years ago, but it's good to hear it from the horse's mouth. After a section that revealed a bit about what goes on at two very fundamentalist bible colleges which gave University of Wales degrees, A. C. Grayling commented thus. \"They are there to train advocates for the biblical message and that is absolutely not, by a very very long chalk, what a university should be doing.. . . A respectable British Higher education institution like the University of Wales shouldn't be touching them with a bargepole.\" Undaunted, Palastanga responded \"That's his opinion. I would say they are validated to the highest standards. They match what are called QAA benchmark. We have serious academics looking at them, and their academic standards are established at the very highest level.\" And if you believe that, you will truly believe anything. You can [download here](/PalastangaBScChiro28082008.pdf) one of many moderator's reports obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. This one is for the BSc (Hons) Chiropractic. It is entirely typical of theuncritical boxticking approach to validation, Nowhere does it say \"subluxation is nonsense\", though [even the GCC now admit that](http://www.zenosblog.com/2010/05/obituary-the-death-of-the-subluxation/). Traditional Chinese Medicine The University of Wales validates several courses in what almost everyone but them classifies as quackery. As well as [chiropractic](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1686) and [\"nutritional therapy\"](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259), there is herbalism. For example a course at a college in Barcelona issues University of Wales degrees in Traditional Chinese medicine, a subject that is [a menace to public health](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923).. I was asked to comment on the course, and on a bag of herbs that the presenter had been sold to treat depression. | Ingredients of a custom mixture. There is no good evidence that any of the ingredients help depression, in fact next to nothing is known about most of them, apart from liquorice and ginger. Swallowing them would be rather reckless. They fall right into the description of any herbal medicine, [in the Patients' Guide](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733), \"Herbal medicine: giving patients an unknown dose of an ill-defined drug, of unknown effectiveness and unknown safety. \" Of the degrees, I said \"There's no evidence that it [the herbs] does you any good. It may be dangerous because you have no idea of the dose. Degrees in Chinese Medicine consist of three years spent memorising myths and pre-scientific, er, untruths. That isn't a degree, it's a travesty.\" Palastanga. responded \"We've had long debates in the Health Committee about where we would draw the line about what we validate. They have to demonstrate to us that there is some scientific basis for the practice, that there is an established curriculum, that there is an established safe practice.\" The presenter asked him \"So you are confident that Chinese medicine works? Palastanga replied \" I didn't say that. I said that there is evidence that it does work . . We are trying to enforce these professions to undertake effective research.\" That statement is simply not true, as shown by the response of the validation committee to the application for validation of the course in \"Nutritional Therapy\" at the Northern College of Acupuncture, [documented previously](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259). The fact of the matter is that the validation proceeded without looking at what was actually taught, and without even a detailed timetable of lectures. The committee looked only at the official documents presented to it and was totally negligent in failing to discover some of the bizarre beliefs of the people who were giving the course. Palastanga went on to raise the usual straw man argument, about how little regular medicine is based on good evidence (though admittedly that is certainly true in his own field -he is a physiotherapist). Fazley International College Kuala Lumpur This business college in Kuala Lumpur offered University of Wales degrees. Its 32-year old president is a part time pop star with impressive looking qualifications The presenter pointed out that \" His doctorate and his MBA were awarded in that citadel of education, Cambridge. Here he is, pictured at the city's prestigious business school. He was there for all of four days and walked away with a doctorate. But the degree was not from the University of Cambridge, but from the now defunct \"European Business School Cambridge\". It never had the right to award degrees.\" Neither the University of Wales nor the QAA had noticed this unfortunate fact. Once the TV team had done their job for them, the [UoW withdrew support](http://www.wales.ac.uk/en/InstitutionsAndCourses/FIC/FazleyInternationalCollege-KualaLumpur.aspx). though, as of 15 November 2010, that is not obvious from [Fazley's web site](http://www.fazleyic.com/). Mr (not Dr) Fazley seemed rather pleased about how students were attracted by the connection with the Prince of Wales. The fact that he is Chancellor of the University of Wales seems not inappropriate, given the amount of quackery they promote. Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) In 2007, I wrote, [in Nature](http://dcscience.net/colquhoun-nature-07.pdf) (see also [here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19)), \"Why don't regulators prevent BSc degrees in anti-science? The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) claims that \"We safeguard and help to improve the academic standards and quality of higher education in the UK.\" It costs taxpayers \u00a311.5 million (US$22 million) annually. It is, of course, not unreasonable that governments should ask whether universities are doing a good job. But why has the QAA not noticed that some universities are awarding BSc degrees in subjects that are not, actually, science? The QAA report on the University of Westminster courses awards a perfect score for 'curriculum design, content and organization,' despite this content consisting largely of what I consider to be early-nineteenth-century myths, not science. It happens because the QAA judges courses only against the aims set by those who run the QAA, and if their aims are to propagate magic as science, that's fine.\" That was illustrated perfectly in the documentary when Dr Stephen Jackson of the QAA appeared to try to justify the fact that the QAA had, like the University of Wales, failed entirely to spot any of the obvious problems. He had a nice dark suit, tie and poppy, but couldn't disguise the fact that the QAA had given high ratings to some very dubious courses. The QAA sent nine people to the other side of the globe, at a cost of \u00a391,000. They could have done a lot better if they'd spent 10 minutes with Google at home. Universities UK (UUK) Needless to say, the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals has said nothing at all. As usual, Laurie Taylor had it all worked out in [ Times Higher Education (4th November)](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=414124). Speaking to our reporter Keith Ponting (30), he commended UUK's decision to say absolutely nothing whatsoever about the abolition of all public funding for the arts and humanities. He also praised UUK's total silence on Lord Browne's view that student courses should primarily be evaluated by their employment returns. When pressed by Ponting for his overall view of UUK's failure to respond in any way at all to any aspect of the Browne Review, he described it as \"welcome evidence, in a world of change, of UUK's consistent commitment over the years to ineffectual passivity\". Meanwhile, a University of Wales video on YouTube Caveat emptor Follow-up A couple of days later, a [search of Google news](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22University+of+Wales%22&hl=en&client=firefox-a&hs=Itq&sa=G&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&prmd=nm&source=univ&tbs=nws:1&tbo=u&ei=UxvjTLTzL4SAhAf_08i2DQ&oi=news_group&ct=title&resnum=11&ved=0CHQQqAIwCg) for the \"University of Wales\" shows plenty of fallout. The vice-chancellor [ claims that](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/welsh-politics/welsh-politics-news/2010/11/13/minister-s-attack-was-totally-unacceptable-91466-27651062/) \"\"The Minister's attack came as a complete and total surprise to me\". That can't be true. It is over two years since I told him what was going on, and if he was unaware of it, that is dereliction of duty. It is not the TV programme that brought the University into disrepute, it was the vice-chancellor. The Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health [shut down amidst scandal](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3023) in April 2010. In July, we heard that a new \"College of Medicine\" was to arise from its ashes. It seemed clear [from the people involved](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263) that the name \"College of Medicine\" would be deceptive. Now the College of Medicine has materialised, and it is clear that one's worst fears were well justified. At first sight, it looks entirely plausible and well-meaning. Below the logo [one reads](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/about-college-medicine) \"There is a new force in medicine. A force that brings patients, doctors, nurses and other health professionals together, instead of separating them into tribes.\" \"That force is the new College of Medicine. Uniquely, it brings doctors and other health professionals together with patients and scientists.\" It is apparent from the outset that the well-meaning words fall into the trap described so clearly by James May (see [What 'holistic' really means](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3095)). It fails to distinguish between curing and caring. As always, the clue lies not in the words, but in the people who are running it. Who is involved? After a bit of digging on the web site, you find the names of the people on the [Science Council of the \"College of Medicine\"](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/science-council), The preamble says \"Good medicine must be grounded in good science as well as compassion. The College's Science Council brings a depth of knowledge from many senior figures.\" But then come the names. With the odd exception the \"science council\" is like a roll-call of quacks, the dregs left over from the Prince's Foundation. The link (attached to each name) gives the College's bio, My links tell a rather different story. - [Professor George Lewith](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/professor-george-lewith)You'll find plenty about [George Lewith on this blog.](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22George+Lewith%22) - [Professor Mustafa Djamgoz](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/professor-mustafa-djamgoz)Superficially respectable but seduced by 'ancient wisdom' He once wrote to me \"There are many 'eastern' remedies (such as acupuncture that we witnessed dismissed 25 year ago) that work. \".

There are a few gaps in this table, to be filled in soon. One can guarantee that a great deal more will appear about the College on the web, very soon. The [Governing Council of the College](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council) is equally replete with quacks (plus a few surprising names). It has on it, for example, a spiritual healer (Angie-Buxton King), a homeopath (Christine Glover), a herbalist (Michael McIntyre). Westminster University's king of woo (David Peters), not to mention the infamous [Karol Sikora](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Karol+Sikora%22). Buxton-King [offers a remarkable service](#abk1) to heal people or animals at a distance. Meanwhile, it seemed worthwhile to provide a warning that the title of the College is very deceptive. It hides an agenda that could do much harm. It is, quite simply, the Prince of Wales by stealth. Follow-up 28 October 2010 Professor Sir Graeme Catto, who has, disgracefully, allowed his name to be used as president of this \"College\" has said to me \"There are real problems in knowing how to care for folk with chronic conditions and the extent of the evidence base for medicine is pretty limited\". Yes of course that is quite true. There are many conditions for which medicine can still do little. There is a fascinating discussion to be had about how best to care for them. The answer to that is NOT to bring in spiritual healers and peddlers of sugar pills to deceive patients with their fairy stories. The \"College of Medicine\" will delay and pervert the sort of discussion that Catto says, rightly, is needed. 29 October 2010 I need a press card. I see that the BMJ also had a piece about the \"College of Medicine\" yesterday: [Prince's foundation metamorphoses into new College of Medicine](http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6126.full), by Nigel Hawkes. He got the main point right there in the title. As was [clear since July](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), the driving force was Michael Dixon, Devon GP and ex medical director of the Prince's Foundation. Hawkes goes easy on the homeopaths and spiritual healers, but did spot something that I can't find on their web site. The \"Faculties\" will include \"in 2011, neuromusculoskeletal care. Two of the six strong faculty members for this specialty are from the British Chiropractic Association, which sued the author Simon Singh for libel for his disobliging remarks about the evidence base for their interventions.\" The College certainly picks its moment to endorse chiropractic, a subject that is in chaos and disgrace after they lost the Singh affair. One bit of good news emerges from Hawkes' piece, There is at least one high profile doubter in the medical establishment, Lord (John) Walton (his 2000 report on CAM was less than blunt, and has been widely misquoted by quacks) is reported as saying, at the opening ceremony \"I'm here as a sceptic, and I've just told my former houseman that,\" he said. The target of the remark was Donald Irvine, another former GMC president and a member of the new college's advisory council.\" 31 October 2010. I got an email that pointed out a remarkable service offered by a member of College's [Governing Council](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council). Angie Buxton-King, a \"spiritual healer\" employed by UCLH seems to have another web site, [The Beacon of Healing Light](http://www.angiebuxton-king.com/) that is not mentioned in [her biography](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/angie-buxton-king) on the College's site. Perhaps it should have been because it makes some remarkable claims. The [page about distant healing](http://www.angiebuxton-king.com/Distant_Healing.php) is the most bizarre. Absent Healing/Distant Healing \"Absent healing is available when it is not possible to visit the patient or it is not possible for the patient to be brought to our healing room. This form of healing has proved to be very successful for humans and animals alike.\" \"We keep a healing book within our healing room and every night spend time sending healing to all those who have asked for it. We have found that if a picture of the patient is sent to us the healing is more beneficial, we also require a weekly update to monitor any progress or change in the patients situation. Donations are welcome for this service.\" I wonder what the Advertising Standards people make of the claim that it is \"very successful\"? I wonder what the president of the College makes of it? I've asked him. Other blogs about the \"College of Medicine\" 30 October 2010. Margaret McCartney is always worth reading. As a GP she is at the forefront of medicine. She's written about the College in [The Crisis in Caring and dangerous inference](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=801). She's also provided some information about a \"professional member\" of the [College of Medicine](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/dr-sam-everington), in [..and on Dr Sam Everington, at the Bromley by Bow Centre....](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=803) It is one of the more insulting things about alternative medicine addicts that they claim to be the guardians of caring (as opposed to curing), They are not, and people like McCartney and Michael Baum are excellent examples. Prince of Wales to become honorary president of the \"College of Medicine?\" Last night I heard a rumour that the Prince of Wales is, despite all the earlier denials, to become Honorary President of the \"College\". If this is true, it completes the wholesale transformation of the late, unlamented, Prince's Foundation for Integrated Medicine into this new \"College\". Can anybody take it seriously now? Text messages to Graeme Catto and Michael Dixon, inviting them to deny the rumour, have met with silence. Herbal nonsense at the College 29 July 2011. I got an email from the College if Medicine [ [download it](http://www.dcscience.net/COM-Self-care.pdf)]. It contains a lot of fantasy about herbal medicines, sponsered by a company that manufactures them. It is dangeroous and corrupt. On Friday 25 August 2006, Michael Baum and I went to visit the rather palatial headquarters of the UCL Hospitals Trust (that is part of the NHS, not of UCL). We went to see David Fish, who was, at that time, in charge of specialist hospitals. That included world-leading hospitals like the National Hospital Queen Square, and Great Ormond Street children's hospital. It also includes that great national embarrassment, the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital (RLHH). It came as something of a surprise that the man in charge did not know the barmy postulates of homeopathy and he looked appropriately embarrassed when we told him. Michael Baum is not only a cancer surgeon. but he has also taken the lead in thinking about palliative and spiritual needs of patients who suffer from cancer. Listen to his Samuel gee lecture: it is awe-inspiring. It is available in video, [Concepts of Holism in Orthodox and Alternative Medicine](https://admin.emea.acrobat.com/_a45839050/p69282078/). The problem for UCLH Trust is that the RLHH has royal patronage One can imagine the frantic green-ink letters that would emanate form the Quacktitioner Royal, if it were to be shut down. Instead, we suggested that the name of the RLHH should be changed. Perhaps something like Hospital for palliative and supportive care? Well, four years later it has been changed, but the outcome is not at all satisfactory. From September it is to be known as the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine. What's wrong with that? You have to ask what is to be \"integrated\" with what?. In practice it usually means integrating things that don't work with things that do. So not much advance there. In fact the weasel word \"integrated\" is just the latest in a series of euphemisms for quackery. First it was 'alternative' medicine. But that sounds a bit 'new age' (it is), so then it was rebranded 'complementary medicine'. That sounds a bit more respectable. Now it is often \"integrated medicine\" (in the USA, \"integrative\"). That makes it sound as though it is already accepted. It is intended to deceive. See, for example, [Prince of Wales Foundation for magic medicine: spin on the meaning of 'integrated'](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466), and [What 'holistic' really means](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3095). Of course the amount of homeopathy practised at the RLHH has fallen considerably over the last few years. Already by 2007 there were signs of panic among homeopaths, They are beginning to realise that the game is up. Some of the gaps were filled with other sorts of unproven and disproved medicine. What the hospital is called matters less than what they do, The current activities can be seen [on the UCLH web site](http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our+hospitals/royal+london+homoeopathic+hospital.htm). Services: - Podiatry and Chiropody] - [Womens Clinic] It would be tedious to go through all of them, but here are some samples. The Children's Clinic \"The mainstay of treatments offered include Homeopathy, Herbal remedies, Flower essences, Essential oils, Tissue salts and Acupuncture. We also assess nutritional status, provide dietary advice and supplementation. Psychotherapeutic techniques including Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), and Visualisation are sometimes used where indicated, to gain better understanding of the presenting problems\". So a wide range of woo there. And they claim to be able to treat some potentially serious problems \"What can be treated A wide variety of clinical conditions are being treated including: - Recurrent infections - Skin diseases such as eczema - Allergic disorders including asthma - Food intolerances and eating disorders - Functional developmental and learning problems - Behavioural disorders including ADHD (hyperactivity) and autism.\" There is, of course, no evidence worth mentioning thar any of these conditions can be treated effectively by \"Homeopathy, Herbal remedies, Flower essences, Essential oils, Tissue salts and Acupuncture\". They describe their success rate thus: An internal audit questionnaire showed that 70% of children responded well to homeopathic treatment So, no published data, and no control group. This is insulting to any patient with half a brain. These claims should be referred to the Advertising Standards Authority and/or Trading standards. They are almost certainly illegal under the [Consumer Protection Regulations (May 2008)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=790). The UCLH Trust should be ashamed of itself. Education Services offers mainly courses in homeopathy, the medicines that contain no medicine, Pharmacy Services stock thousands of bottles of pills, most of which are identical sugar pills. It's hard to imagine a greater waste of money. The Marigold Clinic - Homeopathic Podiatry and Chiropody I was rather surprised to find this is still running. In 2006, I wrote about it in [Conflicts of interest at the Homeopathic Hospital](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=112). It turned out that the prescription costs if the clinic were spent on Marigold paste, made by a company owned by the people who run the clinic. UCLH claimed that they were aware of this conflict of interest, but had no obligation to make it public. That is an odd ethics in itself. Even odder when I discovered that the Trust had been notified of the conflict of interest only after I'd started to ask questions. The same people are still running the clinic. They may well be good chiropodists, If so why surround the service with woo. There are, almost needless to say, no good trials of the efficacy of marigold paste (and it isn't homeopathic). Conclusion At the moment, it appears that the renaming of the RLHH is empty re-branding. No doubt UCLH Trust see homeopathy as something that brings shame on a modern medical service. But to remove the name while retaining the nonsense is simply dishonest. Let's hope that the name change will be followed by real changes in the sort of medicine practised, Changes to real medicine, one hopes.
