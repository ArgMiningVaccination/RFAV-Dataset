From repurposing existing drugs, to developing new therapies and studying human immune responses, Columbia's researchers are investigating multiple public health approaches and treatment options to treat and prevent COVID-19. \"Resolving the COVID-19 pandemic requires discovering drugs that prevent the virus from replicating, among other approaches to this disease. The critical knowledge necessary to create such an anti-viral medicine does not yet exist, but the current crisis requires us to work expeditiously to discover this knowledge and apply it to create an effective treatment.
