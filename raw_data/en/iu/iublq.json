Contrary to popular belief, germs, as opposed to cold weather, cause illness. And what makes us vulnerable to those microscopic crazymakers? Lack of sleep, poor nutrition, and life stress all lead to a weakened immune system and vulnerability to illness. More than anything, anxiety leads to a breakdown in the body's ability to defend itself against bacteria and viruses. When stressed, the hormone cortisol remains in the blood for long intervals, which the body develops immunity to, resulting in increased inflammation. When ill, antibiotics and other medications can help the body recover from illness. However, what medicine fails to do is enhance the body's immune system. This area is where yoga can help. Yoga is one of the time-tested natural immunity boosters which may cause a healthy, sickness-free body.

Keep your hips on the heels, and gently bend forward, and decrease your forehead to the ground. Maintain the arms alongside your body with palms on the floor, palms facing upward. (If this isn't comfortable, you can put one fist on top of another and rest your forehead on them.) Gently press on your chest on the thighs. Hold. Gradually come up to sit on the heels, uncurling vertebra by vertebra and unwind.

Have your arms beside your body, with palms facing down. As you inhale, slowly lift your back off the ground; lightly roll in the shoulders. Then touch the chest to the chin without bringing down the chin, supporting your weight with your shoulders, arms, and toes. Feel your bottom as it firms up in this pose. Both the thighs are parallel to one another and the ground. If you desire, you can interlace the fingers and push the palms on the ground to lift the torso slightly more up, or you might encourage your back with your palms. Maintain breathing easily. Hold the position for a moment or two and exhale as you gently release the pose. Setu Bandhasana opens your heart and improves the blood flow, increasing energy within the body. - Matsyasana (Fish Pose) Lie on your back. Your feet are together, and hands relaxed along with the body. Place the palms underneath the buttocks, palms facing down. Bring the elbows closer toward each other. Breathing in, lift the chest, and head up. Keeping the torso elevated, lower the head backward and touch the surface of the head to the ground. With the head lightly touching the ground, press the elbows firmly to the floor. Place the weight on the elbow rather than on the head. Lift your chest from in-between the shoulder blades and press the legs and thighs to the ground. Hold the asana position for as long as you comfortably can, taking long gentle breaths in and out. Relax in the position with each exhalation. Now lift the head, lowering the torso and head to the ground. Bring the palms back along the sides of the body.

Exercising, gently bring your stomach, chest, and head back into the ground. - Halasana (Plow Pose) Lie down on your back as you place your arms beside you, palms pointing downwards. As you inhale, deploy your abdominal muscles to lift your toes off the ground, lifting your legs vertically at a 90-degree angle.

Allow your legs to sweep at a 180-degree angle over your head until your toes touch the ground. Your spine should be perpendicular to the ground. This position may be awkward initially, but try for a couple of seconds. Do this slowly and gently. Make certain that you don't strain or push your neck into the ground.

Ayurveda, Ojas, Agni & immunity Ayurvedic tips to stay healthy Ayurveda is thousands of years old from ancient India and is yet more relevant in these trying times. It provides us simple but powerful strategies to strengthen our immunity. This holistic healing method has encouraged individuals to protect and enhance their ojas so that they could more easily recover from and ward off disease. Ojas can be known as our vital essence. It is a super subtle substance found both in the center and throughout the body, described as a whitish, soft, and sweet fluid. It's the last outcome of wholesome food intake and decent digestion: well, digested food goes on to make our physical body cells, which, in turn, nourish ojas. The more ojas we have, the better. It gives us energy, strength, and resistance to disease. Ojas is like a shield that resides inside every one of our cells. It won't permit any illness to take root and spread in our body. If our body is strong and healthy, our ojas is powerful, and disease does not have any place to manifest. So how can we know if we've got good ojas? We will not get sick, feel healthy, happy, and content. Every day, we have many choices to improve our ojas, fortify our energy, and reduce our risk of becoming sick from any type of imbalance, be it physical or psychological. The most prominent source of ojas is your mind. Any activity which makes the mind happy is an ojas booster. All healthy joys are encouraged in Ayurveda and behave like medicine. Laughing, connecting with friends and family members, healthy relationships can nourish ojas. Stress, on the other hand, is a response of the brain that drains the ojas. The more we manage stress and keep it at bay, the more powerful our ojas. Every one of us needs to reflect on the amount of stress and anxiety we willingly create in our own lives. Wherever we typically push ourselves beyond our capability, we can scale back. This slowdown won't only reduce stress, but it is going to let our ojas to flourish and resistance to grow. Nature has allowed us to remain put, slow down, and look at how we will need to reframe our reality so that we are living harmoniously in ourselves.
