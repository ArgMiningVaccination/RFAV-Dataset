When the COVID-19 pandemic hit and left her dealing with long -covid, Maria realized more than ever the importance of human connection without an agenda. She decided to promote a fully secular weekly meditation event to give back to her community and promote healthy habits of inclusion and communication, recognizing that our perspective of the world can be limiting if we only see it from our own viewpoint and that of those who are similar to us. Through her commitment to promoting wellness and inclusivity, Maria expects this weekly meditation practice to resonate with the community at large and make a difference in the way we approach our reality as a collective.
