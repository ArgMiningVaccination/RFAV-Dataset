It is designed to promote general wellness and resilience, support the body's normal, ongoing protection against any encroaching bacteria, viruses, or cancer cells, and even targets cold and flu prevention. If you are interested in an effective immune system meditation, to enhance wellness and prevent disease, this combination of superb cellular imagery with exquisite music is the holistic guided imagery tool you are looking for. The track list is as follows: 1. Introduction (2:40) 2. Guided Imagery (14:45) 3. Affirmations (17:47) This Health Journeys meditation for boosting your immune system was written and narrated by guided imagery pioneer and holistic health expert Belleruth Naparstek, scored to the immersive music of Steven Mark Kohn, and produced by the Cleveland Orchestra's impeccable sound engineer, Bruce Gigax. Guided imagery is a holistic, mind-body technique that consists of positive words and images, set to soothing music, to achieve specific goals of healing and wellness. Repeated listening once or twice a day for 2-3 weeks ensures maximum impact. It is as perfect for a cancer survivor who is finished with treatment but still wants to remain active in staying healthy, as it is for those prone to infections, colds and viral illnesses. This program will strengthen your immune system with guided imagery that flexibly supports the strong but discriminating action of protector cells in the body; encourages appropriate action from suppressor cells; and promotes the defense system's ability to differentiate between compromised and healthy cells. Additional imagery encourages appreciation and gratitude for the body's exquisitely orchestrated, non-stop system of protection. A separate track of affirmations shows how to strengthen your immune system and support cold and flu prevention naturally, through briefer versions of the same healing images and ideas - ideal for listening on the go and even while driving.
