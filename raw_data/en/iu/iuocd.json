According to the manufacturer, Noocube is an all-in-one nootropic supplement, containing a potent blend of 11 brain boosting ingredients that work synergistically together to support cognitive function. [According to the Noocube website](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/go/noocube-dallas-review), taking Noocube will help you gain razor sharp focus, improve problem-solving skills, boost memory, reduce brain fog, and improve mental alertness. But does Noocube really work as well as the manufacturer claims or is it too good to be true? In this Noocube review, we'll explain everything you need to know about Noocube, including its ingredients, how it works, pros, cons, and where to buy for the lowest price.

Nootropics are a class of synthetic, semi-synthetic, and natural molecules that can improve cognitive function. You can find nootropics in everything from energy drinks and over-the-counter supplements to prescription drugs. Noocube is an all-natural, clinically tested nootropic supplement that boosts brain health while slowing down the progression of brain disorders and aging. What sets Noocube apart from other supplements is how it affects and stimulates neural function. Rather than providing temporary mental alertness, Noocube targets the root cause of poor brain health to improve mental health from within while preventing neurodegenerative disorders. Brain disorders continue to rise, with Alzheimer's disease now being one of the leading causes of death in the United States, affecting over [6.2 million](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33756057/) Americans over age 65. Cognitive decline and diseases are not the only issues with increasing concerns. As technology progresses and more people spend hours staring at screens, many suffer from lower cognitive performance levels causing rippling effects like sleep issues, poor memory retention, and more. With this ongoing mental health crisis, many new solutions attempt to target overall cognitive function with all-natural ingredients so that people can find relief without the adverse side effects of prescription drugs. Noocube enhances multiple neurotransmitters while balancing the gut-brain axis, responsible for [90%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5526216/) of serotonin production, to provide comprehensive health benefits throughout the body and mind. Noocube Benefits From metabolic health and nervous system stabilization to healthy sleep patterns and improved brain function, Noocube can provide whole-body health benefits. By targeting root brain problems, Noocube provides sustained, long-term solutions for better brain health. The following are some of the primary benefits of using Noocube's Brain Productivity supplements. Sharpened Focus and Mental Clarity Noocube includes multiple ingredients that can sharpen focus, helping you concentrate on tasks throughout the day. [Poor concentration](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/why-cant-i-focus) may occur from stress, anxiety, mood swings, a lack of sleep, and ADHD or as a symptom of dementia and cognitive decline. Noocube includes [alpha-GPC](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1087/alpha-gpc), which can improve dementia and focus issues by increasing levels of acetylcholine in the brain. Noocube also features two essential amino acids, [L-tyrosine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6084775/) and [L-theanine](https://www.healthline.com/health/l-theanine), that can boost mental energy levels, improve ADHD-related self-control, and sharpen attention spans, allowing you to stay focused throughout the day. Low mental energy can make it hard to complete a single task, but Noocube nourishes your brain with each essential amino acid for sustained concentration. [Click Here for the Lowest Price on Noocube and Save Up To 50%!](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/go/noocube-dallas-review) Boosted Memory and Cognitive Function Nearly one-third of the ingredients in Noocube have clinical research supporting their effectiveness in improving memory. Memory loss can happen over time with age or as a triggered result of degenerative diseases or brain health issues. One of Noocube's primary ingredients, cat's claw, can [remove](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12120814/) brain plaque, which causes memory loss, while reducing swelling and free radicals to prevent or lessen the effects of Alzheimer's disease. Noocube also contains powerful ingredients like vitamin [B12](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-b12-benefits), [alpha-GPC](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1087/alpha-gpc), and [ Bacopa monnieri](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4564646/), which are all shown to boost memory. [Resveratrol](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221009483), an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory in the formula, can also work as a memory booster by reducing harmful free radicals in the brain. Increased Productivity A lack of productivity typically occurs when you struggle with multiple brain function issues. If you're experiencing brain fog, mental fatigue, and a lack of focus, you will likely struggle to be productive in your day-to-day tasks. Noocube targets each of these brain function symptoms, allowing you to enjoy an overall boost in productivity. Many of Noocube's ingredients boost energy levels, heighten mood, sharpen focus, improve mental speed, and promote brain health, allowing you to unlock the full potential of your mental capabilities. Lessened Stress and Brain Fog Brain fog affects your ability to think clearly and translate your thoughts into actions. Many people experiencing [brain fog](https://www.webmd.com/brain/ss/slideshow-brain-fog) often feel confused and struggle to articulate their thoughts. Certain lifestyle factors and conditions can cause brain fog, including pregnancy, multiple sclerosis, menopause, prescription drugs, fatigue, depression, stress, anxiety, and more. Noocube features ingredients like [vitamin B1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2738337/) and [oat straw extract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7352613/) that can minimize mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and stress, allowing you to enjoy more mental clarity and reduced fog. The amino acid [L-tyrosine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2736402/) can also lessen acute stress responses by reducing oxidative stress in the body through the elimination of harmful free radicals. Reduced Mental Fatigue Mental fatigue occurs when your brain's energy runs low, leaving you in a state of prolonged tiredness, stress, and even anxiety. Mental fatigue can mimic depression symptoms, making simple tasks like folding your laundry feel like summiting a mountain. Mental and neurodegenerative disorders, a lack of sleep, and more can all cause severe mental fatigue. Noocube can reduce mental fatigue and prevent it by stimulating brain power and energy with all-natural ingredients. For example, the vitamin B complex, including vitamins B12, B7, and B1 in the Noocube formula, can improve oxygen transport and cellular energy production. Without these critical B vitamins, your metabolic health and functional pathways can suffer. [Vitamin B12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7019700/) can affect brain blood flow, stimulating the structures and intercellular connections between brain cells critical in aging and development. With this improved nourishment, you can enjoy more energized brain cells and reduced fatigue, providing comprehensive cognitive performance benefits.

Noocube features 13 all-natural ingredients, including amino acids, ancient herbs, antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, organic compounds, and more, that all work together to improve brain health. This dietary supplement includes the following key ingredients: Vitamin B1 Vitamin B1 (thiamine) can boost memory and cognitive functions during the development of Alzheimer's disease. [Studies show](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4846521/) that thiamine deficiencies are linked to degenerative brain disorders like Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Vitamin B7 Vitamin B7, commonly referred to as biotin, may help patients with various degenerative issues, like Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's. [New research](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-01-biotin-mitochondria-dementia-reveals.html) shows that biotin deficiencies may be linked to severe neurodegeneration. Vitamin B12 Noocube contains a special form of vitamin B12, cyanocobalamin, which can improve brain health by targeting brain structure formations. [Vitamin B12 deficiencies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7077099/#:~:text=Vitamin%20B12%20deficiency%20is%20linked,markers%20of%20Vitamin%20B12%20deficiency.) can cause poor cognitive functions, reduced memory, tingling sensations, nervous system damage, severe immune responses, inhibited nerve growth, and more. With adequate levels of B12, your brain and nervous system's critical structures can regenerate at healthy rates. Bacopa monnieri extract: Bacopa monnieri is an ancient herbal supplement that can [improve](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5075615/) your ability to acquire, retain, and retrieve facts. Further [studies](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.638109/full) show that in subjects over 55, those taking the supplement for 12 weeks experienced faster memory retrieval than those in the placebo group. L-tyrosine The gut-brain axis influences different chemical productions in your brain. The amino acid L-tyrosine can stimulate similar results by boosting dopamine and norepinephrine. [Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26424423/) show that L-tyrosine can work as a brain booster, enhancing brain functions in healthy individuals and those under stress. Cat's claw concentrate Cat's claw is an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant vine that can reduce plaque growth in the brain, slowing the effects of cognitive function decline while improving memory loss symptoms. [Research from 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-38645-0?_ga=2.60255917.1648463477.1654288951-645002530.1654288951#Sec2) proved the effectiveness of cat's claw in reducing brain plaque. Oat straw extract Oat straw extract is another [nootropic supplement](https://www.dallasnews.com/branded-content/2023/04/19/10-best-nootropics-smart-drugs-and-cognitive-enhancers-of-2023/) that can reduce stress reactions, allowing the brain to remain healthy at peak performance levels. [Research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26618715/) shows that Noocube's dosage level of oat straw extract is within the ideal potency range. L-theanine L-theanine is another amino acid providing comprehensive health benefits, ranging from gut health support to memory and focus enhancements. [L-theanine](https://www.healthline.com/health/l-theanine) targets the gut-brain axis by reducing inflammation in the digestive tract, allowing helpful bacteria to flourish, which improves digestion, gut health, and, ultimately, neuro responses. Improved gut health with a balanced gut-brain axis can also alter immune responses, allowing you to enjoy whole-body benefits. Alpha-GPC Alpha-GPC boosts levels of acetylcholine, a chemical in the brain that can improve memory and cognitive function. [Clinical research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12637119/) shows that acetylcholine offers cognitive improvements in patients with mild to severe dementia. Lutemax 2020 (lutein and zeaxanthin) Lutemax is a [clinically two natural carotenoids. [Clinical research](https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN17604865) shows that Lutemax can effectively improve vision, cognitive abilities, mood, and sleep patterns. Huperzia serrata Huperzia serrata is an herb that some ancient cultures relied on to treat conditions that modern medicine might link to cognitive dysfunction, schizophrenia, and dementia. [Clinical research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8435632/) shows that the ingredient can reduce oxygen-glucose deprivation and free radical cellular damage, ultimately improving cell health. Resveratrol Resveratrol is a common anti-inflammatory and antioxidant ingredient found in berries, wine, peanuts, and grapes. The ingredient can improve cholesterol, heart health, blood sugar levels, and brain function. [Research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26212523/) shows that resveratrol targets brain function by reversing the signs of aging and memory loss. Pterostilbene Pterostilbene works similarly to resveratrol and also comes from berries and grapevines. [Research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30816671/) from a study in 2019 shows that the ingredient can improve symptoms related to age-associated decline in cognition. Who Is Noocube For?

Noocube can give you the extra boost you need to feel mentally energized, focused, and clear all day, so you're ready to handle all the unpredictable events life throws at you.
