To me, all health related concerns are individual, so everyone must look at their own health picture and make their own decision with input from their doctor. It is my belief that [most people should get the vaccine](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/covid-19-vaccination-faq) - it's the best way to offer protection for us all and to offer protection to the more vulnerable members of society who may not be able to get vaccinated or for whom vaccination may be less effective. Who might not get vaccinated? Some health concerns are clear red flags and should consult with your doctor before scheduling a vaccination appointment. Family or personal history of vaccine reactions, family or personal history of immune conditions, any current health condition that compromises your immune system, and any personal history of [anaphylaxis or other strong allergic reactions](https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/news/statement-on-covid-vaccine/). As there is no egg in either the Moderna or Pfizer, egg allergies are not a concern. There are other conditions that are likely safe to get the vaccine, but more data needs to be gathered to be sure, such as for [pregnant or nursing individuals](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html). Preliminary research looks like it should be safe, but as more data comes in from folks opting into the vaccine (perhaps a pregnant or nursing front-line worker) we can be more certain. What about my trusting my body's immune system? Vaccines are just another way to keep your immune system in tip top shape, so by getting a vaccine you are trusting in your body! You can do this in addition to other natural methods of support: high dose vitamin C, Vitamin D, herbal support, acupuncture, good sleep, exercise, etc. All vaccines are built around the idea of giving your body's immune system a head start on fighting an illness. The very first vaccine was developed against smallpox - first exposing people to a weakened form of the virus, then discovering a similar virus that still conferred immunity without risking illness. Various methods of vaccine delivery were attempted before we came up with the modern intramuscular shot. [Learn more with this Planet Money podcast episode](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/04/869798010/the-very-first-vaccine). The Covid19 vaccine is built around recognizing a specific part of the virus - [the spike protein](https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/explainer-what-is-a-spike-protein) - through recognizing it's protein blueprint, the mRNA. [This is different from the genetic blueprint of DNA](https://www.technologynetworks.com/genomics/lists/what-are-the-key-differences-between-dna-and-rna-296719). By teaching your body in advance to recognize this specific part of the Covid19 virus, our immune system is more readily equipped to recognize and deal with it, just like exposing your body to a [\"dead\" virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inactivated_vaccine). Can't I just keep practicing pandemic precautions rather than get the vaccine? I recommend both continuing to practice pandemic precautions and getting the vaccine. The truth is, while pandemic precautions significantly reduce your risk of contracting Covid19, there isn't a truly guaranteed way to avoid it completely. I've known several people to do all the \"right things\" and still end up sick. The deeper truth is that most people can't even afford to do all \"the right things\". If you can't work remotely or your work doesn't make allowances for childcare you can't isolate. If you can't afford grocery delivery you have to go to the store. You could get exposed on your way to the pharmacy or on your way to a healthcare appointment. Mask wearing, handwashing and social distancing reduce risk, vaccination will further reduce risk. mRNA Vaccines for Covid - Not as new as you think There's a lot of anxiety about the \"newness\" of this type of vaccine, or concerns that it was rushed through trials. While I share many people's skepticism of the pharmaceutical system, I do believe that much of what is perceived as \"rushed\" was streamlining accomplished by readily available funds to companies researching Covid19 vaccines - significantly speeding up the development process. For those with concerns that things were rushed due to political pressure - the first approved vaccine was actually [developed in Germany](https://fortune.com/2020/11/09/pfizer-vaccine-funding-warp-speed-germany/) (Pfizer). Also important to note is that mRNA vaccines have actually been being researched for [over a decade](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243)! What about unknown side effects? Certain branches of East Asian medicine believe that something should not be considered an established treatment until it has been used successfully for 3 generations, so by this measure Viagra is still unproven ( [having only been used since 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sildenafil)). While the short-term risks of the Covid19 vaccines are well understood, there's always the chance of a new treatment causing unexpected side effects down the road. Standard medical trials don't go for years and years, they go for weeks or months. Scientists have learned from past experience and know more and more about looking out for factors that could cause different reactions in the body. It's with this knowledge that I believe the risk of long term side effects to be a minor one. This is where risk vs benefit analysis comes in. The more we learn about Covid19 the more alarming it is. In some (even mild!) cases of Covid19 people have [developed multi-organ failure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7533045/). This known risk seems much more alarming than any potential risk down the road. Can't you still get Covid19 or transmit the virus after getting the vaccine? While modern (and ancient!) medicine can do some really amazing stuff, it isn't magic. The Covid19 [vaccines have up to a 95% efficacy rate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/learning/what-does-95-effective-mean-teaching-the-math-of-vaccine-efficacy.html) - which is incredible! Up to 95% of people will not contract Covid19 or transmit the virus to others. This is really as high as we could hope! This does unfortunately mean that at least 5% of folks will not get immunity by receiving the vaccine. They might get sick, or they might only get mildly sick and pass on the virus without really having symptoms. Even if you are among the up to 95% of folks to develop immunity, it is important that the vaccine still takes [up to 2 weeks following your second dose](https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/90584) to get the full benefit. It is also important to note that immune reactions to the vaccine are 100% normal. This is your body recognizing the vaccine and reacting accordingly. Did you know that all those signs we associate with being sick - fever, chills, sneezing, coughing, runny nose, etc. - those aren't caused by viruses or bacteria, but are actually [caused by our body's response](https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/why-we-feel-so-terrible-when-we-get-sick) to the viruses or bacteria. It follows that you could feel sick after getting a vaccine since your body is responding by mounting an immune reaction. Let's beat this thing together We're all tired of the pandemic and wish we could hug our loved ones, travel, even just hang out at a coffee shop. While there are going to be some people who cannot and should not get the vaccine, I do hope that those who can receive the vaccine with reasonable safety choose to do so. "}
