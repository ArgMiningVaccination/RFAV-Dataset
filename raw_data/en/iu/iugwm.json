She utilizes Botanical Medicines, Nutritional Supplements, Homeopathy, Hydrotherapy, and Lifestyle Counseling to prevent illness and bring patients back to health. Registered Naturopathic Doctors are guided by the following six principles: The Healing Power of Nature Sun, Air, Water, Plant Medicine The body has an inherent wisdom to maintain a balanced and healthy state. The Registered Naturopathic Doctor recognizes this process as intelligent and uses medicines and techniques to support, maintain, and augment this healing process by identifying and removing any obstacles to health and recovery. First Do No Harm The Most Simple, Most Gentle, and Most Effective Therapies The goal of the Registered Naturopathic Doctor is to prevent disease and restore health in the most gentle, non-invasive manner. The aim is to minimize the risks of harmful side effects while helping the patient reach their ultimate health goals. Find the Cause Remove the Obstacle to Cure Every illness has an underlying cause. Any combination of insults can cause disease. The Registered Naturopathic Doctors will thoroughly investigate each individual case in order to find the root of the illness and facilitate removal of the underlying cause of disease. Doctor as Teacher Educate and Inform The linguistic root of the word \"doctor\" is teacher. A principal objective of Naturopathic Medicine is to educate the patient and emphasize self-responsibility for health. Registered Naturopathic Doctors also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. Treat the Whole Person Body, Mind, Spirit Health or disease comes from a complex interaction of physical, emotional, dietary, genetic, environmental, lifestyle, spiritual and other factors. A Registered Naturopathic Doctor treats the whole person using Naturopathic remedies and taking all of these factors into account. This is also the main goal behind holistic medicine and holistic healing. When we focus on the whole person, we not only treat existing ailments, but we focus on preventative medicine as well. Preventative Medicine Maintaining a Strong and Healthy System The prevention of disease and the attainment of optimal health in patients are primary objectives of Naturopathic Medicine. In practice, these objectives are accomplished through education and the promotion of healthy ways of living. Registered Naturopathic Doctors assess risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to disease, and make appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness. Naturopathic Medicine asserts that one cannot be healthy in an unhealthy environment and is committed to the creation of a world in which humanity may thrive.
