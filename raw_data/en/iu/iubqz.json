Here is a man who has no issue in challenging the conventional pharmaceutical wisdom by researching and defining new treatments which may not include chemotherapy for a cancer diagnosis, but something far more different and effective for most. When one visits Dr. Eliaz in the Northern California town of Sebastopol that he calls home, they are remarkably aware almost immediately of his unpretentious, yet methodical approach to their whole being, no matter what the reason for their visit. Most people's association with the words \"physician\" or \"integrative\" usually do not also include \"meditation,\" \"mind-body,\" \"wholeness\" and \"natural.\" But these are the words which can describe a day or a moment with Eliaz. He doesn't move quickly through hundreds of patients, but rather takes the necessary time to understand the unique issues of each individual who comes to see him. With his unparalleled integrative perspectives and holistic approach, Eliaz is able to uncover and strategically resolve the root causes of illness in a person, undiscovered in many cases by even the most advanced diagnostics and specialists. For these reasons, patients have traveled the globe to see him. His remarkable climb in popularity is not something man-made out of a fancy global media campaign or flashy commercials but from word of mouth and trust from former patients who have been given the opportunity for Dr. Eliaz to simply change their life. Slowly, naturally and holistically. Often sought out to speak at medical conferences and healing seminars as far away as India and as close as San Francisco, Dr. Eliaz spends what he calls his most important time in meditation. During his years of research it was Eliaz who took two yearsaway from his medical practice to meditate. Two entire years were dedicated solely to advanced studies in meditation which he now uses in his own life and clinical practice, and which he teaches in free meditation classes and seasonal retreats open to the public. It is often you could find him within the maze of the beautiful redwood trees in West Sonoma simply taking in the wonderment of what is nature. Here is where he does some of his most profound thinking. \"The redwoods, you can feel their wisdom and healing powers,\" he says. \"They are inspiring, massive and strong.\" And just like the redwoods, Eliaz is steadfast and strong in his beliefs and the practices he is extending to patients, rooted in ancient wisdom which continues to inspire strength and healing. Unconventional and non-traditional are two words Eliaz finds complimentary when people try to describe him. His dedication to the research and design of natural botanical formulas has made stunning changes in the medical field, particularly for the treatment of cancer. He incorporates this research into a soft approach to understanding a person's own mind and body, guiding his patients toward new life processes and lifestyle changes, targeted holistic supplements and natural paces to promote optimal healing. Recently Eliaz and his team at EcoNugenics nutraceutical company announced a botanical formula which has been proven to slow highly invasive human breast cancer growth and reduce breast cancer metastasis. The formula, which includes extracts from botanicals and herbs, medicinal mushrooms and other natural ingredients, was proven safe with no toxic side effects. Genetic analysis studies also confirmed the formula's ability to \"turn off\" specific metastatic cancer genes, with results published in two separate peer reviewed medical journals. Equally promising is a research study published recently which demonstrates that when this breast formula was combined with the revolutionary natural compound known as Modified Citrus Pectin, the anticancer effects were dramatically increased. As the leading authority on Modified Citrus Pectin -a natural compound derived from citrus peels - Dr. Eliaz has been using this breakthrough natural medicine for over 15 years in the treatment of cancer, heavy metal toxicity, immune system support, inflammation and fibrosis-related diseases such as congestive heart failure. In recent years, Modified Citrus Pectin has earned significant attention from the scientific and medical communities, as it is the only proven natural agent that can block the deadly effects of an aggressive molecule called Galectin-3. This aggressive Galectin-3 molecule is now proven to be actively responsible for cancer, inflammation and fibrosis-related diseases. Galectin-3 levels are easily tested with a new FDA-approved blood test, offering an invaluable method to measure cancer, heart disease and other life-threatening conditions. Dr. Eliaz has been one of the first physicians to apply this important diagnostic tool in his practice and teach other physicians of its critical importance, along with the use of Modified Citrus Pectin to halt the deadly effects of the Galectin-3 molecule. Another of Eliaz's published research breakthroughs demonstrates the effectiveness of a natural botanical formula for slowing aggressive prostate cancer and preventing metastasis. The formula, which contains 33 prostate cancer fighting ingredients, has now been tested by researchers at Columbia University and Indiana University, with results published in four independent peer reviewed oncology journals. This unique prostate formula, as well as the breast formula, is now being tested alone and in combination with Modified Citrus Pectin, traditional radiation and chemotherapy regimens for prostate and breast cancer, respectively. These breakthroughs followed Eliaz' research presentations and articles on the practice of mind-body exercises and mindful meditation, proven to protect DNA against cancer-promoting genetic developments. Dr. Eliaz doesn't claim to be a magical healer and he doesn't want to be known as a man who holds the cards to a lot of good luck. His practice has taken years to refine, but his results are near-miraculous, including patients who are living far beyond their terminal diagnosis and others who have dramatically improved their quality of life in body, mind and spirit. Take the story of Andy Aubin, a then 79 year old Santa Cruz, California man diagnosed five years ago with what was certain to be a death sentence. Aubin was initially diagnosed with prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease almost at the same time. Later he was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer and had his colon rupture where he required emergency surgery. It didn't stop there for Andy....only weeks after the colon cancer diagnosis did he hear the news that his liver was also affected. Conventional doctors had minimal options to offer him, and even less hope. It was only Dr. Eliaz's proactive, individualized approach to healing and Andy Aubin's herculean strength and commitment that leaves him disease free today. Eliaz's treatment included removing the toxic metal revealed to be in Aubin's blood through initial testing, a result mostly from the fillings in his teeth. There was also a unique understanding, ongoing dialogue and trust between patient and doctor. Aubin, who's story was featured in the online program \"The Incurables,\" made a complete lifestyle change directed by Dr. Eliaz which included nutritional and herbal therapies, balance and a meeting of mind and heart which ultimately was the answer to the previously dark prognosis.

She felt the ongoing need to emphasize her spiritual path and growing up she found a sense of calm with what would turn out to be her profound understanding of ancient cultures and traditions from the West to the East. In the 1980's Bell contracted what is widely known as \"Cat Scratch Fever,\" a rarely severe condition that comes from being scratched by a cat. Her symptoms included a swollen lymph node under her jaw. She was treated for it up until 1992 when she was believed to be symptom free, however, that same year Bell found a lump in her breast which she thought may be attributed to this condition. After a mammogram and several doctor visits she was assured she was fine. It was on her 50th birthday in 1999 that she felt the lump which had since gotten bigger. Highly invigorated by meditation, she spent much time sitting inside a wonderful ancient madrone tree as she questioned what was happening in her body. Later, as the lump spread, Bonnie began shaking uncontrollably throughout the night. Her husband David called on neighbors to come by and help them. It was only after that episode that Bonnie and David realized it was the beginning of her journey into integrative medicine, where the leading treatments of the West meet the best healing methods from the East. Bonnie turned to Dr. Isaac Eliaz for help. It was Eliaz who found that she indeed had breast cancer triggered by estrogen which he then set out to suppress. Through intense heat treatments using infrared saunas at up to 140 degrees F for almost an hour, herb supplements and acupuncture, Eliaz was able to shrink the large tumor remarkably. In addition to the shrinkage, the heat therapy was strengthening Bell's immune system. Bell began a therapeutic regime designed specifically for her treatment by Eliaz which included medicinal mushrooms, liquid Ginseng tonic and additional supplements, acupuncture, gentle detoxification and an emphasis on mind-body meditation and healing. Today Bell is totally in remission, a remarkable story to add to the results of one man's dedication to healing through integrative processes and individualized programs, achieving unbelievable life-changing results.
