Incense is a biological aromatic material that releases scented smoke when burnt. It is usually made from plant matter or essential oils to give it a certain scent. It can be used in aromatherapy or to simply create a pleasing aroma in the home. Burning incense has a long religious and spiritual history and remains an important ritual for many. Incense is also known to have some health benefits too. Incense throughout history From fumigating tombs to preparing altars and clearing out negative energy from a space, incense has been a part of ceremony and healing for centuries. It's believed that it all started with the ancient Egyptians who would use incense to chase out the less than pleasant scents that lingered in the tombs of the dead. Traces of Frankincense and Myrrh have been found in the burial chambers of Ancient Egypt. It has also been traced back to India and the southern shores of Asia where as early as the 4th century, it was used for prayer, religious ceremonies, and purifying a space all while warding off negative energies. The practice then spread to China where it was also used in ancient Chinese ceremonies. It's even believed that as far back as the 12th century, buildings in China were specifically designed for the burning of incense. That's how important it was in the culture. Incense showed up in Japan in the 6th century and then again later in the 15th century. It was used for everything from samurai warriors prepping for battle to ceremonial arts in the upper class. While incense has traveled a long way, from the spice routes that crossed Arabia to the Mediterranean, we still hold incense close to our ceremonial hearts. Even to this day, incense is used in a similar way. From the catholic church to Buddhist monks and Hinduism, the use of incense plays a major role in all kinds of ritualistic practices and offerings.

How to light incense Each different type of incense will have its own method of lighting and learning how incense burning works only adds to the whole lush ritualistic element of it. Some methods are easier than others - for example, the stick method is simply a matter of directly burning the raw material. Whereas the resin and the powder take a little more precision and care. Fortunately, there are plenty of incense paraphernalia items on the market to help make burning your plant materials as safe, secure, and simple as possible. The last thing you want is a stressful incense burning experience so be sure to play it safe, don't leave your incense unattended, and always snuff out embers and keep your incense away from anything considered to be flammable. How to use incense sticks Incense sticks (sometimes called joss sticks) are one of the most popular methods for burning. Usually crafted from bamboo sticks coated in incense, they are super easy to use. You simply place the incense stick into a holder and light the end of it. As soon as the flame catches, it will either die down or you will need to gently blow it out. The stick will start to ooze smoke. They can smolder for various amounts of time depending on the stick, but they usually last between 20 minutes and an hour. how to use incense cones The cone-shaped incense tends to be more intense than the stick or even the coil. These guys usually billow out smoke and bring big cleansing energy with it. They also produce a high amount of heat so definitely need a good heat-proof base to keep them safe and stable. You can throw down a layer of salt or sand if you want to add some extra heat-proofing into the mix. The cone should have its point facing heavenwards and this is the part that you light. The cones actually burn for less time than the other methods but they do produce way more smoke. How to burn incense powder The powder is scattered over charcoal and it's the charcoal that provides the burning element. There are special charcoal discs you can buy specifically for incense burning. This method definitely turns up the heat and it's super important to have a safe vessel for your charcoal. You need to hold a flame to the charcoal for a good 20 seconds or so until it ignites. Let it burn for a while before throwing on your incense powder. The powder can burn up in seconds so you will need to keep adding to it. This method creates intense heat and intense levels of scent too. How to use coil incense Coils are a great option for when you are bringing fragrance or creating a ceremony in a larger space, You will need to find a larger flatter holder for the incense coil and specially made holders even come with clips to hold your incense in place. Again, you light the end, blow out the flame and let the smoke drift out. How to put out incense Incense will usually burn itself right out, but for those who don't want to wait for it to burn all the way down or for those who want to take extra precautions to ensure it's out fully, there are ways you can snuff it out. While you can use water to extinguish your incense this may not be the best practice if you want to continue to use the incense again as water can affect the way it burns. Other methods could include cutting the tip-off (if you are using a stick) or using a proper snuffer. With the cones and coils, you can blow or fan them until they are naturally extinguished. Incense burners You can also get incense burners which are usually made from ceramics or clay. These can be super ornate or simple and they come in a whole range of styles. You often are shaped and painted and have holes for dispersing the smoke. They are cute and fun and can be anything from a cozy little mushroom to an epic depiction of shiva.

Incense has a whole host of benefits but like everything in life, nothing comes completely risk-free. There has been plenty of research into incense smoke and whether or not it can have an ill effect on your health. Some studies came back as showing that there may be a link between increased risks of carcinomas from inhaling a lot of incense. A [study back in 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2559972/) also showed that incense could contain small particulate matter which could be carcinogenic. In terms of health and wellbeing, it's also important to note that if you struggle with asthma, incense smoke may kickstart asthma issues. It's worth noting with the research behind the increased risks and incense can be tricky. One study compared the risk of inhaling incense smoke to the same as inhaling cigarette smoke, however inhaling cigarette smoke is a much more direct experience than passively inhaling incense. Also in these studies, only certain kinds of incense were used so the results can't be linked to every kind of incense out there. Some studies were also paid for by tobacco companies which further lends a biased light. There are plenty of things out there that we need to weigh up the health and wellbeing factors. For example, if we weigh up incense helping reduce stress and tension (known for causing high blood pressure, heart issues, etc) does that negate the potential effects of inhaling a small amount of smoke? Again, these decisions are purely personal and we can't guide you one way or another. Having awareness, exploring the research, and picking your own path will ultimately be the best choice for you as an individual. It is worth noting that choosing incense that is created from the most natural ingredients possible is going to be better for you than opting for anything synthetically made. When shopping around for your incense goodies make sure that you check the ingredients. Anything listed as 'fragrance' or 'parfum' is a sign that there are some synthetic ingredients stashed in your incense. Here are some quick do's and don't for when working with incense. Do - Open a window a little bit after or even during your burning to not overwhelm the senses of the space. - Always choose all-natural incense - Only burn one incense at a time - Make sure that your incense is well and truly extinguished before you leave the space Don't - Ever leave your incense unattended. Any kind of heat is a fire risk - Use incense that has synthetic properties - Inhale too much smoke especially if you have sensitive lungs or any kind of respiratory issue A Final Thought Incense can bring so much beauty and healing to your world. It's a gorgeous ritual to get into and can help soothe the soul, cleanse a space, and encourages you to welcome in ritual and intention which ups our mindfulness when moving through life. Just make sure that when perusing the world of incense that you stay safe and that you select incense from companies that use all-natural ingredients rather than the synthetic kind. Synthetic incense can actually add to air pollution whereas natural incense can be a rich and rewarding experience. What are your thoughts on incense?
