Possible health effects depend on how they were exposed (skin, oral, or breathing), length of time exposed, and personal factors, such as age, gender, genetic traits, and diet. Symptoms of exposure to fuels Health effects may include irritation to unprotected skin, eye and upper respiratory irritation, fatigue, breathing difficulty, headaches, dizziness, and sleep disturbances. Drinking fuels is dangerous and may result in convulsions, coma and even death. Scientific research on the long-term effects of exposure to fuels is inconclusive; however, if an individual is exposed to fuel at very high levels over a long period of time, lung and heart problems may develop.
