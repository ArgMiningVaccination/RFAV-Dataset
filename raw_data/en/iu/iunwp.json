[HarperCollins](https://www.scribd.com/HarperCollins) Reviews for Essential Oils Every Day 1 rating0 reviews Book preview Essential Oils Every Day - Hope Gillerman INTRODUCTION Annie is a scent professional who writes about perfumes for beauty magazines. We first met at an industry event, where she introduced herself as a die-hard fragrance fanatic. She explained she never left the house without adorning herself with a fragrance from her huge collection. She scented her body, her clothes, her hair, even her friends' homes, with the highly prized scents and candles she adored. Then she blurted out that her back was killing her! Annie suffered from untreated chronic back pain, a result of spending her days in heels and at a desk. She also had pretty terrible allergies, which she treated with over-the-counter medications. I told her I specialized in helping people get rid of their back pain, even if they have had it for years, and I encouraged her to come for some therapeutic sessions in the Alexander Technique and aromatherapy. Annie was ready to sign up! But even though she loved scent, she explained she would be less receptive to incorporating essential oils into the sessions. When I asked why, she admitted she had always shunned essential oils, skeptical of their benefits and assuming their scents were crude compared to the masterworks of French perfumery she admired so much. After a couple of sessions, Annie's back started feeling better. She was elated. So I encouraged her again to try some of my oils for her allergies as well as her pain, and she agreed. We started slowly. I showed her how to use an oil to help clear her sinuses and alleviate the cough she had developed in response to the allergy-inducing chemicals in many of her beloved perfumes. After a few more sessions, her breathing improved\u2014pain is so often exacerbated by shallow breathing\u2014and we moved on to working with a muscle-relaxing blend of oils to help further heal her back pain. With all her progress, Annie was still incredulous, saying her symptoms would normally come and go on their own, until I finally gave her an oil blend for mental clarity, stamina, and focus, which she loved. Before she had experienced essential oils, Annie was addicted to caffeine, drinking five or more cups of coffee a day plus a few diet sodas. She told me that once she got her hands on my special focus blend, a mix of peppermint and lavandin essential oils to relieve tension headaches and improve mental clarity, that all changed. I kept finding that I didn't want my midafternoon coffees, she said. Soon I craved the peppermint sensation on the back of my neck more than my cup of joe. The essential oils were doing the job I thought the coffee was doing, only they were doing it better! I've been down to one cup a day most days and I even skip coffee sometimes. But I never skip my essential oils. They get me going in the morning, for workouts, and help me focus when I'm writing. Once Annie experienced how well essential oils work, she was an instant devotee. Swearing me to secrecy, she confessed she was using oils in lieu of her daily dose of French parfum. I almost feel like a traitor to all of my perfumes! she whispered. I was overjoyed to see her transformation. Over the next year, I saw her shift to eating a better diet, using toxin-free beauty products, incorporating more exercise into her daily routine, and embracing a less crazy schedule\u2014and having more fun! What I love about Annie's story is how easily she moved from knowing nothing about essential oils, except misinformation and misunderstanding, to using them so fluidly she changed the course of her health and well-being. The Story of Essential Oils Annie's exploration is what Essential Oils Every Day is all about. So many people simply haven't experienced how useful these natural, healing essences can be. Essential oils are one of the most comprehensive tools of self-care in the world and one of our oldest forms of natural medicine. The story of essential oils begins in the ancient Near East\u2014Mesopotamia\u2014just over five thousand years ago. This world must have been aromatic heaven: women scented their hair with cedar-infused oil and the air was ripe with aromatic smoke from pine, spruce, juniper, and balsam incense, the rich balsam tones creating an aromatic terrain\u2014the perfume of everyday life, rituals, ceremonies, and healing. It's no wonder then that the origin of the word perfume comes from the Latin per fumus, which means through smoke. Ancient priests and physicians believed that incense's essential-oil-laced smoke ascended up to the gods and gave them the power to call upon healing spirits during religious practices and medical treatments. Without distillation, the process we use now to render essential oils from plant matter, ancient practitioners were limited in how they captured essential oils. The essences were locked in wood, bark, needles, berries, petals, leaves, and resins. To release an oil, the plant was either burned, as with smoldering incense, or soaked in animal fats or seed oils. The plant-oil mixture was heated slowly, in the sun, until the essential oil had leached into the fatty substance the plant had been soaking in. These scented oils were made into balms and healing ointments for overall health, perfume, and personal care as well as for religious and healing ceremonies. I revel in this vision of a world perfectly spiced for mind, body, and spirit. Those simple concoctions were the foundation of all our perfumes, cosmetics, and cleaning and herbal healing products\u2014all that is scented can be traced back to these early balms and incense. The next historical evolution in essential oils and the therapeutic use of aromatic plants occurred in India, as a part of ayurvedic medicine. A five-thousand-year-old healing system still practiced today, ayurveda is based on balancing one's vital energy (prana) according to body type (dosha) and staying in harmony with the environment through meditation, exercise, diet, and lifestyle. This many-limbed system also incorporates detoxifying massage with sesame and coconut oil (panchakarma) and essential oils (including anti-inflammatory turmeric, basil, and peppermint). The ayurvedic healing aesthetic, found in both incense and aromatic personal care oils, is so beautiful that we find it echoed in our favorite perfumes today. We can thank India for giving us sandalwood and vetiver, found in many men's colognes. Heady jasmine and vanilla are hidden in the complex fragrance of Chanel No. 5. Sandalwood and jasmine ground Guerlain's Samsara, and my favorite, Herm\u00e8s's Cal\u00e8che, combines jasmine and citrus. I love knowing that the fragrances that capture our imaginations were originally designed to help our spirits ascend toward nirvana. Moving forward to around 2600 BCE in Egypt, Imhotep, the designer of the first pyramid, acted as physician and priest, using essential oils in religious ceremonies, including mummification. In fact, when the first great tombs were excavated\u2014including those of Pharaohs Tutankhamun and Queen Hatshepsut\u2014traces of still-fragrant frankincense and myrrh were found in some of the vessels. These powerful resins are a mainstay of modern aromatherapy, used for skin care, to focus the mind, and for their strong decongestant and antifungal properties. In ancient Egypt, these substances were burned in large quantities at ceremonies, and they have become integral to spiritual practice, past and present. Chinese herbal medicine and the use of aromatic herbs also had its origins around this time; historically, the development of Chinese medicine parallels Egyptian and ayurvedic medicine. One of the most important early Chinese medical texts is a materia medica on herbs attributed to the quasi-mythical emperor Shen Nung. In it, Shen Nung promoted the stimulating powers of ginseng; he was the first recorded person to do so. Though ginseng essential oil is too costly to extract commercially, if we did, it would make Red Bull and Starbucks unnecessary! Early Chinese healers are also responsible for introducing the beloved citrus essential oils that make us feel happy, refreshed, and calm. These are still favorite scents today. Just think of how we instinctively turn our heads to smell someone cutting open an orange, a lemon, or a lime nearby! From archaeological remains, we also know that people were using aromatic oils in the Middle East around the same time as the Egyptians and the Chinese. In areas of southern Iran and Afghanistan, aromatic oils were found in vessels dated to 2000 BCE and in artifacts from Israel and Jordan. Both frankincense and myrrh are mentioned throughout the Bible, most famously in the story of the gift-bearing Three Wise Men, which explains why we still smell these scents in Catholic churches today. My favorite story about essential oils from the Bible features spikenard, a smoky, mysterious oil that goes back to the Egyptians. As told in the New Testament (John 12:3), Mary Magdalene honored Christ in the days before his arrest by rubbing his feet with this costly oil, filling the house with its transporting aroma. Today, spikenard is used as a powerful sleep aid and for emotional grounding. We also know the Greeks used essential oils, from writings by Hippocrates dated to the mid-fourth century BCE. In roughly 50 CE, the early physician Dioscorides wrote a significant herbal manual for doctors, which was the first to explain how an external application of a plant oil could penetrate so deeply it would affect the internal organs. As with other ancient cultures, the Greeks used essential oils for a number of purposes, such as narcissus for its sedating effects (which we use today very judiciously for panic attacks, since narcissus can have unpleasant side effects). We also know the Greeks used a lot of rose, which cleanses the liver, acts as a sleep aid, and can be the emotional equivalent of a teddy bear for grown-ups. By the eleventh century, Persians, with their interest in aromatics and science, had pioneered steam distillation to isolate essential oils from plants. For the first time, essential oils were available in their purest and most potent form, boosting their therapeutic effects. Meanwhile, as Europe was in the throes of economic and cultural decline in the Middle Ages, herbalist monks kept plant medicine knowledge alive, growing clary sage, lavender, thyme, and rosemary in their monastery gardens. In the twelfth century, German abbess Hildegard of Bingen heralded the restorative power of lavender in her herbal treatises. Gradually, distilled essential oils found their way from Persia to Europe along the spice routes, and fourteenth-century medical practitioners encouraged inhaling them, hoping to stop the spread of plague, as well as used them to fumigate plague-ridden homes. Sixteenth-century European royals applied these same antimicrobial oils to mask the substantial body odors that were the norm in a culture in which bathing was a rare occurrence. In 1653, an English herbalist named Nicholas Culpeper articulated a system in which he matched the therapeutic capabilities of an individual plant to its outward appearance. For example, he used the yellow flowers of chamomile to treat jaundice. Even today, some of his principles\u2014though modernized\u2014are used in aromatherapy. For example, using Culpeper's approach, we see leaves as the part of a plant that breathes, since they consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Therefore, oils that come from leaves, like eucalyptus and peppermint, will help us with breathing and clearing congestion. In the nineteenth century, perfumers were expanding their art with synthetic fragrances. At the same time, doctors began isolating plants' chemical components for use in synthetically composed medicines, identifying these chemicals as active ingredients. At first, pure essential oils were used alongside the new medicines, and research on their antibacterial effects began. But after the advances in germ theory in the mid-nineteenth century, and especially after the success of vaccines and antibiotics fifty to seventy-five years later, a definite shift away from natural cures occurred and modern medicine took over. One exception to this trend was renewed interest in essential oils by a select group of scientists in the early twentieth century, including a perfumer and chemist named Ren\u00e9-Maurice Gattefoss\u00e9. Gattefoss\u00e9 suffered an accident in his laboratory and his hand was badly burned. He tried treating the wound with lavender oil and noticed immediate benefit. Not only did the pain of the wound subside on contact but also Gattefoss\u00e9 barely had a scar afterward. The oil had relieved his pain and regenerated tissue. Although he had applied the oil topically, as opposed to inhaling its aroma, Gattefoss\u00e9 decided to name this method of healing with aromatic plant essences aromatherapy. His contributions to the field and practice during his lifetime included creating the first catalog of the chemical properties of essential oils. His body of work makes up a substantial part of what we know about these powerful substances today. In addition to Gattefoss\u00e9, numerous aromatherapists in modern times have developed new ways to use essential oils to heal. In the 1930s, Austrian-born biochemist Marguerite Maury figured out how to properly dilute essential oils to make synergistic blends for topical application, creating the basis for all our personal care essential oil products and a range of therapeutic applications. In 1939, Albert Couvreur published a new medical text on essential oils, updating earlier scholarship. In the Second World War, Dr. Jean Valnet used essential oils on injured soldiers due to the shortage of antibiotics in the field. And most recently, the French medical practitioner Dr. Daniel P\u00e9no\u00ebl explored the use of large doses of essential oils for eradicating infection (don't try this at home!), which has become a French medical practice, often referred to as medical aromatherapy for health professionals. Ironically, antibiotics are being prescribed with increasing caution today, putting the pressure back on researchers to find new ways to take advantage of nature's own antimicrobials\u2014essential oils\u2014for food preservation and hygiene. Essential oils are finally finding their way back into our homes, offices, and makeup bags as welcome companions to both modern and holistic approaches to medicine, wellness, and beauty. Today, essential oils are readily available in most cities and towns. In fact, they seem to be everywhere: at specialty shops, spas, yoga studios, and your neighborhood Whole Foods, where there are numerous aromatherapy lines to choose from.

After all, why shouldn't beauty and pleasure be matched with health and self-healing? My Story From as early as I can remember, my senses have guided the way I relate to the world and my ability to observe the body in motion. Beyond my five senses, my highly developed somatosensory system floods my body with signals. The somatosensory system controls our perception of touch. Even though touch is considered one of the five senses, the actual impression of touch, of contact with the skin, stems from many different stimuli, including pressure, temperature, and vibration. The somatosensory system also controls proprioception, the body's awareness of its position and movement in space, which arises from the muscles, joints, and fasciae. All this means I feel the minutest sensations from my skin, my muscles, and my joints as I move. With my heightened body awareness, I also continually register subtle shifts in body position and movement quality in others. I even feel the earth's gravitational pull on my body. These are a dancer's tools. Drawn into the world of music and dance at age eight, I quickly found a place to be at home: my body. I was young enough to get a good head start\u2014I had aspirations for a long dance career\u2014and I was old enough to be fully conscious of what I was doing, allowing me a level of discipline in my studies that only drove me to strive to achieve more. I trained my body carefully because I knew that I had found my life's work. In high school, I turned my feet in and became a modern dancer, exploring as many styles as I could: Horton, jazz, Cunningham, Martha Graham, Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n, Afro-Cuban, and more. My training opened me up to finding my own style, and soon I was choreographing to Mozart, Monteverdi, Miles Davis, and other greats. In college, I studied under Bessie Sch\u00f6nberg, a mentor to many choreographers and the namesake of the prestigious New York Dance and Performance Awards, known as the Bessies. In 1976, I moved to New York City after graduation from college and began my career as a choreographer. Downtown Manhattan was the epicenter of the art and experimental dance world. I had everything going for me: I was thriving in my career, surrounded by friends, and making my way in the world. But, sadly, it didn't last. I began to suffer from a heartbreaking phase of untreatable sciatica that came out of nowhere. This typical sign of stress was coupled with other health issues, but the nerve pain was so severe I couldn't walk more than a few city blocks at a time, let alone dance my heart out. Condemned to rest by doctors (who claimed there was nothing wrong with me), I fought back, mustering all my willpower to return to dancing. I resolved to overcome the depression so commonly associated with chronic pain and heal completely; to be permanently healthy was my new end goal, and I worked to achieve this with a fierce determination. My network of dancer and musician friends suggested a bevy of holistic healers for me to reach out to. I found out about a massage therapist who had trained in England and France\u2014the homes of modern aromatherapy\u2014and who had recently moved to the city. The key to all her healing methods was essential oils. She couldn't wait to intoxicate New York City with her therapeutic blends. That was before stores like Origins or the Body Shop existed in the States. I'd never even heard of essential oils. I had no clue what their benefits were, and I was initially skeptical that visiting the massage therapist would help my deep muscular spasms. I'd always associated lavender with clean "}
