Whether you are looking to manifest during the new moon or release during the full moon, this is the perfect bath to help you in cleansing yourself so that you are able to bring in that which serves your highest good. My mother has used spiritual baths for over 25 years and the ingredients used for these baths have been passed on from my great grandmother. It is because of her that both my mom and I are spiritual. Instructions: Warm ingredients with water til it boils. You can use a small pot for this. After it cools some, mix it into a drawn bath. Tips: You can shower before using the ingredients in the bath. It is recommended that you use the spiritual baths on Tuesdays and Fridays as these are spiritually powerful days for manifestation work. When you do the baths, you can set positive intentions on what you want to bring into your life and what you want to release from it. You can also light a white candle before you start your bath and turn it off once you are done. White candles help in clearing energy and intention setting. "}
