Nanolipid components in the Pfzer-BioNTech vaccine ((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate), 2 [(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and cholesterol - Salts: Helping to balance the acidity in your body, the following salts are included in the Pfzer-BioNTech vaccine: potassium chloride, monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium chloride, and dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate - Sugar: Basic table sugar, also known as sucrose, can also be found in the Pfzer-BioNTech vaccine. This ingredient helps the molecules maintain their shape during freezing. Does NOT contain: Eggs, Preservatives, Latex Learn more, read the FDA www.fda.gov/media/144414/download Moderna Vaccine 94% efective Number of shots: 2 shots, 28 days apart Approved for use in people aged 18 years and older Ingredients: messenger ribonucleic sodium acetate, and Explanation of ingredients: - mRNA: Like the Pfzer BioNTech vaccine, Moderna's also uses mRNA technology to build antibodies against COVID-19. - Lipids: Nanolipids help deliver the mRNA to the vaccine recipient's cholesterol, and 1,2-distearoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine [DSPC]) - remaining ingredients, including acids (acetic acid), acid stabilizers (tromethamine and tromethamine hydrochloride), salt (sodium acetate), and sugar (sucrose) all work together to maintain the stability of the vaccine after it's produced.
