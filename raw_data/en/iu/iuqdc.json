Over the years we have struggled with what to call our \"cleanse program\" because the term cleanse often conjures up ideas of deprivation, hunger, and hardship. To us, cleansing is about resting, rebuilding and revitalizing our bodies and our minds. It is a time to return to a more natural way of eating and existing, retraining our bodies to once again appreciate the taste and benefit of whole, unprocessed foods in their natural state. Although we simplify our diets, our cleanse is both nourishing and building; we do not believe in depriving our body of food or pleasure. We personally believe that while you are cleansing with us, you are calling forward your highest self. It is about putting forth the intention and setting aside the time to care for yourself, as if that was your number one priority for a brief time. Can you even imagine what that feels like? We strongly believe that eating wholesome, clean foods for even a few weeks can balance your body in a way that is beneficial for the weeks and months to come. We often tell our cleanse participants that we think the success of our program is actually less about the few weeks that you cleanse with us and more about what you learn during those weeks that you are able to carry forward with you. The changes that you make\u2014and even those small changes that you sustain\u2014will create long-lasting and powerful shifts in your body. We have seen this time and time again. We have chosen to offer our program in the New Year because people are thinking about their intention for the year to come and often their health is on top of the list. Winter is naturally a time to go inward and to rest more. It is the season to rebuild, restore, and support our bodies and minds with seasonally-appropriate foods. Our digestive system gets a rest when we eat foods that are warm, cooked and easy to digest. By giving ourselves this temporary break, we allow our organs the opportunity to focus on deeper cleansing processes and our minds the time to settle and become more clear. We hope this gives you a greater understanding of what cleansing means to us personally. If you would like more information, you can find "}
