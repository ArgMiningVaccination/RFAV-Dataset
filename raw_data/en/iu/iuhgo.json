Travel insurance ESMO requires recipients to purchase travel protection. Travel insurance is mandatory in order to protect delegates from the high cost of potential cancellation due to circumstances beyond the control of the congress organizer. Adequate travel protection is also highly recommended for all congress participants as it protects travelers from risks like loss of passport or checked baggage and may offer coverage for unexpected medical expenses. Having these risks covered ensures an additional layer of protection against financial loss. Support Customer service staff will be available during the congress to provide support and answer any questions you may have. "}
