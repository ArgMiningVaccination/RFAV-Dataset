A hexavalent CPS-cross-reactive material 197 glycoconjugate vaccine (GBS6) is being developed as a maternal vaccine to prevent invasive group B streptococcus in young infants. METHODS In an ongoing phase 2, placebo-controlled trial involving pregnant women, we assessed the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of various GBS6 formula - tions and analyzed maternally transferred anti-CPS antibodies. In a parallel sero - epidemiologic study that was conducted in the same population, we assessed sero - type-specific anti-CPS IgG concentrations that were associated with a reduced risk of invasive disease among newborns through 89 days of age to define putative protective thresholds. RESULTS Naturally acquired anti-CPS IgG concentrations were associated with a reduced risk of disease among infants in the seroepidemiologic study. IgG thresholds that were determined to be associated with 75 to 95% reductions in the risk of disease were 0.184 to 0.827 g per milliliter. No GBS6-associated safety signals were ob - served among the mothers or infants. The incidence of adverse events and of serious adverse events were similar across the trial groups for both mothers and infants; more local reactions were observed in the groups that received GBS6 con - taining aluminum phosphate. Among the infants, the most common serious ad - verse events were minor congenital anomalies (umbilical hernia and congenital dermal melanocytosis). GBS6 induced maternal antibody responses to all serotypes, with maternal-to-infant antibody ratios of approximately 0.4 to 1.3, depending on the dose. The percentage of infants with anti-CPS IgG concentrations above 0.184 g per milliliter varied according to serotype and formulation, with 57 to 97% of the infants having a seroresponse to the most immunogenic formulation. CONCLUSIONS GBS6 elicited anti-CPS antibodies against group B streptococcus in pregnant women that were transferred to infants at levels associated with a reduced risk of invasive group B streptococcal disease.

Gruber, and Jansen Original Article n engl j med 389;3 nejm.org July 20, 2023 216The new england journal of medicine Group B streptococcus is a common cause of sepsis and meningitis in new - borns through 89 days of age.1,2 The primary risk factor for invasive group B strepto - coccal disease in newborns is exposure to ma - ternal rectovaginal group B streptococcal coloni - zation during delivery. An ascending group B streptococcal infection in the mother can also affect the fetus before delivery, when intraamni - otic infection, premature labor, or stillbirth can occur.3-5 In the United States and many other high-income countries, pregnant women under - go screening for group B streptococcal coloniza - tion late in the third trimester, and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is administered to those with positive results.6,7 Intrapartum antibiotic pro - phylaxis is more than 80% effective in the preven - tion of early-onset disease in infants (at 0 to 6 days of age) but has not been effective against late- onset disease (at 7 to 89 days) or prebirth sequelae associated with group B streptococcal infection.6 A maternal group B streptococcus vaccine ad - ministered during pregnancy to prevent invasive group B streptococcal disease in infants could potentially prevent late-onset disease in addition to early-onset disease and may mitigate the need for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis in other - wise healthy women. Such a vaccine could be beneficial because intrapartum antibiotic prophy - laxis may contribute to antimicrobial resistance and disrupt development of the infant microbi - ome.8-10 It is important to note that this vaccine would provide a much-needed measure in the prevention of group B streptococcal infection worldwide and to a substantial percentage of pregnant women living in resource-limited com - munity settings where microbiologic screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis are un - available. Group B streptococcus expresses capsular polysaccharides (CPSs), which are important viru factors. Ten CPS serotypes of group B streptococcus have been defined (Ia, Ib, and II through IX), six of which (Ia, Ib, and II through V) are associated with strains that cause approxi - mately 98% of cases of invasive disease in in - fants worldwide.11,12 Multiple seroepidemiologic studies have shown an association between ac - quisition of a sufficient concentration of trans - placentally transferred, serotype-specific anti-CPS IgG and a reduced risk of invasive group B strep - tococcal disease caused by the homotypic serotype in early life. However, differences in study designs and serologic assays of binding antibodies have precluded agreement on a broadly accepted pro - tective concentration.13-18 The determination of a generally accepted immunologic surrogate of pro - tection is advantageous for vaccine development because clinical efficacy studies would be pro - hibitively large (80,000 maternal participants), given the relatively low incidence of invasive dis - ease in most countries where such studies could be conducted.2,19 We previously reported safety and immuno - genicity results for a hexavalent CPS-cross-reac - tive material 197 vaccine (GBS6) administered to men and nonpregnant women; GBS6 is currently being developed as a maternal vaccine to prevent invasive group B streptococcal disease in infants.20 Here, we report the results of an assessment of GBS6 in pregnant women and examination of the transfer of anti-CPS antibodies to their newborn infants. To relate the induced antibody concentrations to potential protection, a parallel seroepidemiologic study was conducted with the use of the same vali - dated and standardized GBS6 clinical serologic assay20 to determine IgG thresholds that are as - sociated with a reduced risk of invasive group B streptococcal disease among infants through 89 days of age.

Seroepidemiologic Study A case-control, longitudinal, observational cohort study was performed in South Africa. Prospec - tively enrolled mother-infant pairs were moni - tored for the development of invasive group B streptococcal disease in the infant through 89 days of age. Anti-CPS IgG concentrations were assessed in cord-blood serum samples obtained from the case patients (the infants with invasive disease) and controls (the infants without invasive disease who were born to mothers with group B strep - tococcal colonization) in the prospective cohort, and serum samples were obtained at the time of infection from infants who were enrolled retro - spectively within 72 hours after laboratory con - firmation of invasive group B streptococcal dis - ease at the hospitals participating in surveillance. Vaginal and rectal swab samples were obtained at the time of delivery from a subgroup of ma - ternal participants in the enrolled cohort, and by means of exact matching, case patients were matched to controls with vaginal colonization ac -cording to the same serotype of group B strepto - coccal infection and similar gestational age of the infant at birth (see the Supplementary Appendix). Phase 2 Vaccine Trial The clinical vaccine trial is being conducted in three stages; reported here are the results from stage 2. This phase 2, randomized, placebo-con - trolled trial was conducted at three clinical re - search centers in South Africa. Healthy pregnant women 18 to 40 years of age were assigned to re - ceive a single dose of 5 g, 10 g, or 20 g per serotype of GBS6 with or without aluminum phos - phate (AlPO4) or placebo. Serum samples were obtained from the women before and at various times after maternal immunization, and cord- blood or infant serum samples were obtained at delivery and assessed for anti-CPS IgG (see the protocol and the Supplementary Appendix). The trial staff who dispensed and administered the vaccine or placebo were aware of the trial-group assignments, but the assignments were con - cealed from all other trial personnel, including the principal investigators, and the participants. Safety was assessed in both the maternal and infant participants. Maternal participants used an electronic diary to record solicited local and systemic events for 7 days after vaccination and unsolicited adverse events through 1 month after vaccination; serious adverse events, medically at - tended adverse events, and obstetrical complica - tions were recorded through 12 months after de - livery. Among infants, unsolicited adverse events were recorded from birth through 6 weeks of age, and serious adverse events, adverse events of spe - cial interest, and medically attended adverse events were recorded through 12 months of age (see the Supplementary Appendix). Serologic Assay Anti-CPS IgG concentrations were determined with the use of a quantitative direct immunoas - say (Luminex) that measured levels of antibodies binding to CPS serotypes Ia, Ib, and II through V (see the Supplementary Appendix). This assay was used to measure serum anti-CPS IgG concentra - tions in both the seroepidemiologic study and the phase 2 vaccine trial.

Sample size was justified by the likeli - hood of adverse events being observed; safety and immunogenicity analyses were descriptive. Safe - ty was the primary end point and was assessed among all the participants who received GBS6 or placebo (the safety population). Immunogenicity end points were assessed in the evaluable im - munogenicity population, which included the participants who were eligible for the trial, re - ceived the randomly assigned maternal vaccine or placebo, had at least one valid and determi - nate assay result that could be included in the analysis, and had no potentially important pro - tocol violations (see the Supplementary Appen - dix). Point estimates and the exact 2-sided 95% confidence intervals, as calculated with the use of the Clopper and Pearson method, were deter - mined for all the trial groups. Anti-CPS IgG concentrations for the six serotypes were loga - rithmically transformed for analysis. Geometric mean concentrations and the associated two- sided 95% confidence intervals from each trial group were calculated by back transformation of the mean and the 95% confidence interval of the logarithmically transformed assay results that had been computed with the use of a Student's t dis -tribution. Because this was a phase 2 trial, there was no imputation of missing serologic results. Values below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were analyzed as 0.5 times the LLOQ. No adjustments were made for multiplicity be - cause there were no hypothesis tests; furthermore, all reported confidence intervals should be con - sidered to be descriptive and not be used to assess specific hypotheses. Results Participants in the Seroepidemiologic Study From March 2019 to the beginning of June 2020, a total of 24,053 pregnant women at antenatal clinics or in labor underwent screening prospec - tively for enrollment in the study; 17,752 were included in the prospective cohort (Fig. 1 and Table S1). Rectal and vaginal swabs that had been obtained at the time of delivery from a se - lected subgroup of 2950 women showed that approximately 26% of those who underwent screening were carriers of group B streptococcus (Fig. 1). Newborns were followed for the devel - opment of invasive group B streptococcal disease through 89 days after birth; 28 cases were record - ed. The group of case patients in the prospective cohort was supplemented with a separate group of 90 infants with invasive disease who had been enrolled retrospectively within 72 hours after laboratory confirmation of their illness. The overall incidence per 1000 live births in the prospective cohort was 0.72 for early-onset disease (1.53 at <34 weeks' gestational age and 0.66 at 34 weeks' gestational age) and 0.83 for late-onset disease (3.05 at <34 weeks' gestational age and 0.66 at 34 weeks' gestational age). Cord- blood or infant serum samples, the group B streptococcal invasive isolate, and matched con - trols were available for 20 case patients in the prospective cohort and for 57 case patients in the retrospective cohort. Among these case patients, 45 (58%) had serotype III group B streptococcal infection, 18 (23%) serotype 4 (5%) had II, had serotype IV, and 5 (6%) had serotype V (Fig. 1 and Table S2). Serocorrelate Analysis Data from a sufficient number of case patients were available to determine the risk-concentration relationships for serotypes Ia and III. The unad -Figure 1 (facing page). Screening, Enrollment, and Analysis in the Seroepidemiologic Study and the Phase 2 Vaccine Trial. In Panel A, the group of 2950 mothers with vaginal swabs obtained at delivery does not include 4 mothers with infants who were enrolled as case patients in the prospective cohort. Among the 753 carriers of group B streptococcus (GBS), 3 had an unknown gestational age (GA) and 117 had no vaginal isolate. Among the 90 infants with invasive GBS disease who were enrolled retrospectively, the gestational age was unknown for 2, and these infants were not included in the analysis.

In addition, for five of the six serotypes, the geomet - ric mean concentrations of anti-CPS IgG against group B streptococcus were higher among the controls than among the case patients, with point estimates of the geometric mean ratios (controls to cases) higher than 1 (Table S4). The Bayesian model that was fitted to the distributions of concentrations in case patients and controls is shown in Figure 2. Because the serologic assay was cross-standardized and could relate weight-based concentrations among sero - types, risk-concentration curves were compared among case patients and controls with respect to the individual serotypes Ia and III, as well the combination of serotypes Ia, Ib, and II through V. Representative antibody thresholds that are as - sociated with specific risk reductions for invasive disease are provided in Table S5. IgG thresholds that were determined to be associated with 75 to 95% reductions in the risk of disease were 0.184 to 0.827 g per milliliter. Participants in the Phase 2 Vaccine Trial Between July 8, 2019, and August 31, 2020, a total of 494 pregnant women underwent screening, and 360 were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive one of six different vaccine formulations (40 participants per group) or placebo (120 par -ticipants) (Fig. 1 and Table S6). Live births were recorded for all the participants except for a single stillbirth that occurred in a woman who received 5g GBS6 without AlPO4. Two partici - pants in the placebo group withdrew from the trial before delivery. Data from 360 maternal vac - cine or placebo recipients and 357 infants were included in the safety analyses. Vaccine Safety Local reactions were generally mild or moderate, and pain at the injection site was reported more frequently among the participants who received GBS6 with AlPO4 than among those who received GBS6 without AlPO4 (Fig. 3). Solicited systemic events were similar among the GBS6 groups and the placebo group (Fig. 3), with most events be - ing mild or moderate. Severe systemic events were reported in four GBS6 recipients and four placebo recipients. Two GBS6 recipients reported severe fever (39.0\u00b0C and 40.0\u00b0C) lasting 1 day; one fever occurred on day 3 after vaccination and the other on day 7 after vaccination. Among the maternal participants, unsolicited adverse events occurred in 45 to 70% of the participants in the GBS6 groups and in 61% of those in the placebo group (Table 1). The most common adverse events and serious adverse events were in the system organ class of pregnancy, puerperium, and peri - natal conditions; the most common event was fetal distress syndrome. A single stillbirth that occurred in a GBS6 recipient was deemed by the investigator to be unrelated to the vaccine. One maternal participant and her infant were involved in a fatal motor vehicle accident that was deemed by the investi - gator to be unrelated to the trial vaccine. Few participants in the GBS6 groups and the placebo group reported adverse events that were deemed by the investigator to be related to the trial vac - cine or placebo; the most common such events were headache and vomiting. Among the infants, adverse events occurred in 62 to 75% of the participants in the GBS6 groups and in 74% of those in the placebo group; the most common event was upper respi - ratory tract infection (Table 1). There were three infant deaths (one in the group that received 5-g GBS6 without AlPO4 and two in the placebo group), which were all deemed by the investiga -Figure 2 (facing page).

The most common serious adverse events were minor congenital anomalies (umbilical hernia and congenital dermal melanocytosis). No ad - verse event that occurred among the infants was deemed by the investigator to be related to the trial vaccine. Immunogenicity Across all the groups, 11 maternal participants (3%) and 60 infant participants (17%) were ex - cluded from the evaluable immunogenicity pop - ulation (Tables S8). Induction - nal anti-CPS IgG antibodies against all GBS6 serotypes was seen after immunization with any of the vaccine formulations, as compared with placebo, with geometric mean factor increases in vaccinated maternal participants at delivery ranging from 11.6 to 383.1 (Table 2 and Table S9). Antibody concentrations varied among sero - types, with the highest geometric mean concen - trations recorded for serotype Ia and the lowest for serotypes Ib and V (Table 2 and Figs. S2 and S3). The highest anti-CPS IgG geometric mean concentrations were generally observed with the 20-g GBS6 dose, formulated without AlPO4. Because this was a phase 2 trial, no formal com - parisons between the trial groups were performed. Anti-CPS IgG concentrations remained elevated through delivery (Fig. S4), and infant-maternal transfer ratios of approximately 0.4 to 1.3 were recorded across the different serotypes for the six vaccine formulations (Table 2). Because vac - cine-induced and naturally acquired anti-CPS IgG concentrations were measured with the same standardized assay, anti-CPS IgG could be com - pared with the calculated protective thresholds from the seroepidemiologic study. For the most immunogenic formulation, the percentage of infants with anti-CPS IgG concentrations that reached the threshold associated with a 75% risk reduction at birth (0.184 g per milliliter) ranged by serotype from 57 to 97% (Table 2). Discussion In this initial assessment of the GBS6 vaccine in pregnant women, no safety concerns associated with GBS6 were identified, and IgG responses to all six serotypes were elicited, which were sus - tained through delivery and transferred to infants. Immunogenicity did not improve with AlPO4 coformulation, a finding that was also observed in the previous phase 1 study involving nonpreg - nant adults.20 Higher reactogenicity was noted with AlPO4-containing formulations than in those that did not contain AlPO4, which is generally consistent with aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines.22 The kinetics of antibody induction and persis - tence were similar to that observed in the previ - ous study involving nonpregnant adults, in which concentrations remained elevated through 6 months of follow-up.20 Durable concentrations of anti-CPS IgG against group B streptococcus may provide additional benefit for the prevention of sepsis that can occur directly post partum in the mother.23 The distribution of cases in the seroepidemio - logic study followed the global distribution of serotypes causing invasive group B streptococcal disease in infants.2,19 Strengths of the study in - cluded the use of infant controls born to moth - ers with colonization by the homologous case serotype, as well as the determination of IgG concentrations from serum samples approxi - mating directly or indirectly the circulating an - tibody level in the infant. This latter aspect is of particular relevance because maternal IgG trans - fer ratios can vary among persons, and anti- group B streptococcus CPS IgG concentrations in infants generally do not reach maternal con - centrations24,25; moreover, it is biologically sig - nificant because the disease occurs in the infant. Previous serocorrelate studies that included both maternal and infant estimates showed higher calculated thresholds on the basis of maternal serum samples.12 Because South Africa represents Figure 3 (facing page).

A medically attended adverse event was defined as a nonserious adverse event that resulted in an evaluation at a medical facili ty. n engl j med 389;3 nejm.org July 20, 2023 225Maternal Vaccine for Infant Group B StreptococcusTable 2. Maternal and Infant Anti-CPS IgG GBS6 (N = 34-40)Placebo (N = 91-108) Maternal GMC % (95% CI) Serotype Ia 89 (74-97) (88-100) 53 (36-70) 57 (39-74) 9 (4-16) * The numbers of participants in each group are presented as ranges because of occasional missing values in assays for a particul ar serotype. The total GBS6 dose in the 5-g GBS6 groups was 30 g (5-g CPS per 10-g GBS6 groups, CPS per serotype); and the 20-g GBS6 group s, 120 g (20-g CPS per serotype). The standard - ized lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) values for IgG are 0.002 g per for serotype III, 0.004 g per milliliter for serotype IV, and 0.01 g per milliliter for serotype V. Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 \u00d7 LLOQ. The IgG threshold that was determined to be associated with a 75% reduction in the risk of disease was 0.184 g per milliliter, as derived from a universa l Bayesian model. CI denotes confidence interval, GMC geometric mean concentration, and GMR geometric mean ratio. n engl j med 389;3 nejm.org July 20, 2023 226The new england journal of medicine a location with high group B streptococcal dis - ease endemicity where microbiologic screening with intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is not the standard of care, the risk-concentration relation - ship may be more accurately assessed without the confounding effect of routine use of antibiotics. The use of an assay that is cross-standardized enabled evaluation of potential protective thresh - olds among serotypes. Our finding that the po - tential protective thresholds for serotypes Ia and III are similar is consistent with findings in other studies that examined protective thresholds for these two major serotypes, including in a popu - lation similar to that in the current study.12,26 We attempted to derive a risk-concentration curve that may be applicable to all serotypes of group B streptococcus. The biologic plausibility for the notion that equivalent functional activity is achieved by similar unit amounts of anti-CPS antibodies may be underpinned by the common role provided by the group B streptococcus CPS for evasion of the alternative complement path - way and the likely uniform mechanism of pro - tection of anti-CPS antibodies.19 The application of a single set of protective concentrations across serotypes has precedent. A single anti-CPS IgG concentration adequately describes the protective threshold against invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae disease imparted by pneumococcal glycoconjugate vaccines with few exceptions.27 A single protective threshold, however, may not capture protective capacity because concentrations above and below the threshold are not given appropriate weight with respect to risk reduction. The risk-concentration curve that was estab - lished in our seroepidemiologic study is from a low- and middle-income region with a high inci -dence of disease. Effectiveness studies for pneu - mococcal vaccines have shown that estimates derived from low- and middle-income regions can overestimate the protective thresholds for invasive pneumococcal disease in high-income countries.28 The protective antibody concentrations that were derived from this study warrant correlative data with respect to high-income countries to better define proper thresholds.29 Concurrent infections during pregnancy, such as malaria or human immunodeficiency virus infection, can addition - ally affect placental integrity and antibody trans - fer.29 Consequently, levels of transferred anti-CPS antibodies may be different in this context. This possibility should be further studied. GBS6 elicited anti-CPS antibodies against group B streptococcus in pregnant women that were transferred to infants at levels associated with a reduced risk of invasive group B strepto - coccal disease. The use of seroepidemiologic studies to identify quantitative immune correlates for invasive bacterial pathogens has in many cases correctly identified both the protective nature of the target vaccine antigen and the associated protective antibody level.30-34 The potential protec - tive concentrations that are reported herein are based on a single seroepidemiologic study. Future studies are needed to better define these immu - nologic relationships. Supported by Pfizer and the Bill and Melinda Gates Founda - tion.
