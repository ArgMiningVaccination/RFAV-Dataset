Keep your momentum. Beginnings compel us to look forward, move forward, and give shape and life to this year and the possibilities it opens. Remember, if you want things in your life to change, then you have to make changes in your life. What is your vision for health in 2019? Physically, on what are your eyes focused? Computer screens, phone screens, TV screens? This does not support health for a multitude of reasons (read Exposing the Dangers of Blue Light in this edition for the multitude). Take a moment to really evaluate how much screen time you are getting every day. Your eyes take in light, convert the light into electrical signals, and the brain processes this information for you to \"see.\" What are you seeing? What kind of light, information, and images are your eyes and brain processing? As you move toward your personal vision of health in 2019, perhaps it is time to revise what you are looking at and see things that are more supportive of your health. The quality of light in what we see also affects how we feel and how we perceive things from a greater understanding. If your eyes spend most of their time focused on man -made, artificial light that conveys negative information, then guess how you are going to feel. (Robots, anyone?) As is in alignment with the principles of natural health, we seek to return to what nature intended. Sunlight. Moonlight. Darkness. Yes, modern technology has its conveniences, and certainly, we can't all live primitive lifestyles, and so, the key is balance. Take frequent breaks from the screens. Watch a sunrise and a sunset. Gaze at the stars. Let the light of nature illuminate your world. Consider what you are watching, what is filtering into your subconscious mind even if you are \"not paying attention.\" Become more mindful. See something inspiring and uplifting, and let this be healing to you. In striving to accomplish the goals that you have set for this year and to allow that balance to become easy and natural, please keep in mind the classes that are being offered through the NCC and NITE. We aspire to provide topics that are timely, interesting, educational, fun, and that will benefit you, your family, and the community. Please take advantage of these opportunities to learn with like -minded people and expand our vision for health, because we can make a difference and have a significant impact on this world in which we live. There is beauty everywhere if only you have the eyes to look. Amy Jo If you truly love nature, you will find beauty everywhere. Vincent Van Gogh The Praises of Herbs Etc's Clients for CBD Oil: Pain Relieving Stress Reducing Weight Release Hormone Balancing Amazing! Herbs etc High Quality CBD Oil High or Medium Strength Liquid or Topical Creams Discounts Available 3 Top Spring Cleanses By Bessheen Baker, ND Nothing says Spring like a good and proper cleanse! What happened to these great traditions of the past? Well, it's time to bring them back. After a winter of necessary, heavier foods for warmth, not to mention some possible heavy holiday eating, it's time to flush the body of stagnation and invigorate the blood. In this article, you will find a list of my tried and true favorite spring cleanses and even a new one called Purify 2.0. 1. One of the easiest ways to help the body cleanse and restore balance is by fasting. We really enjoy a simple one day \"fast\" that may even include a nice bowl of soup! The body naturally harmonizes with nature, so following a calendar method of cleansing can really tune up your own rhythms within supporting your thyroid, adrenals, and entire glandular system. Consider an all fruit day, just herbal teas with honey, smoothie day, or my favorite, broth throughout the day. Doing this every new moon and full moon creates a wonderful cleansing pattern that has been followed around the world for thousands of years. Some folks enjoy the results so much they do it all year round not just March - May. Join me and the other Naturopaths at Herb etc. We are doing it all year long. Many clients have reported releasing up to 35 lbs in a year, passing parasites, reducing joint complaints and more, just by fasting 2 days a month. 2. Another popular and favorite spring cleanse is to just get on a good liver cleansing herbal combination like: Liver Cleanse, Milk Thistle Combination, Liver Balance or Gall Bladder Formula, taking 2 caps 2x a day from March through May! This is great for headaches, female concerns, grouchy men, angry teens, and humans! 3. Nature's Sunshine has come out with my new favorite cleanse: it's called Purify 2.0, and it hits the nail on the head! This program is easy to take, and you can feel the difference in your energy right away as well as experience a cleaner colon that seriously will make you smile. I know it sounds funny, and yet, you probably know exactly what I mean. What would it feel like to have abundant energy, mental clarity, a stronger immune system, and a happy, regular colon? Although the four products to complete this cleanse can be effective on their own, there is something very unique about the four week program and its amazing clinical results. Independently tested, this program has done the following: Essentially, you take a powdered tasty citrus and beet packet to increase nitric oxide improving blood flow and oxygen throughout the body, and take a similar green packet to support the colon and heavy metal detoxification. Also, take our very tasty vanilla pea protein drink 2x a day, along with some potent friendly bacteria for the gut. Snacks and a healthy meal are part of the program. People are feeling so good after getting the toxins out, the liver function up, and cardiovascular improvement, that the brain is clear, the gut toned, and the aches and pains reduced or gone. Ask us for the instruction handout, and we'll be glad to help! Increase Heavy Metal Elimination up to 76% Lower Gut Inflammation by 35% Reduce Cardiovascular Risk by 22% Improve Liver Function by 21% Increase General Health, Energy and Mental Focus by 42% 4 Q. What is neuropathy? A: Neuropathy is a condition involving nerve damage that often results in a painful sensation in the feet or hands. Numbness, tingling, or even a burning sensation can also accompany this pain. This discomfort is another signal from our bodies that there is something out of balance that needs our attention. If left unchecked, neuropathy can lead to issues with urination, sexual function, organ or gland function, or even paralysis. Q: What causes neuropathy? A: There are several different contributing causes of neuropathy. This condition is most commonly caused by diabetes and is commonly referred to as diabetic neuropathy. Neuropathy that is affecting the peripheral nervous system is known as peripheral neuropathy. This can be caused by chemotherapy treatments, a compromised immune system, or malnutrition from following a nutrient depleted diet. Q: What can be done to help alleviate the pain? A: There are many wonderful naturopathic tools that can be used to help bring balance to the body and therefore, get rid of the obnoxious pain! B: Reflexology is a great therapy that provides quick and lasting relief to those who suffer from the pain and is highly recommended for this condition by many trusted naturopaths. Active isolated stretching can also be of great benefit. C: Herbs Etc makes a custom essential oil blend that works wonders for getting rid of the foot pain. Make this a regular routine between reflexology sessions for the best results. It is always a good idea to consult with your local trusted naturopath to determine the specific cause and a plan of action to bring the body back into a happy and balanced state. Neuropathy: More Than Just a Pain in the Foot! \"I am thrilled to write a testimony for Rejuvenaid from Nature's Sunshine. I picked it up from Herbs etc. after seeing my Naturopath, Bessheen Baker. She suggested that I start on one half a packet per day for the first few days until I got used to the energy and improved blood flow. I have significant circulation concerns. I am cold in the winter, energy is generally low, and I have to push myself mentally to get through many days. We have worked on improving liver function in the past, and she always encourages beets for blood, digestion, and liver health. Honestly, I was pretty happy to get beets in a simple and easy to use powder packet. We felt I was really Nitric Oxide deficient especially with a family history of heart and brain struggles. I could tell a difference the first day but thought maybe I was just having a better than normal day. By day three, I was extremely excited. Yes, my circulation is significantly better, but it's my brain that I notice the most! I can't say that I have felt this good in 10 years or longer! My memory is greatly improved, my attitude is better, I am even funny. Next, we are going to add the DTX Biome to clean my colon; together the two are quite the Spring Cleanse, getting rid of heavy metals and other bad stuff. \" Linda P. - Clare, MI How It Works: A natural, clinically studied, nitric oxide (NO) generating supplement, Rejuvenaid safely produces and sustains superior levels of NO. Unlike other NO products, this patent - pending formula uses a dual system featuring a proprietary beet root extract along with L- Arginine. This dual -pathway approach frees up the body's ability to produce its own NO while using the ingredients to generate even more. Rejuvenaid also features a proprietary, polyphenol rich antioxidant blend called Herbal Shield that offers select vitamins to help sustain higher levels of NO and support circulation. Dual Pathway Nitric Oxide Generator for Vasodilation and Cardiovascular Health. Enjoy youthful vitality with Nature's Sunshine's Rejuvenaid, a natural, healthy way to achieve and maintain peak physical and mental performance with higher levels of vigor. Clinical studies have shown that higher levels of Nitric Oxide (NO) \u2014a signaling molecule that improves blood flow and circulation by relaxing arteries and blood vessels are associated with increased vitality, physical performance, stamina, recovery, mental acuity, sexual performance and lower blood pressure. Made in the endothelial layer of blood vessels and arteries, NO is quickly used or oxidized within the body and must be replaced constantly. A sedentary lifestyle, suboptimal diet, and age can each negatively impact NO production. 5 Our physical body systems are heavily governed by our emotions. This was understood by the Chinese and Indian ancients. Life energy is fed through the electrical or meridian system. This life energy is disturbed by negative thought and emotional patterns. Constant negative emotions will manifest physically. Flower essences help free us from stress and negative thought patterns by either eliminating them or helping us recognize and stop the patterns. Flower Essences will teach our own emotional energy how to acquire positive personality traits. This is slightly based off the homeopathic principle of \"like cures like.\" The emotional signature of a flower will, in turn, transmute that same emotional energy pattern within you. There are documented uses from over 5,000 years ago in ancient Australia, Asia, Egypt, England, and Russia. In ancient Ayurveda and Crete, people floated flowers or petals in water to drink it to anoint certain parts of their body or cleanse themselves of disturbing thoughts. Ancient Native Americans simply had the ability to draw energy from flowers and plants. They were able to match the energy of the flower with the specific part of the body that was out of balance. The famous ancient philosopher and Renaissance physician Paracelsus collected morning dew from flowers, which he not only used himself, but also prescribed to others for emotional disturbances. Paracelsus also revived the method of \"Doctrines of signatures\" and believed that plants and flowers grew freely where they were needed. Nature's Sunshine has developed seven flower essence blends that correspond with the seven emotional states. Healing with Flowers Match Your Emotions to a Flower Essence Blend Keep Cool This \"Keep Cool\" blend eases feelings of anger as well as irritability. The blend teaches how to control temper and work through problems more effectively through communicating instead of fighting. Find Strength \"Find Strength\" promotes our ability to get in touch with our anger in a healthy way and stand up to abuse. It also allows us to establish healthy boundaries in our life and have the ability to say \"no\" and not be taken advantage of. Release It \"Release It\" helps us to move through grief, let go of the past, and gain the inner strength to move forward. This remedy is helpful when we feel like we are victims as well as aid us in the grief of any loss. Open Heart When we have been severely emotionally wounded and/or our hearts have been broken, it is very hard to open our heart again to love and feel safe with intimacy. \"Open Heart\" aids us to trust others again and learn compassion. Be Courageous \"Be Courageous\" helps us have more trust in our own judgement. It allows us to face our fears in order to build our self -confidence and courage. Be Response - Able The \"Be Response -Able\" blend engages us to RESPOND rather than REACT. This helps us get in touch with our emotions so that they do not result in dysfunctional behavior which leads to bad decisions. This blend aids in releasing self -defeating behaviors, addictions, and compulsiveness. Distress Remedy If you are unsure about what blend to choose for yourself or someone else, \"Distress Remedy\" aids us in becoming more emotionally centered. Distress Remedy promotes presence and awareness during times of trauma and severe stress. 6 Hemp is NOT the same as marijuana. However, they are both a part of the Cannabis genus of plants. Due to the similar leaf shape, hemp is frequently confused with marijuana. Although both plants are from the species cannabis, hemp contains virtually no THC (delta -9-tetrahydrocannabinol), therefore Hemp cannot be used as a psychoactive drug, because it produces virtually no THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) (less than 1%), whereas marijuana produces between 5 -20% THC. Hemp is completely different from marijuana in its function, cultivation, and application. But, these differences didn't stop our political leaders from grouping all Cannabis species as a Schedule I Drug in the 1970's due to a corporate agenda. What does CBD mean? CBD (Cannabinoid) is a compound that can be found in both psychoactive cannabis (marijuana) and non - psychoactive cannabis (hemp). CBD's come from the plant leaves and flowers from the hemp plant. Cannabinoids, which can be either consumed or produced naturally by the body, interact with the body's central regulatory system (the endocannabinoid system). When consumed, cannabinoids bind to receptor sites throughout the brain and body. Specifically, THC binds to receptors in the brain. CBD binds to receptors throughout the entire body. Both compounds interact with your body's endocannabinoid system, but they have very different effects. Hemp CBD's contain over 100 different therapeutic compounds to help support numerous areas of the body. CBD vs. Marijuana by Lori Becker, ND Now that the Hemp CBD oil trend is getting more and more popular, we have presented valuable information for you to learn about what it is and how it works. If you decide to use CBD oil as a part of your natural health program, here are some things to expect: A significant reduction in inflammation, clarity of thought, reduction of anxiety, calming of the nerves, and even a normalization, of hunger. The reason why this occurs is because hemp CBD oil has the ability to aid in the balance of the body's natural bio -rhythms. A bio -rhythm is a recurring cycle in the physiology or functioning of the body, such as the daily cycle of sleeping and waking. This also extends to cyclic patterns of physical, emotional, or mental activity. Our body's natural bio -rhythms within the nervous system, brain, glandular system, and immune system are severely disrupted on a daily basis. What disrupts these bio-rhythms? Here is a short list: EMFs, WIFI, computer screens, phone screens, TV screens, cell phone use, and a consistent exposure to toxins from food and water on a regular basis. How can we reset these bio -rhythms? One effective way is to go camping in the woods for about 2 weeks. This exposure to negative ions and nature aids in the rebalance of the circadian rhythm and promotes harmony and health within the body. Not all of us have that option, though. But, what we can do is eat clean and have an honest daily attempt to live in alignment with nature as much as possible. Nature heals. Anything artificial promotes disease. When we look at our lives with that perspective, how many things in our life are really promoting health? Now, let's learn what all this Hemp CBD Oil craze is all about. Hemp vs. Marijuana Hemp is a distinct variety of the plant species Cannabis sativa. 7 New Purify 2.0 The Ultimate Detox The Science To Back it Up: Clinical results show that Purify 2.0: Increases heavy metal elimination up to 76% Lowers gut inflammation by 35% Reduces cardiovascular risk by 22%, including improvements in blood pressure, triglycerides, and cholesterol Improves liver function by 21% Benefits: Helps detoxify the body Supports the elimination of heavy metals Supports healthy intestinal permeability Helps purify the gut and balance bacteria Increases feelings of energy and vitality* Enhances circulatory/heart health function Supports gut health with essential proteins and nutrients How it Works: Purify 2.0 is composed of four products: UltraBiome DTX provides unparalleled support for heavy metal detoxification. It supports healthy intestinal permeability and supports microbiome balance, full -body cleansing, and regular elimination. Nature's Sunshine Rejuvenaid stimulates exceptional nitric oxide production via two pathways to help relax blood vessel walls, improve blood flow, vitality and mental focus, and support blood pressure levels. Bacillus Coagulans supports the gastrointestinal system, providing relief from occasional digestive upset and helping to replenish and rebalance the microbiome. Protein powder provides fuel for a healthy metabolism and supports gut health. Participants in the clinical study reported seeing benefits in as little as 7 days! They also noted a 42% improvement in their general health, energy and mental focus. The Gift of Health, Is it on Your Holiday List? 7 What is the Endocannabinoid system? The Endocannabinoid system is a Biochemical Communication System that regulates our entire physiology! This means it regulates body systems such as the circulatory, immune, glandular, and nervous system. So, the body creates its own cannabinoids, called endocannabinoids, to help support the body's central regulatory system \u2014 which manages homeostasis and affects bodily processes such as hormones, appetite, mood, and sleep. Full Spectrum CBD supplements will support the endocannabinoid system to keep the receptors working at optimal capacity. This allows the body to balance and heal! What is the difference between CBD and THC?? Both Hemp CBD and THC are chemically similar to your body's own endocannabinoids. This allows them to interact with your cannabinoid receptors. The interaction impacts the release of neurotransmitters in your brain. THC is responsible for causing marijuana users to get \"high\" since it binds with the cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors in the brain. Hemp CBD and THC have many of the same medical benefits. They can provide relief from several of the same conditions. However, Hemp CBD doesn't cause the \"high\" that occurs with THC. Hemp CBD is used for many health challenges such as: seizures, inflammation, pain, psychosis or mental disorders, IBS, nausea, migraines, depression, anxiety, epilepsy, MS, ALS, Parkinson's, acne, dyskinesia, psoriasis, dermatitis, eczema, broken bones, bacterial infections, diabetes, RA, ADHD, Schizophrenia, withdrawal, heart disease, convulsions, fibromyalgia, anti -cancer, anti -tumor, cancer prevention, immune system challenges, and much more. THC and CBD cross over in certain areas for health support. Specifically, THC is helpful with: pain, muscle spasticity, glaucoma, insomnia, low appetite, nausea, anxiety, and more. In a full spectrum form of natural Hemp CBD oil, there are no side effects. Risks Associated with THC As with all medicinal herbs, both hemp CBD and marijuana should be used appropriately for their ability to aid in certain health conditions. Unfortunately, marijuana is misused which has led to its legal ramifications. THC causes temporary side effects, such as: increased heart rate, coordination problems, dry mouth, red eyes, slower reaction times, and memory loss. Non-therapeutic use and/or abusive use of THC may be connected to the disruption of the brain's neurotransmitters and long -term negative psychiatric effects. This is especially true for adolescents who consume large amounts of THC. There is a time and a place for THC. However, it should only be used safely and responsibly for medicinal purposes only under the guidance of a health professional. A Quick History Lesson on Hemp: Cannabis has documented therapeutic use for up to the last 3,000 years. Industrial hemp has been grown in the U.S. since the first European settlers arrived in the early 1600's. Colonial farmers were required to grow Hemp in the 1700s, mainly for its strong fiber. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams all grew hemp and actively advocated for commercial hemp production. Benjamin Franklin owned a mill that made hemp paper. Thomas Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence on hemp paper. Many historians say that the first American Flag in 1776 was made from hemp, as no other fiber was strong enough to withstand the salty air on naval ships. Hemp grows like a weed and can be used in the production of food, personal care products, textiles, paper, and even plastic and construction materials. By 1938, Popular Mechanics called hemp the \"Billion Dollar Crop,\" praising its potential to produce 25,000 different products , as high as $192 billion in today's market and capable of producing four times the paper per acre than trees . If Hemp is so useful, why was it banned? American industrialists led by newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst (who owned vast timberlands) and DuPont executives, who'd begun processing petroleum and wood for plastics, became disgruntled by the way hemp cut into their market shares. A strategy was then put into place to create a frenzy over ill effects of marijuana. At the same time as these campaigns, cotton's popular- ity increased, so did the improvisations of the inventions and machinery related to cotton. In 1937, Hemp was lumped under the umbrella of \"marihuana\" in the Marihuana Tax Act. The law was aimed at regulating the narcotic varieties of cannabis, but due to being lumped together, the hemp industry was effectively regulated out of existence. Petroleum products (that are toxic to the environment) replaced hemp lubricants and paints and oil. Due to multiple private corporation's influence on the government, from that point on, hemp was viewed solely as an illegal drug; even though it is not the same as marijuana. Is Hemp Legal today? Hemp -derived CBD products are legal under Federal Law in the United States with certain state regulations. Michigan has legalized Hemp growing and consumption under Michigan's recreational marijuana law that was approved by voters in November 2018. Michigan passed the Industrial Hemp Research Act of 2014, which allowed government departments, colleges, and universities to grow industrial hemp for research purposes, as part of an agricultural pilot program or academic research project. The United States Department of Health and Human Services does hold a patent called 'Cannabinoids as Antioxidants and Neuroprotectants' (Patent # 6,630,507). This patent states: \"Cannabinoids have been found to have antioxidant properties, unrelated to NMDA (N -methyl -D-aspartate) receptor antagonism. This new found property makes cannabinoids useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of a wide variety of oxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic, age -related, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The cannabinoids are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage following ischemic insults, such as stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, HIV and Dementia. \" Nonpsychoactive cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (hemp/CBD), are particularly advantageous to use, because they avoid toxicity that is encountered with psychoactive cannabinoids (THC) at high doses useful in the method of the present invention.\" Some of our CBD tinctures are suspended in Hemp Seed oil. This enhances the medicinal value of the product due to all of the properties of hemp seed. 8 They have an excellent 3:1 balance of omega -3 and omega -6 fatty acids, which promote cardiovascular health. Conclusion: Hemp challenges the profits of the pharmaceutical giants such as Dupont, Bayer (Monsanto) as well as petroleum, plastics, wood, and cotton. We could stop polluting the environment if we replaced plastic, petroleum, deforestation, and cotton with hemp. These are just a few areas of impact of thousands of uses that are environmentally responsible. Hemp plants even have the ability to clean and re -mineralize the soil. The correct medicinal use of CBD oil can also replace the use of dangerous pharmaceutical drugs. Again, all of this is a threat to large corporate profits. Knowing this information makes it not surprising that it was made illegal for these corporate profiteers. Things are finally moving in a better direction. However, we must use these medicines in their whole and natural form. Pharmaceutical companies will pull certain constituents from plants and formulate their own synthetic medicines. They do this in order to patent a drug for profit. Unfortunately, when plant constituents are synthesized in this manner, they are no longer working in their whole, natural, and balanced form. This is why pharmaceutical drugs cause side effects. The body responds to these drugs as a poison with an inflammatory response.

March 30: The Healing Power of Telling Your Story Learning to tell your story may be the most powerful medicine on earth. Story is deep within our biology, and we are literally wired to tell and understand the world in terms of story. Each of us is part of an unfolding narrative, each a hero in an epic tale. And yet, so many of us leave our stories untold, the real story, that is. Most of us tell the \"outside\" story, such as details of our work or family. The real story lies within and expresses our deepest values and hopes. This story touches on the lasting, visionary quality of greatness we all carry. When we don't know and tell this story, we wind up feeling lonely and out of touch with our life's purpose, bothered with a chronic sense that something just isn't right. We may even wind up feeling worthless, unloved, or even sick. Join Instructor Sheila Carroll, professional story coach, for a day of discovery and healing. Sheila will teach you simple techniques for telling your story for health and well -being. A great course for helping yourself or others heal, unique and satisfying!

Special considerations will be given to the health concerns that arise from having worn braces or other dental devices and balancing the restrictions they cause. These advanced techniques help to improve health, focus, mental clarity, hormonal imbalances, and much more. CranioSacral experience required to take this class. Instructor: Amy Jo Howard, ND Class Time: 9 a.m. \u20145 p.m. Class Fee: $89 November 9: How to Deliver a Baby Everyone is invited to this lively and insightful class on \"Birth for Everybody.\" Does it matter how we view birth, or how we talk to our neighbors and kids about birth? (Hint: YES, IT DOES!) How we get born affects our whole lives - our expectations, how we breathe, our immune system, and how we connect (or not) with the rest of the human race. This lively class will reframe birth as it's presented in the US today, teach what babies are really doing and expecting, and discuss how the amateur can safely and calmly deliver a baby if unexpected circumstances occur. NEW understanding of gentle birth has very specific and simple elements which reduce infant and maternal mortality, and that can be used in any situation for great outcomes! We'll explore making -do in disasters and provide a beautiful, easy- to-use reference that reinforces all you've learned. This is a fun and inspirational day (no ick, promise!) and is for everyone who cares about mothers and babies - come with a friend! Instructor: Beth Barbeau Class Time: 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. Class Fee $89 12 Beginning in March, We are Excited to Again Offer Our Healthy Eating Classes These classes have grown in popularity and are facilitated by our resident chef, Gigi. These classes focus on healthy food preparation and storage, as well as learning new techniques and introducing new foods into your daily meals. Due to the popularity of these classes and the number of folks who gather, we will be offering our classes at the Coomer Church, located on South Vandecar Road, 2 \u00bd miles south of M-20. This is a great location right next to Dr. Baker's Symbiosis Ranch and Gardens. Whenever possible, we will use ingredients right from the ranch, and it would not be uncommon to have Dr. Baker or her mother, Nancy Fodor, ND, visit and share in the classes. You will learn meal preparation tips that will help you set a healthy meal on your table for you and your family in minutes. The 2019 series will start March 19 and is scheduled for every third Tuesday of the month through November. These classes are held from 6 p.m. - 7:30 p.m. There is a donation of $5 requested to help cover the costs of supplies. As usual, this is a hands -on class, and you get to sample what you cook each month. Join in on the fun, and learn something new about your food!

Before the invention of artificial lighting, the sun was the major source of light for people's daily activities, determining how people spent their days and their evenings. Now that we rely less on the sun and natural light, it is disrupting our circadian rhythms and creating a number of health concerns. Sunlight contains red, orange, yellow, green, and blue rays, depending on the energy and wavelength of the individual ray. Digital devices emit blue light, and research is showing how this is increasing eye damage and accelerating macular degeneration (AMD), which is the leading cause of blindness. Macular degeneration (AMD) is when you lose your central vision and cannot see fine details either close or far away. Your peripheral vision remains intact. For example, if you are looking at a clock with hands, you will be able to see the numbers but not the hands. The macula is in the middle portion of the retina, located in the back of the eye, and is made up of light -sensitive cells called cones and rods. These cells are essential for central vision. There are also photoreceptor cells in the retina that help convert light into electrical signals that travel along the optic nerve to the brain where the information is processed, allowing you to \"see.\" Without these photoreceptor cells, visual information would not trigger a biochemical response, and the biochemical response, in turn, is due partly to a molecule known as retinal which is a form of Vitamin A. Blue light essentially poisons the photoreceptor cells. Rays on the blue visible light spectrum have shorter wavelengths and more energy. Rays on the red spectrum have longer wavelengths and less energy. 13 A study from the University of Toledo found that blue light emitted from digital electronics may accelerate macular degeneration, because the blue light affects retinal and results in the death of photoreceptor cells in the macula. Kasun Rathnayake, a Ph.D. student from the research group, says: \"It's toxic. If you shine blue light on retinal, the retinal kills photoreceptor cells as the signaling molecule on the membrane dissolves. Photoreceptor cells do not regenerate in the eye. When they're dead, they're dead for good.\" Further research introduced other kinds of cells to different types of light. Cancer cells and heart cells were exposed to green, yellow, and red light, and no activity was generated. When any cell was exposed to blue light, however, the blue light produced toxicity, and every type of cell was killed. What's even more interesting to note is that while retinal is essential to trigger photoreceptor cells in the eye to produce electrical signals, retinal is not limited to the eye and is present throughout the body. Therefore, the toxicity from blue light could potentially be even more damaging to our health. Another critical aspect of our lives being affected by blue light is sleep. Blue light inhibits melatonin production, because melatonin synthesis and secretion is affected by light exposure to the eyes. (Not to mention that serotonin is the precursor to melatonin, and serotonin is primarily produced in the gastrointestinal tract. From here, we could get into a whole discussion about foods, toxins, and digestive system health. But, where were we... .) Melatonin is responsible for regulating sleep -wake cycles, reproduction, and other circadian rhythm processes and is also an antioxidant for the mitochondria of your cells. By Amy Jo Howard, ND, CH For the pineal gland to properly synthesize melatonin from serotonin, we must be exposed to bright (natural) light in the early part of the day and complete darkness at night. So, if we are not getting sunlight during the day, are getting lots of screen time during the day and especially, right before bed, and we are not sleeping in a totally dark environment (because of illumination from night lights, TV, cell phone, alarm clocks, street lamps, etc.), then is it any wonder that a majority of people have trouble sleeping? To protect your vision for 2019 and beyond (and to get some restorative sleep, too), here are some natural ways to keep your eyesight healthy and keep your biological rhythms functioning optimally: Reduce screen time. Do some activities outside (in the sun!). If you are working and can't avoid screen time, take a few minutes break every half an hour. 14 Wear blue blocking glasses (especially after noon and definitely, after 7pm), or install blue -blocking software on your digital devices. We carry great glasses at Herbs etc. Replace LED lights with incandescent bulbs. Sleep in total darkness - Take the technology out of the bedroom, place darkening shades on the windows, or wear an eye mask if needed. Vitamin E - Researchers found that alpha -tocopherol, a derivative of vitamin E, stopped the photocells from dying when exposed to blue light. Super Omega 3 EPA - Omega 3 fats help improve cell structure and protect eyesight. Perfect Eyes - This herbal combination from Nature's Sunshine contains Vitamin A, lutein, zeaxanthin, carotenoids, and more to reduce light -induced oxidative damage to the eyes. Super ORAC or Super Antioxidant - These combinations from Nature's Sunshine are full of antioxidants that help protect cells from free radical damage. Flora PM liquid probiotic - This liquid probiotic also contains humic minerals, trace minerals, and magnesium from the Dead Sea; besides being restoring to the digestive tract, it is said to be healing to eyesight when applied as eye drops: 1 drop in each eye, 1x daily before bed.
