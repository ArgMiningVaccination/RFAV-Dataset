SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS 62761 (217) 782 -3516 FAX: (217) 785 -4111 Page 1 of 21 NAME: Hazel Crest TYPE OF PROJECT: Substantive HSA: VII DESCRIPTION: The Applicants (Advocate Health and Hospitals Corporation d/b/a Advocate South Suburban Hospital, Advocate Health Care Network , Advocate Aurora Health, Inc. and Advocate Health, Inc.) propose to establish a 27- bed acute mental illness category of service at a cost of $21,068,968. The expected completion date is February 29, 2024. T he purpose of the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Act is to establish a procedure (1) which requires a person establishing, constructing or modifying a health care facility, as herein defined, to have the qualifications, background, character and financial resources to adequately provide a proper service for the community; (2) that promotes the orderly and economic development of health care facilities in the State of Illinois that avoids unnecessary duplication of such facilities; and (3) that promotes planning for and development of health care facilities needed for comprehensive health care especially in areas where the health planning process has identified unmet needs. Cost containment and support for safety net services must continue to be central tenets of the Certificate of Need process. (20 ILCS 3960/2) T he Certificate of Need process required under this Act is designed to restrain rising health care costs by preventing unnecessary construction or modification of health care facilities. The Board must assure that the establishment, construction, or modification of a health care facility or the acquisition of major medical equipment is consistent with the public interest and that the proposed project is consistent with the orderly and economic development or acquisition of those facilities and equipment and is in accord with the standards, criteria, or plans of need adopted and approved by the Board. Board decisions regarding the construction of health care facilities must consider capacity, quality, value, and equity. \"Construction\" or \"Modification\" means the establishment, erection, building, alteration, reconstruction, modernization, improvement, extension, discontinuation, change of ownership of or by a health care facility, or the purchase or acquisition by or through a health care facility of equipment or service for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes or for facility administration or operation or any capital expenditure made by or on behalf of a health care facility which exceeds the capital expenditure minimum . In formation received by the State Board regarding this project can be found at: https://www2.illinois.gov/sites/hfsrb/Projects/Pages/22 -028.aspx Page 2 of 21 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Applicants ( Advocate Health and Hospitals Corporation d/b/a Advocate South Suburban Hospital, Advocate Health Care Network, Advocate Aurora Health, Inc. and Advocate Health, Inc. ) propose to establish a 27- bed acute mental illness category of service at a cost of $21,068,968. The expected completion date is February 29, 2024. In conjunction with t his project the Applicants have applied to discontinue the 39- bed acute mental illness category of service at Advocate Christ Medical Center (#E -051-22). As part of that discontinuation exemption the Applicants are proposing to add 20- medical surgical bed s to Advocate Christ Medical Center. The Applicants consider this project a relocation of acute mental illness service from Advocate Christ Medical Center to Advocate South Suburban Hospital . The Hospitals are approximately 12 miles and 30 minutes apart. Both Hospitals are in Hospital Planning Area A -04. The State Board does not have rules regarding the relocation of an Acute Mental Illness Category of Service from one Hospital to another. Therefore, this project is being reviewed as an establishm ent of Acute Mental Illness Service at Advocate South Suburban Hospital. This Application was modified on November 14, 2022, to add Advocate Health, Inc. as an Applicant. BACKGROUND In 2018 the State Board approved Advocate South Suburban Hospital to construct a 2- story structure housing the surgery suite connected to the main hospital. Permit #18 -022 approved the Hospital to add an additional cardiac catheterization lab, endoscopy procedure rooms , and Phase I and Pha se II recovery rooms . The total cost of the project was $83.2 million. WHY THE PROJECT IS BEFORE THE STATE BOARD: This project is before the State Board because the project proposes to establish a category of service. PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT: According to the Applicants this project is being proposed to improve access to mental health services while also improving access to tertiary and other critical care services for patients at Advocate Christ Medical Center . The Applicants believe it is essential to convert the 39- bed acute mental illness category of service at Advocate Christ Medical Center to medical surgical beds. According to the Applicants the only viable option is to discontinue the acute mental illness category of service at Advocate Christ Medical Center and convert 20 of those beds to a medical/surgical unit and establish a 27 -bed a cute mental illness service at Advocate South Suburban Hospital. PUBLIC HEARING/COMMENT: No public hearing was requested. The St ate Board received 14 letters of support and one letter of opposition and are included at the end of this report. CONCLUSION: There is a calculated excess of 59 AMI beds in HSA 6 -7 A-04 AMI Hospital Planning Area. Should the State Board approve this project as well as the discontinuation of the 39- bed Acute Mental Illness Category of Service at Advocate Christ Medical Center there will be a calculated excess of 47 AMI beds in the A -04 AMI P lanning Area . There are three hospital AMI units within the 10 - mile radius of Advocate South Suburban Hospital with a 148 AMI beds. None of these hospitals Page 3 of 21 are at the target utilization of 85% and based upon their 2021 utilization could accommodate the patients projected to utilize the proposed 27- bed unit at Advocate South Suburban Hospital by 2025. State Board Standards Not Met Criteria Reasons for Non -Compliance 77 ILAC 1110. 210 (b) - Planning Area Need The HSA 6 & 7 A-04 Acute Mental Illness Planning Area has a calculated excess of 59 AMI Beds. 77 ILAC 1110. 210 (c)(7) - Unnecessary Duplication/Maldistribution There are 148 authorized AMI beds within 10 -miles of Advocate South Suburban Hospital with a CY 2021 average daily census of 59.2 patients and a utilization of approximately 40%. 77 ILAC 1120.140 (c) - Reasonableness of Project Costs Modernization and c ontingency costs are $11,618,050 and are $576.66 per GSF. This appears high when compared to the State Board Standard of $565.58 a difference of $11.08.

State Board Staff finds the proposed project is not in conformance with the provisions of 77 ILAC 1120 (Part 1120). III. General Information Advocate Aurora Health, Inc., a Delaware nonprofit corporation, is the sole corporate member of Advocate Health Care Network, an Illinois not -for-profit corporation (\"Advocate\") and Aurora Health Care, Inc., a Wisconsin nonstock not -for-profit corporation (\"Aurora\"). Advocate Aurora Health, Inc. is comprised of not -for-profit and for-profit entities, the primary activities are the delivery of health care services and the provision of goods and services ancillary thereto. Advocate Aurora Health, Inc. is comprised of 24 acute care hospitals (nine hospitals in Illinois), an integrated children's hospital and a psychiatric hospital, primary and specialty physician services, outpatient centers, physician office buildings, pharmacies, and rehabilitation and home health and hospice care in northern and central Illinois and eastern Wisconsin (Source : Audited Financial Statements) . Advocate Aurora Health Inc. and Atrium Health Inc. were approved Page 5 of 21 by the State Board to enter into a joint operating agreement on November 14, 2022. The joint operating agreement is known as Advocat e Health, Inc. The t able below shows the nine hospitals in Illinois owned by Advocate Health, Inc. the city and the number of beds at each hospital.

Financial Commitment will occur after permit approval. The Applicants noted the financial commitment \" status may change if the Advocate Aurora Health Master Agreement is completed prior to permit approval .\" 1 Target occupancy for acute mental illness service is 85%. Below is the Advocate South Suburban Hospital 2021 Utilization. 1 The Applicants Response : The reference to a Master Agreement relates to plans to execute a master design and construction agreement (\"Master Agreement\") which will occur shortly and likely no later than early October 2022. At the time that the CON permit application was filed, suc h Master Agreement had not been completed and this is the basis for the footnote. By way of background, MH utilizes an integrated project delivery (\"IPD\") contracting approach for design and construction activities. This IPD method has become a standard m ethod for contracting in the construction industry including for health care facilities. IPD allows for greater collaboration between the architects and the general contractor, shorter timelines and provides for a more nimble design and construction proces s. Instead of working separately, everyone from architects to trade partners and contractors work from a single model, providing real-time cost and constructability feedback. This allows for the most efficient use of resources and eliminates the need for c ostly and time -intensive design iterations. In effect, it allows the architects to design projects that will be on budget based on the amount of approved capital and based on the anticipate d CON permit amount. Note that while the IPD model accelerates AAH construction timeline by allowing its architects and contractors to collaborate on the project design and finalize the architectural plans, so they may be submitted to IDPH immediately after CON approval, AAH will not commence demolition or construction of the new acute mental illness unit until it receives both HFSRB and IDPH approval. Importantly, the costs incurred during the design phase will not exceed the capital expenditure minimum, and the Master Agreement is terminable at AAH's conv enience, in the event the CON permit application is not approved. Therefore, the commencement of these preconstruction services complies with the HFSRB's regulations governing project expenditures.

The Hospital stated the reason for the obstetric discontinuation \"At a national level, birth rates have declined over 9% since 2015, while Illinois births have declined at a steeper rate of 18%. In the South Chicagoland service area, births have declined by 19% since 2015, however births at Ad vocate South Suburban Hospital have declined 40% during that same time period. Advocate stated that Advocate Trinit y Hospital and Advocate Christ Medical Center are both within 30 minutes of Advocate South Suburban Hospital and can accommodate the obstetric patients . IV. Health Service Area Advocate South Suburban Hospital is in Health Service Area VII and Hospital Planning Area A -04. The A -04 Hospital Planning Area includes the City of Chicago Community Areas of West Pullman, Riverdale, Hegewisch, Ashburn, Auburn Gresham, Beverly, Washington Heights, Mount Greenwood, and Morgan Park; Cook County Townships of Lemont, Stickney, Worth, Lyons, Palos, Calumet, Thornton, Bremen, Orland, Rich, and Bloom. There are seven acute care hospitals in the A -04 Hospital Planning Area and one psychiatric hos pital. The A -04 Hospital AMI Planning Area includes three hospital s with AMI hospital units and one psychiatric hospital in this AMI planning area. There is currently a calculated excess of 59 AMI beds in th e A-04 Hospital Planning A rea.

Project Details The Applicants propose to establish a 27- bed acute mental illness category of service at Advocate South Suburban Hospital. The Applicants consider this a relocation of acute mental illness service from Advocate Christ Medical Center to Advocate South Suburban Hospital. According to the Applicants the Advocate South Suburban behavioral health program will be a contemporary state of the art program encompassing 27 bed single Page 7 of 21 occupancy rooms, living environment promoting safety and ligature risk mitigation strategies, evidence -based color design themes promoting holistic healing, and the latest technology platforms for therapeutic environment. The Applicants state the shift to a single room occupancy care delivery model will enhance team members' ability to address the unique needs of each patient, while promoting a safe and private environment for patients. The Applicants plan to expand behavioral health services in and around Advocate South Suburban Medical Center to include: Partial Hospitalization Program, which helps patients reduce or stabilize symptoms while living at home and among family. Intensive Outpatient Program, which can be utilized as a step- down from partial Hospitalization . Electroconvulsive Therapy, which is a specialized procedure that us es electricity to treat severe depression and other psychiatric illnesses. Esketamine Therapy 2, which is administered intranasally under the supervision of a health care provider and used in conjunction with oral antidepressants. Expansion of the crisis worker coverage via in -person and/or telehealth consults. Complementing Services are Being Developed in AMG Primary Care Clinics. (See Application for Permit pages 81 and 82) Over a 7 -year period Advocate Christ Medical Center 's Acute Mental Illness Category of Service had an average daily census of 23 patients which would justif y 27 acute mental illness bed s at the State Board's target occupancy of 85%.

But it wasn't until recently that esketamine, a more potent version of ketamine, earned FDA approval specifically for use as a nasal spray for t hose with treatment- resistant depression. Esketamine is derived from part of the ketamine molecule Because it's more potent, you can use it at a lower dose and theoretically have fewer side effects. Esketamine, like ketamine, has the potential to distort your perception during the first two hours after treatment, so it has to be administered in a clinic setting. Treatment for esketamine nasal spray is done on an outpatient ba sis. With the nasal spray, you give yourself three doses, spaced five minutes apa rt, under doctor supervision. You remain in the clinic under doctor observation until potential side effects have passed. Esketamine must be used in conjunction with a conventional antidepressant. The intention is that esketamine provides rapid relief fro m depression symptoms until the other medication takes effect. (Source: John Hopkins Medicine) Page 8 of 21 VI.

Background of the Applicants, Purpose of the Project, Safety Net Impact Statement, Alternatives to the Proposed Project A) Criterion 1110.110 (a) - Background of the Applicants The Applicants attest there have been no adverse actions against any facility owned and/or operated by Advocate Health and Hospitals Corporation, Advocate Health Care Network, Advocate Aurora Health, Inc . and Advocate Health, Inc. as demonstrated by compliance with the CMS conditions of Participation with Medicare and Medic aid, during the three years prior to the filing of this application. The Applicants also authorize the Health Facilities and Services Review Board and the Department of Public Health to access information to verify any documentation or information submitte d in response to the requirements of this Application for Permit. Advocate South Suburban Hospital has a Medicare four -star rating. It appears the Applicants have the qualifications, background, and character to adequately provide a proper standard of heal th care service for the communities served . These three criteria below are informational only. A) Criterion 1110.110 (b) - Purpose of the Project B) Criterion 1110.110 (c) - Safety Net Impact Statement C) Criterion 1110.110 (d) - Alternatives to the Proposed Project B) Purpose of the Project According to the Applicants , this project is being proposed to improve access to mental health services while also improving access to tertiary and other critical care services for patients at Advocate Christ Medic al Center. The Applicants believe it is essential to convert the 39- bed acute mental illness category of service at Advocate Christ Medical Center to medical surgical beds. The establishment of the acute mental illness service is essential due to physica l plant limitations at Advocate Christ Medical Center. According to the Applicants the only viable option is to discontinue the acute mental illness category of service at Advocate Christ Medical Center and convert 20 of those beds to a medical/surgical u nit and establish the acute mental illness service at Advocate South Suburban Hospital. C) Safety Net Impact Statement The Applicants provided a safety net impact statement at pages 152 -154 of the Application of Permit. At the end of this report is the Charity Care and Medicaid information for the years 2018 thru 2020 for Advocate South Suburban Hospital. D) Alternatives to the Proposed Project The Applicants considered two alternatives to the proposed project: Doing nothing Establish a free -standing psychiatric hospital Establish AMI Services from Advocate Christ Medical Center to Advocate South Suburban Page 10 of 21 1. The do- nothing alternative was rejected according to the Applicants because Advocate Christ Medical Center needs additional medical surgical beds due to its tertiary and Level I trauma status. The Applicants state Advocate Christ Medical Center admits the most c ritically ill patients and continually operates above the State Board's medical surgical utilization standard . According to the Applicants Advocate Christ Medical Center anticipates an average of 30 medical/surgical beds will be needed on an ongoing basis to treat COVID -19 patients. 2. The Applicants considered the option of building a stand- alone psychiatric hospital but rejected that option because the cost to build and operate a stand- alone behavioral health hospital would be higher than a unit within the hospital and the projected utilization of the GSA can be accommodated in the 27- bed Hospital unit . The Applicants stated if inpatient behavioral health volumes increase in the coming years, such that capacity in the planned acute mental health unit needs to be expanded, the Applicants will re -evaluate this option. The cost of this alternative is estimated as $116.3 million. 3. As discussed throughout the application, Advocate Christ Medical Center (ACMC) is a tertiary referral center, a teaching hospital, and the only Level I trauma center in the South Chicagoland service area. The recent pandemic has exacerbated the need for Med/Surg beds at ACMC, and the Applicants decided to relocate its AMI services from Oak Lawn to Hazel Crest/Advocate South Suburban Hospital (ASSH), in an effort to better serve the programmatic needs of the immediate service areas surrounding these hospita ls. The option chosen will address both programmatic needs at the two facilities, with the most prudent use of existing resources. Cost of chosen option: $21,068,968. Page 11 of 21 IX. Size of the Project and Project Utilization A) Criterion 1110.120 (a) - Size of the Project B) Criterion 1110.120 (b) - Projected Utilization A) Size of the Project The Applicants are proposing 14,809 GSF or 549 GSF per bed. The State Board Standard for Acute Mental Illness Beds is 560 GSF per bed. The Applicants have met the requirements of the State Board. B) Projected Utilization The Applicants are projecting 9,107 days by 2025 or an ADC of 25 patients. The State Board 's Target Occupancy for AMI service is 85%. The Applicants have met the requirement of this criterion . Page 12 of 21 X. Acute Mental Illness 1110.210 (b)(1) Planning Area Need - 77 Ill. Adm.

The population in this 10- mile GSA is approximately 758,000 residents. A review of the referral letter referenced in the application (Application for Permit page 101 ) indicated that 231 patients resided in th e 10-mile GSA of Advocate South Suburban Hospital and received care at Advocate Christ Medical Center 's acute mental illness unit. Of the 770 referrals approximately 30% came from the 10- mile GSA (2 31 patients \u00f7 770 patients = 30%). The Applicants also provided the number of referrals to psychiatric facilities that Advocate Christ Medical Center (1,812 referrals), Advocate South Suburban Hospital (1,060 referrals) and Advocate Trinity Hospital (742 referrals) made over the past two years. [see Table at t he end of this report] Page 13 of 21 C) Service Demand - Establishment of AMI The Applicants based upon the utilization of the Advocate Christ Medical Center AMI unit believe the proposed 27- bed unit will have an average daily census of 23 patients similar to the 7- year average at Advocate Christ Medical Center 's 39-bed AMI Unit. A referral letter was provided from the Medical Director of Emergency Services of Advocate Christ Medical Center. The Medical Director stated: \"Advocate Christ Medical C enter (\"ACMC\") has the busiest Level I Trauma Center in Illinois with a trauma surgery team available on site, around the clock and a dedicated inpatient trauma unit. The patients who present in the emergency department who are experiencing mental health crisis are in need of immediate care with dedicated behavioral health resources. The medical needs of these patients are typically of a different nature than those of the critically ill patients requiring our trauma care resources and of other patients we serve in the emergency department. Realigning the location of the inpatient behavioral health unit between our hospital locations will better allow our staff to focus on the discrete needs of our different types of patients continuing our mission to provide the highest quality of care to all of our patients. ....W ith the relocation of behavioral health services, patients who present to the ACMC emergency department requiring inpatient behavioral health services will be transferred to Advocate South Suburban Hospital. As one might imagine, we currently accept transfers from other Advocate area hospitals that don't currently operate an AMI unit -Advocate South Suburban Hospital (ASSH) and Advocate Trinity Hospital. As such, the patient transfers to ASSH will be similar to those we currently accept from these other area hospitals.\" D) Service Accessibility 3 There are three hospital units locate d within 30 -minutes of Advocate South Suburban Hospital with a total of 1 48 acute mental illness beds. The three Hospital units are underutilized. T here is no absence of AMI service in the 10- mile GSA and no restrictive admission policies of existing providers have been identified. The proposed AMI Unit will be in a Mental Health Professional Shortage Area as are the three hospitals identified below. 3 A federal shortage designation is a way for communities and health care facilities in to establish a need for additional heal th care professionals and resour ces. The overall purpose is to identify areas of greatest need, so that limited resources can be prioritized and directed to the people in those areas. This need is evaluated based on criteria set forth by two federal shortage designation programs: Health Professional Shortage Areas and Medically Underserved Areas/Populations. The designations provide both federal and state government grant/program benefits for communities, health care facilities, and providers. Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA), and Medically Underserved Area (MUA) / Medically Underserved Population (MUP) designations are administered by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Shortage Designation Branch. More than 37 federal programs depend on the sh ortage designation to determine eligibility or funding preference as a way to increase the number of physicians and other health professionals who practice in those designated areas. Mental Health : Identifies an area's access to either psychiatrists only, or core mental health professionals (CMHPs) which include psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, psychiatric nurse specialists, and marriage and family therapists. Similar to Primary Care and Dental HPSAs, a population -to-provide r ratio is used to help determine eligibility. Several different population -to-provider ratios (psychiatrists and/or core mental health professionals) are available for consideration. In Illinois as of June 2022 there are 223 mental health HPSA's.

There is 1 acute mental health bed for every 5,121 residents in the 10- mile GSA. In the State of Illinois there is 1 acute mental health bed for every 3,045 residents. Based upon the ratio of beds to population in the 10- mile GSA compared to the ratio of beds to population in the State of Illinois there is not a surplus of acute mental health beds in this 10-mile GS A. Currently there are 183 authorized acute mental beds in this Planning Area. As can be seen in the table above there are hospitals with excess capacity than can accommodate the patients to be referred to Advocate South Suburban Hospital proposed 27- bed unit . The Applicants stated \"t he planned project will transition behavioral health services (also known as acute mental illness services) from A dvocate Christ Medical Center to Advocate South Suburban H ospital . Patients to be served at A dvocate South Suburban H ospital would historically receive inpatient acute mental illness services at A dvocate Christ Medical Center . Accordingly, this Project will not lower the utilization of other area hospitals below the State Board's occupancy standards. The planned project is the relocation of AMI services from A dvocate Christ Medical Center to Advocate South Suburban Hospital . Patients to be served as A dvocate South Suburban H ospital would historically receive inpatient a cute mental illness services at A dvocate Christ Medical Center . Accordingly, this Project will not lower, to a further extent, the utilization of other area hospitals below the State Board's occupancy standards.\" F) Staffing Availability The Applicants stated Advocate South Suburban Hospital has evaluated the staffing needs and does not expect any issues meeting the licensure and accreditation staffing requirements as a result of the proposed project. According to t he Applicants t he hospital's ability to attract and place nurses has historically been strong. The Applicants state Advocate Aurora Health offers a competitive salary and benefits package for its clinicians and other support staff and also has a dedicated team of Recruiters and Sourcing Specialists. According to the Applicants , if there is a significant staff need anywhere in the system, resources are shifted quickly to address the situation. The staffing consultants at Advocate Aurora Health work in a collaborative manner. The Applicants state an additional source for Hospital's applicant pool comes from active partnerships with local Page 15 of 21 nursing programs. According to the Applicants the Hospital has continually benefited from the strong reputation of Advocate Aurora Health as an excellent place of employment, as evidenced by consistently being named as one of the Top 100 Places to work in Illinois.

Page 18 of 21 Acute Mental Illness Bed Need Methodology A bed need of .11 beds per 1,000 projected population is established in each planning area as the minimum bed need. Calculate the planning area's experienced use rate by dividing the number of patient days in the base year by the base year population in thousands. Multiply the experienced use r ate by the population estimate in thousands to obtain estimated patient days. Divide the estimated patient days by the number of days in the population projection (which is five years from the base year) to determine the projected average daily census (AD C). Divide the estimated ADC by .85 (85% occupancy factor) to obtain a projected bed need in the planning area. When the projected bed need is less than the minimum bed need, the minimum bed need is the projected bed need. When the estimated bed need i s greater than the minimum bed need, the estimated bed need is the projected bed need. Calculate the number of additional beds needed in each area by subtracting the number of existing beds from the projected bed need. Subtract the number of existing beds in the planning area from the projected planning area bed need to determine the projected number of excess (surplus) beds or the projected need for additional beds (deficit) in the area.

Jefferson St., 2nd Floor Springfield, Illinois 62761 Re: Advocate South Suburban Hospital Behavioral Health Services Project Dear Chairwoman Savage, My name is Patrick Daymond and I serve as the Senior Pastor for the Covenant United Church of Christ (Covenant UCC) in South Holland. Covenant UCC's vision is to be the realization of a multi -generational beloved community - connectin g cultural affirmation, love of God and neighbor, justice for the poor, healing for the hurting, and liberation for the oppressed - for the betterment of the world and the promotion of God's kingdom (Luke 4:18). Covenant UCC believes in the benefits of be havioral health care and supports the theory that religion and spirituality can have a positive impact on mental health. In fact, research suggests that religiosity reduces suicide rates, alcoholism and drug use. Our Pastoral Care program offers spiritu al, emotional and religious support, including counseling, guidance and support for our parishioners.From our experience, we see firsthand that religion provides structure and offers the ability to connect and realize when we need professional help. Advo cate will be investing in a $21 million contemporary inpatient unit for crisis intervention and is expanding outpatient mental health services to fill a critical gap in our community to screen and intervene for behavioral health problems in the primary car e setting. Early intervention will includeemotional wellness coaching, care navigation and community referrals. We believe these services align with our pastoral outreach, and webelieve that the south suburbs will benefit from this collaborative relation ship. We ask of you and your fellow members of the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Boardto please approve this application for the good of our community. I thank you for your support and may God continue to bless us all. Sincerely, Reverend Dr. Patrick L. Daymond Senior Pastor 8/8/2022 Debra Savage Chairwoman Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board 525 West Jefferson Street, 2nd Floor Springfield, Illinois 62761 Re: Support Letter for Establishment of AMJ Category of Service at South Suburban Hospital Dear Chairwoman Savage: I am Elizabeth Gawne, a native of Chicago and the surrounding suburbs and a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) affiliated with Advocate Christ Medical Center, which l 'm proud to say is my first place of professional employment after receiving my nurse practitioner credentials. I am writing to urge your support to establish a 27-bed Acute Mental Illness Category of Service at Advocate South Suburban Hospital. I began my formal education at Saint Louis University, School of Nursing, and worked for six years on inpatient behavioral health units in Illinois and Ohio. I continued my graduate studies and earned a Master of Science in Nursing from Eastern Kentucky University. Over the course of my training, I discovered a great passion for meeting the needs of patients with behavioral health needs. I also have a strong desire to give back to my community, which is why I returned to the Chicagoland area from Ohio, to work in psychiatry. 1 believe Advocate's new inpatient behavioral health unit will deliver important benefits to our patients with its therapeutic and dignified care environment, which is the cornerstone of psychiatric nursing. Along with my colleagues, I commend Advocate Aurora Health's support and investment in this project. I cannot express how eager we are to come to work at Advocate South Suburban and to bring our care and compassion to the residents in the south suburbs. On behalf of us all who do this critical work, I urge a favorable vote. Thank you. Sincerely, ~~~11~/';l'/5 Elizabeth A.

I am a physician currently treatin g patients who will receive care in the planned unit and I enthusiastically support the modernization of this program. I am board certified in psychiatry and addiction medicine. Having completed my residency in psychiatry at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital, I have continued my career with Advocate Aurora Health and am currently affiliated with Advocate Christ Medical Center. I am pleased the new program at Advocate South Suburban Hospital will allow our system to have a significant focus on behavioral health patients for community residents away from the tertiary care setting where there are many competing demands for space and staff. I am particularly excited about the planned capital expenditures to provide for a state -of-the-art inpatient facility with private patient rooms and ample therapy space. I strongly believe that patient experience is an important measure that determines the efficiency and effectiveness of mental health services. As a mental health provider, I work hard to ensure that I deliver an exemplary patient experience. This new program will allow me to do my job in an optimal environment to the benefit of my patients. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your consideration of this project and respectfully encourage your favorable vote. Sincerely, Jessica M.

This pro ject will have an overwhelmingly positive impact in the south suburbs. What began 50 years ago as a small gro up of people in Park Forest who wanted to g ive youth a place to be safe, heard and understood has since grown into the third largest community health center in Illinois and the largest pro vider of behavioral health services among co mmunity health centers in the state. Day after day, we work to build on our organization's proud legacy to create strong, healthy communities, w here ev eryone has access to high-q uality health and wellness care to foster better social and emotional health, but we can't do that without our partners in the community who share our organization's vision and values. Collaborating with Advocate and supporting this project is in the best interest of our organization and the communities we serve. Advocate South Suburban Hospital's new behavioral health program, involving a capital investment of more than $21 million, more integrated outpatient care and expanded pediatric mental health services, will allow so many more families in the south suburbs to receive the care they need and deserve. This application deserves your approval. Please vote in support. Sincerely, Raul Garza President and CEO Aunt Martha's "}
