Patients who have existing scheduled appointments will still receive their flu shot. January 16th, 2020 Dear UMD community, Seasonal influenza activity in the United States and in Maryland is high and continues to increase. Here are some reminders of important ways to stay healthy by following the [CDC's Flu Preventive Steps](https://maestro.listserv.umd.edu/trk/click?ref=zvb24p867_2-1bb7x31cafx010267&): Take time to get a flu vaccine before the beginning of the spring semester. It takes about two weeks after receiving the flu vaccine for it to become effective. The flu shot is the best way to protect yourself from getting the flu. If you are already in the area, the University Health Center still has flu vaccines available. Schedule an appointment for a flu shot at [myuhc.umd.edu](https://maestro.listserv.umd.edu/trk/click?ref=zvb24p867_2-1bb7x31cb0x010267&) or call 301.314.8180. Take everyday preventive actions to stop the spread of germs: - Try to avoid close contact with sick people. Consider avoiding crowded places during flu season, especially when you are ill. - While sick, limit contact with others as much as possible to keep from infecting them. If you are sick with flu symptoms, CDC recommends that you stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care or for other necessities. - Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. - Wash your hands often with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand rub. - Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Germs spread this way. - Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs like the flu. If you have underlying health conditions or take medications that suppress your immune system: - It is especially important to get your yearly flu shot to prevent complications. - If you develop flu symptoms (fever with a cough or sore throat), please see your healthcare provider within 24-48 hours.

In health, University Health Center February 20th, 2019 February 20, 2019 Dear University of Maryland community, The University Health Center is seeing an increase in individuals presenting with influenza in the past two weeks, primarily Influenza A. Influenza is a respiratory illness that typically presents suddenly with high fever, body aches, headache and cough that is contagious. We have not diagnosed or been made aware of any cases of Adenovirus illness since the start of the Spring semester. We're writing with a reminder about ways to keep yourself and those around you healthy... - Be a healthy Terp and get a flu shot. It is not too late! The UHC has already given thousands of flu shots and we have a small supply remaining. - Wash your hands frequently and use the hand sanitizing stations that are located around campus. - Avoid those who are ill, if possible. - Clean high touch surfaces in your room and/or office with anti-bacterial cleaner (bleach wipes are very good). - Cough into your sleeve or a tissue, not directly into your hands, and wash your hands immediately. - Avoid touching your face both when you are ill and when healthy. This spreads germs! - Avoid sharing food, utensils, cups, and water-bottles. The treatment for influenza for otherwise healthy people is \"supportive,\" meaning that our recommendations will often be that you rest, take plenty of fluids and fever reducing medicine if you are diagnosed with the flu. Anti-viral medications (Tamiflu and Relenza) must be started within 48-72 hours of the onset of illness, but they are generally not recommended for healthy people with flu. For students, faculty and staff who have chronic medical problems, such asthma, diabetes, and immune dysfunction, it is important to visit the UHC or your personal physician within 48 hours of developing flu symptoms. - If you are sick, stay home and in bed. Avoid crowded places like dining halls, classrooms, restaurants and the Recreation Center to prevent spreading your illness to others. - Recruit a friend (your \"Flu Buddy\") to help care for you and help bringing food to you from the dining hall. - Take fever reducers like acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve) if you have a fever. If your fever persists for more than three days in spite of fever reducers, please seek care. - Drink plenty of fluids. - Contact the UHC at 301.314.8180 for medical advice if you are unsure of what to do after reading this information. For more information on the Flu, please visit the following site: [Flu (influenza)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm). Stay well! The University Health Center is here to answer any questions that you may have. In Health, David McBride, MD Director, University Health Center November 9th. 2018 Flu and other virus season is upon us again and I'm writing with some things to consider. We are seeing many ill patients (as is typical in the fall) with fevers and sick symptoms for a variety of reasons. In particular, we're seeing patients with non-specific fever and gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea and vomiting), influenza-like illness and some scattered cases of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease. The Health Center, Residential Facilities, Facilities Management and RecWell are working together to increase cleaning of high touch surfaces and restrooms around campus. This is no cause for alarm, but it does give us the opportunity to practice effective prevention techniques for these types of illnesses: - Be a healthy Terp and get a flu shot! The UHC has plenty of flu vaccine available. Schedule an appointment for a flu shot today! - Wash your hands frequently and use the hand sanitizing stations that are located around campus. - Avoid those who are ill, if possible. - Clean high touch surfaces in your room with anti-bacterial cleaner (bleach wipes are very effective-follow the instructions on the packaging). - Cough into your sleeve or a tissue, not directly into your hands, and wash your hands immediately. - Avoid touching your face when you are ill and when healthy; this spreads germs! - Avoid sharing food, utensils, cups, and water bottles. - Avoid Emergency Rooms and Urgent Care Centers unless you are truly sick as these locations will be crowded with many sick people.
