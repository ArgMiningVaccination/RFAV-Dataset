NSU Student Handbook All NSU students are required to familiarize themselves with the university-wide policies located in the NSU Student Handbook FLEXIBILITIES IN POLICY University policies are intended to describe some of the expectations of members of the University community, as well as outline the University's community policies and programs. It is intended to be used as a guideline and does not create an express or implied contract which cannot be changed or modified. Circumstances not specifically addressed in university policies will be handled on a case-by-case basis by the appropriate official selected by the University. As the need may arise, the University reserves the right to, in its sole discretion, modify, revise, supplement, rescind, suspend, terminate, or change its policies, procedures, programs, activities and services, in whole or in part, to the fullest extent permitted by law. DEAN'S MESSAGE I am pleased to extend you a warm welcome to Nova Southeastern University and the College of Psychology. Our goal is to guide you through a rich and transformative journey where you will grow personally, academically, and socially on the road to becoming major contributors to our global society. We strive to provide students with the support and opportunities necessary to develop skills needed to impact institutions and quality of life for individuals, families, and communities. Our College offers a wide range of degree programs, including bachelor's programs in psychology and neuroscience, as well as graduate programs in counseling, clinical, school, experimental, forensic, and general psychology. In addition, the College has doctoral internship and postdoctoral residency programs, and offers continuing education to professionals. Our Psychology Services Center provides training opportunities and offers an array of therapy and assessment services to the community. Students in every program, from first year undergraduates to final year doctoral candidates, benefit from the instruction and mentorship of experienced faculty who reach beyond the classroom to model professional success in the lab, clinic, and community. The scope of psychology, counseling, neuroscience, and related fields is expansive, as our disciplines describe and explain the effects of psychological processes from the level of individual brain cells to the scale of complex social interactions. The areas of expertise our faculty collectively possess are similarly diverse. Regardless of the specific field or subfield of study, however, our students benefit from the greater involvement that small classes provide and from the related opportunities for research collaborations and experiential placements in community settings. While the lasting memories of one's years at a university surely include many events beyond the confines of the classroom, one's day-to-day enjoyment while enrolled as a university student depends largely on his or her chosen field of study and engagement with its particular subject matter. The College of Psychology is proud to house engaging undergraduate majors, an array of highly regarded graduate programs and related training opportunities, and a clinic that serves our community. We hope that these opportunities will figure positively in the memories our students have of their university experience. On behalf of myself and the faculty of the College of Psychology, I encourage you to explore everything the College has to offer, and look forward to working with you as you harness the best within yourself and take full advantage of the NSU Edge!

The Student Center also contains information about professional counseling organizations, opportunities for professional involvement, and activities appropriate for students. Students must complete the required modules to access the materials, including completion of the Degree Acknowledgement requirement. Academic Year The academic year for students is divided into three semesters. Students are expected to register for classes at the designated time in accordance with procedures outlined in this text and in program literature unless they have an approved leave of absence (see section below on Student Enrollment). Attendance Students are expected to attend all scheduled learning activities including classes, lectures, and seminars. Anticipated absences should be approved in advance with the instructor. Excessive absences may result in a lower grade at the instructor's discretion or may necessitate a withdrawal from the course. STUDENT ENROLLMENT All degree seeking students are considered fulltime students when they register for two or more courses per semester. This requirement is independent of the number of transfer credits the student may receive. In order to maintain an active student status, all students are to be in continuous registration (minimum of 3 credit hours, including summer) until they receive their degree unless prior approval is received from the master's program office. Failure to remain in continuous registration will be considered formal withdrawal from the program. Students who do not complete courses for two consecutive semesters will be considered not in continuous enrollment and will be reviewed by the program office. Full-time Status Students are considered to be full-time if they complete six credit hours each semester. A student on financial aid considering completing less than the scheduled credit hours in any given semester should discuss this with the master's program office and the Office of Student Financial Services and Registration prior to the time of registration. It is the responsibility of the student to seek advisement of options available for completing the Master's Program. Leave of Absence A leave of absence is a temporary period of time during which the student is not in attendance but is not considered withdrawn from the university. A student may request a leave when he or she can demonstrate an extenuating circumstance beyond the realm of his or her control. A request for leave due to poor academic performance, financial issues, or to delay the return of unearned Title IV funds is not considered an extenuating circumstance. Federal guidelines state the maximum period of time allowed for an approved LOA is 180 days within a 12-month period. If the student is granted one LOA, and then is granted a second LOA, the total period of 20 both LOAs cannot exceed 180 days within the 12-month period. Prior to an LOA approval, the university must determine there is a reasonable expectation the student will return from the leave. Conditions for a Leave of Absence All approved LOAs (status and dates) must be reported to the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC). A student who was approved for a leave for less than 180 days but fails to return to the university when the LOA is over will be reported as withdrawn to the NSC as of the last date of attendance. Students who are concurrently enrolled in multiple programs of study cannot request a leave from one program and remain enrolled in a second program. Students cannot be registered in any program at the university during an approved LOA. The university will not disburse any financial aid to students while on an approved LOA. A student is expected to return at the end of his or her approved LOA. A student returning from an LOA is required to complete the courses they started prior to the leave. The university cannot impose additional charges or disburse additional financial aid until the student has earned the Title IV financial aid previously paid for the courses. Requesting a Leave of Absence The Leave of Absence Request Form must be submitted at least 14 days prior to the start of the requested leave unless the student is incapacitated and unable to meet the 14-day requirement. Leaves requested after the semester/term has begun will be considered for approval only in a documented extreme circumstance. To receive an approved LOA: 1. The student must have successfully completed one (1) semester/term in their current degree program. 2. The student must confer with their academic advisor/program office prior to submitting the Leave of Absence Request Form. 3. The student must not be in an academic standing that prohibits registration. 4. The student must not have a hold(s) (e.g., disciplinary, financial, etc.) which would prohibit registration. An employee hold is an exception to this requirement. 5. The student must submit a written, signed, and dated Leave of Absence Request Form, with documentation, detailing the reason(s) for the LOA being requested and declaring an expected return date. Medical LOA requests must be accompanied by a signed typed letter/form from a medical doctor or treating psychologist their letterhead. Military LOA requests must be accompanied by a copy of the military orders. Students, where possible, should seek advisement from their program director or advisor when considering a leave. The Leave of Absence Request Form and policy statement can be found here: Leave of Absence Policy (nova.edu). Excused Absences for Participation in Co-Curricular Activities 21 While enrolled at NSU, students are expected to make academic participation their top priority. However, there may be instances when students must miss class due to their commitment to officially represent the University in certain co-curricular activities. NSU will consider travel to and participation in certain University-sponsored co-curricular events as grounds for approval of an excused absence, including but not limited to: NCAA intercollegiate athletic competition, musical/theatrical performances, and academic program field trips. Practices and rehearsals for university-sponsored co-curricular events, participation in club or intramural athletic competition, and field trips that are not associated with the student's academic program are not considered grounds for an approved absence. Students who intend to miss class due to participation in a co-curricular event must still follow all applicable policies and procedures of their academic program to ensure that their academic program and instructors are aware of their absence and to receive direction on the makeup of any missed academic instruction and/or coursework. Students who are approved for an excused absence pursuant to this policy remain responsible for the completion any academic instruction and/or coursework missed during the period of excused absence. Concentration and Format Changes Students in the Department of Counseling are admitted into a particular concentration and format (if applicable) and are expected to complete all degree requirements within that classification. Students desiring to add, remove, or transfer concentrations or formats must apply in writing for a concentration and/or format change to the master's program office no later than one month prior to term start. Requests will be considered with respect to available seat space in the desired concentration and/or format and depending on course availability. If granted, students will not be permitted a second concentration or format change at a later date. Time Limit Requirements Students must complete their program within five years from the date of first enrollment. This means that students are expected to graduate with the master's degree within this time period. In the event that a matriculated student who has not completed all requirements within the five year time limit, he or she must re-enroll in the master's program and: 1. Maintain full-time status (minimum six credits per semester). 2. Complete remaining degree requirements, which will include any course work that is more than five years old. All other program, college, and university requirements will be in effect. Failure to Register Students who fail to register for a regular semester without a leave of absence are considered to have withdrawn from their program. Such students must make formal application and go through the entire admission process if they wish to reenter the program at a later date. Addresses & Contact Information Due to state-specific licensure guidelines, it is important to make sure that student contact information on-file is up to date and have knowledge of licensure state-specifics. It is the responsibility of the student to keep the Department of Counseling up to date via Self-Service Banner/WebSTAR regarding their current mailing address, phone number, email address, and emergency contact information. Any questions should be directed to counseling@nova.edu. 22 ADVISING The college offers academic advisement to students. Advisers are accessible to students to assist with course planning and selections, development of a planned program of study, appraisal of their academic standing, review of university policies and procedures, respond to individual circumstances, etc. A formal orientation program will be available to all students to familiarize them with the academic program and requirements, registration procedures, library information, student rights and responsibilities, etc. Students may meet with an adviser regularly during registration or at any time upon request. All matters pertaining to a student's record, schedule of classes, leaves of absences, etc. should be directed to the master's program administration on the main campus in Fort Lauderdale. REGISTRATION All students are expected to be in continuous enrollment every semester until they receive their degree (see section on Student Enrollment). Arrangement with the Bursar's Office regarding payment of tuition and fees is part of the registration process and registration is a prerequisite to class attendance. Non-degree seeking students who are not registered for two consecutive semesters will be withdrawn from graduate study. Registration Policies and Procedures Students register directly on the university system: https://ssb.nova.edu/. All students must complete the Student Enrollment Agreement (SEA) form in order to register for classes. The SEA requires students to agree with NSU standards and policies regarding course registration and withdrawal, financial responsibility, a release of liability, and more. Students registering for courses will be prompted to complete the form as part of the registration process on Sharklink (https://sharklink.nova.edu/) and Self-Service Banner/WebSTAR (https://ssb.nova.edu). Payment of Tuition and Fees Payment of tuition and fees is due within 30 days of the beginning of a particular semester. Students awarded financial aid will have fees/tuition deducted before receiving a refund. Arrangement with the Bursar's Office regarding payment of tuition and fees is part of the registration process and registration is a prerequisite to class attendance. University Student Services Fee NSU offers to all students\u2014on campus, online, clinical or hybrid\u2014the same quality education and many opportunities for student benefits depending on the student's choice of educational modality. Therefore, the University sets the overall student fees on an aggregate, student-centric basis for the entire student body. The overall costs exceed the amount collected from student fees charged to all students. 23 Tuition and Fees Master's tuition for 2022-2023 will be charged at the rate of $865 per credit hour. (Students should anticipate an annual review of fees by the university and possible increases). Students are expected to pay tuition in full at the time of registration. Students receiving financial aid must familiarize themselves with the requirements of that office with regard to payments and may defer payment only if they have been officially notified of an award. Once a loan check is disbursed, students will be responsible for making all appropriate payments. Tuition $865 per credit hour Application Fee $50 (non-refundable) Late Payment Fee $100 per semester Student Services Fee $600 per semester (4 or more credits) $300 per semester (under 4 credits) Textbooks $80-200 per course (approximate cost) Official Transcript Fee $19.50/$17.00 (printed/electronic) Student Health Insurance Fee $2092 coverage August 1, 2022 thru July 31, 2023 (12-month coverage period) (Student Health Insurance Plan Details, Rates, and Waiver Deadlines are Published at nova.edu/studentinsurance.) Professional Liability Insurance $10 per semester Fingerprinting/Background Checks Fee determined by agency CMHC Students Only: Counselor Preparation Comprehensive Exam $ 150 per attempt for CMHC students only CMHC Practicum/Internship Liability Insurance $40-105 per year (practicum & internship students only) ABA Students Only: ABA Fieldwork Liability Insurance $18-35 per year (fieldwork students only; recommended) Behavior Development Solutions Modules $338 per 6-month per 36-month license $698 per 48-month license The expenses outlined above are to be considered as very general estimates and may vary considerably depending on individual circumstances. Some courses may require additional fees for laboratory and/or equipment (e.g., calculator, testing materials) and supplemental course materials. Students are provided NSU Email accounts at no charge. Off-campus students will need to make arrangements for Internet access and are responsible for any corresponding costs. * Please note that all above fees are subject to change without notice. Indebtedness to the University NSU offers to all students\u2014on campus, online, clinical, or hybrid\u2014the same quality education and many opportunities for student benefits depending on the educational modality selected. Therefore, the University sets the overall student fees on an aggregate, student-centric basis for the entire student body. The overall costs exceed the amount collected from student fees charged to all students. These student fees are blended together to create 1NSU with high-tech systems, student activities, and many other essential student services that make a complete, integrated University. This mission transcends the development and ultimate determination of the amount of student fees for all students, irrespective of their choice of learning modality. 24 By registering for courses at Nova Southeastern University, the student accepts financial responsibility for payment of all institutional costs including, but not limited to, tuition, fees, housing, health insurance, and meal plan (if applicable), and any additional costs when those charges become due. Payment is due in full at the time of registration. NSU eBills are sent the middle of each month to the student's NSU email address. However, to avoid late charges, students should not wait for their billing statement to pay their tuition and fees. A student will not be able to register for future semesters until all outstanding balances from previous semesters have been paid in full. If a student has a balance 30 days after the start of the semester, a hold and a $100 late fee will be placed on his or her account. This hold stops all student services, including, but not limited to, access to the NSU RecPlex, academic credentials, grades, and future registrations. It will remain on the student's account until the balance has been paid in full. Delinquent student account balances may be reported to a credit bureau and referred to collection agencies or litigated. Students with delinquent accounts will be liable for any costs associated with the collection of unpaid charges, including attorney fees and court costs. All registration agreements shall be construed in accordance with Florida law, and any lawsuit to collect unpaid fees shall be brought exclusively in the appropriate court sitting in Broward County, Florida, regardless of the student's domicile. Professional Liability Insurance All master's students are required to carry professional liability insurance through the university. Students are assessed a fee at the time of each registration. All students are required to abide by the ethical standards of the profession. Students will abide by the ethical standards of the profession as delineated in the American Counseling Association Publication, Code of Ethics, http://www.counseling.org/docs/ethics/2014-aca-code-of-ethics.pdf. In addition to complying with the policies and procedures of the College of Psychology, students must also follow all rules and regulations of the agency/school/district where his or her practicum and or internship will be completed. The college/student professional liability insurance policy provides coverage while the student is attending Nova Southeastern University and while he or she is functioning in approved college activities. This policy does not provide coverage for non-approved or non-college related activities. Refund Policy Any student in good standing enrolled in the M.S. in Counseling programs wishing to withdraw from classes because of illness or some other satisfactory reason must contact the Master's Program Office immediately at 954-262-5740 or via email at counseling@nova.edu. Adjustment of tuition fees will be computed from the date on which the notice is received by the Program Office. (a) No part of the application fee or the registration fee will be refundable upon withdrawal. (b) The refundable percentage of total tuition (paid or due) will be computed in accordance with the refund timeframes and rates provided on the College of Psychology Academic Calendar in this handbook. Class Cancellation Policy The university reserves the right to cancel any class. If a class is cancelled and a replacement is not offered, 25 then students will receive a full refund of tuition paid for the cancelled class. If the student registered for only one class, then the registration fee would be refunded as well. Drop/Add The academic calendar outlines the dates and refund schedule for courses dropped or added. A course that is dropped within the time frame indicated on the academic calendar will not appear on the student's official transcript. Once a semester begins, master's students must contact the program office to drop a course. Withdrawal from a Course When the student drops a course prior to the first class, the course is deleted from the student's record. A \"W\" grade is assigned when a student withdraws from a course after the last date indicated on the academic calendar to drop courses with a refund and prior to last published date to withdraw for the term. If the student fails to withdraw by the final published date to withdraw for the term, the student will be assigned a grade of \"F.\" Withdrawal from a course may affect the student's financial aid status. Transfer of Credit All transfer credit must be awarded during the student's first academic year in the master's program. Students requesting transfer of credit must submit a written request for transfer along with supporting documentation to the master's program office. Sufficient documentation is required to allow for evaluation by faculty committee and the Department Chair, including an official transcript from the institution where the course was taken and a course description as listed in the institution's catalog. Other documentation may be required, such as syllabi, course notes, or other material. The number of transfer credits that will be credited towards graduation is six. Transfer of credits will be awarded when the course being evaluated meets all of the following criteria: 1. It is a graduate level course taken at an institution accredited as degree granting- by a recognized regional accrediting body for higher education at the time the course was completed. A graduate level course is defined as one that would be credited toward a master's degree at the institution where the course was taken. At minimum, this must be verified in the school's catalog or a letter from the chair of the department. 2. It is equivalent in content to a required course in the curriculum. 3. It was completed no longer than five years prior to the student's first enrollment in the program. 4. A grade of B or higher was received. A grade of P (Pass) or CR (Credit) or other such grades cannot be accepted as equivalent unless it can be officially verified as such. It will be the responsibility of the student to satisfactorily demonstrate the equivalence of the course(s) proposed in order for credits to be awarded. Course work submitted from a foreign institution will be evaluated for equivalency in accordance with accreditation standards. Courses completed at other institutions after the student has enrolled in the master's program will be considered only if there has been prior approval by faculty committee and the Department Chair. Typically, such transfer credit is granted only under special circumstances. Transfer credits are not taken into account when computing the student's grade point average. No transfer credit may be applied to practicum, internship or for portfolio-based- experiential learning. Federal Regulations require that veteran students MUST report all prior credit and training, and that the school MUST evaluate such and grant credit as appropriate, with training time and tuition reduced 26 proportionately and with the VA and student so notified. Credits earned at Nova Southeastern University are transferable only at the discretion of the receiving school. It is the student's responsibility to verify with the State of Florida Department of Education, that courses transferred are applicable toward the educational requirements for Florida Certification in School Counseling (Pre-K-12). Course Audit Policy Course Audit Policy (nova.edu) An audit is a registration status allowing students to attend a course without receiving academic credit. Undergraduate, graduate, and professional students may audit a course that does not require special preparation (e.g., prerequisite courses) and/or admissions to a program of study. Students have access to course materials and assignments but will not be required to submit assignments, participate in discussions, or take exams. NSU must ensure all students participating in a course are registered to have accurate class rosters of individuals in a classroom in case of an emergency, to comply with maximum seating limits as set by fire marshal regulations, and to maintain university records. Requirements for Course Audit A course may only be audited with the written approval from the instructor and Department Chair/Director after determining if the student has met any prerequisites tied to the course. Students wishing to audit a course must complete the Course Audit Request Form found at Course Audit Policy (nova.edu). A course can only be audited on a space-available basis. The registration will not be processed until all non-audit students are registered. Students are not able to register to audit a course through their SharkLink account. The registration(s) must be processed through their advisor or program office. An audit course does not affect a student's part-time or full-time enrollment status and does not count toward the determination of continuous enrollment. An \"AU\" grade will be posted to the student's academic record and will appear on the academic transcript for any audited course(s) but will not affect the student's attempted credits, earned credits, and grade point average (GPA). Students must identify themselves to their instructor as auditing students and discuss the parameters of participating in class discussions and completing assignments and exams. Evaluation of course work is at the discretion of the instructor. An audited course cannot be changed to a letter grade once the course has begun (or vice versa). If a letter grade is required, a student must retake the course and pay full tuition and all applicable fees. An audited course(s) does not fulfill degree or certificate requirements. Except for students participating in the Lifelong Learning Institute, the cost of an audit course will be 100 percent of the course tuition cost as well as the University Student Services Fee, the Registration Fee, and any additional applicable fees. Financial aid (e.g., scholarships, grants, discounts, and loans) will not be available to cover the cost of an audit course. Audited courses will not be counted toward a student's financial aid eligibility. Instructors may request the Department Chair/Director to officially withdraw a student who is auditing a course if the student is interfering with learning in the class. A tuition refund will be considered in accordance with the semester/term refund schedule dates. 27 Any course required for the completion of the student's program/degree can only be audited after it has been previously passed. In other words, students may audit a course as a \"refresher\" but not as a \"practice run. PROVISIONAL ADMISSIONS Students may be provisionally admitted to a degree-seeking program based on a review of unofficial transcripts or other specific program admission requirements. However, this admission includes a condition that final and official documents and requirements must be received within 90 calendar days from the start of the term. If these final and official documents and/or requirements are not received by that time, the student will not be allowed to continue class attendance. Financial aid will not be disbursed to a provisional/conditional student until he or she has been fully admitted as a regular student (all admission requirements have been approved by the college/program admissions office). GRADING POLICY The following policies apply to all academic programs in the College of Psychology effective Fall 2017. All degree programs in the College of Psychology programs assign grades to coursework according to the following system: Grade Points or Percentage Earned Quality Points A 93-100 4.00 A- 90-92 3.75 B+ 2.50 C 73-77 2.00 C- 70-72 1.75 F Below 70 0.00 I Incomplete - PR Progressing - W Withdraw - In all courses, a letter grade will be assigned based on the individual instructor's assessment and evaluation of the student's work. Before the first class session, dropped courses will be deleted from a student's record. A grade of W is assigned when a student withdraws from a course after the \"last day to drop courses,\" indicated in the section on Withdrawal from Classes. A grade of W will appear on the student's official transcript and will be included in attempted credit hours. Students failing to officially withdraw before the \"last day to drop courses\" will be subject to grading as described in the course syllabus. A \"PR\" (Progressing) grade indicates that clinical or research activities are ongoing. It is used for practicum and internship. An \"I\" (Incomplete) indicates that the student has not completed the course requirements during the scheduled time and the instructor has given additional time to do so. An \"I\" grade is not routinely assigned in courses. An \"I\" grade is not assigned by faculty members when students fail to complete the course requirements. Students cannot be assigned an \"I\" to finish extra credit work. 28 A student must request an Incomplete from the instructor. If the instructor approves an Incomplete, a contract form is signed by the instructor and the student and submitted to the master's program office. The contract must specify the following: 1. The requirements to be completed by the student to remove the incomplete. 2. The time period within which the student must satisfy the incomplete. The time limit is to be specified by the instructor, but must not exceed 10 weeks from the end of the semester. 3. The grade that the student will receive if the incomplete is not satisfied by the conclusion of the specified time period. Should the instructor choose not to assign an incomplete, the grade assigned will then be based upon the instructor's assessment of the quality and quantity of work completed. A student will not be permitted to register for a sequential course when a grade lower than a B- or an \"I\" (incomplete has been received in a prerequisite course. **The ABA program does not issue minus grades. Policy for Grading Disputes Grade disputes shall be limited to concerns about the method(s) (i.e., error in calculation of grades) by which grades are determined. A student seeking to dispute a decision regarding a course grade and/or other evaluation should seek solutions through the following administrative channels by entering at the appropriate level and proceeding in the order stated: a. Course Instructor/Supervisor b. Program Coordinator c. Department Chair or Designee (Final Decision of Dispute Process) A student seeking to resolve a grade problem or dispute through the administrative channels cited above must initiate such action in writing within five business days (excluding official school holidays and weekends) from the date that the grade was recorded in Self-Service Banner/WebSTAR. The grade appeal should include a concise statement of the basis of the appeal and shall not exceed one (1) page. The student will then have five days from the time of notification of the decision at each level in order to proceed to the next level in the administrative channels cited above (i.e., if the student receives notification of an unfavorable decision by the course instructor/supervisor, the student must proceed with his/her appeal to the program administrator within five days of said notification). Where a student fails to either initiate this process or proceed through this process within the specified time frame, the student will be deemed to have waived his/her right to dispute the grade in question. In the case of a grade dispute or other appeals relating directly to a student's academic performance, an administrator may not substitute his/her judgment for the performance appraisal of the faculty member rendering the grade or assessing the students' work. The decision of the faculty chair is the final decision in the process. There are no further appeals permitted. EVALUATION OF MASTER'S STUDENTS Core Performance Standards for Admission and Progress The standards required for admission keep in mind the safety and well-being of clients whom its graduates will eventually serve in clinical situations. Candidates for the degree must possess with or without 29 reasonable accommodation(s), multiple abilities and skills including intellectual, conceptual, integrative, and quantitative abilities; and intrapersonal, communication, behavioral, and personal attributes including empathy, emotional self-awareness, and emotional maturity. Each student is evaluated on an ongoing basis while enrolled in the program, including during the practicum/internship experience. In addition to course evaluations, matriculation and evaluation of readiness for practicum is coordinated by the master's program office. The purpose of evaluation is to provide students with relevant feedback concerning their performance and to serve as a screening process in order to ensure high standards for the profession. Relevant information including practicum evaluations is coordinated through the program administration. In addition to academic abilities and skills, students will be evaluated on an ongoing basis, including on the practicum/internship experience, on intrapersonal, communication, behavioral, and personal attributes that are considered integral and necessary parts of professional functioning. Faculty will monitor these areas of functioning and may, identify problems in their students' functioning, provide constructive feedback to them, and require a remediation plan to address those difficulties. While it is difficult to operationally define all characteristics associated with quality professionalism, students and faculty have targeted several observable behavioral categories that they consider to be an integral and necessary part of professional functioning. These broad areas include the following: 1. Academic Achievement a. Academic standing as discussed in this handbook. b. Ability to communicate orally and in writing. c. Management of practicum/internship experiences. 2. Responsible Behavior a. Dependability in commitment (e.g., punctuality in attending classes, submitting papers and assignments, meeting with clients, etc.). b. Accepts responsibility for own work. c. Carries through and completes tasks. d. Seeks needed guidance from appropriate sources. 3. Ethical Behavior a. Abides by the ethical standards of the profession as delineated in the American Counseling Association publication, Code of Ethics, (http://www.counseling.org/docs/ethics/2014-aca-code-of-ethics.pdf and/or the American School Counselor Association Ethical Standards (http://schoolcounselor.org/asca/media/asca/Resource%20Center/Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Issues/Sample%20Documents/EthicalStandards2010.pdf). b. Abides by university requirements as outlined in this handbook and in other published university and college documents. 4. Intrapersonal Behavior a. Displays mature and appropriate behavior. b. Demonstrates ability to function independently. c. Exhibits usual and customary judgment and discretion in both student and professional activities. d. Presents a generally respectful and non-hostile attitude. e. Participates in activities that are pursuant to professional development. f. Develops intrinsic criteria to evaluate own performance. 5. Interpersonal Behavior a. Cooperative with and respectful of others. 30 b. Ability to give, accept, and utilize constructive criticism. c. Develops and maintains positive relationships with peers and faculty. d. Develops satisfactory working relationships with supervisors and advisers. Endorsement/Recommendation Policy The counseling program faculty and administration are committed to assisting students and graduates pursuing licensure, certification, or employment in their area of specialization and professional competency. Endorsements are provided when the individual has successfully demonstrated meeting program standards and competencies through required coursework and clinical field experiences, and who have met core standards for admission and progress. Such standards include demonstration of professional comportment and ethical conduct as required of professional counselors. The program faculty or administrators may verify a graduate's completion of the degree and educational and clinical requirements after review of the official transcript. When responding to requests for recommendations for graduate study and employment, faculty familiar with the student can take into account the student's performance in coursework, evaluations from field supervisors in practicum and internship, outcomes of professional examinations, (e.g. NBCC, state examinations, and/or other academic accomplishments). They are not able to endorse extracurricular activities outside the curriculum. Thus, faculty reserve the right to decline endorsement outside their area of specialization or if they have had insufficient interaction with a student. Written requests for recommendations should be made to the appropriate faculty or office. A job description or relevant information about the position and a resume should be included. Faculty may refer a student to a faculty or field supervisor who had directly observed a student's work. It is the student's responsibility to keep abreast of state regulations pertaining to licensure that are subject to change. Regulations are available from a state licensing board who should be contacted about current standards. STUDENT CONDUCT All students are expected to comply with the legal and ethical standards of this institution. Moreover, all counselors-in-training are expected to comply with the ethical codes and standards of practice of the profession/field of study. Academic dishonesty and/or non-academic misconduct will result in disciplinary action. Specific instances of misconduct include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, knowingly furnishing false information to the institution, and forging or altering institution documents and/or academic credentials. The institution reserves the right to require a student to withdraw at any time for misconduct as described above. It also reserves the right to impose probation or suspension on a student whose conduct is determined to be unsatisfactory. Students who feel their rights have been denied are entitled to due process. PROFESSIONAL STANDING COMMITTEE The Professional Standing Committee of the College of Psychology is appointed by the Dean and serves in a variety of capacities related to the review of student professional standing matters. The committee consists of faculty, concentration adviser, and other members as appointed by the Dean. The committee may be asked to review alleged violations of the university Student Code of Conduct, including academic standards and ethical standards of the field. In addition, the committee may conduct 31 reviews concerning emotional and behavioral problems serious enough to suggest interference with professional functioning (e.g., in relation to staff and faculty, other students in the program, and/or those in practicum and internship sites), academic performance, or performance in a clinical practicum or internship setting. The purpose of the committee's review and recommendations are not limited to disciplinary actions, but may encompass efforts to remediate a deficiency or problems so that students can continue their education and function competently as professionals. Committee activities are designed to ensure a process by which all relevant facts can be determined, including providing the student with full opportunity to present important information. Actions the committee may recommend to the Dean could include, but are not limited to, remediation, referral, warning or sanctions up to suspension or termination. In instances of complaints regarding violations of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility, the Dean may charge the committee with conducting a formal investigation into the facts pertaining to allegations of misconduct. In such cases the committee will adhere to professional standing committee guidelines that ensure a timely and complete review of the facts. The process will ensure that the student and involved parties have the opportunity to present relevant information. DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY The use of illegal drugs, the use of controlled substances without a prescription, and the use of or being under the influence of alcohol while in class or a clinical rotation/clinical experience are prohibited. Should a student receive a positive drug or alcohol screen and a positive follow-up screen the student will be referred to the dean's office for a professional standing review that could result in dismissal form the program. Students who receive a positive test or screen must follow the procedure for medical review. They cannot participate in a clinical or counseling placement until the disposition of the matter is determined. If a student reports to the academic program chair for help with a personal drug or alcohol use concern, PRIOR to an impending drug test, the student will be required to report to the Dean's Office for referral to the Student Assistance Program. The student will only be permitted to report to class or a placement if cleared by the committee and Dean's Office. DRUG AND BACKGROUND SCREENINGS The College of Psychology may require students to submit to Level 1 and/or Level 2 background checks and/or drug screenings. This will be particularly applicable to students assigned to clinical and counseling placements. These programs include, but are not limited to, School Psychology - Psy.D.; Specialist in School Psychology - Psy.S.; Clinical Psychology - Psy.D.; Clinical Psychology - Ph.D.; and Master's in Counseling programs. College of Psychology Drug Screening College of Psychology students may be required to submit to urine drug screen testing. Students who test positive for illegal or illicit drugs, marijuana even if prescribed or certified by a physician, or for a controlled substance for which they do not have a prescription, will be referred to the College to be handled in connection with the College's policies and procedures. College of Psychology Background Screening The NSU College of Psychology may require students within its graduate programs to submit to a Level 1 and/or Level 2 background check, as defined in Chapter 435, Florida Statutes, prior to enrollment in a practicum, internship, or other training activity. Each College of Psychology program may have program-specific requirements for background screening of students that can be found in their program and/or practicum and internship handbooks. Students enrolled in such programs are required to authorize the NSU 32 College of Psychology or affiliate clinical training facilities to obtain background check(s) pursuant to this policy. If the background check(s) reveals information of concern, which the NSU College of Psychology may deem unfavorable, the College will request that the individual provide a detailed written explanation of the information contained in this report, along with appropriate documentation (e.g., police reports). Students may also be required to authorize clinical training facilities that they are assigned to by the College of Psychology to obtain a background check with the results reported to the clinical training facility. Acceptance of a background screening by an NSU College of Psychology program does not automatically guarantee that a student with information of concern will be accepted by clinical training facilities to which they may be assigned. Students with questions concerning the background checks should contact their respective college and/or academic program for more information. If information received in connection with any background check indicates that the student has provided false or misleading statements, has omitted required information, or in any way is unable to meet the requirements for completion of the program, then the student may be disciplined or dismissed, or his or her enrollment may be terminated. STUDENT, INTERN, OR RESIDENT CONTINUING DUTY TO DISCLOSE Students enrolled in NSU's College of Psychology have a continuing duty to disclose any arrest, conviction, guilty or no contest plea, adjudication of guilt withheld for a criminal offense or participation in a pretrial diversion program or its equivalent for any criminal offense. Students are required to notify the dean's office within 10 days of any arrest or subsequent conviction, guilty or no contest plea, or participation in a pretrial diversion program or its equivalent for any criminal offense. While enrolled at NSU, students have a continuing duty to disclose all the above, along with any arrests or pending criminal charges, within 10 days of any arrest or charges filed. Students must notify the Dean or designee of any arrests or pending criminal charges. A failure to timely disclose any arrests or pending criminal charges may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from NSU. DEGREE CONFERRAL Students who have completed all requirements for the master's degree must submit an online application for degree. Forms are available via the Office of the University Registrar's website: http://www.nova.edu/cwis/registrar/instructions.html. Degree applications require approval by the Office of the Dean, University Comptroller, Registrar, and Library. These offices verify that requirements are met and that the student's accounts, records, etc. are in good standing. Upon approval, the application is presented to the NSU Board of Trustees for conferral. Following the official conferral of the degree, which is noted on the transcript, a diploma is mailed to the student. Students are encouraged to submit their degree applications at least one month prior to the completion of their program. GRADUATION Graduation exercises for Nova Southeastern University take place each spring/summer. Eligibility to graduate is determined by having completed all requirements prior to the graduation date or by the end of the summer term. Students eligible to participate in graduation may contact the Office of the University Registrar for information about graduation ceremonies. 33 DEGREE RESCISSION POLICY Nova Southeastern University (NSU) awards degrees on the basis of the successful completion of all academic and program requirements and in accordance with NSU's Code of Conduct requiring academic honesty and integrity. NSU reserves the right to rescind a degree in the event there are findings of academic misconduct, fraud, or other violations committed by a student in completing and/or obtaining the degree. The Dean or designee of the college or school that oversees the degree program is essential in determining the discovery and receipt of credible information for review or investigation and will follow the protocols outlined in the applicable student catalog and handbook. The recission recommendation is presented to the Provost and President for review and support. The decision to rescind the degree is the responsibility of the President of the University with the approval of the NSU Board of Trustees. Once the decision to rescind a degree has been approved by the NSU Board of Trustees, the following will occur. The Provost will communicate the actions required to formally rescind the degree and will provide the University Registrar, with a copy to the Dean, written authorization to proceed as follows: a. Send a certified notification to the individual informing the individual of the university's decision to rescind the degree and requesting return of the diploma provided after degree conferral. b. Remove the degree conferred status and date from the individual's academic record, the official transcript, and in all other pertinent education records maintained in the student information system (current and archive). c. Inform the College Dean, the National Student Clearinghouse, the Office of Alumni Affairs, the Library (if applicable for publications), and, if applicable, any local, state, national, or international agency of the degree rescission so that their records are revised to reflect this action. d. Enter a \"Degree Rescinded\" notation on the individual's academic record indicating rescission action and date of the Board of Trustee's decision. e. Place a University (UA) Hold on the individual's record to prevent future admissions, registration, and enrollment at the university. f. Ensure the Provost's written authorization and all supporting documentation are placed in the individual's permanent university records. 34 ETHICAL ISSUES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF COUNSELING PROGRAMS All students and graduates are expected to be knowledgeable about and conform to both the letter and spirit of their professions' ethical standards. Counseling students are expected to abide by the 2014 Code of Ethics as approved and adopted by the America n Counseling Association Governing Council. Additionally, School Counseling students should review the American School Counselor Association's Ethical Standards for School Counselors and Clinical Mental Health Counseling students should review the American Mental Health Counselors Association Code of Ethics for Mental Health Counselors. ABA students should review the BACB (Behavioral Analyst Certification Board) Professional and Ethical Compliance Code for Behavior Analysts , and Substance Abuse Counseling students should review the NAADAC (National Association for Addictions Professionals) Code of Ethics. A copy of the full text of materials to which students and graduates are expected to conform will be made available in the relevant ethics course (s). From time to time these materials are amended. Students and graduates are expected to review these materials periodically to ensure that they have an understanding of current guidelines. In particular, attention is drawn to the following points, whic h are illustrative rather than exhaustive or comprehensive: 1.Students enrolled in NSU's College of Psychology have a continuing duty to disclose any arrest, conviction, guilty or no contest plea, adjudication of guilt withheld for a criminal offense or participation in a pretrial diversion program or its equivalent for any criminal offense. Students are required to notify the dean's office within 10 days of any arrest or subsequent conviction, guilty or no contest plea, or participation in a pretrial diversi on program or its equivalent for any criminal offense. While enrolled at NSU, students have a continuing duty to disclose all the above, along with any arrestsor pending criminal charges, within 10 days of any arrest or charges filed. Students must notif y t he Dean or designee of any arrests or pending criminal charges. A failure to timely disclose any arrests or pending criminal charges may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from NSU. 2.No student should represent themself as being in possession of the master's degree, either orally or i n writing, directly or by implication, until all formal requirements for the degree have been satisfactorilycompleted, and the NSU Board of Trustees has met and conferred the degree. 3.It is mi sleading and inappropriate to append \"master's student\", or some similar designation, afte r your name. 4.A student should guard against being in a position of having final clinical responsibility for clinicalwork. This is most important both ethically a nd legally. 5.When a student is in practicum /internship , the student will verbally identify them self to their superviso r, the agency or school staff and each client and client's family as a graduate student \"trainee\" in Clinica l Mental Health Counseling , School Counseling , Substance Abuse C ounseling or Applied Behavior Analysis. 6.In Florida, new graduates are legally ineligible to represent themselves as \"mental health counselor\" o r to offer or advertise independent services until the Florida license is awarded. Students should comply with the rules of their particular state. 7.Any academic, professional, or personal difficulty which results in action being taken by the master's program regarding a student will be brought to the attention of a program administrator. Dependi ng upon the particular type of difficulty identified, a number of processes are available to the programadministrator. 8.Florida students in the Clinical Mental Health Counseling program should familiarize themselves with 35 Chapter 491, Florida Statutes, the Florida State Law for licensure as a Mental Health Counselor. Florida students in the School Counseling program should familiarize themselves with the Florida Department of Education guidelines for certifying school counselors. Students from other states should familiarize themselves with the laws of their state. Dual Relationships between Faculty Members and Students While in principle the ACA and ASCA policy of discouraging dual relationships is endorsed, recognition is given to the fact that, given the complexity and diversity of our functions, certain dual relationships between faculty members and students are bound to arise. Faculty members and students are therefore urged to be sensitive to and aware of the existence of dual relationships and to enter into these with full awareness of their implications. Sexual relationships between a university faculty member or administrator and a student who are not married to each other or who do not have a preexisting analogous relationship are inappropriate whenever the university faculty member or administrator has a professional responsibility for the student in such matters as teaching a course or otherwise evaluating, supervising, or advising a student as part of a school program. Even when a university faculty member or administrator has no professional responsibility for a student, the university faculty member or administrator should be sensitive to the perceptions of other students that a student who has a sexual relationship with a professor may receive preferential treatment. A university faculty member or administrator who is closely related to a student by blood or marriage or who has a preexisting analogous relationship with a student should eschew roles involving a professional responsibility for the student whenever possible. Romantic or sexual relationships between a faculty member and a student then enrolled in the faculty member's class (including supervised student activities for which academic credit is given) may be or appear to be coercive and are discouraged. Even when no coercion is present, such relationships create an appearance of impropriety and favoritism, which can impair the academic experience of all students in that class. It is, therefore, improper conduct for a faculty member to engage in a romantic or sexual relationship with a student enrolled in the faculty member's class. At Nova Southeastern University, romantic and sexual relationships between a faculty member and a student are subject to the prohibition against sexual harassment. It is specifically required that when either a faculty member or any agency, corporation, or program under the auspices of a faculty member employs a student, or whenever a student or any agency, corporation, or program under the auspices of a student employs a faculty member, both parties shall document the existence of this dual relationship in a letter to the Dean of the College of Psychology. This documentation shall be retained in both the student's and the faculty member's permanent files. As necessary, an ad hoc committee shall be appointed to review any complaints that might arise as the result of dual employment relationships. Further, no services provided by a faculty member or any agency, corporation, or program under the auspices of a faculty member shall result in academic credit being granted to a student unless the services are officially rendered as part of the recognized curriculum (e.g., practicum work, supervised university research, internship, or course work). Approval of such rendering of service must be in writing and approved by the Dean. The provision of psychological services by faculty to students is discouraged. Extenuating circumstances may exist, such as when some unusual expertise is possessed by a faculty member or when a student was in treatment with a faculty member prior to becoming a student. In such cases, the Dean must approve the provision of psychological services to a student. Adjunct faculty members who expect no further instructional or supervisory relationship with a student may provide services without this reporting requirement. 36 No Direct Payment to Faculty Direct student payment to faculty for educational or professional services is not permissible. That is, no student is to make private arrangements to reimburse any faculty member for psychotherapy, tutoring, supervision, or other educational assistance. Students are encouraged to seek whatever educational help they need from faculty members and to seek professional services (such as psychotherapy) outside of the program. STUDENT GRIEVANCES AND APPEALS The College of Psychology faculty and staff value professionalism, honesty, and ethical conduct in the handling of student concerns. At all times, matters are handled in the spirit of education and development. The purpose of the student grievance and appeals process is to allow for the orderly resolution of student grievances concerning a policy, procedure, or administrative action. At all times, the respect and protection of students is of utmost concern. Evaluation of course work and assessment of competency resides within the expertise of faculty who are uniquely qualified by their training experience. Such evaluations and grades are not subject to student grievances and appeals under this section, unless there is an allegation of federally/state protected discrimination, but rather are subject only to appeal under the Policy for Grading Disputes where applicable. Informal Procedure Before initiating a formal appeal, the student must first meet with the party against whom the complaint is being made and present supporting information in an attempt to resolve the matter informally. If this does not result in an acceptable resolution the student shall bring all academic matters to the attention of the Program Coordinator within 30 working days of its occurrence, where informal resolution will continue in consultation with the Department Chair or Designee. Should the Department Chair or Designee find insufficient evidence or if this step fails to bring about an acceptable resolution, the student must next request intervention through the Dean of the College of Psychology within another 30 days. Formal Procedure 1. A student wishing to proceed with the grievance must file a written appeal with the Dean. This document should contain a concise statement of the particular manner of harm, along with all relevant facts and compelling supporting evidence. 2. Upon receipt of a written appeal, the Dean shall review the document to determine if the complaint warrants further review. a. If the Dean decides that no further action should be taken, the appeal will be terminated and a brief written explanation will be submitted to the student. b. If the Dean decides that a further review should occur, the appeal should be referred to the college's standing Appeals Committee. The committee will conduct a substantive review of all facts it deems pertinent to the appeal. The committee, at its discretion, may interview the student or any other pertinent person, which it judges has information relevant to the review. No persons may have legal counsel accompany them or appear in their behalf. 3. The Appeals Committee will file a written recommendation to the Dean with justification, including whether sufficient evidence exists to uphold or overturn the action being grieved. The Dean will notify the student of a determination in writing within a reasonable period following the filing of the appeal. 4. If the student has evidence that there have been any procedural irregularities within the appeals process, such irregularities must be presented in writing to the director within 5 days of the notification of 37 determination. The Dean will review the document and notify the student of a decision. Should any irregularities have occurred, the director will return the appeal to the Appeals Committee for consideration consistent with the process described in this policies and procedures handbook. 5. Following a review of the committee's report, the Dean's decision shall be final. Students acknowledge upon their acceptance into this program that the above procedure provides for adequate review of university action by any other outside parties or jurisdictions. Further, the jurisdiction for all grievance issues related to policies, procedures, and/or administrative action shall be Broward County, Florida. REMEDIATION POLICY A student receiving a grade of F in any course must repeat and successfully complete the course within one year (excluding leaves of absence). Both grades shall remain on the student's record and shall count toward the cumulative total of below B minus (B-) grades; however, only the higher of the two grades will be counted toward the student's grade point average. A grade lower than B minus (B-) in the following courses reflects inadequate performance and does not satisfy curriculum requirements: Clinical Mental Health Counseling: PYCL 0666 0681 Counseling Internship, and Continuing Counseling Internship Substance Abuse Counseling: SA 0770 Substance Abuse Counseling Practicum I, Substance Abuse Counseling and Education: SA 0780 Substance Abuse Counseling Practicum II, and SA 0790 Substance Abuse Counseling Practicum III Applied Behavior Analysis: ABA 0711 Concepts and Principles of Applied Behavior Analysis I, ABA 0712 Concepts and Principles of Applied Behavior Analysis II, ABA 0761 Fieldwork in ABA I, ABA 0771 Fieldwork in ABA II, ABA 0781 Fieldwork in ABA III School Counseling: PYCL 0685 School Practicum, PYCL 0688 School Counseling Internship and PYCL 0689 Continuing School Counseling Internship The student must repeat the course and a minimum grade of B minus (B-) must be achieved. Both grades shall remain on the student's record and shall count toward the cumulative total of below B minus (B-) grades; however, only the higher of the two grades will be counted toward the student's grade point average. As part of the Remediation Policy of the college, any student receiving a grade below B minus (B-) during matriculation or placed on academic probation is required to meet with the Program Coordinator or Department Chair. Students with weak evaluations in practicum and/or internship or who are terminated from a practicum and/or internship placement due to problematic performance will receive a grade no higher than a C, may be subject to review by the Professional Standing Committee and required to remediate difficulties before consideration of a new placement is made. Students will be required to repeat the practicum/internship course and clinical training at a different setting. Progress in the degree program requires that students maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 or better, and professional functioning as outlined in academic standing policies, core performance standards for admission and progress, and criteria for evaluation of students as listed in this handbook. Students may be referred to the Professional Standing Committee for a review of areas needing remediation, for violations of the academic code of conduct, or other concerns about professional functioning in the program. The committee reserves the right to dismiss students from the program. 38 READMISSION Students dismissed or withdrawn from the program may petition for readmission after one calendar year (three consecutive semesters, including summer terms) . Applicants should complete the readmissions application and supply supporting documentation regarding remediation . Readmission petitions should be submitted to the College of Psychology Admissions Off ice. Applicants are advised to petition for readmission no earlier than the semester prior to the expiration of the one calendar year dismissal period. Students will have their records examined by the master's program admission committee . The admission committee may consider the circumstances which led to the student's departure from the program, any information presented by the student to remedy the factors that contributed to such departure, steps taken to prevent their recurrence, and any ot her information the committee deems relevant. Upon app roval, the student will be readmitted to the program in effect at that time . Only those courses, previously completed in the College of Psychology master's program within the past five years with grade s of B- or better and that are equivalent will be applied toward the master's degree. Applications must be received by the deadlines posted on the College of Psychology website. 39 OTHER POLICIES AND INFORMATION COURSE ATTENDANCE AND ENGAGEMENT Students are expected to engage with the course on the first day of class. Students not attending the course by the 14th day of class will be marked as non-attending and may be withdrawn from coursework in accordance with University Registrar and Roster Reconciliation policies. FORCE MAJEURE NSU's duties and obligations to the student shall be suspended or modified immediately, without notice, during all periods that the University determines it is closed or ceases or modifies or curtails operations because of force majeure events including, but not limited to, any fire or any casualty, flood, earthquake, hurricane, lightning, explosion, strikes, lockouts, prolonged shortage of energy supplies, riots or civil commotion, Act(s) of God, war, governmental action, act(s) of terrorism, infectious diseases, epidemic, pandemic, physical or structural dangers, or any other event beyond the University's control. If such an event occurs, NSU's duties and obligations to the student (including its delivery and format of classes, student housing and dining, campus facilities, and related services, activities, and events) will be postponed, cancelled, or modified until such time as the school, in its sole discretion, may safely reopen or resume normal operations. Under no circumstances, except as otherwise required by Federal or State statute, will NSU be obligated to refund, reduce or credit any portion of tuition, housing, meal plans, fees, or any other cost or charge attributable to any location, delivery modality, or service affected by any such force majeure event necessitated by Acts of God, University or academic or health and safety decisions, and/or any situations outside of the University's control.

Students, faculty, staff, and visitors should not have an expectations of privacy while they are in recordable spaces at NSU, such as classroom/lecture halls (including online participants), common areas, or other spaces that are generally open to members of the NSU community. Any course where class content may be recorded should include a syllabus statement detailing the terms and conditions associated with such recordings, such as statement included in this policy detailed below. Recordings depicting personally identifiable information of students (such as images, audio recordings, or documents) are considered education records subject to the Family Educational Records Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"). As such, student access to recorded class content will be limited to those students registered to participate in the live offering of the class, regardless of a student's section, discipline, or if they are participating online. (Some class lectures/content may be delivered to students form separate courses, colleges, or disciplines, in a single classroom setting. For purposes of this policy, all students registered to participate in the class, including those participating online, will be permitted to access and review the recorded course content.) Faculty members seeking to grant access to or share recordings of class content with students or third parties who were not registered to participate in the live offering of the class must obtain written approval from their college's Dean or designee before doing so. If approved, the faculty member must make the following steps before making the recording available to students or third parties who were not registered to participate in the liver offering of the class: 1. Review the lecture recording for any personally identifiable student information and remove or redact any such information from the recording (e.g. blurring the student's image, altering the student's voice, removing sections of the recording featuring student information, etc.); or 2. Obtain written consent from any student whose personally identifiable information appears in the recording (including video, audio, or student documentation) using the Distribution Student Recording Classroom Consent Form.

SCHO OL COUNSELING MATRICULATION REQUIREMENTS (DEGREE CANDIDACY) School Counseling Program Candidates are admitted into graduate study in School Counseling at the master's level and are reviewed for degree candidacy (matriculation) after the completion of the first four courses (12 credits) for which the candidate is enrolled. During the formal review for matriculation, candidates' academic performance and professional functioning in the first four courses will be examined. Candidates need a grade point average of 3.0 or above in the first four courses to be matriculated. Candidates who achieve a grade point average of 2.5 or below, who receive two grade s below a B minus (B- ), or who receive a grade of F in any of the first four courses will not be matriculated and will be automatically withdrawn from graduate study. Under no circumstances will that candidate be permitted to take additional graduate level courses in a College of Psychology program. Candidates with a grade point average greater than 2.5 but less than 3.0 for the first four courses will be maintained in a non -matriculated status. No more than four additional courses may be taken without achieving an overall grade point average of 3.0. 52 ACADEMIC STANDING (FOLLOWING MATRICULATION) The grading policy for all graduate programs in the College of Psychology requires students to maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0. In addition, other minimum requirements are in existence. Failure to meet these req uirem ents will result either in academic probation or dismissal as detailed below. Probation Academic probation will occur automatically when any of the following conditions exist: 1.The cumulative grade point average falls below 3.0. 2.A grade of F is received. 3.Three concurrent incompletes (I) appear on the transcript. The student, the master's program administration and the Department Chair will be notifie d in writing of the student's probationary status.

Should a non-degree seeking student receive a second grade below B minus (B -) or a grade of F, the student will aut omatically be withdrawn from graduate studies and must wait one year (three academic terms) to reapply . SCHOOL COUNSELING PRACTICUM AND INTERNSHIP REQUIREMENTS Practicum and internship are conceived to be that phase of the master's in School Counseling program in which a counselor -in-training is able to crystallize his or her educational experiences by translating theoretical constructs into practice. This type of su pervised practice in School Counseling is generally viewed as an experience that assists the prospective counselor to function effectively in a future employment situation. It serves as a bridge between the theoretical and the practical application. It is an opportunity for the counselor -in-training to apply what he or she has learned from the more didactic portion of the School Counseling program. Candidates entering practicum/internship training may find it necessary to make special arrangements with their employer, including taking a leave of absence, to fulfill this requirement. Candidates will need to arrange their schedule to complete this degree requirement . All candidates must apply by their local school district's policies and deadlines regarding placement. Additionally, candidates must ensure that the school district where they choose to do practicum or internship has a placement agreement with Nova Southeastern University. If the school district does not have an agreement with NSU, placement may be delayed. Candidates must communicate with the program office regarding practicum and internship placement options to ensure that placement is obtained according to the candidate's schedule. 53 Practicum and internship placement procedures vary among counties; candidates must abide by the differing guidelines. Local school boards may charge school counseling candidates a fee for practicum /internship placement in a school with a cooperating school counselor. Should a candidate elect to complete their practicum/internship in a school district that requires such a fee, it will be the candidate's responsibility to submit the fee on the designated day and time stipulated by the school board staff in a ccordance wi th their guidelines. Local school boards may require candidates to complete a security clearance and background screening which may include, but not be limited to, a background screening, fingerprinting , and/or drug testing. Some school districts may require additional documentation such as proof of immunizations, health screenings, etc. Candidates are expected to comply with school district procedures and timelines including incurring the cost of possibl e fees. Some school districts may require additional documentation such as proof of immunizations (including but not limited to COVID-19 vaccination), health screenings, etc. Students are expected to comply with the school district and the timelines including incurring the cost of possible fees. The University is not required to provide alternative sites for practicums or internships should students be placed at a school that requires COVID-19 or other immunizations. Students' failure to comply with the immunization requirements for practicum or internship may result in the delay of program completion and/or the inability to satisfy the graduation requirements. Candidates will choose to do their practicum experience at one of the three Pre -K-12 grade levels and the internship experience at a different Pre -K-12 grade level. The three grade levels from which to choose are elementary (Pre -K-5), middle (6 -8) and high school (9 -12). Practicum responsibilities require candidates to spend 100 hours (40 of which are direct student contact hours) at a Pre -K-12 grade school setting. It is a distinct experience where candidates gain basic counseling skills and professional knowledge which may include individual and small -group counseling, classroom guidance pre sentations, consultation, parent conferencing, individual and large group testing, involvement in the exceptional student education process, and other experiences relevant to the practicum setting. This experience is completed over the course of one semes ter (3 credit hours) and is to familiarize candidates with the role of the professional school counselor prior to internship. Candidates spend approximately 7 to 8 hours per week at a school. Internship is an experience which requires candidates to spend 6 00 hours (240 of which are direct student contact hours) in a Pre -K-12 grade school setting. Candidates integrate knowledge acquired in the classroom to real, on the job supervised training. This experience enhances basic professional school counseling s kills in the student academic, social/emotional, and career counseling areas. The six credit hours of internship afford counselors -in-training an opportunity to work with a variety of students, parents or teachers over time. NSU ascribes to the American School Counselor Association National Model for school counseling programs and supports experiences that include leadership, student advocacy, collaboration and teaming, and systemic change. 54 Candidates may select from the following two scheduling options to fulfill the 600 hours (six credit hours) of internship experience: 1.Completion of one academic semester (fall or winter) where the candidate will be required to complete a minimum of 40 hours per week in a school setting. 2.Completion of two continuous s emesters (fall and winter) where the candidate will be required t o complete a minimum of 20 hours per week in a school setting. Candidates employed by the school system will be required to obtain permission from their principal or designated school official for release time to pursue their internship. Candidates may be required to take a leave of absence or make other necessary ar rangements to fulfill this requirement. Candidates are not permitted to complete their internship experience at the school where they work, unless they are employed as a school counselor and there is a supervisor within the school who meets the requiremen ts put forth by the Florida Department of Education. Please be advised that waiver of practicum and internship experience for any reason will not be permitted. The candidate must file an application for practicum and internship and receive approval prior to registering for these courses. The practicum and internship courses must be completed with a grade of B minus (B- ) or higher, otherwise the course will need to be repeated. The practicum and internship c ourses are offered in the synchronous online format . In addition to the experiential, in -school work r equired for practicum over one semester and for internship over one or two continuous semester/s, candidates will participate in synch ronous online group supervision meetings with NSU candidates and faculty members at the university. Additionally, during practicum, individual or triadic supervision will take place on the alternate week with a faculty supervisor. Individual and group supervision meetings are held online at the time designated by the instructor . Specific details on practicum and internship are provided to candidates by the practicum coordinator at the appropriate time in their program. Please be advised that during practicum and internship, candidates may also be enrolled in regularly scheduled classes.

FLORIDA EDUCATOR ACCOMPLISHED PRACTICES The Florida Educator Accomplished Practices ( FEAPs ) were adopted by the State of Florida Department of Education (DOE) to delineate the knowledge base and skills required of educators in the public school system. Successful articulation of the Florida Educator Accomplished Practices delineated by DOE are a requirement for graduation from the School Counseling program and reflects the commitment of the College of Psychology to a performance -based assessment of these essential competencies. 56 Candidates receive the Candidate Guide to the Florida Educator Ac complished Practices upon admission to the School Counseling program. This guide describes the Flor ida Educator Accomplished Practices and outlines where the FEAPs are imbedded into the School Counseling coursework. This guide also lists the required assessments and forms that candidates will need to complete to meet the FEAP requirements. One of these forms is the Individual Remediation Plan (IRP) that the candidate and instructor will need to fill out tog ether if the candidate has not met a specific FEAP assessment requirement within a course. The instructor will assign a plan for remediating the FEAP assessment, and the candidate is responsible for completing the tasks outlined in the remediation plan.

CLINICAL MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING MATRICULATION REQUIREMENTS (DEGREE CANDIDACY) Clinical Mental Health Counseling Concentration Students are admitted into graduate study at the master's level and are reviewed for degree candidacy (matriculation) after completion of the designated four cou rses (12 credits) which must be completed within the first six courses (18 credits) or first two semesters for which the student is enrolled. These four designated courses require demonstration of written, quantitative, and interpersonal skills, as well as overall professional functioning. The designated four courses for matriculation are: 1.PYCL 0502 Counseling Theories and Practice 2.PYCL 0511 Introduction to Counseling Techniques 3.PYCL 0507 Research and Evaluation for Counselors 4.PYCL 0570 Ethical, Legal, and Professional Issues for Counselors During the formal review for matriculation, the students' academic , behavioral, interpersonal, and professional performance in the four designated courses listed above will be examined. Students need a grade point average of 3.0 or above in the four designated courses to be matriculated. Students who receive two grades below a B minus (B- ) or a grade of F in any o f the four designated courses will not be matriculated and will be withdrawn from graduate study. Prior to the formal matriculation review, should a student receive a second grade below B minus (B- ) or a grade of F, the student will automatically be with drawn from graduate study. Students with a grade point average greater than 2.5 but less than 3.0 for the four designated courses will be maintained in a non-matriculated status. No more than four additional courses may be taken without achieving an over all grade point average of 3.0. 66 Under no circumstances will students who achieve a grade point average of 2.5 or below in the four designated courses be permitted to take graduate level courses in a College of Psychology pr ogram. ACADEMIC STANDING (FOLLOWING MATRICULATION) The grading policy for all graduate programs in the College of Psychology requires students to maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0. In addition, other minimum requirements are in existence. Failure to meet these requirem ents will result either in academic probation or dismissal as detailed below. Probation Academic probation will occur automatically when any of the following conditions exist: 1.The cumulative grade point average falls below 3.0. 2.A grade of F is received. 3.Three concurrent incompletes (I) appear on the transcript. The student, the master's program administration, and the Department Chair will be notified in writing of the student's probationary status.

CLINICAL MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING PRACTICUM AND INTERNSHIP REQUIREMENTS Practicum and internship is conceived to be that phase of the M.S. in Counseling, Clinical Mental Health Counseling concentration , in which a counselor -trainee is able to crystallize his or her educational experiences by translating theoretical constructs into pra ctice. This type of supervised practice in counseling is generally viewed as an experience that assists the prospective counselor in his or her delivery of clinical mental health counseling services. It serves as a bridge between the theoretical and the re al and is the first opportunity for the counselor -trainee to apply what he or she has learned from the more didactic portion of the Clinical M ental H ealth C ounseling program. Students eligible to begin practicum will complete and submit a practicum/internship application form to initiate the placement process . Students who submit an application to start practicum/internship will 67 have completed the prerequisite coursework required prior to starting practicum. The application and deadline da tes are published in the Student Center in Canvas under Practicum and Internship Information. It is important that students list the correct address for placement as the application is routed to the designated Practicum Coordinator for that area . It is ad vised that students who reside outside of the South Florida area apply several months before the deadline date . Students must resubmit an application if there is a delay to a subsequent term . Students will be notified by the program office of their approva l or rejection to begin practicum. Those students approved to begin practicum will be provided with instructions regarding site placement several months in advance of the term start . To guarantee seat availability in the practicum course, students must register for the course no later than one month prior to term start. The student cannot complete his or her practicum experience in a private practice. If the student would like to do his or her practicum at the same site where he or she is employed, it must be completed in a different department/unit, must involve completely different duties, and must be supervised by a qualified professional unrelated to his or her present position. The student must receive permissi on from the program coordinator before requesting a placement in the place of his or her employment. An NSU representative will contact the agency on behalf of the student. While many students can complete the practicum/internship requirement while workin g, they should be prepared to make whatever arrangements are necessary to complete this requirement including a leave of absence, adjustment of the work schedule, etc. Practicum and internship time must not be compensated. Three consecutive semesters of clinical field experience are required to afford students the opportunity of working with a variety of client populations over time. Students entering practicum/internship training may find it necessary to make special arrangements with their employer, incl uding taking a leave of absence, to fulfill this requirement. Students will need to arrange their schedules to complete this degree requirement. Once placed at a site, students are expected to remain at the same site for the three consecutive semesters of practicum and internship. If a change of site occurs, students may have to complete additional hours. The Clinical Mental Health Counseling practicum and internship each span a full 15 -week semester on average. During Practicum , the student will spend a minimum of 150 clock hours (10 hrs/week) with a minimum of 40 hours of direct client contact in a community agency setting and participate in a weekly practicum class which will include meeting with an instructor for group and triadic supervision. During Internship (which will be completed over two continuous semesters) immediately following practicum, students are required to spend a minimum of 600 hours (20 hrs/week) with a minimum of 240 hours of direct client contact in a comm unity agency setting and participate in bi -weekly seminar class. To fulfill the 600 clock hour requirement, a minimum of three hundred (300) total clock hours must be completed for each of the two semesters with at least one hundred -twenty (120) of those t otal hours per semester to be direct client contact. If an agency where an individual would like to complete practicum does not appear on the approved list, the designated Practicum Coordinator must be contacted at least five months prior to any semester, so that the possibility of arranging a new placement can be determined. For regional campus students, practicum and internship schedules are a departure from the intensive weekend format. The practicum and internship courses will be held during the week via synchronous online class es. In the regional campus format, practicum/internship is scheduled only once during the curriculum for each cohort, and typically after a minimum of 10 courses have been scheduled. Currently, for students in the regular pace, p racticum is scheduled to begin in the fall semester, with internship following in the winter and summer semesters. For students in the accelerated pace, practicum is scheduled to begin in the winter semester, with internship following in the summer and fall semesters . Each campus has a local Practicum Coordinator who assists in all arrangements for site placements. 68 Please be advised that during practicum/internship, students typically are also enrolled in regularly scheduled classes. For online students, practicum and internship sched ules are a departure from the asynchronous format. Students will be required to register for a section and be available for the live, synchronous online class via videoconference during the posted class meeting times. Sections meet during the week at varying times, as listed in Self Service Banner . Online students who enroll in PYCL 0681 remain with the same instructor for PYCL 0682. Online students who reside outside of Florida or in the Florida Panhandle and North Central Florida will be required to take an active role in locating community agencies by completing a site form listing sites of interest after applying for practicum/internship. These sites are generally community mental health centers that employ a licensed supervisor. A major criterion for practicum site selection is the ability of the site to provide the student with supervised, therapeutic counseling experiences that will satisfy the minimum direct/indirect hour r equirement. Sites are generally community mental health, non -profit agencies, hospitals, or universities. The site must employ a Master's level supervisor with relevant certifications and/or licenses, a minimum of two years of pertinent professional exper ience in mental health counseling, and requisite training in supervision. The NSU representative will contact the agency on behalf of the student and determine approval of the site and to provide information about NSU's expectations, requirements, and eval uation procedures. Students may be required to travel or relocate in order to fulfill the practicum/internship requirement if a site cannot be located. Some areas/states may have less availability of sites which could extend the degree period until a site can be secured. Students who reside in South Florida or near a NSU Campus generally have many sites available to the m and will be provided with a site list. Please note that placements cannot be made in the state of New York or outside of the United States or its Territories. Students have an ongoing responsibility to report any address changes via Self-Service Banner/Webstar while enrolled. Please see the Disclosure section located in this handbook. ***Immediate placement at a practicum site is not guaranteed*** Clinical Mental Health Counseling Practicum Prerequisites To be eligible for PYCL 0680 Counseling Practicum, students must have been matriculated and must have successfully completed a minimum of 24 semester hours which includes the following course work: 1.PYCL 0502 Counseling Theories and Practice 2.PYCL 0507 Research and Evaluation for Counselors 3.PYCL 0511 Introduction to Counseling Techniques 4.PYCL 0570 Ethical, Legal, and Professional Issues for Counselor s** 5.PYCL 0584 Diagnosis and Treatment of Adult Psychopathology 6.PYCL 0586 Diagnosis and Treatment of Child and Adolescent Psychopathology 7.PYCL 0635 Group Theory and and Treatment Strategies* *PYCL 0666 Must be completed with a grade of B minus (B- ) or better. ** HIPAA training is required as part of PYCL 0570.

Resources to fulfill this individual liability insurance requirement are available in the Department of Counseling Student Center in Canvas . Proof of coverage will be required for students to remain at a site placement. Please be advised that most sites require a student to undergo a background screening that may include, but not be limited to, fingerprinting and/or drug testing. Some sites may require additional documentation such as proof of immunizations (including but not limited to COVID -19 vaccination), health screenings, etc. Students are expected to comply with agency procedures and timelines including incurri ng the cost of possible fees. The University is not required to provide alternative sites for clinical practicums or internships should students be placed at a site that requires COVID - 19 or other immunizations. Students' failure to comply with the immuniz ation requirements for practicum or internship sites may result in the delay of program completion and/or the inability to satisfy the graduation requirements. Further practicum instructions will be provided to students prior to practicum registration. COMPETENCY ATTAINMENT As part of a systematic assessment of each Clinical Mental Health Counseling student's progress t hroughout the program, faculty will examine student learning in relation to demonstration of a combination of knowledge and skills, as well as professional dispositions. Competency -based assessments, in the form of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) , are embedded in the Clinical Mental H ealth Counseling coursework . Students who do not meet the required competency will be required to remediate the competency in order to receive a passing grade for that particular course. The instructor will assign a plan for remediating the KPI assessment, and the student is responsible for completing the tasks outlined in the remediation plan. Detailed assignment information and associated grading rubrics are located in the designated course syllabi. COUNSELOR DISPOSITIONS In addition to the College of P sychology Core Performance Standards, throughout the educational experience at Nova Southeastern University, applicants and students in the Clinical Mental Health Counseling concentration should develop and embody key professional dispositions. NSU counseling student dispositions are comprised of four categories, including professional behavior; positive attitude and self-awareness; communication, and ethical behavior. Faculty will monitor these dispositions at multiple points in time across the Clinical Mental Health Counseling curricul um. Faculty may identify problems in students' functioning, provide constructive feedback to them, and require a remediation plan to address those difficulties. Detailed assessment information is located in the designated course syllabi and in the Department of Counseling Student Center in Canvas . CLINICAL MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING COUNSELOR PREPARATION COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION (CPCE) All Clinical Mental Health Counseling students are required to complete the Counselor Preparation Comprehensive Examination (CPCE) and earn a passing score prior to graduation.The CPCE is a standardized multiple -choice examination that covers the eight common core areas of counseling: Assessment and Testing, Career Development, Counseling and Helping Relationships, Group Counseling and Group Work, Human Development, Professional Counseling Orientation and Ethical Practice, Research and Program Evaluation, and Social and Cultural Diversity . The passing score is determined by 70 the Department of Counseling for each academic year.

Students enrolled in PYCL 0681 Counseling Internship I are eligible to sit for the CPCE. Students are required to register for the exam when enrolled in PYCL 0680: Counseling Practicum . Students can access the Department's CPCE registration link and registration deadlines in the Department of Counseling Student Center in Canvas. After registering with the Department, students will receive instructions to register with the Center for Credentialing Education (CCE). Upon approval from CCE, students schedule to take the CPCE through at a Pearson VUE Center. The current cost of the exam (Computer -Based Test -CBT) is $150 and may be subject to change . Students who do not earn a passing score on the CPCE will need to retake the exam. Students hav e up to two additional attempts (3 attempts total) during the 6-month testing authorization granted by the Center for Credentialing and Education (CCE) .The exam cost is assessed for each attempt. If a student does not pass the CPCE on their third attempt, the student's best scores in each of the eight sections across the three attempts will be used to calculate a \"superscore. \" If the student's superscore meets or exceeds the required passing score for the academic year in which the student attempted the ex am for the third time , then the student has successfully completed the CPCE requirement. If the superscore does not meet or exceed the required passing score , then the student will work with program faculty to devise a remediation plan prior to retaking the exam a fourth time. Each subsequent attempt will then be evaluated using the superscore method , inclusive of all previous attempts . Students who defer any repeated exam attempts to future terms will be held to the standards and procedures in p lace for the term in which they sit for the exam. A student may repeat the exam as many times as needed; however, they must complete their program within five years from the date of first enrollment (see Time Limit Requirements).

Du al concentrations may not be available in all concentrations and formats. Consult a program advisor for further details. SUBSTANCE ABUSE COUNSELING MATRICULATION REQUIREMENTS (DEGREE CANDIDACY) Substance Abuse Counseling and Substance Abuse Counseling and Education Concentrations Students are admitted into graduate study at the master's level and are reviewed for degree candidacy (matriculation) after completion of the designated four courses (12 credits) which must be co mpleted within the first six courses (18 credits) or first two semesters for which the student is enrolled. These four designated courses require demonstration of written, quantitative, and interpersonal skills, as well as overall professional functioning. The designated four courses for matriculation are: 1.PYCL 0502 Counseling Theories and Practice 2.PYCL 0507 Research and Evaluation for Counselors 3.PYCL 0570 Ethical, Legal, and Professional Issues for Counselors 4.SA 0710 Foundations of Substance Abuse/Mental Health Counseling in Community Settings During the formal review for matriculation, the students' academic, behavioral, interpersonal, and professional performance in the four designated courses listed above will be examined. Students need a grade point average of 3.0 or above in the four designated courses to be matriculated. Students who receive two grades below a B minus (B- ) or a grade of F in any of the four designated courses will not be matriculated and will be withdraw n from graduate study. 79 Prior to the formal matriculation review, should a student receive a second grade below B minus (B- ) or a grade of F, the student will automatically be withdrawn from graduate study. Students with a grade point average greater than 2.5 but less than 3.0 for the four designated courses will be maintained in a non-matriculated status. No more than four a dditional courses may be taken without achieving an overall grade point average of 3.0. Under no circumstances will students who achieve a grade point average of 2.5 or below in the four designated courses be permitted to take graduate level courses in a College of Psychology pr ogram. ACADEMIC STANDING (FOLLOWING MATRICULATION) The grading policy for all graduate programs in the College of Psychology requires students to maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0. In addition, other minimum requirements are in existence. Failure to meet these requirem ents will result either in academic probation or dismissal as detailed below. Probation Academic probation will occur automatically when any of the following conditions exist: 1.The cu mulative grade point average falls below 3.0. 2.A grade of F is received. 3.Three concurrent incompletes (I) appear on the transcript. The student, the master's program administration, and the Department Chair will be notified in writing of the student 's probationary status. A student is allowed one year (two full semesters, excluding summer sessions and leaves of absence) to remove probationary status. Academic probation may affect the student's financial aid status. Dismissal Automatic dismissal from any Counseling program in the College of Psychology will occur when any of the following conditions exist: 1.Academic probation extends beyond one year. 2.More than 2 grades below B minus (B- ) are received. 3.Two grades of F are received. ACADEMIC STANDING (NON-DEGREE SEEKING STUDENTS) Non- Degree Seeking students will be held to the same standards in coursework as degree seeking students. Students will be notified to contact a Program Coordinator should they receive a first grade below B minus (B-). Should a non-degree seeking student receive a second grade below B minus (B -) or a grade of F, the student will aut omatically be withdrawn from graduate studies and must wait one year (three academic terms) to reapply . SUBSTANCE ABUSE COUNSELING PRACTICUM REQUIREMENTS Practicum is conceived to be that phase of the master's in counseling program in which a counselor trainee is able to crystallize his or her educational experiences by translating theoretical constructs into practice. This type of supervis ed practice in counseling is generally viewed as an experience that assists the prospective counselor to function within a clinical setting. It serves as a bridge between the theoretical and the real. It is the first opportunity for the counselor trainee to apply what he or she has learned from the 80 more didactic portion of the counseling progra m. Practicum experiences are designed to provide students with a sequential, supervised field experience in an appropriate clinical setting. Students will be required to complete the designated clinical training (field) experiences in their concentration. If more than one clinical training experience is required in a concentration, students are required to complete the practicum in continuous semesters. Students should be aware that some clinical training sites require evenings and weekends as well as dayt ime hours. Students are also expected to meet all clinical obligations during holidays and academic session breaks. If the student elects to intern more than the required hours per week, it should be discussed during the initial interview with the site. In addition, the student is required to attend the regularly scheduled class meetings. Students may elect to complete additional hours as required for licensure or certification in their state. Students eligible to begin practicum will complete and submit a practicum form to initiate the placement process. Students who submit an application to start the practicum will have completed the prerequisite coursework required prior to starting practicum. The application and d eadline dates are published in the S tudent Center in Canvas. It is important that students list the correct address for placement as the application is routed to the designated Practicum Coordinator for that area. It is advised that students who reside outside of the South Florida area apply several months before the deadline date. Students must resubmit an application if there is a delay to a subsequent term . Students will be notified by the program office of their approval or rejection to begin practicum. Those students approved to begin p racticum will be provided with instructions regarding application for site approval and placement several months in advance of the term start . If a student is requesting placement outside of Florida or not near an NSU regional campus, the student is respon sible for providing information on appropriate agencies in their local or surrounding areas. The student cannot complete his or her practicum experience in a private practice. If the student would like to do his or her practicum at the same site where he or she is employed, it must be completed in a different department/unit, must involve completely different duties, and must be supervised by a qualified professional unrelated to his or her present position. The student must receive permission from the pro gram coordinator before requesting a placement in the place of his or her employment. An NSU representative will contact the agency on behalf of the student. While many students can complete the requirement while working, they should be prepared to make w hatever arrangements are necessary to complete this requirement including a leave of absence, adjustment of the work schedule, etc. Practicum and internship time must not be compensated. Please note that placements cannot be made in the state of New York or outside of the United States or its Territories. Substance Abuse Counseling (SAC) Practicum One semester of practicum is required. The practicum spans a 15 -week semester. The stud ent will spend a minimum of 160 hours (approx. 11 hrs/week) with a minimum of 75 hours of direct client contact in a community agency setting and participate in a practicum seminar class. Students may elect to take an additional practicum to gain more expe rience and to satisfy certification requirements. Substance Abuse Counseling and Education (SACE) Practicum Three consecutive semesters of practicum are required to afford students the opportunity of working with a variety of client populations over tim e. Each practicum spans a 15 -week semester, on average . The student will spend a minimum of 160 hours (approx. 11 hrs/week) with a minimum of 75 hours of direct client in a community agency setting and participate in a practicum seminar class each semester . Some states may require more practicum hours than required by Nova Southeastern University for licensure/certification. Students wishing to meet their respective state requirements for practicum 81 may increase hours during the regular scheduled practicum or add additional practicum courses to meet state requirements. It is the student's responsibility to check your respective state or local statutes and requirements for supervised practicum experiences in your selected discipline. Students are responsible for the cost of their own fingerprinting and background checks for practicum and internships. For online students, practicum and internship schedules are a departure from the asynchronous format. Students will be required to register for a section and be available for the live, synchronous class via Canvas during the posted class meeting times. Sections meet during the week at varying times, as listed in Self-Service Banner/ WebSTAR. ***Immediate placement at a practicum site may not be guaranteed*** Substance Abuse Counseling (SAC) Practicum Prerequisites To be eligible for SA 0770 Substance Abuse Counseling Practicum I, students must have completed the following prerequisite courses: PYCL 0502 Counseling Theories and Practice PYCL 0507 Research and Program Evaluation PYCL 0570 Legal, Ethical and Professional Issues for Counselors ** PYCL 0584 Diagnosis and Tr eatment of Adult Psychopathology PYCL Substance Abuse SA of Illicit and Licit Drugs * *SA 0740 must be completed with a grade of B minus (B- ) or better ** HIPAA training is required as part of PYCL 0570.

The University is not required to provide alternative sites for clinical practicums or internships should students be placed at a site that requires COVID - 19 or other immunizations. Students' failure to comply with the immunization req uirements for practicum or internship sites may result in the delay of program completion and/or the inability to satisfy the graduation requirements. Further practicum instructions will be provided to students prior to practicum registration. 82 COMPETENCY ATTAINMENT As part of a systematic assessment of each Substance Abuse Counseling student's progress t hroughout the program, faculty will examine student learning in relation to demonstration of a combination of knowledge and skill s, as well as professional dispositions. Competency -based assessments, in the form of Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) , are embedded in the Substance Abuse Counseling coursework . Students who do not meet the required competency will be required to remedi ate the competency in order to receive a passing grade for that particular course. The instructor will assign a plan for remediating the KPI assessment, and the student is responsible for completing the tasks outlined in the remediation plan. Detailed assignment information and associated grading rubrics are located in the designated course syllabi. SUBSTANCE ABUSE COUNSELING LICENSURE AND CERTIFICATION A degree conferred by any College of Psychology program, may not automatically mean (1) acceptance of the program curricula by a given state for the purpose of professional licensure or certification; (2) acceptance of the program curricula for the purpose of any nongovernmental certification; or (3) satisfaction of an employer's preconditions/qualifications for employment. Students are responsible for verifying periodically their individual eligibility for licensure, certification, internship, and emplo yment through careful review of the applicable requirements of specific states, provinces, agencies and employers, as such requirements are subject to change without notice.

If the student would like to participate in fieldwork at the same site where he or she is employed, it must be completed in a different department/unit, must involve completely different duties, and must be supervised by a qualified professional unrelated to his or her present position. The student must provide documentation supporting his/her request . Should the request be granted, a na NSU representative will contact the agency on behalf of the student. While many students can complete the requirement while working, they should be prepared to make whatever arrang ements are necessary to complete this requirement including a leave of absence, adjustment of the work schedule, etc. Fieldwork must not be compensated. Applied Behavior Analysis Fieldwork Three semesters of fieldwork are offered as electives to help students gain clinical training experience under the supervision of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst. Students will work closely with the program administrator to identify and secure a fieldwork placement. Students wil l be provided with a list of approved fieldwork sites, and they will submit a rank order of training sites that they are interested attending. Students may also identify possible fieldwork sites for review and approval for a fieldwork placement. The clini cal training coordinator will contact the site and determine what types of support and supervision will be needed and secure affiliation agreements with the fieldwork site. In order to be approved to begin fieldwork training, students will be required to i nterview with the site of interest and receive a formal invitation to receive supervised training (as per the agreed upon affiliation agreement) at the site. The student must successfully complete all prerequisite coursework. In addition, students will exe cute a supervision agreement with both their onsite supervisor and their faculty supervisor before starting to accrue experience hours. Lastly, students will need to successfully complete NSU's HIPAA training and receive background screening clearance. Students will complete 25 hours per week of clinical training during fieldwork. Students may choose to complete supervision privately through their place of employment or through contracting with a local BCBA. If a student chooses this option, the student will coordinate his or her own experience independent of the university. For more information regarding specific requirements for certification please consult the BACB at www.bacb.com . Some states may mandate additional hours than required by Nova Southeastern University for licensure. Students wishing to meet their respective state training requirements may increase clinical training hours (no more than 130 per month ) during the regular ly scheduled fieldwork course. It is the student's responsibility to review and understand respective state or local statutes and requirements for supervised fieldwork experiences in their selected discipline. 92 Please be advised that most sites require a student to undergo a background screening that may include, but not be limited to, fingerprinting and/or drug testing. Some sites may require additional documentation such as proof of immunizations (including but not limited to COVID -19 vaccination), health screenings, etc. Students are expected to comply with agency procedures and timelines including incurring the cost of possible fees. The University is not required to provide alternative sites for field work should students be placed at a site that requires COVID -19 or other immunizations. Students' failure to comply with the immunization requirements for practicum or internship sites may result in the delay of program completion and/or the inability to satisfy the graduation requirements. Fieldwork schedules are a departure from the asynchronous format. Students will be required to register for a section and be available for the live, synchronous class via Canvas during the posted class meeting times. Sections meet during the week at varying times, as listed in Self-Service Banner/ WebSTAR. ***Please note placement at a fieldwork site is not guaranteed*** Applied Behavior Analysis Fieldwork Prerequisites 1.ABA 0711 and ABA 0712 Principles and Concepts of Applied Behavior Analysis I and II (must be completed with a grade of B or better 2.HIPAA training (required as part of PYCL 0570 ; a certificate will be issued to the student upon completion.)

COMPETENCY ATTAINMENT As part of a systematic assessment of each ABA student's progress throughout the program, faculty will examine student learning in relation to demonstration of a combination of knowledge and skills, as well as professional dispositions. Competency -based assessments, in the form of Key Performance Indicators (KPI's), are embedded in the ABA coursework. Students who do not meet the required competency will be required to remediate the competency in order to receive a passing grade for that particular course. The instructor will assign a plan for remediating the KPI assessment, and the student is responsible for completing the tasks outlined in the remediation plan. Detailed assignment information and associated grading rubrics are located in the designated cou rse syllabi. Fieldwork is a time for students to practice and build on their clinical skills. If by the end of the semester, the student has not demonstrated proficiency in the use of the basic ABA skills, the student will receive an appropriate grade r eduction. Students must earn a grade of B or higher in all fieldwork courses. Students may be referred to professional standing if there are concerns regarding his/her level of competency. APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS LICENSURE AND CERTIFICATION A degree conferred by any College of Psychology program, may not automatically mean (1) acceptance of the program curricula by a given state for the purpose of professional licensure or 93 certification; (2) acceptance of the program curricula for the purpose of any nongovernmental certification; or (3) satisfaction of an employer's preconditions/qualifications for employment. Students are responsible for verifying periodically their individual eligibility for licensure, certification, intern ship, and employment through careful review of the applicable requirements of specific states, provinces, agencies and employers, as such requirements are subject to change without notice. Nova Southeastern University, College of Psychology, Master of Sc ience in Counseling, Applied Behavior Analysis Concentration has been verified by The Association of Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) as meeting the coursework requirements for eligibility to take the Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) examinati on. Certification as a BCBA is necessary in order to practice Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) in the United States. Currently, only 36 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, Wyoming) require professional licensure in addition to certification as a BCBA to practice within those respective states. Professional licensure is not currently required in the following states: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, M aine, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and West Virginia. Standards for professional licensure can vary drastically by state. These requirements can change frequently and often without notice.
