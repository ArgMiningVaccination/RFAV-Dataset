Pullulan is a natural extracellular polysaccharide excreted by the yeast-like fungus Aureobasidium pullulans. It is not genetically modified and it is commercially produced by a non-pathogenic and non-toxigenic strain of the organism using a liquid starch syrup as the fermentation substrate. Pullulan can be made into very thin films with high tensile strength and stability over a range of temperatures, making it an ideal material to be used in the manufacture of empty capsules for the purpose of encapsulating dietary supplements or as a coating for dietary supplement tablets. Encapsulated vegetarian dietary supplements certified under USDA's National Organic Program (NOP) rely on the use of Pullulan as the primary ingredient in the capsule. For dietary supplements, the capsule is considered an \"ingredient\" and must either be \"certified organic,\" or comprised of ingredients compliant with the National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances. Since the early 2000s, accredited certifying agents have classified Pullulan as \"agricultural\" and allowed its use only in encapsulated dietary supplements certified to the \"made with\" product category. This allowance has significantly contributed to the growth of NOP certified dietary supplements. Currently, certified organic Pullulan is commercially unavailable in North America and there are no other NOP compliant vegetarian options available. Gelatin capsules, while allowed under NOP, present consumer acceptance and GMO challenges. 1 The Organic Trade Association (OTA) is the membership-based business association for organic agriculture and products in North America. OTA is the leading voice for the organic trade in the United States, representing over 9,500 organic businesses across 50 states. Our members include growers, shippers, processors, certifiers, farmers' associations, distributors, importers, exporters, consultants, retailers and others. OTA's mission is to promote and protect organic with a unifying voice that serves and engages its diverse members from farm to marketplace. Headquarters - The Hall of the States, 444 N. Capitol St. NW, Suite 445-A, Washington, D.C., 20001 (202) 403-8513 Member Services - 28 Vernon St., Suite 413, Brattleboro VT 05301 (202) 403-8630 www.OTA.com 2 In late 2016, NOP released a guidance document (NOP 5033) on the Classification of Materials. This document assists the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB), accredited certifying agents, and the organic industry in making 'Agricultural' vs. 'Non-agricultural' and 'Synthetic' vs. 'Non-synthetic' determinations. Given the information contained in the NOP guidance document, accredited certifying agents are now in general agreement that Pullulan should be classified as a \"non-agricultural, non-synthetic\" substance and accordingly must appear on the National List at \u00a7205.605 to be allowed in NOP certified products. In response to this new interpretation, we are requesting that Pullulan be added to the National List so that it may continue to be allowed as an ingredient in capsules for dietary supplements labeled \"made with organic (specified ingredients or food group(s)).\" Without its continued allowance, and without an alternative option, we estimate the economic impact to the organic dietary supplement sector would be over $825 million. Please note that we are intentionally limiting the allowance of non-organic Pullulan to dietary supplements certified to the \"made with\" category. Any encapsulated dietary supplement sold or labeled as \"certified organic (95%+) will need to use certified organic Pullulan. Although organic Pullulan based capsules are not commercially available in North America, development is underway and they should be available in the future. In summary, adding Pullulan to the National List will: Quickly address a new interpretation made by several accredited certifying agents in response to NOP's Classification of Materials Guidance (NOP 5033); Prevent widespread disruption and economically significant damage to the organic supplements sector; Bring the allowance of non-organic Pullulan under strict review of NOSB and the National List Sunset process; Support the commercial development of certified organic Pullulan. Thank you for your assistance in putting this petition before NOSB. If you need any additional information, please contact me via e-mail or telephone: gwyard@ota.com or (503) 798-3294. Respectfully submitted, Gwendolyn Wyard Vice President, Regulatory and Technical Affairs Organic Trade Association cc: Laura Batcha Executive Director/CEO Organic Trade Association Page 1 of 15 Pullulan Petition 1/31/2018 Item A This petition seeks inclusion of Pullulan as an ingredient in tablets and capsules for dietary supplements labeled in the \"made with organic (specified ingredients or food group(s))\" category on the National List at \u00a7205.605(a). Item B 1. Substance Name. Common Name: Pullulan polysaccharide excreted Aureobasidium pullulans (formerly known as Pullularia pullulans). It is not genetically modified and it is commercially produced by a non-\u00adpathogenic and non-\u00adtoxigenic strain of the organism using a liquid starch syrup as the fermentation substrate. Pullulan is a linear glucan consisting of repeating units of maltotriose joined by -\u00adD-\u00ad(16) linkages. 2. Petitioner and Manufacturer Information. Petitioner: Organic Trade Association 444 N. Capitol St. NW, Suite 445A Washington, DC 20001 Contact Person: Gwendolyn Wyard Title: of 15 3. Intended or Current Use. Pullulan can be made into very thin films with high tensile strength and stability over a range of temperatures. Pullulan films have a low oxygen permeability, are oil and grease resistant and dissolve rapidly in water. These films may be shaped using rapid evaporation of water, compression molding or extrusion at high temperatures, making it an ideal material to be used in the manufacture of empty capsules for the purpose of encapsulating dietary supplements or as a coating for dietary supplement tablets. Non-\u00adanimal capsules and tablets are suitable for a variety of cultural and dietary requirements, including those of vegetarians, diabetics, and people with restricted diets for health or religious reasons. The danger from animal plagues such as mad cow disease and foot-\u00adand-\u00admouth disease raised concerns about raw materials of animal origin being used in foods. Questions surrounding the GMO status of animal feed have also been pervasive in the natural products industry. The requests for raw materials of plant origin for use in foods, cosmetics and the medical fields have been increasing. Pullulan is produced from starch and, therefore, demand for pullulan capsules has grown significantly, as evidenced by the more than 42% growth in sales over the past two years. Pullulan is also currently used in a wide range of other applications. These include as coatings and binders for pharmaceutical tablets, as a thickener in sauces, jams, jellies and confections, postharvest coatings for fruits and nuts, cosmetics, and oral hygiene products. Because of its biocompatible properties, pullulan is also the base material used in a host of biomedical applications. 4. Intended Activities and Application Rate. For the purposes of this petition, we will focus on pullulan's primary use in the manufacture of dietary supplements as described above. Hard capsules are manufactured by dipping stainless steel pins into a pullulan solution (usually 5-\u00ad10%), then dried. The amount of pullulan in the final capsule is approximately 80% or greater, with water being the next highest constituent. Pullulan coatings and films may be as thin as 0.01 mm. In the Pullulan GRAS Notification submitted by Hayashibara International Inc. to FDA in 2002 (See Appendix A), it was estimated that the daily intake of pullulan as a capsule would be approximately 0.69g per day. 5. Manufacturing Process. Hayashibara Company Limited in Okayama, Japan, began commercial production of pullulan in 1976. Pullulan production was a natural outgrowth of Hayashibara's original business of starch syrup production, founded in 1883. Hayashibara adjusted the growth conditions of a specified strain of Aureobasidium pullulans to produce pullulan products of particular molecular weights and Page 3 of 15 specifications. These include food grade and pharmaceutical grade products with mean molecular weight ranging from 100,000 to 200,000. Pullulan films were commercialized by Hayashibara in 1982. Today, this company is still the principal commercial producer of pullulan. The A. pullulans strain that is used is non-\u00adtoxigenic and has been selected by traditional techniques, i.e., the strain is not the product of genetic modification using recombinant technologies. The production strain has a high yield of pullulan and low production of black pigment (melanin). The manufacturing process is conducted under conditions of good manufacturing practices and uses raw materials and processing aids that comply with food grade specifications. Pullulan is produced by mesophilic (22-\u00ad30\u00baC) fermentation of A. pullulans in a suitable starch syrup. During fermentation, pullulan is secreted extracellularly by the organism into the culture medium from which it is then recovered and purified. At the completion of fermentation, the resulting broth consists of microbial cells and cellular debris, as well as the extracellular metabolites produced and excreted during the fermentation (e.g., pullulan). The microbial cells and cellular debris are first removed by microfiltration. The cell-\u00adfree filtrate is then heat-\u00adsterilized. The filtrate is then purified by a deionization process using an ion exchange resin to remove the salt and protein contaminants1. The deionized solution is concentrated to a solids content of about 12%, treated with activated carbon to remove pigments and other impurities by adsorption, and filtered using diatomaceous earth as a filter aid. The filtrate is concentrated by evaporation to a solids content of about 30% and dried in a drum dryer. The dried pullulan is pulverized to a specified particle size and packed in sterilized polyethylene bags. The final pullulan product is tested in accordance with global compendia test methods and specifications as referenced in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia, the European Pharmacopoeia, the United States Pharmacopeia and the National Formulary, and the Food Chemicals Codex. 1 Please note that some manufacturing descriptions found in research articles indicate that an additional step may be utilized prior to deionization using ion-\u00adexchange chromatography in which the filtrate is treated with an organic solvent (e.g., alcohol) to precipitate the pullulan. However, we have confirmed that Hayashibara Company's manufacturing process does not use this step and no organic solvents are used during their production. Page 4 of 15 Page 5 of 15 6. Ancillary Substances. There are no ancillary substances such as carriers, emulsifiers or stabilizers in the final pullulan product. 7. Previous Reviews. National Organic Standards Board In 2004, a petition to add pullulan to \u00a7205.605 of the National List was submitted to the National Organic Standards Board by Capsugel Division of Pfizer Inc. NOSB subsequently put this petition on hold and no final recommendation for this substance was ever made. At this time, it is unclear why the petition was put on hold as we could not find any references to it in the NOSB meeting minutes, and Handling Subcommittee meeting notes for this time period are not available on the USDA NOP website. However, prior to the finalization of Guidance document NOP 5033\u2014Classification of Materials, non-\u00adorganic pullulan was commonly classified as an agricultural ingredient and was therefore allowed in products labeled \"made with organic.\" Due to this interpretation, many organic supplements were developed to use non-\u00adorganic pullulan capsules and currently are being marketed in the \"made with organic\" category. After NOP 5033 was finalized, some certifiers have reclassified pullulan as a non-\u00adagricultural ingredient based upon the decision tree published in NOP 5033-\u00ad2. This has created a challenge for both certifiers and manufacturers as there is not a clear consensus regarding the classification of this material and whether existing products using it should continue to be allowed in the \"made with organic\" category. Recently, the Accredited Certifiers Association created a work group to address this topic. While not all in the industry agree that pullulan should be considered non-\u00adagricultural, this work group strongly agreed on this classification. As such, they have suggested that since the National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances currently does not provide an allowance for pullulan at \u00a7205.605, steps should be taken to phase out existing formulations containing this material. However, they have agreed that with the submission of this petition, certifiers should suspend the phase-\u00adout efforts until such time that the NOSB reaches a decision about whether pullulan should be added to the National List. The 2018 forecast for pullulan capsules, the only capsule that is currently allowed in the \"made with organic\" category, is approximately 2.5 billion capsules. A conservative estimate of $10 per bottle of 30 would represent an economic value of over $825 million. The addition of pullulan at \u00a7205.605 will be critical to maintain the status of these products and avoid consumer confusion. Notably, there is no other alternative for a vegetarian, organic-\u00adcompliant capsule and companies would be forced to either lose organic certification without changing their formula, or switch to a gelatin capsule. World Health Organization In the WHO Food Additives Series: 56 - Safety evaluation of certain food additives prepared by the 65th meeting of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), the Committee concluded Page 6 of 15 that the use of pullulan as a food additive and the studies provided to the Committee on its safety provided sufficient information to allocate an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) 'not specified'2 (See Appendix B). European Food Safety Authority In the European Food Safety Authority's (EFSA) Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food on a request from the Commission related to Pullulan PI-\u00ad20 for use as a new food additive (EFSA-\u00adQ-\u00ad2003-\u00ad138), adopted 13 July 2004 (See Appendix C), the following conclusion was made: \"...On the basis that pullulan is similar to other poorly digested carbohydrates and that the current proposed usage levels are below the level likely to cause abdominal fullness, the Panel consider that the expected intakes of pullulan would not present any concern when used as a food additive in the proposed uses and at the usage levels requested...\" National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme In Australia, the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS) is administered by the Department of Health and Ageing, and conducts the risk assessment for public health and occupational health and safety. The assessment of environmental risk is conducted by the Department of the Environment and Water Resources. Hayashibara International applied to NICNAS for pullulan so that it could be used in the manufacture of cosmetic products such as shampoos, creams and lotions, styling products (as an impermeable, antistatic solid film) and toothpastes (See Appendix D). In the May 2007 Full Public Report on Pullulan prepared by NICNAS, the following conclusions were made: 8.1 Level of Concern for Occupational Health and Safety There is Low Concern to occupational health and safety under the conditions of the occupational settings described. 8.2 Level of Concern for Public Health There is No Significant Concern to public health when used in the proposed manner. 8.3 Level of Concern for the Environment The polymer is not considered to pose a risk to the environment based on its reported use pattern. 2 ADI 'not specified' is used to refer to a food substance of very low toxicity which, on the basis of the available data (chemical, biochemical, toxicological and other) and the total dietary intake of the substance arising from its use at the levels necessary to achieve the desired effects and from its acceptable background levels in food, does not, in the opinion of the Committee, represent a hazard to health. For that reason, and for the reasons stated in the individual evaluations, the establishment of an ADI express in numerical form is not deemed necessary. An additive that meets this criterion must be used within the bounds of good manufacturing practice, i.e., it should be technologically efficacious and should be used at the lowest level necessary to achieve its effect, it should not conceal food of inferior quality or adulterated food, and it should not create a nutritional imbalance. Page 7 of 15 8. Regulatory Authority. In the USA, the FDA received the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) notification of pullulan in March 2002. The Agency Response Letter issued in August 2002 noted that FDA had no question about the GRAS status of pullulan and designated it as GRAS in Notice GRN 000099 (See Appendix A). In the U.S. EPA Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Chemical Substance Inventory, the entry for pullulan notes that it is exempt from reporting. In Japan, pullulan was approved as food ingredient and additive with no limitation of use in Serial #373, April 16, 1999. It appears in the List of Existing Food Additives published on 16 April 1996 (Ministry of Health and Welfare Notification No. 120). The specifications are described in the Specifications and Standards for Foods, Food Additives, etc. (Ministry of Health and Welfare Notification No. 370 issued in 1959 revised on 30 March 2006) and listed in Japan's Specifications and Standards of Food Additives, 8th edition on 30 August 2006. It is listed in the Japanese Standards of Quasi-\u00adDrug Ingredients 2006 (Notification No. 0331030 issued by the Director of the Pharmaceutical and Food Safety Bureau, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare). Pullulan and Pullulan Capsules are also listed in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia, 17th edition, published on April 1, 2016. In the EU, pullulan has the European Community (EC) number 232-\u00ad945-\u00ad1 and the E number E1204. Commission Regulation No. EU 231/2012 outlines specifications for pullulan as a food additive for use in capsules, tablets and films under directive 2006/52/EC. In addition, pullulan is permitted in Russia, China, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and Mercosur of South America (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) (Chaen, 2010). The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) evaluated the safety of pullulan at the 65th meeting (See Appendix B) and announced the acceptable daily intake (ADI) as 'not specified'. The International Numbering System (INS) number 1204 was assigned to pullulan. Additionally, pullulan is approved for use in Halal and Kosher foods. 9. Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Number and Product Labels. CAS Number: 9057-\u00ad02-\u00ad7 INS Number: 1204 See Appendix E for Specification Sheet. 10. Physical and Chemical Properties. Pullulan is a white to slightly yellowish powder that is tasteless and odorless. It is non-\u00adtoxic, non-\u00admutagenic, non-\u00adcarcinogenic and non-\u00adhygroscopic. It has physical properties that are useful in a wide Page 8 of 15 variety of applications, most importantly in food and nutritional supplements. Its film-\u00adforming properties are excellent for creating hard capsules and tablet coatings for supplements. The oxygen resistance of pullulan films is suitable for the protection of readily oxidized fats and vitamins contained within the capsules. Pullulan also provides a better odor barrier of pungent ingredients or compounds versus other capsule types. Pullulan films also inhibits fungal growth. When dissolved in water, pullulan is highly adhesive and has remarkable binding properties, making it useful for binding and agglomerating powders. Pullulan is capable of being compressed into tablets that release a suspended or solubilized substance over time. Pullulan is easily dissolved in hot or cold water to form a stable, viscous solution that does not gel. It is not hygroscopic but can retain 10-\u00ad15% moisture content without becoming sticky. It is stable over a broad range of pH conditions when in solution. It is also relatively stable to heat. (a) Chemical interactions with other substances, especially substances used in organic production: Because it does not contain any chemically reactive groups, pullulan is not expected to interact chemically with other substances. (b) Toxicity and environmental persistence: Aureobasidium pullulans, the organism that produces pullulan, is a common mold that is ubiquitous in nature. It is widely spread in all ecological niches including forest soil, fresh and sea water, plant and animal tissues, etc. (Cheng et al., 2011). It is non-\u00adpathogenic and non-\u00adtoxigenic. Pullulan itself is also non-\u00adtoxic. It is a fully biodegradable polysaccharide and does not persist in the environment. In 2005, Dr. Timothy D. Leathers3 addressed how some enzymes produced by various microorganisms break down pullulan: Pullulan is attacked by glucoamylases from numerous fungi, including species of Aspergillus, Candida, Rhizopus, Sclerotium et al, and et al, 1985; Kelkar and Deshpande, 1993). Glucoamylases are progressive exo-\u00adacting enzymes that attack from the non-\u00adreducing end to produce glucose. Aureobasidium also has been reported to produce glucoamylases, and it has been postulated that these enzymes may be involved in pullulan degradation in late cultures (Saha et al, 1993; West and Strohfus, 1996a). 3 Leathers, T. D. 2005. Pullulan. Polysaccharides. Biopolymers Online. 6. (Published online 15 January 2005) Page 9 of 15 Bender and Wallenfels (1961) first described a pullulanase Aerobacter or Enterobacter aerobenes) with specificity for the internal -\u00ad(16) linkages of pullulan. This enzyme converts pullulan almost quantitatively to maltotriose, which is readily broken down by amylases (Catley, 1978). Because pullulanases also recognize -\u00ad(16) branch linkages in amylopectin, they sometimes have been referred to as \"bacterial isoamylases\". However, isoamylases (EC 3.2.1.68) lacking pullulanase activity are widely produced by many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals (Manners, 1971). Many plants produce both isoamylases and pullulanases as separate activities. (c) Environmental impacts from its use and/or manufacture: There are no known negative environmental impacts resulting from the use or disposal of pullulan. It is a biodegradable polysaccharide that is easily metabolized by many microorganisms found in nature to give carbon dioxide and water. Because of its unique qualities, pullulan may be used as a base material in novel flocculants that have been developed for the removal of contaminants in wastewaters (Ghimici & Constantin, 2011) resulting in a beneficial impact on aquatic environments. (d) Effects on human health: Pullulan provides few calories and acts as a soluble dietary fiber. In vivo and in vitro metabolism and digestion studies in rats and humans demonstrated that pullulan is minimally hydrolyzed by salivary amylase (Oku et al.\u00b81979; Okada et al. 1990; Yoneyama et al., 1990). Enzymes of the small intestine also hydrolyze pullulan producing minimal amounts of glucose. A large proportion of the dietary pullulan reaches the large intestine and functions as a prebiotic, selectively promoting the growth of beneficial bifidobacterial (Mitsuhashi et al., 1990; Sugawa-\u00adKatayama et al., 1994; Yoneyama et al., 1990). Wolf et al. (2003) reported that a food grade pullulan is slowly digested in humans, and that half of administered pullulan is absorbed as blood sugar. Pullulan has been used in Japan in various forms for more than 30 years without reported adverse effects. In addition, pullulan intakes of 10 g/day were well tolerated by human volunteers taking part in a 14-\u00adday metabolism study (Yoneyama et al., 1990). The only complaint, which was reported by a few of the participants, was post-\u00adintake abdominal fullness. There were no significant changes in the blood biochemistry parameters of the volunteers fed pullulan. In an oral lethality study, pullulan administered at doses of up to approximately 15 g/kg body weight did not cause any mortalities in mice (Kimoto et al., 1997). The yeast from which pullulan is obtained, Aureobasidium pullulans, also was demonstrated to be relatively innocuous, as indicated by oral LD50 values of >24 and >40 g/kg body weight in male adult mice, and male and female Sprague-\u00adDawley rats, respectively (Kimoto et al., 1997). Page 10 of 15 Results of longer-\u00adterm repeated dose studies also demonstrated pullulan to be of low oral toxicity (Oku et al., 1979; Kimoto et al., 1997). No toxicologically significant effects were observed in rats fed diets containing as much as 40% pullulan for 9 weeks. Observations of decreased body weight and digestive tract hypertrophy in rats fed high pullulan diets (20-\u00ad40%) can be attributed to the effect of replacing the normal nutrient content of food with indigestible carbohydrate (LRSO, 1975). The NO(A)EL, or no observed adverse effect level, for pullulan, based on a 63-\u00adweek dietary study in rats, was estimated to be 5,000 mg/kg body weight/day (Kimoto et al., 1997). The only treatment-\u00adrelated change noted was an increase in cercal weight in female rats receiving 5,080 mg/kg body weight/day of pullulan (about 10% of diet). Increased cercal weight is a common physiological response to consumption of poorly digested polysaccharides (El-\u00adHarith et al., 1976; Oku et al., 1979; MacKenzie et al., 1986; Olivier et al., 1991). Mutagenicity studies in strains of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, using the plate incorporation method, demonstrated that pullulan was not mutagenic either with or without metabolic activation (Kuroda et al., 1985; Kimoto et al., 1997). Pullulan also was not found to be clastogenic in a chromosome aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells (Ishidate et al., 1985). In November 2016, the FDA Office of Nutrition and Food Labeling Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition published the Science Review of Isolated and Synthetic Non-\u00adDigestible Carbohydrates. This document provided a summary of its review of the scientific evidence that it identified for certain isolated or synthetic non-\u00addigestible carbohydrates that are not listed as a dietary fiber in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i). Following is the entry for Pullulan from this document: Background Pullulan is a naturally occurring exopolysaccharide produced by Aureobasidium pullulans, a ubiquitous fungus. Pullulan is a glucan consisting predominantly of repeating maltotriose units, which consist of three 1,4-\u00adlinked glucose molecules, linked by -\u00ad1,6-\u00adglycosidic bonds (Catley, 1971). Occasionally, maltotetraose units consisting of four 1,4-\u00adlinked glucose molecules are distributed randomly in the polymer (Catley, 1986). Pullulan is a soluble fiber with film-\u00adforming properties that is used as a matrix to hold flavors (breath fresheners), as a coating for foods to extend shelf-\u00adlife, and as a substitute for gelatin in capsules used for dietary supplements (FDA, 2002). Blood Cholesterol Levels We identified one study that evaluated the effect of pullulan consumption on blood cholesterol levels (Stewart et al., 2010). Scientific conclusions could not be drawn from this study because it was not conducted long enough to evaluate the effect of pullulan on fasting blood cholesterol levels. Page 11 of 15 Blood Glucose Levels We identified five studies that evaluated the effect of pullulan consumption on blood glucose levels. Scientific conclusions could not be drawn from one of these studies (Klosterbuer et al., 2012) because a mixture of non-\u00addigestible carbohydrate, including pullulan, was used in the study and the physiological effect of pullulan per se therefore could not be evaluated. Wolf et al. (2003) Twenty-\u00adeight non-\u00addiabetic healthy U.S. adults consumed 50 g of pullulan or maltodextrin (control) in a randomized, double-\u00adblinded, cross-\u00adover study in which subjects participated in two separate three-\u00adhour meal tolerance tests. The incremental peak blood glucose concentration was reduced by 54% when subjects consumed pullulan compared to the control group (4.24 \u00b10.35 vs. 1.97 \u00b1 0.10 mmol/L) (P < 0.001). At 180 minutes, the blood glucose concentration was higher when subjects consumed pullulan, supporting the hypothesis that pullulan is digested slowly (P < 0.05). The positive incremental area under the curve was significantly reduced by 50% when subjects consumed pullulan compared with the control (P < 0.001). Kendall et al. (2008) Twelve healthy Canadian volunteers participated in a randomized, cross-\u00adover study in which they consumed 25 g of glucose in a beverage (control) and seven test beverages that contained 25 g of total carbohydrates. One of the test beverages contained pullulan as the carbohydrate. The measured blood glucose (as well as insulin) area under the curve (mmol \u00d7 min/L) was significantly lower for the study subjects who consumed the pullulan test beverage (8.7 \u00b1 4.1) compared to the control group (103.7 \u00b1 13.7) (P < 0.05). Peters et al. (2011) Thirty-\u00adfive healthy subjects from the Netherlands participated in a randomized, double-\u00adblind, cross-\u00adover study in which they were provided with a test beverage containing 15 g of long-\u00adchain pullulan (LCP), medium-\u00adchain pullulan (MCP), or maltodextrin (control). Blood samples were collected from only a subset of the study subjects (n=12). The blood glucose area under the curve for the period of 0 to 150 minutes was significantly higher for LCP and MCP groups compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Laxation/Bowel Function We identified one study that evaluated the effect of pullulan consumption on laxation. Stewart et al. (2010) Page 12 of 15 In a single-\u00adblind, cross-\u00adover study, 20 healthy US subjects consumed 12 g/day of one of five non-\u00addigestible carbohydrates including pullulan, or maltodextrin (control) for 14 days. There was no significant difference in the number of recorded stools per day between the pullulan and control diets (P > 0.05). Energy Intake We identified one study that evaluated the effect of pullulan consumption on energy intake (Klosterbuer et al. 2013). Scientific conclusions could not be drawn from this study because a mixture of non-\u00addigestible carbohydrate along with pullulan was provided to the study subjects and the physiological effect of pullulan per se therefore could not be evaluated. To summarize, no adverse effects of toxicological significance have been observed for pullulan in a variety of assays. Pullulan is structurally similar to starch and would not be expected (based on estimated consumption data) to introduce a substantial increase in the level of alpha-\u00ad1,6 linked glucose, a minor constituent of normal starches, into the diet. Lastly, the safety of pullulan is supported by over 30 years of Human consumption in Japan and by the absence of adverse events in human trials at doses of 10 g pullulan/day to evaluate metabolism and digestion. (e) Effects on soil organisms, crops, or livestock: Pullulan is a biodegradable polysaccharide that is easily metabolized by many microorganisms naturally found in soil to give carbon dioxide and water. While pullulan is not expected to be used in crop production, it has been used as an ingredient in post-\u00adharvest coating of fruits and vegetables to extend shelf life and maintain quality. Feed supplements for livestock would need to be certified organic, therefore, pullulan capsules would not qualify for this use. However, as a non-\u00adsynthetic material, it could in theory be used for livestock health care. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no livestock health care products in the organic market that use pullulan, but if there were, we would expect the pullulan to act as a soluble dietary fiber as it does in humans. 11. Safety Information. Pullulan is not expected to be hazardous when used under normal conditions. However, because it is a powder, appropriate personal protection should be used when it is being handled to avoid respiratory or eye irritation. See Appendix F for Safety Data Sheet No substance reports for pullulan were found in the National Institute of Environmental Health Studies or National Toxicology Program databases. Page 13 of 15 No Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) reports for pullulan were found in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) database. 12. Research Information. Pullulan has a long history and due to its unique properties, it has been studied for many different applications. In addition to the research information presented in section 10 above that is relevant to food and dietary supplement uses, there is considerable research for its use as a base for: Post-\u00adharvest coatings for fruits and vegetables to preserve food quality Blood plasma substitute / expander Skin, bone, cartilage and smooth muscle cell culture Drug and vaccine delivery Wound healing Post-\u00adoperative tissue adhesion prevention Biodegradable and anti-\u00adfog food packaging Flocculants for water treatment See the Supplemental Bibliography included in Appendix G for additional examples of literature regarding uses for pullulan other than as an ingredient in dietary supplements as further evidence of its history of safe use as a food additive, as a biocompatible base material for medical applications, and other purposes. 13. Petition Justification Statement Encapsulated vegetarian dietary supplement products certified under USDA's National Organic Program (NOP) rely on the use of Pullulan as the primary ingredient in the capsule. For dietary supplements, the capsule is considered an \"ingredient\" and must either be \"certified organic,\" or comprised of ingredients compliant with the National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances. Encapsulation of organic raw materials and active blends is an essential to the handling of dietary supplements because it allows for the delivery of materials without the use of excipients, and without the risk of damaging those materials through tablet compression. It also allows for controlled dosage, which bulk powders do not and the lack of heat used during processing helps preserve the bioavailability of the active compounds. Since the early 2000s, accredited certifying agents have classified Pullulan as \"agricultural\" and allowed its use only in encapsulated dietary supplements certified to the \"made with\" product category. This allowance has significantly contributed to the development of NOP certified encapsulated dietary supplements and the growth of the $1.2 billion organic dietary supplement sector as a whole. In late 2016, NOP released a guidance document (NOP 5033) on the Classification of Materials. This document assists the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB), accredited certifying agents, and the organic industry in making 'Agricultural' vs. 'Non-\u00adagricultural' and 'Synthetic' vs. 'Non-\u00adsynthetic' determinations. Given the information contained in the NOP guidance document, accredited certifying agents are now in general agreement that Pullulan should be classified as a \"non-\u00adagricultural, non-\u00adPage 14 of 15 synthetic\" substance and accordingly must appear on the National List at \u00a7205.605 to be allowed in NOP certified products. In response to this new interpretation, the Organic Trade Association is requesting that Pullulan be added to the National List so that it may continue to be allowed as an essential ingredient in capsules for dietary supplements labeled \"made with organic (specified ingredients or food group(s)).\" Continued allowance is necessary because organic Pullulan is commercially unavailable in North America and there are no other NOP compliant vegetarian options available. We estimate the economic impact to the organic dietary supplement sector would be more than $825 million should Pullulan be no longer allowed. Non-\u00adsynthetic/synthetic substances on the National List, or alternative cultural method that could be used in place of the petitioned synthetic substance: Pullulan is non-\u00adsynthetic As stated earlier, Pullulan is the only non-\u00adsynthetic NOP compliant option available for encapsulated vegetarian dietary supplements certified under USDA's National Organic Program. It also meets the requirements for Kosher and Halal. Pullulan is a natural extracellular polysaccharide excreted by the yeast-\u00adlike fungus Aureobasidium pullulans. It is produced through a naturally occurring biological process (fermentation) and does not undergo a chemical change at any stage of the extraction or purification process. The purified substance is non-\u00adsynthetic. Furthermore, the microorganism is not genetically modified and there are no ancillary substances added. Organic alternatives At this time, organic Pullulan based capsules are not commercially available in North America. A quick Internet search for organic Pullulan will produce results reflecting the availability from Bright Pharma Caps, Inc., JC Bright. However, Capsugel\u00ae is the owner of US patents covering Pullulan capsules. Capsugel\u00ae sued JC Bright for patent infringement and false advertising related to JC Bright's sale of Pullulan capsules. Capsugel\u00ae obtained a consent judgment barring JC Bright from selling infringing organic and non-\u00adorganic capsules. At this time, we are not aware of a legitimate source of Pullulan capsules in the US other than Capsugel\u00ae Due to the fact that Pullulan is made via a fermentation utilizing agricultural source material, the manufacturing of organic Pullulan is possible and development is underway. Capsugel\u00ae is in the process of ramping up scale to meet the demand and the availability of organic Pullulan for the US market should occur in the future. However, in the interim, no other vegetarian option is available. National List alternatives Gelatin-\u00adbased capsules, informally called gel caps or gelcaps, are composed of gelatin manufactured from the collagen of animal skin or bone. Gelatin is listed on \u00a7205.606 of the National List and may be used as an ingredient in gelatin capsules for dietary supplements provided they are non-\u00adGMO and not available in organic form. However, gelatin capsules are animal based and not appropriate for vegetarian products and may cause issues among kosher and halal consumers. Page 15 of 15 Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) based capsules are commonly used as an alternative to gelatin capsules and provide consumers with a vegetarian option. However, HPMC was petitioned to the National List in September 2002 as an ingredient of hard capsules but the recommendation to add the substance failed. NOSB determined that HPMC is manufactured from purified cellulose that they classified as synthetic and the majority concluded that its use is not compatible with organic production. Appendices A.

Pullulan is an extracellular polysaccharide, excreted by the polymorphic fungus Aureobasidium pullulans. The molecule is a linear a-D-glucan comprised of regular repeating trisaccharide units. The trisaccharide units are maltotrioses in which three glucose units are linked through 1,4-glucosidic bonds. Each maltotriose unit is terminally linked to a series of three other maltotrioses through a 1,6-glucosidic bonds creating a long stair-step-type structure. The molecular weight for commercial Pullulan may range from 8,000 to more than 2,000,000 daltons, depending upon the conditions under which the organism is grown. A GRAS Report in support of the safe use of Pullulan in foods was prepared by Hayashibara International Inc. and Lee B. Dexter and Associates. The Report was reviewed by a Panel of Experts qualified by training and experience to assess the safety of food ingredients. The Experts concurred with Hayashibara International Inc.'s determination that Pullulan is safe for general udse in foods. The Panel relied upon the results of numerous animal toxicology studies, a twenty-year history of safe consumption in Japan, the similarity of Pullulan to other GRAS food substances, such as amylopectin, and a large body of published literature. A copy of the Expert Opinion is attached to this notice. HAYASHIBARA GROUP Appendix Ae Page 2 February 12,2002 Dr. Linda Kahl This Notification of a claim for premarket exemption is based on a GRAS determination under proposed g170.36. Hayashibara International Inc. has prepared a Notification document in triplicate, which accompanies this letter. The Company would appreciate notice of the receipt of this document, and looks forward to any comments the agency would care to make on the Notification.

Silncerely, Vice President and General Manager a Hayashibara Company, Ltd. International Inc. January 25,2002 Hayashibara International Inc. GRAS Notification Introduction Pullulan is a natural polysaccharide elaborated extracellularly by the fungal species Aureobasidium pullulans. It is commercially produced by a non-pathogenic and non-toxigenic strain of the organism utilizing corn syrup as the substrate. Pullulan has a linear structure comprised of maltotrioses in which three glucose units are linked through a-I ,4-glucosidic bonds. The maltotrioses are in turn linked to a series of three other maltotrioses through a-l,6-glucosidic bonds creating a long stair-step-type structure (See Section II D). This type of molecular structure, in which a-1,4 and a-I ,6-glucosidic bonds join various chain lengths of glucose is also found in such com'mon food substances as the amylopectin fraction of corn and wheat starch, and in dextrins and maltodextrins. Due to its high molecular weight (50,000-500,000 daltons) and its bond configuration, Pullulan acts as a soluble dietary fiber in the human body. The Hayashibara Company, Ltd. (Hayashibara) of Okayama, Japan developed the production strain of Aureobasidium pullulans, and the method for producing Pullulan more than two decades ago. Modern food processing research has shown that Pullulan may have an expanded role as a food ingredient. 0 _, Hayashibara is providing this Notification document to allow the FDA to evaluate whether the submitted notice provides a sufficient basis for a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) determination for Hayashibara Pullulan. The company believes that the document contains the information required in proposed \u00a7 170.36. The document is being submitted by Hayashibara International Inc., of Westminster, Colorado, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hayashibara Company, Limited. Both companies will be referred to as \"Hayashibara\" in this Notification, unless a specific distinction is necessary. In compliance with 21 CFR 5 170.30, Hayashibara determined that Hayashibara Pullulan could be considered GRAS when used in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices. Hayashibara wishes to voluntarily notify the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) of that determination, and according to proposed \u00a7 170.36, the company is submitting the following GRAS exemption claim. Hayashibara International Inc. has prepared a GRAS Report, which forms the basis for the information found in this Notification. The company commissioned a panel of experts (Expert Panel), qualified by scientific training and experience to assess the safety of food ingredients, to critically evaluate the Pullulan GRAS Report as well as other data and information relevant to the use and safety of this i'ngredient. As the result of various telephone conferences and a meeting held on July 25, 2001, the Expert Panel concurred with the company's determination that ,a 1 Appendix APullulan GRAS Claim Hayashibara International Inc. January 25,2002 0 Hayashibara Pullulan can be considered generally recognized as safe for general use in food. Based on the data and information contained in the Report and the opinion of the Expert Panel (which is attached to this notification), Hayashibara explicitly accepts responsibility for the GRAS determination of Hayashibara Pullulan. Section I. GRAS Exemption Claim Hayashibara International Inc. hereby notifies the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that the use of Hayashibara Pullulan as a food ingredient is exempt from the premarket approval requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, because Hayashibara has determined that such use is GRAS. 1.

Physical Properties of Pullulan Pullulan has various physical properties that can be used for food-associated applications. These properties may be useful in producing ,products that dissolve easily in aqueous environments and, are resistant to changes in viscosity with changes in pH, temperature or the use of salts. Additionally, Pullulan's film forming properties can be used to form films or coatings on foods; and oxygen barriers or matrixes to hold flavors and protect food quality. Pullulan is capable of being compressed into tablets, where its particular dissolution properties can be used to release a suspended or solubilized. substance over time. It can also function as a binder or humectant. Table lcontains a list of the physical properties of Puilulan that can be exploited for various bod products.

Production Process and Quality Controls Pullulan has been sold into the food industry and eaten by consumers in Japan for more than 20 years. Hayashibara Company, Ltd. has continued to optimize the production of Pullulan. The general production process, possible variations, and methods to ensure the quality and safety of the products will be discussed in the following section. 1. Introduction HBC Pullulan is produced by mesophilic (22O-3OoC) fermentation of starch with the , Auteobasidium puiiuians. Aureobasidium pullulans is non-pathogenic and non-toxigenic, and is ubiquitous in nature. Various researchers have studied the characteristics and taxonomic position of this organism. A brief summary of these findings is included in Appendix 3. Hayashibara uses a strain of the organism that produces only small amounts of black-pigment, and grow rapidly to yield maximum quantities of Pullulan. Pullulan is elaborated' extracellularly into the culture medium from which it is recovered and purified as described below [Catley, 1971 Vol2 Tab 41. 2. The Hayashibara Process The strain of Aureobasjdjum pullulans used for the production of Pullulan is labeled \"Hayashibara strain''. The organism and the particular strain are non-pathogenic and non-toxigenic, and are not the product of genetic engineering. To assure that a pure culture of the Hayashibara strain is used in Pullulan production, stock cljltures are freeze-dried and stored in ampules. At the time of cultivation, stock cells are cultured from the ampules and streaked on agar plates. If, after colony formation, the purity 5 06f046)41 Appendix APuliulan GUS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 Section LI Chemical Identity of the culture is confirmed, one colony is transferred to an agar slant. This . colony is then used as the innoculum for the production of Pullulan. ,,A process flow diagram of the Hayashibara Pullulan production scheme is shown below. The black pigment produced by the Hayashibara strain is decolorized with activated carbon following pH adjustment of the culture medium. Appendix 3 provides a further description'of the production process. 6 Appendix APuliulan GRAS Notification Section II Chemical Identity Hayashibara International Inc.

February 5,202 Section I1 Chemical Identity 3. Process Controls Overview HBC Pullulan is manufactured at Okayama Plant II. Quality control activities from several sections of the company are jointly responsible for Pullulan quality assurance. Each section has its own analytical laboratory within the plant, equipped with all the laboratory equipment normally required for the analytical control of raw materials and finished products. If necessary, the plant also has access to other laboratories within the company and the city of Okayama that are equipped to handle more complicated issues. Analytical methods are designed to provide longitudinal data and information on the identity, purity, quality, strength, and stability of Pullulan. Feedback from the quality control laboratories to the manufacturing plant is used to adjust critical control points if necessary to maintain the desired properties and characteristics of the product. Such a system ensures that HBC Pullulan is manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP), and that it will meet its published ~ specifications. OQOQ44 8 Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Hayashibara lntemational Inc. February 5,2002 Section I1 Chemical Identity Tower and TBA Tower), and polyethylene (in the hydrochloride acid tank). These were designed and are used under cGMP. 6. Packaging and Labeling Twenty-five kg of Pullulan is weighed into an anti-static polyethylene bag (thickness: 0. lmm), and secured with a 'rubber band. The bag is placed in a cardboard box with a cardboard pad on the bottom. The box has a label printed with the appropriate information. The box is sealed with adhesive tape. The specifications for the packaging material were provided to and reviewed by the Expert Panel. 7. Product Release Controls The Drug Additives Manufacturing Supervisor of Hayashibara Company, Ltd, releases Hayashibara Pullulan after a review of the raw materials and specification analyses, and comparison to final product specifications. J. Complaint and Recall Procedures There are detailed procedures to be followed if 'Hayashibara receives a complaint concerning product qualrty. These included a through investigation and reporting system, and if necessary a product recall. K. Multiple Products Hayashibara Pullulan is currently commekially available in two molecular weights. The products are designated as \"10\" and \"20\", which represent mean molecular weights of 100,000 and 200,000. There are also two specification grades for Pullulan that are called \"PF\" for food grade, and \"PI\" for a highly deionized product. It is possible to predictably vary the molecular weight of the Pullulan produced by varying the dependent conditions of cultivation [Sugimoto, 1978 Vol4 Tab 421. The conditions include substrate concentration, temperature, pH, aeration and agitation rates. Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Hayashibara Internatonal Jnc. February 5,2002 Section I1 Chemical Identity 4. Manufacturing Process Controls Current Good Manufacturing'Practices'(cGMP) are used in the handling of raw materials, the production of the Pullulan, and the process controls. To guarantee the purity of the culture several steps are- taken and 'critical control points are used. Briefly, all containers and culture media used for cultivation are thoroughly sterilized, and the air used for aeration of the culture is filtered. At regular intervals during fermentation, microscopic examination and pH determination of the culture, and analyses of the Pullulan are conducted to assure purity. If a culture is contaminated, it is sterilized and discarded. The batch is not reprocessed. To the extent possible, the source of the contamination is determined, and appropriate counter measures are adopted to prevent recurrences. * After cultivation the live organisms of the Hayashibara strain are removed from the culture media by microfiltration. The Pullulan containing media is then sterilized with heat as an added measure of safety. The absence of the live strain of A. pullulans in the product is determined by culture. The Hayashibara strain exhibits characteristic growth morphology, and is therefore recognizable. For those colonies that are difficult to classify, inoculation into liquid medium and assessment of the colony's ability to produce Pullulan is determined. *, Appendix 4 lists the process controls that are in place in the manufacture of Hayashibara Pullulan. 5. Manufacturing Facilities and Equipment It should be noted that while the building is used for the production of other products, the Pullulan production area is separated from the other areas and dedicated for this purpose. The materials that come in direct contact with Pullulan during the production include stainless steel, natural hard rubber linings (in the TBK 9 Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 Section II Chemical Identity The purpose for altering the molecular weight of the final product is to provide products whose viscosity potential matches an intended use. For example, a 10% solution of HBC PF-20 (mean molecular of 15-25 mm2/s at the same concentration [Hayashibara, internal Data, 2000 Vol 2 Tab 131. The different viscosities are specified by product in the company's published specifications. L. HBC Pullulan Specifications, Product Identity, and Purity 1.

Product Identity HBC Pullulan occurs as a white to slightly yellowish powder, depending on the. extent of deionization (See Process Flow Diagram Above). Pullulan products designated PI have * undergone extensive deionization, and are white in color. Pullulan, which has been purified and designated as food grade may 'be white to slightly yellowish. All products contain greater than 90% Pullulan, and less than 6% moisture. The residue on ignition is less than 1.5% for PF-20 and less than 5.0% for PF-10. The pH of all Pullulan products ranges from 5.0 to 7.0. The content of mono, di- and oligosaccharides (on a dry basis) is less than 10%. HPLC analysis of the saccharides in Pullulan have shqwn that greater than 33% are composed of two glucose molecules or less, and that 95.6% have a degree of polymerization (DP) less than 13 Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification International Jnc. February 5,2002 Section 11 Chemical Identity .. 10 [Hayashibara Internal data, 2000 Vol2 Tab' 131. The viscosity of a 10% solution of Pullulan varies with the molecular weight of the product. PF-20, with a mean molecular weight of 200,000 has a viscosity ranging from 100;-180 mm2/s. PF-10 has a mean molecular weight of 100,000, and its viscosity ranges from 15-25 mm2/s. Microbiological profiles show that the products are negative on a 25gram basis for contaminants of public health significance, such as Salmonella sp., E. mli, and Staphylococcus aureus. 3. Analysis of 10 Lots In order to demonstrate that Hayashibara Company, Ltd. is able to consistently manufacture Pullulan to meet published specifications, the company has analyzed 10 lots of PF-20 produced over a period of time. The results are shown in Table 5 (below). The data show that product punty ranged from 91.2 to 95.0%. Oligosaccharide content ranged from 5.0 to 7.2%, and moisture ranged from 2.2 to 3.1%. Residue,,on ignition ranged from 0.0 to 0.16%, and pH ranged from 5.53 to 6.02. The product had a 'mean viscosity of 150 mm2/s, and the metals content of all lots was less than the published specification. Interestingly, the data showed that the products contained no viable microorganisms. 4. Certificates of Analysis for Pullulan PF-10 Table 4 depicts the results of three Certificates of Analysis for Pullulan PF-10. Significantly, these analyses were carried out on Pullulan produced in three different years. Lot number 7B18, was produced February 18, 1997, lot number 8818 was produced February 18, 1998, and lot number CB21 was produced March 1,2001. The results showed ' that loss on 'drying was less than 6.0%, residue on ignition was less than 3.0%, and the pH ranged from 5.51 to 5.72. Two lots (7818 and CB21) yielded the same color in aqueous solution, 0.052, and the third lot yielded a very similar value, 0.048. Protein content of the products ranged from 0.1 0 to 0.22%. Heavy metals and arsenic were less than 14 Q60050 Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Hayashibara Intdonal Inc. February 5,2002 Section II Chemical Identity 5ppm and Zppm, respectively. As in the data for PF-20 (shown in Table 5) no viable counts of microorganisms were detected for any of the lots. 5. Lead and Specific Heavy Metal Analyses In order to ensure that HBC Pullulan products met the published specifications for lead, analyses were performed by an independent laboratory (Institut Europ6en de I'Environnement de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France; IEEB) on 10 lots of Pullulan PI-20. The results are shown in Table 6. All lots contained less than 0: 1 ppm lead as analyzed by Atomic Absorption. The concentrations for lead ranged from O.Oppm to O.09ppm. The company also performed specific heavy metal analyses on three lots of HBC Pullulan PF-20, Pullulan PI-20, numbers: 1KO6 and 11 117. The lots were tested for cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic. The data, as shown in Table 7, indicate that cadmium, lead, and mercury were all below the level of detection, and that levels of arsenic were near the level of detection, ranging from 0.079 to 0.098 mgkg for PF-20 and from 0.020 to 0.033 mgkg for lots of PI-20. These data indicate that the concentration of lead in Hayashibara P'ullulan is less than the recommended 'tolerance limits for GRAS substances with .high consumption levels (~0.1ppm) contained in the Agency's advance notice of proposed rule making 'Lead in Food and Color Additives and GRAS hgredienis; Request for Data\" (Fedem/ Register, February 4, 1 994). 6. Mycotoxin Levels Since the fungal species Aureobasidium pullulans is used to produce Pullulan, the Hayashibara Company, Ltd. had .the IEEB measure the level of my&toxins in three commercial lots of their Pullulan PF-20 product and in two commercial lots of PI-20. All mycotoxins tested were below the level of detection, as shown in Table 8 below. The assays were performed as an additional demonstration of safety. The Sponsor is not aware of any information, either from the literature or from 'in-house sources, that suggests that A. pullulans produces a mycotoxin(s). ., Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Section IT Chemical tdentity Hayashibara International Inc.

Antibiotic and Aureobasidin Production The presence of antibiotics is not anticipated from the information available to the Sponsor; however, for additional assurance three lots of HBC Pullulan PF-20 and two lots of PI-20 were tested for antimicrobial activity. The assays were preformed at the IEEB. This is a laboratory that performs official assays for the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of the Environment and other governmental agencies. This study was performed according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization protocol using bacterial strains recommended for the antibiotic assay. e Using this test system, no antimicrobial activity was detected in the Pullulan products. Table 9 displays the results. Strains of Aureobasidium pullulans have been shown to produce a group of antifungal agents termed Aureobasidins (Takesako, K, et ai., J Antibiotics 44: 919-24, 1991). These are ,cyclic deps-ipeptides . formed by eight La-amino acids. Three or four of the amino acids are-N-methylated, and a hydroxy acid binds to both ends to form a ring structure (Ikai, K, et a/., J Antibiotics 44: 925-33, 1991). Aureobasidins are not structurally similar to known mycotoxins [Kimoto, et a/., 1997 Vol 3 Tab 221. More importantly, Aureobasidins have been shown to be non-toxic in mice (Takesako, K, et a/., J Antibiotics 46: 1414 -1420, 1993). Aureobasidin was administered in a single dose at concentrations up to 50mg/mi to 5 female mice. Treatments were given intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously and per os, and the mice were observed for 7 days. LDh values were 231, approximately 1,000, >1,000, and >l,000mg/kg when given by the respective routes of administration. Further, data from studies on animals and humans, and commercial consumption of Pullulan in , Japan over a period of more than 20 years has not indicated any safety associated concern associated with the production strain.

The assays were preformed at the IEEB. This study was performed using methods recognized by the U.N.. Food and Agriculture Organization and the European Union. The results are presented in Table 10. The results indicated that HBC Pullulan was very nearly free of microbial cells. The product was below the level of detection for all microbial pathogens, and contained less than 100 total mesophilic organisms.

Test Methods Hayashibara Company, Ltd. can provide written test methods for each of the chemical and microbiological variables in its specifications for Pullulan products. These methods are approved in Japan and correspond to either AOAC Methods of Analysis or the methods provided by FDA in the Bacterial Analytical Manual (BAM). N. Stability of Pullulan The storage stability of 5 lots of Hayashibara Pullulan was assayed in its commercial packaging materials. The cartons were stored in the Product Storage Room at room temperature (1O-3O0C: RH 40-65%). Samples were tested periodically over a 24-month storage period for moisture, pH, viscosity, fungi, Pullulan purity, and oligosaccharide content. The analytical results were reported af\u20acer the first month, then every 3 months for the first 12 months, and then every 6 months for the final 12 months of the test period,. The stability study showed that virtually no change had occurred in the test criteria throughout the test period, and that the product remained within the prescribed specifications (with one exception for moisture at 24 months for Lot No. 50303)., Based on the test results, it was concluded that HBC Pullulan was stable for 24 months of storage under the test conditions used. Data is provided in Appendix 5. 0. Explanation of the Lot Code ~ A,, HBC Pullulair is assigned lot numbers based on two coding systems. One code uses all numbers and the second one is alpha-numeric. The former code is used to identify Pullulan lots that are sold to one specific customer. For various reasons Hayashibara is interested in being these able to easily identrfy these lots. An examples of the lots that use only Appendix APullulan GUS Notification Hayashibara International Inc February 5,2002 Section II Chemical Identitv able to easily identify these lots. An examples of the lots that use only numbers would be \"1,0227\". The first digit \"1\" indicates the year, in this example the, year is 2001. The second digit, \"02\", signifies the month, in this case, February, and the last two digits, \"2T, denote the day. Thus, Lot No 'I 10227\".was manufactured on February 27,2001. In the second coding system the only change is that the second and third digits, representing the month are replaced by a letter. For instance, \"A\" would be January, \"\u20ac3\" February and so on. For the example above, the code would be \"1 B27\". P. Summary Pullulan is a polysaccharide elaborated extracellularly by Aureobasidium pullulans, in nature. The organism is ubiquitous. Hayashibara Pullulan is commercially produced by a non-pathogenic and non-toxigenic strain of A. pullulans utilizing corn syrup as the substrate. Pullulan has a linear structure comprised of maltotrioses in which three glucose units are linked through a- 1,4-glucosidic bonds. Ttie maltotrioses are in turn linked to a series of.other maltotrioses through a-l,6-glucosidic bonds creating a long stair-step-type structure. The molecular weight of Pullulan can range from 50,000 up to several million daltons. Pullulan is very similar in composition to the amylopectin fraction of typical food starches, found in corn and wheat. However, due to its size and bond configuration, it acts as a dietary fiber in the human body. Commercial Pullulan is produced under current ,Good Manufacturing I Practice, which results in product purity com,parable to that specified for dextrin in the Food Chemicals Codex, 4th' Edition. The products have been extensively tested for the presence of antibiotics, mycotoxins, heavy metals, and pathogens. No contaminants of public health significance have been observed. The Food Chemical Section, Environmental Health Department, Ministry of Health and Welfare approved Pullulan as a food ingredient in Japan. It.is also listed in the Standards for Ingredients of Drugs and is widely used as a pharmaceutical additive for bulking: and stabilization of tablets in Japan.

Consumption Estimates. and Information on Self-Limiting Levels Section 111. Intended Uses, Functional Effects, Consumption Estimates, and Self- Limiting Levels Pullulan has been used in Japan for more than 20 years as both an indirect food ingredient for coatings on food packaging, and as a direct food additive in a variety of applications. ' This experience provides exa'mples upon wh'icli ' to base physical and technical functional effects, the intended uses, consumption estimates and self-limiting aspects of this product. A. Intended Uses, Functional Effects, and Use Levels Hayashibara Pullulan has a variety of potential uses in the U.S. These potential products are based on the experience of use in Japan as wel'l as Hayashibara company research and information from U.S. patents. This information provides realistic intended uses, functional effects and use levels that are associated with the use of Pullulan under current Good Manufacturing Practice. 1. Intended Uses The first column of Table 11 includes several specific types of products (Intended Uses). The second column lists the 43 FDA food categories found at 21 C'FR \u00a7170.3(n) that are correlated to the food products in the first column. These are provided to show the variety of food categories in which PuHulan may be used. The intended uses of Pullulan fall within three general categories. They include use as an ingredient directly added to foods, as a film, and as an excipient. The following is a brief description of each use. Food Ingredient--One primary category of intended use of Pullulan is as a multifunctional food ingredient that provides physical and technical effects that improve the quality of a variety of food products. Several of, the Japanese food ,products provided in Table 1 I would ,be likely candidates for use in the US. It is proposed that the use levels in Japan provide a reasonable guide for the use levels in the 'US. An additional intended use in this category is as a fiber source in food products. Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 e Section ID. Technical Effects. Intended Uses. Consumption Estimates. and Information on Self-Limiting Levels Film--A second category of intended use for Pullulan is for the production of edible films. Pullulan can be used to produce an edible film that has been sold in Japan as a fast dissolving breath \"mint\". The film can also be formed into soft or hard capsules for nutrient delivery. Pullulan has been shown to be an acceptable alternative to gelatin. It can be used as essentially the only material in a capsular matrix, or it may be combined with other materials [US Patent 5,411,945 Vol 4 Tab 48; US Patent 4,623,394, Vol 4 Tab 471. Food products can be dipped or sprayed with Pullulan, resulting in a fil,m coating that .provides esthetic enhancement,, a matrix to hold flavors, and an oxygen barrier to preserve flavor; color and protect quality. Excipient--Pullulan can be used in several excipient applications. These would include: a) Coating to slow tablet deterioration, increase shock resistance, reduce cracking,, reduce color deterioration, and improve finish and gloss, b) Granulation to add stability and reduce particle size, c) Pelleting to increase stability, increase bind'ing strength, and prevent elution, d) Binding agent for tablets, and e) Direct blending with nutrient substances for tableting to provide timed release of ingredients [Ohta, et a/., 1985a Vol 3 Tab 30 and Ohta, et a/., 1985b Vol 3- Tab 311. Depending on the type of excipient application, the amount of Pullulan as a percentage of total tablet weight would range from 1.66% (for coatings) to more than 95% (for binding). ., 2. Physical and Technical Functional Effects and Use Levels Pullu81an has several physical and technical functional effects that suggest its use for a number of products., The various functional effects listed in Table 11 can be correlated to the list of 32 physical or technical functional effects published by the FDA for which direct food ingredients may be added to food. These are codified at 23 CFR $170.3 (0) (1-32). The following is a list of the appropriate classifications of physical and technical functional effects under 21 CFR $1 70.3 (0).

Section In. Technical Effects, Intended Uses. Consumption Estimates. and e Information on Self-Limiting Levels February 5,2002 B. Consumption and Exposure Estimate 1 .' Consumption Pullulan is a polysaccharide composed exclusively of glucose molecules, as are other common food grade ingredients such as starch, dextrin and maltodextrin. All four substances consist of glucose units linked through a-1,4-glucosidic and a-I ,6-glucosidic bonds. Dextrin and maltodextrin have been affirmed GRAS under 21 CFR Part 184. The .dextrins and Pullulan are particularly similar to the amylopectin fraction of food-grade starches, which has always been a significant part of the human diet. Pullulan is fundamentally resistant to degradation by human digestive enzymes; whereas, starches, dextrin and maltodextrin are usually digestible. Mod,ifications in processing can result in non-digestible products. If these are not digestible, they are commonly enzymatically hydrolyzed by the bacterial flora in the large intestine. Since the introduction of .Hayashibara Pullulan in 1976, millions of kilograms have been sold into the Japanese food market. As of this date, the company is unaware of any consumer complaint resulting from the consumption of Pullulan. Unlike 'in the US, where many food-associated ad'verse events go unreported, the Japanese consumer is well-known for either directly contacting the food processor, or making use of one of the many regulatory avenues available for registering a complaint. Therefore, it is likely that Hayashibara would have been notified had any adverse effect been reported. 2. Exposure Estimate In order to estimate the probable human exposure to HBC Pu'llulan on a continual daily basis, Hayashibara Company, Ltd. has relied upon examples of commercial formulations from Japan, examples of potential Pullulan use from the recent patent literature, and the results of its own food technology research. Exposure to Pullulan was estimated in Appendix APullulan GUS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 Section III. Technical Effects. Intended Uses. ConsumDtion Estimates. and 0 Information on Self-Limiting Levels accordance with the agency's guidance document, Estimating Exposure to Direct Food Additives and Chemical Contaminants in the Diet [FDA, September, 1995 Vol 2 Tab 91. Use of Pullulan was estimated using the 94 sub-categories included in the document from the National Academy of Sciences titled \"GFWS Food Additive Categories and Sub-Categories\" (data not shown). Since this document does not correlate these 94 food sub-categories with consumption, the food categories were combined so that they were consistent with the food categories from USDAs Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII) [Enns, et a/., 1997 Vol 2 Tab 81. The CSFll food categories, along with percent Pullulan -use, mean daily food intake, and subsequent Pullulan intake in grams per day are provided in Table 12. This Table presents mean intake data for adults 20 years and over (eaters only). For example, three food sub-categories (white bread, dark bread, rolls) from the National Academy of Science l,ist were averaged to yield the average use level for Yeast Bread and Rolls shown on Table 12 (the CSFII categories). Since the CSFll intake data is statistically valid, the percentage use level for Pullulan may be multiplied by the mean intake indicated in the CSFll database to yield an estimated exposure to Pullulan from a given food category (Pullulan use % x Daily mean food intake per food category = Daily mean Pul:lulan intake per food category). The resulting totals for each food category were then summed to yield a total mean daily intake. The total mean daily intake of Pullulan used as a food ingredient is calculated to be 9.4 grams. This amou,nt was doubled to 18.8 grams, to provide an estimate of the 90* percentile, in accordance with the guidance document, Estimating Exposure to Direct Food Additives and Chemical Contaminants in the Diet ['FDA, September, 1995 Vol2 Tab 91. In addition to the estimated intake for the items listed in the CSFli categories, there are three specialized categories in Table 12 listed below Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 Section lII. Technical Effects. Intended Uses. Consumption Estimates. and the calculated total mean daily consumption. In conversations with the Agency it was suggested that these should be listed as separate line items outside the normal daily consumption calculation because the products would be relatively restricted to specific populations. The three categories are the use of Pullulan for producing capsules, its use as an excipient in tablets, and its use in a dietary supplement as a source of fiber (no health claim is inferred). The daily intake of Pullulan as a capsule would be approximately 0.69g per day. Industry figures show that the average consumption of capsules in the US is 0.71 per day and average weight of a capsule is 0.979 [Proprietary Report to Hayashibara International Inc., 2001 Vol 3; Tab 361. The International Pharmaceutical Excipient Council (IPEC) esti'mates that the average adult in the US consumes 5 tablets per day, and that the average tablet weighs 0.5 grams [IPEC; Personal Communication, 2001 Vol 2 Tab 161. Therefore, Pullulan consumption as an excipient would range from 0.415 gramdday, if it were used as a coating (1.66%) to 2.375 gramdday, if it were used as a binder (2 95%). The daily intake of 'Pullulan as a fiber supplement is given as 1.5 to 15 gramdday, which is consistent with other soluble fiber supplements [Institute of Food Technologists Report, 1999 Vol2 Tab 141.

These categories include: Baked good, Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 Section 111. Technical Effects. Intended Uses. Consumption Estimates. and e Information on Self-Limiting Levels mixtures, mainly grain; Total vegetables, fresh vegetables; Total fruits, dried fruits; Total fruits, fruits and mixtures; and Nuts and nut products. C. Self-Limiting Levels The Sponsor asserts that the use of Pullulan will be self-limiting on the basis of the nature of the product itself. Pullulan meets the definition of a dietary fiber and could be consumed as such;' however, it also has physical and technical functional effects when added to various food products. All fibers are self-limiting in foods, in that they are known to interact with other food ingredients in such a way that the total food system may be rendered unpalatable or unacceptable if the fiber is.'incorporated in amounts that negatively affect certain quality standards. Dr. George C. Fahey, Jr. of the University of Illinois, a'n expert in the area of the physiological effects of dietary fiber consumption, offered the following Opinion regarding the self- limiting nature of fiber ingredients, including Pullulan. \"The issue is occasionally raised as to whether one can consume too much fiber. Organoleptic properties of the fiber itself generally will prevent its over- consumption by humans. By themselves, many are dry, dusty, or gritty, and it is often a challenge of the food preparation specialist to mask their properties, when included in complete foods. Thus, maximum levels of inprporation of hbers into many different types of food products, including enteral' formulas, have been defined. These levels are nearly always below the 35 gramslday quantity recommended by the various medical agencies\" [Fahey, 2001 Expert Opinion, Appendix I]. .. D. Other Limiting Factors It is believed by the Sponsor that the estimates of both the percentage use of Pullulan and daily mean consumption of foods 'listed in the various categories are reasonable numbers; however, the calculated value of the total mean intake.(grams) of Pullulan is believed to be higher than what would actually occur. There are additional limiting factors that would likely result in a lower consumption than presented. Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 Section III. Technical Effects. Intended Uses. Consumption Estimates. and Information on Self-Limitin? Levels 1. The calculation assumes that every product in all categories will use Pullulan. Each category represents dozens if not hundreds of specific products. It is highly unlikely that Pullulan would provide benefit for more than a small fraction of the potential products. 2. The calculation assumes that there will be 100% market penetration in each of the categories and for each specific product ('1. above). There are many different ingredients and additives that will compete for the functional effects provided by Pullulan. It is not likely that Pullulan will provide the most effective functional effect and subsequently the best quality final product in all the foods in which Pullulan . could theoretically be used. 3. Pullulan is relatively more expensive than other ingredients or additives for which it might be substituted.\" The cost of Pullulan in Japan where the ingredient has been sold for approximately 20 years is approximately $25(USD)/kg. While the cost benefit ratio ma.y be sufficient to support this price in some specialized uses, it may not be cost effective for use for others since the food industry is one of thezmost cost sensitive sectors of the economy. Appendix AAppendix Apullulan Hayashibara International Inc. GkAS Notification February 5,2002 Safety when Consumed as an Ingredient in Processed Foods Introduction This section contains a comprehensive discussion of available scientific data, and i#nformation that the Notifier has relied upon to reach its conclusion that HBC Pullulan is safe when used under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) as a direct additive to food. The basis upon which this determination of safety was made includes the similarity of Pullulan to other polyglucoses, the use of food grade materials, purity'of the final product, the use of cGMP, safety of the source organism, acute and chronic studies on animals, digestibility in human and animals, and a history of safe use in hu,mans in 'Japan. Citations to the published scientific literature that were included in the GRAS Report reviewed by an Expert Panel appear in brackets. A complete listing of each citation can be found in Appendix 2. . ' Citations not included in the GRAS Report are given in parentheses .in standard format. A. Pullulan and Polyglucoses Pullulan natural water-soluble polysaccharide elaborated extracellularly by pullulans, It is commercially produced by a non-pathogenic, non-toxigenic strain of A. pullulans grown in media containing starch-based sugars and other food grade com,ponents. . Pullulan has a linear I structure comprised of ma:ltotrioses, in which three glucose units are linked through a-1,4- glucosidic bonds. The maltotrioses are in turn ,linked to a series of other maltotrioses through a-lI6-glucosidic bonds, creating a long stair-step-type structure [Catley, 1986 Vol2 Tab 51. Pullulan, like several other edible molecules, are composed of only glucose molecules, which are bound together by a-1,4- and a- lI6-glucosidic bonds. Other common food-related substances that ' contain only glucose and the same a-l,4- and a-l,6-glucosidic bonds are dextrins, maltodextrins, and amylopectins. These three groups : Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 Section IV Safety have been considered or affirmed as GRAS (21 CFR 184.1277 & 184.1444). Polyglucose molecules found in common foodstuffs have been consumed for thousand of years, and investigators estimate that approximately 150 grams of these types of compounds are consumed daily in the diet [Southgate, '1998 Vol4 Tab 401. Differences between these molecules include the relative percentages of a-1,4 and a-1,6 bonds, and the tertiary structure. As mentioned, Pullulan has a sta'ir-step structure, while amylopectins (a major component of starch) are bottlebrush in appearance. Dextrins and maltodextri'ns contain a variety of fragments broken down from amylopectin and amylose. Analyses of Pullulan, cornstarch and maltodextrin have shown that the percentage of a-1,6 bonds are 30, 20 and 5%, respectively wistler, et a/., 1984 Vol4 Tab 531. digestibility these polyglucoses. Amylopectins, dextrins and maltodextrins are usually to glucose by the human digestive enzymes; whereas, Pullulan is digested by bacteria in the large intestine. Conversely, starches, dextrins and maltodextrins can be modified by heat, chemical or enzymatic' treatment. Some of these products, like Pullulan, are \"resistant\" to gastrohtestinal tract digestion, and are hydrolyzed by bacterial enzymes in the colon. These modified resistant products have also been eaten in large quantities over the last several years. The final disposition of Pullulan and the resistant polyglucose molecules is to be converted into short-chain fatty acids that are thought to be of benefit to human body (Flickinger EA, et a/. Journal of Nutrition 130:1267-73, 2000). It is thought that approximately 7% of all the energy used by humans is obtained from microbial metabolism in the large intestine (Cummings JH, ef a/. Journal .of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 21 (6):357-65, 1997). I. Neither the Sponsor nor the Expert Panel for the G,MS review found any literature to suggest that the Pullulan molecule, consisting of glucose and a-I ,4 and a-1,6 glycosidic bonds, would intrinsically ~ . present, a greater safety concern than other polyglucose molecules. Appendix APullulan Hayashibara International Inc. GUS Notification February 5,2002 e Section IV Safety While the lack of negative data is not proof of safety, it does provide a long history of the safe consumption of products with similar chemical structures. Hayashibara contacted Dr. George Fahey, Jr., who is a member of the National Academy of Science, Institute of Medicine's Panel on the Definition of Dietary Fiber. The Sponsor asked Dr. Fahey to give his expert opinion on the safety of glucose polymers as related to Pullulan. The full response is included in Appendix 1. A concluding statement is as follows, \"Clinical studies conducted in our laboratory and in the laboratories of others have shown that.a range of glucose polymers have been well tolerated by animals and humans, and no adverse health effects have been noted. Pullulan also is a glucose polymer and its linear structure with limited branching appears to reduce its digestibility. There is no indication that pulluian would be less wel:l tolerated than another glucose-based oligosaccharide or polysaccharide mentioned above.\" 6. Commercial Pullulan 'I)\" The commercial Pullulan product is produced with a purity and quality comparable to that specified for dextrin [Food Chemicals Codex, 4th Edition, 1996 Vol 2 Tab IO]. The safety of Hayashibara Pullulan for use in foods in general' is supported by the fact that Pullulan meets a set of food grade specifications, is free of contaminants, and is free of the producing \"organism, Aureobasidium pullulans. The source '* organism itself is non-pathogenic a'nd, non-toxigenic, and Pullulan is manufactured under current Good. Manufacturing Practice. Pullulan has been approved as a food ingredient in Japan and safely used for more than 20 years as both an indirect food additive for coatings on food packaging and as a direct additive 'for a variety of applications. These applications were d'iscussed in Section 111 above [Tsujisaka, et a/. , 1993 Vol 4 Tab 451. The Food Chemical Section, Environmental Health Department, Ministry of Health and Welfare approved PullmuIan as a food ingredient in Japan. It is also listed in the Standards for Ingredients of Drugs Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 e Section IV Safety and is used as a pharmaceutical additive for the bulking and stabilization of tablets in Japan [Ministry of Health and Welfare Opinion, 1986 Vol 4 Tab 411. C. Pathogenicity of the Source Organism, A. pullulans A. pu//u/ans, the organism which elaborates Pullulan is ubiquitous in nature, and has generally been regarded as non-pathogenic and non-toxigenic wallenfels et a/., 1965 Vol 4 Tab 511. There have been reports of its presence in clinical samples from isolated individuals. This has lead to questions about possible pathogenicity [Salkin et al., 1986 Vol 3 Tab 37, Kaxzrnarski et a/., 1986 Vol 3 Tab 21, and Giaradi et a/. 1993 Vol 2 Tab 1 I]. However, as noted by Ajello, the mere isolation of a fungus from a lesion or from a clinical sample does not, per se, establish the isolate as a pathogen, especially when the organism is ubiquitous [Ajello, 1978 Vol 2 Tab 11. Similarly, growth in immunosuppressed individuals does not indicate that it is a pathogen capable of establishing an infection in otherwise healthy individuals [Pariza, et a/., 2001 Vol 3 Tab 351. For comparison, it should be noted that Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Brewer's or Baker's yeast), a harmless industrial yeast, has been implicated in several infections, but only in immunosuppressed patients [Sobels et a/.; 1993, Vol 3 Tab 39, Tollermar et a/., '1992, Vol 4 Tab 44, and Tawfik, 1989 Vol4 Tab 431. Because there were a few reports suggesting a possible link between Aureobasidium pullulans and infection, Hayashibara International Inc. commissioned Dr. Donald G. Ahearn, and Dr. Libero Ajello, to provide their expert opinion concerning this issue. These two individuals are noted experts in the field of pathogenic mycology. Their written opinion is included in Appendix 1. I In brief, Drs. Ahearn, and Ajello, noted that Aureobasidium pullulans is a common black saprophobic mold, which is virtually ubiquitous i'n nature and in indoor environments. This mold is inhaled and ingested with fruits and vegetables everyday. These experts Appendix APullulan Hayashibara International Inc. GRAS Notification February 5,2002 Section IV Safety indicated that early clinical studies failed to establish Aureobasidium pullulans as a pathogen. Additionally, reports of the involvement of this organism in clinical infections have been shown to be the result of misidentification of the isolated organism. Based on their years of experience, the researchers concluded that the involvement of A. pullulans with any adverse human health condition is extremely rare, more rare in fact, than reports associated with Baker's . yeast. Therefore, they attest that the products of A. pullulans could be considered generally recognized as safe [Expert Opinion of Ahearn and Ajello, 2001 Appendix I]. D. Acute Toxicity in Mice and Rats The Hayashibara Company, Ltd. commissioned three acute studies in rodents to test the toxicity of Pullulan, the production strain of A. pullulans, or its lysate (see below). The 'studies indicate that the product, the organism, or its lysate were not toxigenic or pathogenic to rats or mice, even when administered in doses up to 20g/kg of body weight. The School of Medicine of Juntendo University conducted two studies in mice in '1974. Only a study summary certificate is available for each study. The number of mice per treatment is not known. One study examined the acute response of mice to a commercial sample of Pullulan and the other study evaluated their response to the production strain of Pullularia pullulans (now Aureobasidium pullulans). The Pullulan was suspended in olive oil and the organism in water. No deaths were recorded for either study. The LD50 for the organism was determined to be >24.134g/kg body weight, and the LD50 for the product was >14.28Og/kg body weight. The investigators indicated that these concentrations were likely the maximum that could be administered, because of the thickness of the preparation [Juntendo University Reports, 1974 Vol2 Tabs 18 and 191. A third acute study was performed to note the effects of A. pullulans lysate in rats [Mitsubishi Chemical Safety Institute Ltd., 1996 Vol 3 41 Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 Section IV Safety Tab 271. The study was certified as being performed using FDA Guidelines (1982) and US FDA GLP Standards for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies (21 CFR part 58, 1987). Aureobasidium pullulans lysate (lot number 960408) was administered orally to ten Sprague-Dawley rats (five weeks old) five per sex at doses of 10 and 20g/kg body weight each. As a positive control Saccharomyces cerevisiae lysate (lot number 960408) was also administered to 10 other rats (5 per sex) at a dose of 20g/kg. This treatment served as the positive control. Five additional rats per sex comprised the negative control group, and this group received sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Both the test substance and the positive control were administered at a purity of 66.7% in PBS solution. The Sponsor verified the lysate before administration. Male rats ranged in weight from 135-1 569, while females were 11 6-1 319. Five of the 20 females rats weighed less than 1209 at treatment, which was the only deviation from the protocol. This was thought to have been caused by the required fasting from the everting before treatment. Since the animals appeared healthy and the difference was only a few grams, they were used for the study. Each animal was identified by body tattoo and cage labels. Doses of A. pullulans lysate and controls amounting to 10 and 20g/kg body weight were divided in two equal aliquots and ad'ministered by gastric tube as two separate oral doses 4 hours apart. Food was withheld for about two hours after dosing. Individual animal weights were measured immed'iately before treatment. The dose volume was 20ml/kg for both the first and second administration. Animals were observed for mortality and signs of toxicity at approximately 05, 1, 3 and 4 hours after the first and second administration. Thereafter, clinical. observations were made twice a day for 13 days after administration, except for weekends where only one observation was made each day. On the day of necropsy (14 days after administration) the rats were observed once before anesthetization and sacrificed by exsanguination. Body weights were determined before administration and once a week thereafter. At the Appendix APullulan GUS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 I Section IV Safety conclusion of the study the rats were examined for mortality, body weight, gross clinical signs, gross toxicity of internal organs, and if abnormalities of organs were observed, histopathology would be performed. No deaths occurred during the study. Body weights increased in a normal fashion and were the same as the negative control. No abnormalities were observed in clinical signs throughout the study. No abnormalities were found in any organs of the control or treated rats. Since gross examination revealed no apparent abnormalities, histopathology of the organs was not performed. It was concluded that 20glkg body weig'ht of Aureobasidium pullulans lysate ad'ministered in two acute oral doses was not lethal or toxic to SD rats, and the LD50 was > 20g/kg body weight [Mitsubishi Chemical Safety Institute Ltd., 1996 Vol 3 Tab 271. E. Long-term Feeding Study in Rats Kimoto, et a/., published results of a feeding study designed to assess the potential' effects of long-term consumption of Pullulan by Sprague-Dawley rats [Kimoto, et al., 1997 Vol 3 Tab 221. The study was originally conducted by the Department of Public Hygiene, School of Medici'ne, Juntendo University [Kotani, et ,a/., 1976 Vol 3 Tab 231. The Pullulan used was taken from a commercial production lot. One hundred twenty (1 20) four-week old SD-JCL rats were divided into 4 groups of 30, 15 of each sex. The rats were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups or a control group. Test groups were administered Pullula'n in the diet at levels of 1, 5 and 10% for a period of 62 weeks: Control animals received a standard laboratory diet. The protocol was designed to include general observations of animal health and activity on a daily basis, and weight determinations on a Appendix APullulan GUS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 Section IV Safety weekly basis. At the conclusion of the study the rats were anesthetized and blood .was collected directly from the heart. Blood samples were analyzed for. red and wh'ite cell concentrations, differential counts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Additionally, the investigators measured concentrations of serum transaminases (AST, ALT), alkaline phosphatase, cholinesterase, the albumin to globulin ratio, total cholesterol, serum protein, and blood sugar. Urine was collected and assayed for protein, sugar, ketones, pH, and occult blood. Animals were exsanguinated and major organs were observed for pathological changes by macroscopic and histologic methods. The feeding study was originally intended to be for 24 months. However, the study was terminated at 62 weeks due to poor survival resulting from intercurrent pneumonia in ail groups, including the control. Examination of all rats that died during the study showed no noteworthy changes other than pneumonia, which accounted for most of the deaths in the colony. The investigators stated that pulmonary abscesses and pneumonia are conditions, which are commonly encountered in long-term studies with mice and rats [Kotani, et a/., 1976 Vol 3 Tab 231. Other investigators who have utilized long-term rat studies to assess the safety of new food ingredients have published reports corroborating respiratory ailments as one of the common findings in older colonies (Woodard, et a/., 1973 Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 24, 30-36). In this study all surviving animals were necropsied, and thorough gross post-mortem examinations were conducted after 62 weeks of treatment [Kotani, et a/., 1976 Vol 3 Tab 231. Pullulan did not adversely effect food consumption or food efficiency (See Table 1'3) [Kimoto, et a/., 1997 Vol 3 Tab 221. The body weight of male rats in every group increased rapidly until the loth week. This was followed' by a gradual increase in weight to about 600 grams at the 40\" week, after which weights remained stable. Mean weight gains of the rats fed diets containing 1 and 10% Pullulan were reported to have been somewhat slower than those of the control Appendix APullulan Hayashibara International Inc. GRAS Notification February 5,2002 Section IV Safety .. group; however, these differences were not statistically significant. At the termination of the study, the 'mean weight of the animals in the 1 and 10% group were significantly less (Pe0.05) than the control group. The mean weight of the 5% group was not significantly different. The female rats grew rapidly from the 2\"d to the IO* week. Gradual growth was noted until the female rats reached a weight of approximately 350 grams, and no substantial weight gain was noted after the 40h week. The mean body weight gabs .of all treatment groups were comparable to the controls. None of the mean weights of the treatment groups were significantly different than the control. Therefore there appeared to be no consistent or dose-associated effect of Pullulan consum'ption on weight gain or absolute weight after 62 weeks [Kotani, et a/., 1976 Vol 3 Tab 23 and Kimoto, et a/., 1997 Vol 3 Tab 221. No significant or consistent differences in daily feed intake per animal or per kg body weight were noted between the treatment groups and the control group. No increase in daily intake was measured during the rapid growth period of the 2\"d to the IO* week. Therefore, the dietary intake per kg body weight, decreased in all groups during this time, and then remai,ned stable throughout the study [Kotani, et a/., 1976 Vol 3 Tab 23 and Kimoto, et a/., 1997 Vol 3 Tab 221.

For the male groups, the mean RBC concentration of the 1 and 10% groups were significantly (Pc0.01 , 0.05, respectively) greater than control. The lymphocyte counts of the 1 and 5% groups were less, than control (P~0.01, 0.05, respectively). The 1% treatment group had a significant increase in band neutrophils (P~0.01)~ while the 5% group had a greater percentage of segmented neutrophils (PcO.05). The 5% treatment group also had a lower (Pc0.05) ALT concentration that the control group. The only significant difference between the female groups was that the 5% treatment group had a significantly greater (Pc0.05) total cholesterol concentration than the control group. There was no indication of a Pullulan treatment related effect in the animals administered Pullulan at up to 10% of their diet for 62 weeks. All urine samples were negative for sugar, occult 'blood or ketones. pH and protein content ranged from 6-8 and + to +++, respectively, without ,any apparent differences in pattern between 'the treatment and the control groups. Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 Section IV Safety Organ weights were statistically compared on an absolute and per body weight basis. Tables 14 and 15 provide a statistically relevant comparison between the groups for male and female animals. Male rats fed Pullulan at all concentrations showed a decrease in mean liver and right kidney weights when compared to the control group. Other statistically. significant differences were' also observed, (Table 14). However, when organ weights per body weight were compared, none of the differences were significant. The pattern of significant differences of organ weights was not the same in female rats as that observed in males (Table 15). Statistically significant differences (PcO.05) in mean organ weights were calculated between the control and the 10% treatment group for heart, liver, spleen and cecum (P<O.Ol).. However, as with the male groups,'when calculated on an organ weight per body weight basis no significant differences were noted. According to several authors, cecal enlargement' is a common physiologic response to poorly absorbed sugars and carbohydrates, and is considered an adaptive rather than a pathologic change [Kimoto, ef a/., 1997 Vol 3 Tab 22; Oku et a/., 1979 Vol 3 Tab 331. Taken together these data suggests that none of the differences were associated with treatment with Pullulan. Additionally, the authors noted that no histologic changes were observed that would indicate that the differences in mean organ weights resulted from a pathologic condition.

Unless othetwise stated (number of rats), each group represents one Heart: localized myocarditis, The authors concluded from macroscopic and microscopic examination of selected organs that there was no indication of Pullulan-related toxicity in the organs [Kimoto, et a/., 1997 Vol 3 Tab 221. The study was originally planned to last for 24 months, but because of pneumonia-related deaths in a'll groups the study was terminated at 62 weeks. Deaths of the treated and control male rats tended to occur relatively early in the study. The survival rate of the male control group was less than 50% at the end of the test (62 weeks). Deaths in female rats were less than those of male rats prior to the 35* week, and more females survived to the end of the study. The investigators indicated that this finding was in accordance with other long-term feeding studies conducted at their facility. Although the survival rate of the 10% Pullulan-fed females was significantly (fcO.05) lower than the control group, no dose dependency was noted between Pullulan intake and survival rate. The survival rate for each group of rats by sex is depicted in the figure below. 52 Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification 0 Section IV Safety Hayashibara International Inc. Figure 2 February 5,2002 Survival of fUts after a 62 W&k Pullulan Intake Study percentage of Pullulan in Diet Study Conclusion While an ongoing intercurrent disease developed during the study, a comparison of treatment to control groups indicated that Pullulan did not cause any additional untoward effects in the animals. Although individual significant differences in survival rates, and !body weights were observed, there was not any variable that was consistent with a dose effect or was seen in both males and females. Some absolute organ weights were significantly different than controls, but when compared on a body weight basis there was no significance. Also, no consistent pattern between males and females was seen. On the basis of the .study results, it was concluded that Pullulan lacked toxicological activity. The no-observed-adverse-effect was , determined as the highest concentration tested, 10% of the diet. This was equal to or greater than 4450mg/kg body weightlday in ma'les I and 5080mg/kg body weightlday in females. The authors stated that these results would support use in various foods at a level of at least 45mg/kg body weightlday [Kimoto, et a/., 1997 Vol3 Tab 221. Appendix APullulan Hayashibara International Inc. GRAS Notification Section IV Safety 1 n February 5,2002 F. Human Consumption Study Yoneyama et a/. investigated the effects of the consumption of reagent grade Pullulan (MW 50,000) ' on 13 healthy human volunteers. The volunteers were given Pullulan (1 Oglday) at lunch, either in water or in soup, for fourteen consecutive days. No untoward effects were noted. Some subjects noted a feeling of fullness. Subjects included I3 healthy adult volunteers (24-53 years old, mean 34.5 years). During the experimental period, the volunteers were allowed to carry out their normal daily activities, but were instructed to avoid the excessive use of alcoholic beverages. There were no other dietary restrictions [Yoneyama et a/., 1989 Vol4 Tab 541. Six of the 13 volunteers had stool weight, stool .pH, short-cha'in fatty acid (SCFA) concentration, water-soluble saccharide concentration, and .the profile of the bacterial flora of the stools. tested before and after treatment. Stool weights were determined from samples collected over the 48-hour period just before and after the study period. For blood biochemistry, all 13 subjects were used. The items tested included cholesterol components, lipid components, inorganic salt concentration, hepatic function, and blood .sugar level. In addition, blood pressure of all the test subjects was taken. A reduction in fecal pH as the result of Pullulan intake was detected in 5 of'6 test subjects following stool sampling. The average pH . values tended to decrease from pH 6.53 before the study to pH 5.97 after intake. This may be physiologically sign'ificant, as various health authorities have linked lowering the pH of the colonic environment to a reduction in the instances of certain cancers [Kntchevsky, 1996 Vol 3 Tab 241: Correspondingly, total SCFA detected in lg of feces showed an increase as the result of Pullulan consumption in 5 of 6 test subjects. The average values tended to increase from 6.0mglg I before intake to 8.8mglg after intake. However, these' changes were 000091 54 Appendix APullulan GUS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 e Section IV Safii not found to be statistically significant [Yoneyama et a/., 1989 Vol 4 Tab 541. The daily fecal weight increased 33%; however, the difference was not significant. The results of water-soluble saccharides in the feces of the 6 test subjects showed an average decrease from 135mg/lOOg of feces to lOGmg/lOOg, although, individual results were highly variable. These data are consistent with essentially complete fermentation of Pullulan in the colon [Yoneyama et a/., 1989 Vol 4 Tab 541. Stool frequency did not change after treatment. The majority of microorganisms in the human intestine are known to be members of the families, Bacteroidaceae, Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium, and Peptococcaceae [Salyers, et a/., 1985 Vol 3 Tab 383. Isolates of all four of these families could be detected in 3 subjects. Eubacterium and Peptococcaceae were not detected in 1 and 2 subjects, respectively. The number of Bifidobacterium increased after Pullulan intake in 5 of 6 subjects. In one test subject, the increase in microorganisms due~to Pullulan intake was notable, (> 10,000 fold increase). Members of the Bacteroidaceae were the most predominant microfloral organisms in all the test subiects. This population increased, decreased, or showed mo,change in two each of the 6 test subjects, while, the total numbers of fecal organisms on a log scale (10.8 per lg of feces) showed no change [Yoneyama et a/., 1989 Vol 4 Tab 541. Rather, there was a demographic shift towards Bifidobacteriurn. Fecal- populations of Bifidobacterium were shown to increase in five of six subjects over the course of the 14-day study. As a result, the ratio of Bifidobacteriurn to total human fecal microflora increased from 11.9% before consumption of Pullulan to 21.9% after intake. Many health practitioners feel that this is clinically significant, because certain health benefits have been associated with an increase in the population of probiotic bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium. A recent Scientific Status Summary published by the Institute of Food Technologists lists several potential and established effects of probiotic bacteria [Institute' of Food Technologists, 1999 Vol 2 Tab 141. Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 @ Section IV Safety No significant differences were noted in the 14 serum variables 'examined before and after treatment. Additionally, no changes were observed in subject blood pressure [Yoneyama et a/., 1989 Vol4 Tab 541. Some of the test subjects mentioned the sensation of abdominal fullness after ta'king log of Pullulan per day, but no other symptoms were noted. The investigators concluded that there were 'no adverse effects from the consumption of log of Pullulan per day, and that orally administered Pullulan functions as a dietary fiber, which might act to improve the human intestinal' environment [Yoneyama et a/., 1989 Vol4 Tab 541. G. History of Safe Use HBC Pullulan has been in commercial production since 1976 in Japan. To date more than three thousand metric tons have been sold into the food chain. The product was classified as a food ingredient in Japan by the Food Chemical Section, ' Environmental Health Department, Ministry of Health and Welfare in 1977 [Official Letters to Hayashibara Company, Ltd. 1976 and 1977 Vol 3 Tab 291. It is also listed in the Standards for Ingredients of Drugs and is widely used as a pharmaceutical additive for bulking and stabilization of tablets in Japan [Hayashibara Certificate, 1988 Vol2 Tab 121. To Hayashibara Company, Ltd's knowledge, no complaints have been made to either the company or the various government entities that would handle such matters. There are at least five agencies in Japan to which consumer complaints concerning food products can be reported. It is likely that any consumer inquiry to a central government agency would be referred to the Japanese Consumer Information Center (JCIC). The JCIC is a nonprofit organization, which was established by the Japanese Government in 1970 to provide consumer education, training programs and publications, test Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 0 Section IV Safety products, alert consumers to potential problems with products, and handle consumer complaints. The JCIC collects the appropriate information from the consumer, contacts the company, and reviews the available information. A response is formulated, which includes corrective measures. If companies are not responsive to the concerns of JCIC, the case is turned over to appropriate agencies for legal action. In addition to government-associated agencies in Japan, manufacturers encourage cbnsumer comments directly to them and usually provide a telephone contact number on their product. Since Pullulan is usually used as an ingredient in a food product, it is more likely that any complaints would first be made to the final product manufacturer or to the JCIC. Subsequent to a complaint, Hayashibara would be contacted if there was a question of whether Pullulan was involved in a particular issue. Although Pullulan has been sold into the Japanese market for more than two decades, no consumer complaints have been reported to any Hayashibara associated company. This provides strong evidence that consumption of Pullulan is safe and has not' produced untoward effects based on the concentrations being used in the Japanese food industry. H. Fate of Pullulan in the Digestive Tract The determination that Hayashibara Pullulan is safe, for' human consumption is also based on its digestive pattern. Studies conducted on the fate of Pullulan in the digestive tract have demonstrated that it is hydrolyzed to a very limited extent by the salivary and pancreatic amylases of the upper GI tract, and that essentially no glucose is released during hydrolysis [Okada, et a/., 1990 Vol 3 Tab 321. However, as with many other commonly consumed oligosaccharides, the majority of the ingested Pullulan is 57 Appendix APulluian GRAS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 Section IV Safetv fermented by resident bacteria in the large intestine forming short- chain fatty acids [Nakamura, 1984 Vol 3 Tab 281. Glucose polymers may differ in the site(s) of digestion based on their structure and molecular weight (Murray, et a/., Journal of Nutrition 128 (1 1):2032-5, 1998 and (Flickinger EA, et a/. Journal of Nutriton 130:1267-73, 2000). Nonetheless, there is no indication that any glucooligosaccharides are in and of themselves toxic to humans. Hayashibara International Inc. sought an Expert Opinion from Dr. George Fahey, of the Department of Animal Sciences, University of Illinois, regarding the relationship of structure to the digestibility and safety of glucose polymers. Dr. George Fahey stated that, \"glucose-based oligosaccharides are common in the human diet, and exhibit a wide variety of structural variations. While these structural variations may affect the site (small intestine vs. colon) and extent of digestion, none are known to be harmful to humans, and many glucose polymers have been tested in a clinical setting. Using starch as an example, it is well known that rate of digestion is effected by the relative amounts of amylose and amylopectin in the starch fraction. Goddard et a/., (1984) explained that the rate of amylose digestion is slower than that of amylopectin,, because it is a linear molecule, whose glucose units participate more readily in hydrogen bonding than do those of the more highly branched amylopectin. This tends to make them less accessible to enzymatic digestion, according to Thorne, et a/., (1983). Further, amylopectin is a larger molecule, with more 'surface area for enzymatic attack. The structure of starch, and therefore its digestibility may be modified purposely or inadvertently through food preparation. For instance, Annison and Topping (I 994) reported that it was possible to physically modify the structure of starch by retrogradation, so that it became partially inaccessible to enzymatic attack. This type of starch is now known as resistant starch. Appendix APullulan Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 GRAS Notification Section IV Safety Vonk, et al. (2000), found that highly digestible (80%) cornstarch contained 26% amylose and contained 62% amylose and 38% amylopectin. This and other studies have shown that the digestibility of resistant starch drops to about 50%. Likewise, maltodextrins are generally considered to be highly digestible sources of carbohydrate energy, however, the addition of heat and enzymatic hydrolysis during preparation of maltodextrins can create a greater variety of bond formations, including p-1-3, p-1-4 and p-1-6 linkages. The ,glucose digestibility of these modified maltodextrins has. been shown to be lower than unmodified maitodextrin. Clinical studies both in our laboratories and elsewhere have shown that a range of glucose polymer structures have been well tolerated by animal or human subjects, and no effects adverse to health have been noted. Pullulan is also a glucose polymer and its linear structure with limited branching appears to reduce its digestibility. However, there is no indication that this particular structure would be less well tolerated than any of those already discussed.\" As noted by Dr. Fahey, Pullulan is structurally similar to amylose and therefore more 'resistant to digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract than typical cornstarch derived maltodextrins or native food grade starches. While Okada, et a/., found that enzymatic hydrolysis of Pullulan stops at the ct-lI6-linked bonds, .the normal human diet contains tens, if not hundreds ,of grams per day of a-l16-linked glucose units in common foods [Okada, et a/., 1990 Vol3 Tab 32 and Southgate, 1998 Vol 4 Tab 401. Consumption of Pullulan should pot substantially alter current consumption patterns because, in large part, Pullulan will displace other carbohydrates in the diet, which also contain glucose linked by a-I ,6 or a-1,4-glucosidic units [Enns, et a/., 1997 Vol2 Tab 8 and Southgate, 1998 Vol4 Tab 401. Okada et a/. designed an in vitro study to simulate the digestion of Pullulan. Two Pullulan products were tested including a commercially available Pullulan. Pullulan (PI-20) had a mean 59 Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 e Section IV Safety molecular weight of 200,000 and contained about 8% low molecular weight (<10,000) sugars lacking the structure of Pullulan. The second sample was a reagent grade Pullulan (PR-5), with a mean molecular weight of 50,000, but containing no low molecular weight sugars. The PI-20 product was not degraded by gastric fluid, but was ,partially converted to reducing sugars by salivary and pancreatic enzymes (an increase of 0.6% and- 0.7%, respectively). Subsequently, rat-derived partially hydrolyzed Pullulan PI-20, liberating 9.7% reducing sugar. Conversely, gastric acid, or pancreatic enzymes did not hydrolyze the PR-5 sample; however, treatment with rat small intestine enzymes did result in an increase of 3.6% of reducing sugars, suggesting that most of the increase in reducing sugar came from the hydrolysis of the low molecular weight saccharides in the PI- 20, and not from breakdown of the Pullulan itself. Further examination of Pullulan digestion demonstrated that' for samples with a mean molecular weight greater than approximately 65,000, the amount of glucose formed is constant at about 1.5%. For preparations with mean molecular weights less than this, the amount of glucose formed increases in a constant manner with decreased molecular weight. For samples with molecular weights of 48,000, 5,800 and 990 the amount of glucose formed from enzymatic digestion was 1.9, 8.6 and 36.3%, respectively [Okada, et a/., 1990 Vol 3 Tab 321. Microbial fermentation of Pullulan was examined using an in vitro fecal culture system that showed that Pullulan was fermented to short-chain fatty acids in a manner typical of dietary carbohydrates that are not digested by hydrolytic enzymes. About 50% of the administered Pullulan was converted to short chain fatty acids (SCFA), mainly acetic,, propionic and, n-butyric acids. This, again is consistent with the other common .dietary fermentable sugars and polysaccharides [Okada, ef Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 Section IV Safety The next step in the' multi-part study of Okada, et a/., was to determine the energy contribution of. Pullulan. This study used a Pullulan with a mean molecular weight of 50,000. In the study, the assumption was made that all glucose produced in the small intestine was absorbed so that there was an energy transfer of 100%. Additionally, it was assumed that all the SCFA were absorbed in the colon., The amount of glucose absorbed from lg of Pullulan would be about 0.0279 X 3.74kcal/g = 0.1Okcal: In order to determine the amount of energy produced by the SCFAs, the amount of SCFAS that were present after all the Pullulan had disappeared (after 8 hours of in vitro fermentation) was determined. The energy derived from the SCFAs was calculated from an equation developed by the authors showing that Ig Pullulan resulted in 2.05kcal [Okada, et a/., 1990 Vol 3 Tab 321. In this study the amount of Pullulan reaching the colon was 0.9769. Therefore, the energy derived from the large intestine was 2.05kcal/g X 0.9769 = 2.00kcal. The final calculation showed that the energy produced per gram of ingested Pullulan was: 0.1Okcal (from glucose) + 2.1Okcal. The authors :wncluded that Pullulan products are dietary fibers that are not susceptible to the normal enzymes of the gastrointestinal tract. I. Systemic Exposure No data are available to suggest that Pullulan is or is not assimilated ' into the body after ingestion. Because of the size:of the Pulluian molecule and the 'minimal enzymatic digestion that occurs prior to the large intestine, the systemic uptake of Pullulan is highly unlikely veiner, 1988 Vol4 Tab 521. The pharmacokinetics of Pullulan in the body was examined by intravenous injection of Wistar rats with fluorescein-labeled Pullulan (MW 58,200) [Kaneo, et,a/., 2001 Vol 3 Tab 201. Animals were fasted for 16 hours, anesthetized, and injected with a single Appendix APullulan GUS Notification Hayashibara International Inc February 5,2002 * IV Wety 0.2ml dose of'labeled Pullulan through the jugular vein. Samples of blood (0.3ml) were obtained periodically to track the clearance of Pullulan. Results showed that intravenously administered, Pullulan was rapidly eliminated, from the blood circulation in a dose dependent manner, followed by an appreciable distribution to the liver. The data suggested that even if Pullulan entered the circulatory system from the gut, it would clear the blood stream in a relatively short period of time. The authors concluded from this and other studies that Pullulan is not toxic and lacks immunogenicity when administered intravenously [Kaneo, et a/., 2001 Vol 3 Tab 201. . J. Mutagenicity of Pullulan The mutagenicity of pullulan was assessed with and without metabolic activation Salmonella typhimurium strains (TAIOO, TA1535, TA98 Pullulan did not increase the number of revertants per plate in any strain at any dose, including 10,000 pg/plate with or without metabolic activation, from microsomal enzymes from Aroclor-induced rat liver. These data suggest that ii Pullulan lacks mutagenidcarcinogenic potential. Further, Pullulan was not toxic to rats when given at levels of up to 10% of the diet [Kimoto, ef a/., 1997 Vol 3 Tab 221. K. Conclusions on Safety Hayashibara has provided information on the chemical composition of Pullulan, its elaboration by a non-pathogenic, non-toxigenic organism, Aureobasidium pullulans, the manufacturing and purification process for HBC Pullulan, and a set of food grade specifications. Results of both animal toxicology studies, human feeding studies, and classic mutagenicity studies have shown that even when HBC Pullulan is fed at levels up to 10% of the diet, no adverse effects, and no deaths attributable to treatment were observed [Kimoto, -et a/., 1997 Vol 3 Tab 221. Further, systemic exposure of Pullulan to rats resulted in no adverse effects. Humans Appendix APullulan Hayashibara International Inc. GRAS Notification February 5,2002 Section IV Safety consuming HBC Pullulan in an amount of 10 grams per day at a single eating occasion for 14 consecutive days reported sensations of fullness, but no adverse observations were recorded, and there was no change in blood biochemistry 'over the course of the study [Yoneyama, et a/., 1989 Vol 4 Tab 541. Finally, in 20 years of consumption by humans in Japan, where HBC Pullulan has been eaten in a number of food products has not produced a known complaint related to safety. .. The amount in the human study (lOg/day) is nearly equal to the very conservative estimated mean intake reported in Section Ill ,Table 12 (9.41g/d/person). Dr. George C. Fahey, Jr. of the University of Illinois . provided an Expert Opinion on the safety of consuming HBC Pullulan at levels equivalent to those recommended for soluble fiber intake (25gl1000 kcal) for persons with diabetes [Vinik, et a/., 1987 Vol 4 Tab 50; and Fahey, Expert Opinion, 2001 Appendix I]. The conclusion of the Expert Opinion was that HBC Pullulan, when consumed at a concentration of 25g11000 kcal would have the same physiological effects as any other source of soluble fiber; and therefore should pose no threat to human health. A second Expert Opinion by Drs. Donald Ahearn and Libero Ajello addressed the iss.ue of safety of products prepared from the source organism, Aureobasidium pullulans [Ahearn and Ajello, Expert Opinion, 2001 Attachment A]. The conclusion of the Expert Opinion was that products produced from Aureobasidium pullulans could be considered safe. While the fact that the organism is not pathogenic provides reassurance from a theoretical point of view, as a practical matter, the organism does not come into contact with the final Pullulan product. The company's system of Critical Controls specifies that each lot be tested for any viable Aureobasidium pullulans. Written process,controls state that any lot containing the source organism be destroyed (See Section 11). The sterility of the Pullulan product (See Tables 4 and 5, Section II) indicates that the manufacturing process 63 Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Hayashibara International Inc.

Based on the data and information described above, the Expert Opinions commissioned by the company, and more than twenty years of safe use in Japan, Hayashibara has concluded that HBC Pullulan may be considered generally recognized as safe under scientific procedures for its intended use in food, when manufactured and used in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices. 64 Appendix ATO: Alan B.

This is a timely issue as the UL for dietary fiber, broadly defined, will be reviewed in the upcoming report thatwill provide Dietary Rcfercncc Intaka (DRIsj for macronutrients. I was a member of the \"Panel on the Definition of Dietary Fiber\" Lhat wrote the entitled \"Dietary Rcfmenct Intakes: Proposcd Definition of Dietary Fiber\" that will serve as the basis for the recommendation on fiber that will bc published in the macrotlutrient report. That report is scheduled to be published at thc cnd of this year. Tu lhis point in the, potential adverse hcalth effects of dietay fiber are not known but, when ncccssary, each fiber is considered on a case-by- case basis. From the information,that 1 have reviewed, I conclude that pullulan consumption is acceptable when consumed by humans at thc lcvcf of 25 grams/1,000 kcal. Indeed, both the American Medical Association and thc American Dietetic Association recommend that thc total daily intake of dietary fiber should 'be as high as 35 gramddcty, The American Diabetes Association publis11ed.a papcr in 1987. hdicating that a 25 gramn/l,OOO kcal level is desirable for human diabetics. In my 25 years of profcssionai experiencc in the area of djetary fiber, the only negative effect of fiber consumption that T have comc across is in develupiny coltntries where largely unrefined diets we fed and where mineral absorption and rctcntion issues may surface as a result of the poor nutrition cxperienced by thc populations residing there.. But in the case of Western ma&- eating more refined food<, many of thei supplemented with minerals, fiber appears to have no untoward effects on mineral absorption and retention. As regards pullulan itsclf, it is a water solublc alpha-glucan containing alpha-I,4 and alpha-l,6- I. linked glucose units with a stair-stcp structure. Jdpanese rcscarchers fed rats diets containing as much as 10% by wcight of pullulan d found that pullulsln lacked toxicological activity as demonstrated by an entire battcry of specific tests. .: , Appendix APagc 2 The issue is occasiurally raiscd as to whether one cm consume too much fiber. Organoleptic properties of the fiberitself generally will prcvcnt its over-consumption by humans. By thcmsclvcs, many are dry, dusty, or gritty, and it is often the challcngc of the food prepantion specialist to mask lhcir properties when included in complete foods. Thus, maximum Ievcls of incorporation of fibers into many dif\u20acmnt types of food products, including enteral formulas, havc becn defined. These levels nearly always are below the 35 gramdday quantity mdummended by the various medical agcncies. As to whether there 3re adverse events that might occur if humans consumed a high quantity of puUulan, gas production during the early stages of consumption might occur. But colonic microbes usually will adapt to high level fiber feeding aftcr 4 to 7 days, after which gds production will be reduced to nonrial levels. In addition, humans may adapt to high lcvel fiber feeding by graduaIly increasing theii fiber consumption ovcr a 7 day period. This generally will circumvent the problem outlined above. Pullulan should be no different chan any other fiber in this regard. In summrtry, 1. see no problem with pullulan feeding at levels approximating 25 grams/l,OOO kcal. Given its chemical structure, its rate and extent of digestion should be relatively high., it should exert no untoward effects on thc microbial ccosystem of the large bowel or on the morphology of the organ itself, and no negative systemic effects should be demonstrated as a result of its consumption.

GUS Notification Expert Panel Conclusion Hayashibara Pull'ulan Expert Panel Opinion htroduction November 20,2001 The undersigned, an independent panel of recog,nized experts (Expert Panel), qual;ified by their scientific training and relevant national and international experience to evaluate the safety of food and food ingredients, was convened by Hayashibara International Inc. to determine the Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status of Hayashibara Pullulan for use as a food ingredient. The resumes of each Panelist are on file at the offices of Hayashibara International Inc. in Westminster, Colorado. The qualifications of the Panel satisfy the requirements set forth in the Federal Food, Drug, and' Cosmetic Act's definition of generally recognized as safe (GRAS) substances ([j 201 (s)) and 21 CFR 170.30(a) \"Eligibility for classification as generally recognized as safe (GRAS)\". A comprehensive search of the scientific literature for information on the safety/toxicity of Pullulan and Hayashibara Pullulan through September 2001 was undertaken by Lee Dexter and Associates and was made available to the Expert Panel'. The members of the Expert Panel independently evaluated information provided by Hayashibara and other materials deemed appropriate or necessary. Follow'ing this independent and critical evaluation,, the Expert Panel conferred by telephone and' met in Washington, D.C. on July 25, 2001, with representatives of Hayashibara International Inc., who presented additional pertinent safety and functionality information associated with Hayashibara Pullulan. The. information critically evaluated by the Panel was compiled into a GRAS Report, which supports the elig:ibility of Hayashibara Pullulan as a GRAS ingredient in accordance with 21 'CFR 170.36. The information provided for the Panel's review was presented in the form stipulated in 21 CFR 170.35. The Panel unanimously agreed to the GRAS status of Hayashibara Pullulan as a food ingredient when produced and used 'in accorda'nce with current Good Manufacturing Practices and meeting the specifications described herein. Notice of GRAS exemption claim: Hayashibara Pullulan is exempt from premarket approval requirements of the Federal Food, Drug a'nd Cosmetic Act because it has been determiined to be ', ge,nerally recognized as safe (GRAS) under conditions of intended use by experts qualified by scientific training and experience. Appendix APullulan Hayashibara International Inc. GRAS Notification Expert Panel Conclusion November 20,2001 A Summary of the Basis of the GRAS Determination Chemistry and Manufacturing , > Hayashibara Pullulan is a linear a-D-glucan comprised of regular repeating trisaccharide units [Catley, et a/., 1986 Vol 2 Tab 71. > The molecular weight range for commercial Pullulan may range from 50,000 to 5,000,000 daltons, depending upon the conditions under which the organism is grown [Sugimoto, 1978 Vol4 Tab 55, Ueda et a/., 61 , and Catley, et a/., 1,986 Vol 2 Tab 71. Regardless of the molecular weight the Structure is identical. 3+ Structurally, Pullulan is a linkar a-D-gl,ucan comprised of regular repeating trisaccharide units. These maltotrioses (in which three glucose units are li'nked through 1,4-glucosidic bonds) are in turn terminally linked to a series of other maltotrioses through a 1,6-glucosidic bonds creating a' long stair-step-type ' structure [Catley, et a/., 1986 Vol 2 Tab 71. A small percentag,e of maltotetrose units can also be incorporated into the structure. P Hayashibara Pullulan is produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices. );. Hayashibara Pul'lulan is produced using a non-pathogenic and non-toxigenic strain of Aureobasidium pu//u/ans. The organism is cultured and the Pullulan is excreted extracellularly. The culture fluid undergoes several steps to remove impurities and concentrate the Pullulan into the final product . > Hayashibara Pullulan occurs as a white to slightly,yellowish powder, depending on the extent of deionization durimng processing. ,Pullulan products designated PI ha've undergone extensive deionization, and'are white in color. Pul'lulan, which has been purified and designated as food grade (PF) may be white to slightly yellowish.

Use and Functionality 3 Pullulan is a glucose polysaccharide, as are other common food grade ingredients such as starch, dextrin and maltodextrin. All four substances consist of glucose units linked through a-l,4-glucosidic and a-1,6- glucosidic bonds. > Both dextrins and Pullulan are similar to amylopectin molecules that are a main 'component of food starches. k Puliulan has been used in Japan for more that 20 years, a history of safe use that . supports its safety. a > Pullulan is used as both an indirect food ingredient for coatings on food packaging and as a direct food additive in a variety of applications. 3 In 1977, Japanese regulatory authorities approved the use of Pullulan in all food applications. Pullulan was also approved as an auxiliary medical additive and listed in Non-Official Drugs Specifications of the Pharmacopoeia of Jawn in 1986. k Pullulan may be used in foods for a variety of Technical Effects, which are codified at 21 C'FR Q170.3 (0) (1-32): (8) \"Emulsifiers (31) \"Synergists\" (32)\"Texturizers\" > Dietary fiber content (on an as is basis) of five commercial lots of Hayas'hibara Appendix APullulan Hayashibara International Inc. GRAS Notification Expert Panel Conclusion November 20,200 1 Pullulan ranged from 67.5 to 69.5% for PI-20 and from 59.2 to 65.7% for PF-20. 3 The estimated daily mean exposure derived from calculations based on USDA's Continuing Survey of Food Makes by individuals (1996) is 9.41 grams of HBC Pullulan per day. The 90* percentile is then estimated to be 18.82 grams per day. Safety Studies Safety studies in animals and a history of safe use in Japan (>20 years) support the safety of uayashibara Pullulan. , Similarity to Other Foods with a History of Safe Use P Pullu'lan is virtually identical in composition to maltodextrin (which has been affirmed GRAS under 21 CFR Part 184), and to the amylopectin component of food grade starches. All three substances consist of glucose units linked through a-l1,4-and a-l,6-glucosidic bonds. A comparison of the percentage of a-1,6- glucosidic bonds was presented by Hayashibara International Inc. * Appendix APullulan Hayashibara International Inc. GRAS Notification Expert Panel Conclusion November 20,2001 Comparison of the Percent of a 1,6-Glucosidic Bonds in Polyglucoses Pullulan 30% Maltodextrin > Pullulan to other polyglucoses in structure, and the hydrolytic enzymes that degrade it are common to those that hydrolyze other polyglucoses. Therefore, the ultimate degradation product from P'ullulan fermentation is glucose. 'Physiological Function as a Dietary Fiber > Hayashibara Pullulan is a dietary fiber, which functions physiologically as an indigestible polysaccharide [Oku, et a/., 1979 Vol 3 Tab 431. e > Studies conducted on the fate of Pullulan in the digestive tract have demonstrated that it is only partially hydrolyzed by the salivary and pancreatic amylases of the upper GI tract, and that essentiallly no glucose is released during hydrolysis by these enzymes. P The majority of Pullulan is fermented i'n the large intestine to short chain fatty acids [Nakamura, et a/., 1984 Vol 3 Tab 401. However, very small quantities of glucose may be released from Pullulan by tHe action of enzymes in the small intestine [Okada, et a/., 1990 Vol 3 Tab 421. k The difference in the digestibility of Pullulan in comparison to ,, other carbohydrates, such as sta'rch, may be attri'buted to the differing ,percentages of a-l,6-glucosidic bonds. Since Pullulan contains a higher percentage of a-l,6 bonds, it is more resistant to digestion i,n the upper gastrointestinal tract [Okada, et a/., 1990 Vol 3 Tab 42 and Kimoto, et a/., 1997 Vol2 Tab 221. k Normal western diets contain tens to hundreds of grams per day of a-lI6-linked glucose units in common foods [Enns, et a/., 1997 Vol 2 Tab 1 11. P Dr. George C. Fahey, Jr. of t'he University of 'Illinois provided an Expert Opinion Appendix APullulan Hayashibara International Inc. GRAS Notification Expert Panel Conclusion November 20,200 1 on the safety of consuming HBC Pullulan at levels equivalent to those recommended for soluble fiber intake (25g/lOOO kcal) for persons with diabetes [Vinik, et a/., 1987 Vol4 Tab 62; and Fahey, Expert Opinion, 2001 Attachment A]. Dr. Fahey stated that, \"As to whether there are any adverse events that might occur if humans consumed a high quantity of pullulan,, gas production during the early stages of consumption might occur. But colonic microbes usually will'adapt to high level fiber. feeding after 4 to 7 days, after which gas production will be .reduced to normal levels. In addition, humans may adapt to high level fiber feeding by gradually increasing their fiber consurnption over a 7-day period. This generally will circumvent the problem outlined above. Pullulan should be no different than any other fiber in this regard.\" Dr. Fahey conclsuded that, \"Given its chemical .structure, its rate and extent of digestion should ,be relatively hig'h, Nit should, exert no untoward effects on the microbial ecosystem of the large bowel, or on 'the morphology of the organ itself, and no negative systemic effects should be demonstrated as the result of its consumption.\" Safety of the Source Organism P Drs. Donald Ahearn and Libero Ajello provided an Expert Opinion covering products prepared from the source organism, Aureobasidium pullulans [Ahearn and Ajello, Expeit Opinion, 2001 Attachment A]. The conclusion of the Expert Opinion was that, \"Host debilitation is by far the primary factor in the opportunistic or adventitious involvement of saprobic fungi with 'humans. Nevertheless, in our- over 30 years of experience with yeasts and moulds in environ'mental,, industrial I and clinical' settings, the involvement of A. pu//u/ans with any adverse human ' health related problems is extremely rare. We' recommend on the basis of our experiences and our knowledge of the extensive laboratory and industrial applications of A. pullulans that the ,species and its products be recognized under G'RAS status.\" The Experts also stated that reports linking Aureobasidium ,' pullulans to any pathological incident in humans were more rare than those for the commQn industrial yeast, Saccharomyces cerevesiae. Safety Studies > Acute studies in mice and' rats indicated that neither Aureobasidium pullulans nor its lysate were toxigenic at doses up to 20 g/kg body weight. 7 Appendix APullulan Hayashibara International Inc.

The study was terminated at 62 weeks due to intercurrent pneumonia in all groups: There were no consistent treatment-related dose-dependent adverse effects reported on any of the parameters evaluated inchding food consumption, food efficiency, body weight gain, clinicai chemistry, hematology, organs weights, gross and microscopic pathology. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was the highest concentration tested, 10% of the diet, equal to 4450 mg/kg body weightlday males and 5080 mg/kg females. The authors stated that, \"A no-observed-adverse-effect level of 10% in the diet, the highest concentration tested, equal to 4450 mg/kg body weightlday, will su8pport an acceptable daily intake of at least 45mg/kg body weighffday as an ingredient in food\" [Kimoto, et a/., 1997 Vol 2 Tab 221. Digestion and Fermentation of Pullulan in Humans > Yoneyama et a/., investigated the effects of Hayashibara Pullulan (m.w. 50,000) 'by thirteen. healthy humman volunteers who consumed 10 grams of Pullulan/day at lunch, either in water or in soup, for fourteen days. Analysis of stool samples revealed that P'ullulan was completely fermentable by human intestinal bacteria, that no residual Pullulan was detected in the feces, that daily stool weight for those subjects increased by 33%, and that the mean fecal pH levels decreased [Yoneyama et a/., 1989 Vol 4 Tab.72 1.

These indude cellobiose and cellodextrins, beta-cycloderttdns, Fibersol-2 (a resistant maltodextrin), gentiooligosaccharides, glucoohgosaccharides, starch, and cellulose. These compounds vary widely in structure and, as a result, affect site (small intes!ine \\\\ vs. colon) and extent of digestion. None are known to be harmful to humans, and several have been tested in clinical settings. Using starch as an example, it is well known that rate of digestion is affected by the relative amounts of amylose and amylopectin in the polysacchiide. Goddard et al. (1984) explained that the rate of amylose digestion is slower than that of amylopectin because it is a linear molecule whose glucose units participate more readily in hydrogen bonding than do those in the more highly branched amylopectin. This tends to make them less accessible to enzymatic digestion pome et aL, 1983). Further, amylopectin is a larger molecule with more surface area for enzymatic attack. Starch structure and its dgestibility may be modified purposely or inadvertently as a result of food preparation. Annison and Topping (1 994) reported that starch smcture was physically modified by retrogradation such that it became partially inaccessible to enzymatic attack, a fraction of starch known today as resistant starch. Nutritionally, starches can be grouped into glycemic starches and. resistant starches. The former are starches digested in the small intestine into maltose and glucose by alpha-amylase secreted by the pancreas. These sugars are absorbed through the small intestinal wall into the bloodstream and function as the main source of energy for metabolism. Resistant starches are the sum of starches and products of starch degradation that resist digestion and absorption in the small intestine of healthy humans. These starches pass into the colon where they are fermented by colonic microflora, gperating short chain fatty acids butyrate) and gases (carbon dioxide, methane, hydfogen). Vonk et al. (2000) found that highly digestible (-SO%> cornstarch contained 26% and 38% amylopectin. This and other studies have shown that digestibility of resistant starch can drop to -50%. Likewise, maltodexths generally are considered to be highly digestible; however, the addition of heat and enzymatic hydrolysis during preparation of maltodextrins can create a greater variety of bond formations including beta-1,3, beta-1,4, Ad beta-1,6, linkages. Glucose e Appendix A\". digestibility of these modified rnaltodextrins has been shown to be lower than that of unmodified maltodextrins. Clinical studies conducted in our laboratory and in the laboratories of others have sho& that a range of glucose polymers have been well tolerated by animals and humans, and no ad<erse health effects have been noted. Pdulan also is a glucose polymer and its linear structu{e with limited branching appears to reduce its digestibility. There is no indication that pullulaq would be less well tolerated than another glucose-based oligosaccharide or polysaccharide mentioned above. Indeed, a safety study performed on a similar carbohydrate, Fibersol-2 (a resistkt maltodextrin produced by a transglucosidation [that occu during hydrolysis]) indicates neither toxicity rats of greater &an 20 g/kg) nor mutagenicity (Ohkuma and Wakabayashi, 2001). Long term administration did not affect animal growth, weight of internal organs, or any blood biochemical characteristic.: No diarrhea occurred until levels of 1 g/kg body weight was fed.\" Ohkuma, K. and S.

Production Process 1. Production Process Overview HBC Pullulan is produced by mesophilic (220-30\u00b0C) fermentation of a syrup with the black yeast, Aureobasidium pullulans. Aureobasidium pullulans is non-pathogenic, and strains of the organism which produce the least amount of black-pigment, and which require the shortest cultivation periods are used to yield maximum quantities of Pullulan. Pullulan is elaborated extracellularly into the culture medium from which it is recovered and purified' as described below [Catley, 1971 Vol 2 Tab 41. The taxonomy of Aureobasidium pullulans has been detailed by William Bridge Cooke in his 1961 publication covering the black yeasts [Cooke, 1961 , Vol2 Tab 61. The genus Aureobasidium belongs to a group of Fungi lmperfecta, in which several spores are produced on a conidiophore or a conidiophore-like structure. The most common species within this genus is Aureobasidium pullulans. Cooke described the problems of fungal taxonomic development, but concluded that the genus Aureobasidium (formerly known as Pullularia) is the type genus for the family Aureobasidiaceae [Cooke, 1961 , Vol2 Tab 61. The black yeasts are common soil fungi, found on decaying plant matter, and on fruit, such as the seeds of grapes, where they are common spoilage organisms [Durrell, 1967, Vol 2 Tab 71. The dark pigmentation of the yeast is due to melanin, which' stains the cell walls, and may be heavily encrusted on older cells [Durrell, 1967, Vol 2 Tab 71. Aureobasidum pullulans has a global distribution, where it acts as a plant ' pathogen, and an agent of decay [Ajello; 1978 Vol2 Tab I]. It is unique as a fungus, in that it plays all three roles ascribed to fungi in the ecosphere: it decomposes dead organic material, it acts as a pathogen to plants, and it acts as a symbiont with other organisms, such as lichens [Zabel, et a/, 1978 Vol 4 Tab 551. As such Aureobasidum pullulans is ubiquitous in . nature. A. pullulans 'is an important saprobe 'in wood products, causing sap wood stain, and m'ildew on paint, it is a pathogen on some fruits, and vegetables, and as #mentioned above, it is reported to be symbiotic with certain khens [Zabel, et a/, 1978 Vol4 Tab Notification February 5,2002 Auoendix LII Production Process Hayashibara International Inc. I ' Pullulan was described in 1959 by Bender, et a/., who reported that the polysaccharide was formed in Czapek-Dox medium, at a 20-22% yield on glucose, saccharose, and fructose. Thiamine was stimulatory to Pullulan production, increasing the yield to 32%. The optical activity in water of the polymerized product resulting from the work of Bender and his colleagues was [a]02' + 168\" [Bender, et a/., 1959 Vol 2 Tab 21. These authors stated that glucose was the sole product of hydrolysis, and that the material was similar to the bacterial dextrans. In 1971 Catley reported on the carbon sources utilized by what then was called Pullularia pullulans [Catley, 1971 Vol 2 Tab 41. The author stated that after about 100 hours of incubation, the culture gradually, darkened and became. black, due to the production of melanin pigment. Catley confirmed through paper chromatography following acid hydrolysis and depolymerization with pu:llulanase that maltotriose was the major oligosaccharide present, and that glucose was the major monosaccharide [Catley, 1971 Vol 2 Tab 41. In this study traces of tetrasaccharide and galactose were also found. Table 1 demonstrates the effect of carbon source on the yield of Pullulan. 2 Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Hayashibara International Inc.

Pullulan elaboration apparently occurs only when the cells are in the late log phase of growth. Interestingly, the polymer continues to be produced even when the cells have reached the stationary phase [Catley, 1971 Vol 2 Tab 41. The authors stated that the conditions for the production of Pullulan are reminiscent of those in which bacteria accumulate polysaccharide. This. tends to occur as a result of limiting growth cond#itions in the presence of an excess of carbon. Over the last two decades Hayashibara Company, Ltd. has optimized the production of Pullulan. The general production process and its possible variations will be discussed in the following section. Appendix APullulan GRAS Notification Hayashibara International Inc. February 5,2002 ADDendix 111 Production Process 2. The Hayashibara Process The strain of Aureobasidium pullulans used for the production of Pullulan is labeled \"Hayashibara strain\". The organism and the particular strai'n are non-pathogenic and non-toxigenic, and are not the product of genetic modification'. To assure that a pure culture of the Hayashibara strain is used in Pullulan production, stock cultures are freeze-dried and stored in ampules. At the time of cultivation, stock cells are cultured from the ampules and streaked on agar plates. If, after colony formation, the purity of the culture is confirmed, one colony is transferrpd to an,agar slant. This colony is then used as the innoculum for the produhion of Pullulan. To guarantee the purity of the culture, the containers and culture media used for cultivation are thoroughly sterilized and the air, used, for aeration of the culture, is filtered. At regular intervals . during fermentation, microscopic examination, pH determination of the culture and an analysis of Pullulan yield are cond'ucted to assure punty. If a culture is found to be contaminated, it is heat sterilized and discarded. The source of the contamination is determined to the extent possible, and appropriate counter measures are adopted to prevent recurrences. Live organisms of the Hayashibara strain are killed by heat sterilization in the course of producing Pullulan. The absence of the live strain in the product is determined by dissolving Pullulan in sterilized water which is added to an agar plate able to support growth of A. pullulans. Colonies are observed macroscopically and microscopically to assess whether they can be identified as Hayashibara strain. This strain exhibits characteristic growth morphology, and is therefore recognizable. For those colonies that are difficult to classify, inoculation into liquid medium and assessment of the colony's ability to produce Pullulan is determined. The black pigment produced by the Hayashibara strain is decolorized with activated carbon following pH adjustment of the culture medium.

During the review of the Pullulan GRAS Report, a member of the Expmert Panel asked whether or not Aumobasidium pullulans, the source organism for Pullulan, produced an Aureobasidin that might affect the health of human:%. Aureobasidins are substances with anti-fungal activity, which are produced b!y certain strains within the genus Aureobasidium (These were discussed in Sectiorr !I, page 20, ## 7 in the Notification). As we discussed, the Pullulan Notification contains an Expert Opinion by two well-known mycologists (Ajello and Aheam), who iridicated that one would not expect A. pullulens to produce substances toxic to humans. 0 Nonetheless, in order to confirm that no Aumbasidins were present in Hayashibara Pullulan, the company performed a fungal inhibition study using two strains of Sacchammyces ce~visise as the test organisms. Three! lots of Pullulan culture medium and three lots ea& of products PF-20 and PI-20 were assayed for their ability to inhibit the growth of Saccharomyces cemvisiae. As predicted, no inhibition was detected. Although you stated that it was not necessary to submit this data as an amendment, it is available upon request. Please call either Dr. Afan Richards at (303) 650-4590 or myself if the need should arise. 0 Appendix ADEXTER AND ASSOCIATE I Sincerely, PAGE 03/03 March 21, 2002 Dr. Linda Kahl Lee 8.

Pullulan is an essentially linear glucan consisting of 1,6-linked maltotriose and some interspersed maltotetraose units. Pullulan has not previously been evaluated by JECFA but has been recommended for priority evaluation by CCFAC. The commercially available pullulan (Pullulan PI-20) has a purity of more than 90 %. Its average molecular weight (at peak of a gel permeation chromatogram) is about 200 kD. The main impurities are mono-, di- and oligosaccharides, which are carried over from the raw material (hydrolysed starch) into the final product. The specifications for Pullulan include standard parameters for identification and for chemical and microbiological purity. The film-forming properties of pullulan are the basis for its proposed use as a substitute for gelatin in the production of capsule shells (for dietary supplements), as an ingredient of coated tablets (dietary supplements), and as an ingredient of edible flavoured films (breath fresheners). It has been used as an additive and as a food ingredient in Japan since 1976. Specifications for Pullulan were prepared at 65th JECFA (2005) and will be published in FNP 52 Add 13. 2 Description 2.1 Chemistry and nature of the product The name \"pullulan\" was proposed by Bender, who was the first to describe the formation of this extra- cellular polysaccharide by Aureobasidium pullulans (syn. Pullularia pullulans ) (Bender et al., 1959). It is essentially a linear polymer of repeating maltotriose units linked by a-1,6 glycosidic bonds. Depending upon the culture conditions (duration, pH, phosphate concentration, etc.) under which this extra-cellular glucan is elaborated by Aureobasidium pullulans , the molecular weight varies from about 10 to 3 000 kDa (Sugimoto, 2002). \"Pullulan PI-20\" is the brand where \"P\" stands for \"pullulan\", \"I\" for \"dei onized\" and the figure 20 designates the number-average molecular weight (M n) of about 200 kDa (Okada e t al., 1990; Nakamura, 1984). The subject of the present CTA is pullulan (Pullulan PI-20) with a number-average molecular weight (M n) of about 100-200 kDa and a weight-average molecular weight (M w) of about 362-480 kDa ( Okada et al., 1990). The INS No. of pullulan is 1204 , the CAS No. is 9057-02-7, and its chemical formula is (C 6H10O5)n. For P ullulan PI-20, n corresponds to about 1250 glucose units on the basis of M n. The structural formula of p ullulan corresponds 65th JECFA 2 2.2. Natural vs. synthetic origin Pullulan is a naturally occurring, fungal exopolysaccharide produced by Aureobasidium pullulans. The organism is ubiquitous. It is found in soil, lake water, on the surface of latex paint films, synthetic plastic materials, shared-used cosmetic and foods such as cereals, fruits, cheese and tomato (Vadkertiova 1964, Zabel et al., 1980, Webb et al. , 1999, Mislivec et al. , 1993). Because it forms a black pigment (melanin), this organism is also known as \"black yeast\" (Cooke, 1961, Durrell, 1967, Domsch et al., 1993; Gibbs & Seviour, 1996). Pullulan is produced on an industrial scale by fermentation of liquefied starch under controlled conditions using a specific, not genetically modified, non-pathogenic and non-toxigenic strain of Aureobasidium pullulans . 3 Method of manufacture 3.1 Principle Pullulan is produced commercially by mesophilic (22-30\u00b0C) fermentation of hydrolysed starch with a Aureobasidium pullulans (Yuen, 1974; Leathers, 2003; Shingel, 2004) and further purification of the product. Pullulan is formed extracellularly when the cells are in the late log phase and stationery phase of growth (Catley, 1971) and its formation is dependent on a various factors including pH, temperature, substrate and strain (Catley, 1971, Yuen, 1974, Madi et al, 1997, Gibbs and Seviour, 1996, Lazaridou et al. 2002, Sugimoto, 1978, Ueda et al. 1963, 1966). The yield and molecular weight of pullulan can be adjusted by manipulation of the substrate and fermentation conditions. 3.2 Detailed description The manufacturing process is conducted under conditions of good manufacturing practices and uses raw materials and processing aids that comply with food grade specifications. Pullulan is produced by mesophilic fermentation of starch syrup by the selected non-toxigenic strain of Aureobasidium pullulans. The strain has been selected by traditional techniques, i.e. the strain is not the product of genetic modification using recombinant technologies. The production strain has a high yield of pullulan, low production of melanin and does not produce aureobasidin A. After completion of the fermentation, the fungal cells are removed by microfiltration. The cell-free filtrate is heat-sterilized and treated with activated carbon to remove pigments and other impurities by adsorption. The decolourized filtrate is cooled and deionized using cation and anion exchange resins. The deionized solution is concentrated to a solids content of about 12 %, treated a second time with activated carbon, and filtered using diatomaceous earth as a filter aid. The filtrate is concentrated by evaporation to a solids content of about 30 % and dried in a drum dryer. The dried pullulan is pulverized to a specified particle size and packed in sterilized polyethylene bags. 4 Chemical characterization 4.1 CComposition of pullulan Pullulan is an essentially linear polysaccharide (glucan) consisting predominantly of repeating maltotriose units. The maltotriose units, which consist of three 1,4-linked glucose molecules, are linked by \u0001-1,6- glycosidic bonds. This repeating sequence forms a stair-step-type structure (Figure 1). Appendix BChemical and Technical Assessment 65th JECFA 3 Figure 1. Structural formula of pullulan Maltotetraose units consisting of four 1,4-linked glucose molecules also occur, probably randomly, but are rarer (about 6 %) (Wallenfels et al., 1965, Catley, 1971; Carolan et al., 1983). There is also evidence for a rare occurrence of branching points where poly-maltotriosyl side-chains are attached to the main chain by a 1,3-glycosidic bond (Catley et al., 1986; Sowa et al., 1963). 4.2 Physicochemical properties Pullulan PI-20 is a white to off-white, tasteless and odourless powder. It is not hygroscopic. According to the specifications provided by the sponsors it contains less than 6 % water. Pullulan dissolves readily in cold or hot water, but is insoluble in organic solvents, except dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide & Mitsuhashi, 1993). Aqueous of do not form gels. The viscosity (10% w/w, mm2/s. The v iscosity of pullulan solutions resembles that of gum acacia (gum arabic) solutions, i.e. the viscosity of pullulan is rather low in comparison with that of other soluble polysaccharides, such as guar gum (Sugimoto, 1978; Tsujisaka & Mitsuhashi, 1993). Differences in the pH or salt content do not substantially affect the viscosity of pullulan solutions (Sugimoto, 1978). The viscosity of an solution Pullulan decreases upon (10% pH of 5.0-7.0. Molecular gel permeation chromatograms of three batches of Pullulan PI-20 showed a molecular weight at the peak of the chromatogram of 173000-186000 Da with a number-average molecular weight (M n) of 96900-101000 Da and a weight-average molecular weight (M w) of 433000-479000 Da. P ullulan is structurally closely related to starch amylopectin and maltodextrin. All three carbohydrates consist of glucose units linked by \u0001-1,4 and \u0001-1,6-glucosidic bonds. Maltodextrin contains approximately 20% \u0001-1,6-glucosidic bonds and pullulan 30%. In comparison, contains 95% \u0001- 1,4-glucosidic bonds and 5% \u0001-1,6-glucosidic bonds. Differences between pullulan and these glucans, besides the relative proportions of alfa-1,4 and alfa-1,6 bonds, are the tertiary structure of the molecule and the extent and mechanism of degradation of the materials in the human gut. Pullulan can be classified in the group of soluble fibres. 4.3 Possible impurities (including degradation products) Pullulan PI-20 has a purity of more than 90% on a dry substance basis. Since the purity of this polymeric substance cannot be determined directly, it is calculated as the difference between 100% and the sum of the percentages of analytically determined known impurities, i.e. mono-, di- and oligosaccharides (determined with anthrone-sulfuric acid reagent (Morris, 1948)) and water. The purity of 10 batches of Pullulan PI-20 was in the range of 91.2- 95.0 %. Appendix BChemical and Technical Assessment 65th JECFA 4 The analysis of 10 lots of Pullulan PI-20 reveals a combined content of mono-, di- and oligosaccharides of between 5.0 and 8.7%. Mono- and disaccharides constitute about 30-40 % of these non-pullulan carbohydrates. About 37-42% of the molecules have a degree of polymerization (DP) between 3 and 10. These carbohydrates are derived from the food-grade corn syrup, which is used as the raw material for the p roduction of pullulan. The analysis of 10 lots of Pullulan PI-20 reveals ash contents of 0.00-0.16 %. The sources of minerals are the food-grade corn syrup raw material and the inorganic salts, which are added to the culture medium (ammonium sulfate, calcium hydroxide, sodium chloride, diammonium phosphate, dipotassium phosphate, sodium glutamate, magnesium sulfate). The analysis of 10 lots of Pullulan PI-20 using the semi-micro-Kjeldahl method reveals a nitrogen content of 0.002-0.004% (limit of detection: 0.001%). Applying the standard conversion factor of 6.25, this corresponds to a protein content of about 0.01-0.03 %. Specific analyses for lead revealed values of less than 1 mg/kg, i.e. lower than general JECFA limit of 2 mg/kg. Additional analyses of two different batches of Pullulan PI-20 for Cd, Pb, Hg and As confirmed the high purity of the product. Other impurities in pullulan could stem either from the starting material (food-grade corn syrup), the fermentative action and metabolism of Aureobasidium pullulans , or the cell wall of this microorganism. The purification steps that are included in the manufacturing process of Pullulan PI-20 ensure that such by- products are eliminated. Thus particulate materials from the cell walls are removed by micro filtration and treatment with activated carbon; ionic compounds (e.g. fermentatively produced organic acids) are removed during the deionization step; organic compounds (e.g. melanin, protein) are absorbed during the treatment with activated carbon; and volatile products (e.g. fermentatively formed ethanol) disappear during the final evaporation and drying. Two batches of Pullulan PI-20 were subjected to detailed microbiological analysis. With the exception of the test for so called 'flat sour spores', none of the applied tests gave a result above the threshold of detection. Flat sour spores were found in one of the two tested batches only at 2 CFU/g. Flat sour spores represent mainly Bacillus stearothermophilus and Bacillus coagulans . It is likely that these heat-resistant, spore-forming microorganisms originate from the raw material, i.e. corn syrup. The canning industry, for example, accepts sugar with flat sours of up to 7.5 CFU/g. There was no evidence for the presence of Aureobasidium pullulans in ten examined batches. This microorganism would be detected in the tests for yeast and moulds. Analyses for total mesophilic bacteria demonstrate the high microbiological purity of the product. Some strains of Aureobasidium pullulans produce aureobasidin A, which is toxic to fungi and yeast at low c oncentrations (0.1-0.5 \u0003g/ml). The strain used for the production of pullulan has been checked for aureobasidin production. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a sensitive tester strain, it was determined that neither pullulan (samples from six commercial batches) nor the unpurified filtrate of the pullulan culture medium contained aureobasidin-like activity (limit of detection 2 ppm) (Hasimoto & Fukuda, 2002). There are no observations that would indicate that Aureobasidium pullulans produces mycotoxins other than aureobasidin. Two batches of Pullulan PI-20 were analysed for the presence of aflatoxins (B 1, B2, G 1, G 2), zearalenone, sterigmatocystin and ochratoxin. Using standard analytical methods, all batches te sted negatively for these mycotoxins. Tests of two batches of Pullulan PI-20 with a number of tester strains for antibacterial activity gave negative results. Appendix BChemical and Technical Assessment 65th JECFA 5 4.4 Analytical methods The analytical methods for the proposed specifications of pullulan are based on general tests for identity and purity published in Food and Nutrition Paper 5, Rev 2 (FAO, 1991) (solubility, pH, sulfated ash, loss on drying, lead, nitrogen determination, microbiological criteria and spectrophotometry), as well as the determination of mono-, di- and oligosaccharides with Dreywood's anthrone reagent (Morris, viscosity using a Ubbelohde-type (falling-ball) viscometer. 4.5 Rationale for proposed specifications The specifications proposed for Pullulan are based on the manufacturing process and raw materials and define the composition of the material of commerce. The parameters tested include the identified components of pullulan. Specifications of polymeric carbohydrates take into consideration the heterogeneous composition of these products with respect to chain length, degree of branching, etc. Pullulan is a glucan, i.e. a homopolysaccharide consisting solely of glucose molecules, and the definition of the purity of pullulan as 'not less than 90% of glucan'\" is, therefore, consistent with current practice. Batches containing less than 90% of glucan on an anhydrous basis would not meet the proposed specifications. Levels of possible impurities are also included in the specifications to ensure that these levels remain at a minimum and that the article of commerce is identical to that evaluated in the toxicological tests. The lead limit is included in the specifications for safety purposes and is lower than the general limit adopted by JECFA. In addition, analytical data for 10 different manufacturing batches of Pullulan PI-20 indicate that the method of manufacture produces a consistent product and suggests that the finished product produced by the described manufacturing process complies with the proposed specifications. 5 Functional uses Pullulan is used as a glazing agent, as a film forming agent, as a thickener or as a carrier in the production of capsules for dietary supplements (substitute for gelatin), coatings for coated tablets (dietary supplements), for production of edible flavoured films (breath fresheners), jams and jellies, confectionery and some meat and fruit products. It is also used as a texturizer in chewing gum and as a foaming agent in milk based desserts. 5.1 Technological function Pullulan forms transparent, water-soluble, fat-resistant, Sugimoto, 1978; Yuen, 1974). Films prepared by rapid evaporation of a 5-10% aqueous pullulan solution applied to a smooth surface and dried. Very thin films (down to 0.01mm) can be made (Yuan, 1974). By admixture of other components, the relevant properties of these films can be modified (Yuen, 1974; Shih, 1996; Biliaderis et al., 1999; Diab et al., 2001). By compression moulding or extrusion at elevated temperature, pullulan films can be formed to shaped bodies (Hijiya & Shiosaka, 1974). Because of these properties, Pullulan PI-20 can be used as a substitute for gelatin in the production of capsule shells for dietary supplements and medicinal products. Pullulan-based edible films can also serve as a matrix to hold flavours. Pullulan films with, for example, menthol dissolve quickly on consumption, releasing the bound flavour and thus acting as an instant breath freshener. Because pullulan-based films have a low permeability to oxygen and humidity, pullulan may also be used for the coating of foods in tablet form (dietary supplements). In this application, it protects susceptible ingredients (nutrients, colours, flavours) from deterioration and thus preserves the nutritional and organoleptic quality of the products. 5.2 Food Categories and use levels Appendix BChemical and Technical Assessment 65th JECFA 6 Pullulan-based capsule shells may contain 15-90% pullulan. Pullulan-based, flavoured, edible films consumed as breath fresheners may contain up to 90% pullulan. The coating of tablets with pullulan results in products with a content of up to 2% pullulan. Use levels of pullulan in jams and jellies, chewing gum, confectionery and some meat, milk and fruit products are in the range of 0.2 to 5%. 6 Reactions and Fate in Foods 6.1 Stability The chemical structure and thus the reactivity of pullulan resembles that of maltodextrin and starch, both of which are common constituents of food. Having a large molecular weight, Pullulan PI-20 is essentially non-reducing. It is stable in aqueous solution over a wide pH range (3-8) (Wallenfels et al., 1965). Only prolonged heating at pH< 3 leads to a decrease of viscosity which is indicative of hydrolytic depolymerization (Nakamura, 1984). On dry heating, pullulan decomposes and carbonizes at 250-280\u00b0C (Tsujisaka & Mitsuhashi, 1993). 6.2 Chemical interactions with nutrients Because it does not contain any chemically reactive group, pullulan is not expected to interact chemically with other nutrients in foods. As it is not degraded by the digestive enzymes of the human alimentary tract to a significant extent, pullulan remains intact in the small intestine. Having a low viscosity and a chemical structure lacking anionic or cationic groups at recommended levels of intake, pullulan is not expected to impair the small-intestinal absorption of essential nutrients such as vitamins and minerals (Gordon et al., 1995, Gorman & Bowman, 1993, Rossander et al., 1992, Kelsay, 1990). 7 References Bender H., Lehmann J. and Glass transition and physical properties of polyol-plasticized pullulan-starch blends at Res 114: 237-243.

Pullulan is a polysaccharide produced from a yeast. Pullulan has been used as a food ingredient for over 20 years in Japan. It has Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) status in the US for a much wider range of applications and thus higher intakes th an the current application. The proposed use is in the production of caps ule shells and of coated tablets for the preparation of dietary supplements and as a matrix for edible flavoured films (breath fresheners). The toxicological data base for pullulan is limited but indicates that pullulan is of low toxicity. Human volunteer st udies have only reported abdomin al fullness at doses of 10g pullulan per day with other mild gastrointestinal symptoms at higher doses. Exposure in adults at the specified worst case assu mptions (12 tablets and a packet of breath freshening films) would be around 23% of this amount . The Panel noted that the manufacturer claims a non-toxin producing strain of Aureobasidium pullulans is used for the production of PI-20, this should be included in the specification. On the basis that pullulan is similar to other poorly digested carbohydrates and that the current proposed usage levels are below the level lik ely to cause abdominal fullness, the Panel Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 2consider that the expected inta kes of pullulan would not presen t any concern when used as a food additive in the proposed uses and at the usage levels requested. If high er levels of use or other uses were to be requested then more data might be required. Key Words Pullulan, food supplements, edible films, breath fresheners BACKGROUND A dossier for the use of pullula n as a new food additive was s ubmitted to the Commission who subsequently asked EFSA to consider the safety of pullulan in the proposed uses. This work falls to the EFSA Scientific Panel on Food A dditives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food. Pullulan is a naturally occurring, fungal exopolys accharide first described by Bender (1959). It has film-forming properties and ca n be used as a substitute fo r gelatine or other film-forming polymers in certain foods. The petitioner specifically addresses the use of pullulan in the production of gelatine-free capsule s and coated tablets for dietary supplements and for edible flavoured films for consumption as breath fresheners. Pullulan is produced by Aureobasidium is also known as \"black yeast\" because it also produces melanin (Cooke, 1961) According to the petitioner pullulan has been exte nsively used for more than twenty years in Japan where it is classified as a food ingredient. Its main use has been as a glazing agent with oxygen-barrier properties. Pullulan is accepted for use as an excipient in pharmaceutical tablets and is listed in the Japa nese Standards for Ingredients for Drugs. It has GRAS status in the US for a much wider range of applications and thus higher intakes than those to be expected from the current application. T ERMS OF REFERENCE Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 3The Commission asks the European Food Safety Authority to provide a scientific opinion on the safety of pullulan as a new food additive (f oodstuffs in capsule and coated-tablet form) or as flavoured edible films (bre ath-freshening edible films). ASSESSMENT Technical data Pullulan is essentially a linear polymer of re peating maltotriose units consisting of two (1 4) linked -D glucose molecules followed by a (1 6) linked -D-glucose molecule. Maltotetraose units (Wallenfels, 1965, Carolan et al. , 1983) are often found at the terminal ends and may occasionally be found internally where they can be cleaved by salivary amylase which cleaves 1986; Tsujisaka and Mitsuhashi, 1993). Occasional branch points (Wallenfels et al., 1965) with 1 3 glycosidic linkages (Sowa et al., 1963) may also be found (Tsuji saka and Mitsuhashi, 1993; Gibbs et al., 1996). The empirical formula of pullulan is (C 6H10O5)n where n routinely ranges from around 300 to 12,000 molecules i.e. molecular wei ghts of approximately 0.05 - 2 x 106 daltons. The EFSA (2004) 85, 1-32 4 The molecular weight of pullulan can vary considerably (see above and numerous other references, e.g. Wallenfels et al. 1965, Wiley et al. (1993). Molecular weight standards are available from ~1000 daltons up (Okada et al. 1990). The commercial product for which authorisation is requested is Pullulan PI-20 (P for pullulan, I to indicate that the produc t is deionised and 20 the average molecular weight of 200,000 daltons). According to the petitioner the pr oduct as commercialised (PI-20) \"has a number average molecular weight (M n) of about 100,000 to 200,000 daltons and a weight average molecular weight (M w) of about 362,000 to 480,000 daltons (Okada et al., 1990). Production of pullulan by Aureobasidium pullulans occurs when the cells are in the late log phase (Catley, 1971) and stationary phase and is dependent on a range of factors including, temperature, pH, substrate, medium and st rain (Catley, 1971, Gi bbs and Seviour, 1996, Lazaridou et al. 2002; 1978, Mitsuhashi, 1993, Ueda et al. 1963, 1996, Yuen, 1974). The yield and molecular weight of pullulan can be adjusted by manipulation of the substr ate and fermentation conditions (Wiley, et al. , 1993). Pullulan can be made into very thin films (down to 0.01 mm, Yuan, 1974). These have a high tensile strength and are stable over a range of temperatures. Pullulan films have a low oxygen permeability, are oil and grease resistant and dissol ve rapidly in water. Pullulan films are usually prepared by rapid evaporation of a 5-10% aqueous pullulan solution applied to a smooth surface and dried; it may also involve the use of high temp erature and pressure. Pullulan can also be made into shaped bodies. Optimally such bodies are made from pullulan of a molecular weight of around 250,000 dalt ons. This process usually involves rapid evaporation of water, compression moulding or ex trusion at high temperat ure. A wide range of food, industrial and pharmaceutical applications have been cite d for pullulan films. Pullulan can be mixed with a range of other food or non-food materials to alter the physical characteristics of pullulan films. Commonly pullu lan may be mixed with gelatine, amylose and polyvinyl alcohol. Pullulan films or shaped bodies alcohols plasticisers; e polyvinyl alcohol (Shih, 1996, Yuan, 1974, Biladeris et al., 1999, Diab et al. 2001). Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 5 Description A white to off-white tasteless, odourless powde r that forms a viscous non-hygroscopic solution when dissolved in water at 5-10%. It can be ma de into films of high tensile strength and low oxygen permeability. Pullulan starts to decompose at 250\u00b0 C and chars at 280 \u00b0C (Tsujisaka and Mitsuhashi, 1993) Solubility Highly soluble in water, dilute alkali, insoluble in alcohol and other organic solvents except dimethylsulphoxide and formamide (Wallenfels et al. (1965). According to the petitioner a 10% w/w solution of PI-20 ha s a pH between 5 and 7. Specifications Proposed specifications for pullulan PI-20 have been provided by the petitioner. These are based on those detailed for pullulan listed in The Japanese Pharmaceutical Excipients (Ministry of Health and Welfare, 1993), which al so includes a limit for heavy metals. These values are similar to those of some of th e modified celluloses (JECFA, 1992; EC, 2003). According to the petiti oner the substance is 90% pure calculated as the difference between total dry weight and the sum of the known impurities (e.g. ash, mono, di and oligo saccharides). Details of impurities together w ith the method of analysis is provided by the petitioner. Possible impurities correspond to thos e listed in the proposed specifications, i.e. mono, di and oligosaccharides de rived from the raw material (f ood grade corn starch) used to produce pullulan (not more than 10%), inorga nic compounds (not more than 0.5%) and lead (not more than 1mg/kg). Additiona l specifications are used by the petitioner for internal quality control. These include limits for heavy metals, protein and arsenic. Levels of impurities as assessed from the analysis of 10 batches of PI-20 are included in the dossier. The suggested specifications were met for all ba tches. Independent analysis of 2 batches of pullulan for heavy metals, mycotoxins and microbiol ogical contamination have also been provided. Analysis of three batches of pullulan PI-20 for mono, di and oligosaccharides indicated that an average of approximately 30% of the total (mono, di and oligosaccharides) had a degree of polymerization (DP) of 1, 27% had a DP 11 (oligosaccharides) with the remainder being of intermediate sizes. According to the petitioner these non-pu llulan carbohydrates are derived from the raw material used to produce pullulan (food grade corn starch). Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 6Microbiological purity - Impurities could in clude the production strain, and cell wall components. Flat-sour bacteria sp ore-forming members of the genus Bacillus , (mainly B. stearothermophilus and B. coagulans ) were detected in one batch out of two at 2 colony forming units/g analysed. These possibl y originate from the raw materials. A. pullulans is removed from the fermentation broth by micr ofiltration and the filtrate sterilised by a proprietary heat treatment step using conditions suffici ent to prevent carry over of the source organism (according to the petitioner A. pullulans is killed when heated to 60\u00b0C for 1 minute). A. pullulans was not detectable in 10 batches tested. Production strain - The petitioner claims that their production strain has been selected by traditional means, without additional antibiotic resistance being introduced. It is not a genetically modified organism. The production strain has a high yield of pullulan, low production of melanin and does not produce aureobasidin A. Viscosity Pullulan solutions are viscous but do not gel. There is a linear relationship between the viscosity and molecula r weight (Wallenfels et al. , 1965, Nakamura et al. , 1984). Viscosity is relatively independent of pH (<2 to >11) and temperature. Heating at 90 \u00b0C for an hour reduces the viscosity of large polymers (around 300,000 daltons) by about 10% whereas there was little change in the molecular weight of smaller molecules (60,000-100,000 dalt ons). Viscosity is also unaffected by heating to 100\u00b0C for 6 hours in 30% NaCl (Sugimoto, 1978, Tsujisaka and Mitsuhashi, 1993). Manufacture Pullulan is made commercially by growing pullulan prod ucing strains of Aureobasidium pullulans in appropriate media and then extracti ng and purifying pullulan from the culture media (Sugimoto, 1978, Yuen et al. , 1974). An overview of the production is given by Sugimoto (1978). Specific details of the manufac ture of PI-20 by the petitioner are provided in the dossier. The following is an abbreviated vers ion of the process take n from the petitioner's dossier. A non GM strain of Aureobasidium pullulans , selected for its high yield and low melanin production is used with corn syrup as a substrate. Following fermentation and Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 7microfiltration to remove fungal cells the mixture is heat sterilised, deco lourised, deionized and concentrated and then decolouris ed and filtered for a second time. The resulting filtrate is concentrated by evaporation to a nomin al solid content, dried and crushed. In-process controls are applied at all stages of the process. Partic ulate materials from the fungal cell wall are removed by microfiltration and tr eatment with activated carbon; ionic compounds (e.g. organic acids) are removed during th e deionisation step; organic compounds (e.g. melanin, protein) get absorbed during the tr eatment with activated carbon; and volatile products (e.g. ethanol) volatilize duri ng the final evaporation and drying. METHODS OF ANALYSIS IN FOOD As described by the petitioner this is a three step pr ocess involving; (a) isolation and extraction, which may be carried out either by Prosky's method (Prosky, et al. , 1988), or by aqueous extraction of the pullulan food and precipitation with methanol in the presence of KCl; (b) digestion with pullulanase; (c) analysis of samples of the initial extract from the first stage (a) and the pullulanase treated sample by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine concentrations of maltotriose molecules. Case of need and proposed uses The petitioner cites pullulan's film-forming propert ies as the basis for its proposed uses for the following: - a substitute for gelatine, and thus suitable for vegetarians, in the production of capsule shells for dietary supplements; - as an ingredient of coated tabl ets for dietary supplements; and - as a matrix for edible flavoure d films (breath fresheners). Intended usage levels are 15 to 90% pullulan in capsule shells, up to 2% tablet weight when used as a coating for tablets and up to 90% pullu lan in breath freshening films. Using the petitioner's estimate that the average capsule shell weighs 100 - 150 mg and that tablets weigh 1.2 - 1.5 g this equates to between 15 and 135 mg pullulan per capsule and 24 to 30 mg Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 8pullulan per tablet. Breath freshening strips we igh 32 mg each so may contain up to 29 mg pullulan. According to the petitioner the use of pullulan as a substitute for gelatine in coated capsules and tablets offers consumers, and especially vegetarians, the option of avoiding gelatine. In addition, the low oxygen permeability of pullu lan films \"protects susceptible ingredients (nutrients, colours, flavours) from deterioration and thus preserves the nutritional and organoleptic quality of the produc ts\". According to the petitioner pullulan's fast dissolving qualities and ability to act as a matrix for fla vours makes pullulan based edible films suitable for use as instant breath freshene rs that dissolve in the mouth. Predicted exposure The petitioner is unable to provide any data on th e intake of dietary suppl ements in Europe nor does he provide an estimate of average consumpt ion of breath-freshening edible films. An estimate of consumption was ma de by the Panel based on the assu mption that individuals will not normally exceed six capsules per day and that extreme consum ers will not take more than double this amount. Another assumption was that they would not consume more than a standard packet (containing 24 individual films) of breath freshe ning films per day. On this basis using the maximum usage levels, intake would be around 2.3 g pullulan per day. This assumes that an individual may inge st on a daily basis twelve supplements as capsules with 150 mg shells containing 90 % pullulan and the individual consumes a packet of breath freshening strips cont aining 90% pullulan. UK data 1 on the consumption of food supplements pr ovides information on the consumption of food supplements by adults (Henderson et al. , 2002) young persons, 4-18 years, (Gregory et al., 2000) and toddlers aged 1.5 to 4.5 years, (Gregory et al. , 1995). The surveys indicate that 24% of adults2, 14% of young people3 and 17% of toddlers4 consumed food supplements. These data do not discriminate between tablets and capsules, thus except for toddlers worst case intakes have been calculated assuming that all supplemen ts were in capsule form. The 1 Calculations provided by the UK Food Standards Agency 2 based on 1724 adults surveyed 3 based on 1701 young people surveyed Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 997.5th percentile of estimated intake in consumers was 945 mg/day for adults (deriving from 7 capsules a day) and 270 mg/day for young people (deriving from 2 capsules a day). Assuming toddlers do not consume capsules the estimated 97.5th percentile intake in consumers was 210 mg pullulan per day (deriving from 7 tablets a day). The panel considered that whereas small chil dren probably do not cons ume breath fresheners this would not necessarily be true fo r older children and teenagers. Information provided by the petitioner in support of its application for GRAS status as a food ingredient the US (see existing authorisations) and evaluated by the petitioner's expert panel quotes estimated average and 90 th percentile daily intakes of pullulan as 9.4 and 18.8 g/person/day for the uses specified in its application for use as a food (which are wider than in the current request to the EU). The FDA considered these values in good agreement with their independent daily intake estimates of pullul an based on food categories and usage levels provided by the petitioner, which would be 10 g/person/day at th e mean and 20 g/person/day at the 90th percentile (GRAS, 2002). The notification does not specify if these estimates are for the total population or consumers only. Existing authorisations and evaluations According to the petitioner pullulan has been used extensively in Japan for more than twenty years having been in commercial production since 1976. In Japan it is classified by the Food Chemical Section, Environmenta l Department, and Ministry of Health and Welfare as a food ingredient . It is also used as an excipient in pharmaceutical tablets and is listed in the Japanese Standards for Ingredients for Drugs (Min istry of Health and Welfare, 1993) Pullulan was accepted for GRAS status in the US by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2002. This was based on the company's assertion that pullulan is GRAS (FDA, 2002) and supported by the report of an inde pendent panel assembled by the petitioner. It examined the information on pullulan and considered it met GRAS criteria for its status as a food ingredient. The FDA's GRAS notice not es that pullulan has not been separately evaluated by the FDA and that the onus of en suring that food ingredients marketed by the 4 based on a survey of 1675 toddlers Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 10company are \"safe, and are otherwise in compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements\" lies with the manufacturer. The GRAS noti ce covers a wider range of applications than the current application to the EU Commi ssion and thus is commonl y referred to as 'black yeast' due to melanin formation (Cooke 1961). The organism is ubiquit ous. It is found in soil, lake water (Vadertiova 1994), weathered wood and plant leafs, on the surface of latex paint films (Zabel et al. , 1980) and synthetic plastic materials (Webb et al. , 1999), shared-use cosmetics (Mislivec et al. , 1993) and foods such as fruits, cer eals, tomato and cheese. The petitioner claims that their production strain has been selected by trad itional means, without additional antibiotic resistance being introduced. It is not a genetically modified organism. The production strain has a high yield of pullulan and low production of melanin. Some strains produce aureobasidin A, a cyclic depsipeptide which is toxic to fungi and yeast, but has an LD50 >200 mg/kg bw in mice. According to the petitioner no aureobasidi n was detected from the production strain or culture medium filtrate using a sensitive yeast ( Saccharomyces Fukuda, Amase Institute, Japan, 2002). No other mycotoxins have been detected in two batches analysed. Effect on intestinal flora Ingested pullulan is not signifi cantly degraded by the digestive tract enzymes due to the high percentage (30%) of alpha 1,6-glucosidic linkage s, whereas it was completely fermented by the microbial flora of the colon like other fermenta ble dietary fibre. Changes in caecal microbial flora were in S-D fed polydextrose and pectin. The relative number of bifidobacteria (in relation to total counts) was increased and Bacteroides decreased (Sugawa-Katayama et al. , 19945). In human studies 10g of 50, 000 dalton molecular weight pullulan ingested daily for 14 days was not det ected in stool samples and therefore it was concluded that it was completely metabolised by th e intestinal flora to short chain fatty acids. Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 1-32 number of bifidobacteria increased from 11. 9% to 21.9% of the total flora (Yoneyama et al., 1990). Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion On the basis of the structure and molecular weight of pullulan, it can be assumed that it will not be absorbed as such. In vitro studies Human faecal cultures prepared from fresh stools (5 adult males) were incubated anaerobically with 4% w/w pullulan PR-5 (number average molecular weight 50,000) for up to 24 hours, then assayed for short chain fa tty acids (SCFAs), water solu ble saccharide and molecular weight of the undigest ed pullulan (Okada et al. , 1990). The pullulan was fully digested in 4 - 8 hours yielding a maximum of 52.7 g SCFA/100g pu llulan. On this basis the energy value for SCFA was estimated as 2.05 kc al/g. The authors noted that assuming 100% SCFA absorption may be unrealistic and that with increasing pullula n intake more SCFA may be excreted in the faeces. Digestion of pullulan film (molecular weight unspecified) and nine other polymers, including other carbohydrate polymers (starch - powder and film, levan and cellulose films) was investigated in vitro using an enzyme mix (Kunkel and Se o, 1994). A 1% pullulan solution was treated with the enzyme -amylase, amyloglucosidase, peptidase, protease, invertase and es. Analysis of oligos accharides by HPLC provided an estimate of the degree of carbohydrat e hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of pullulan was less than 10%. By comparison, hydrolysis of levan powder and cellulose film was less than 5%, whereas starch powder and starch film were hydrolysed by more than 90%. Digestion of pullulan PI-20 (number averag e molecular weight around 200,000 daltons, containing about 8% low molecu lar weight - <10,000 non pullulan sugars) and pullulan reagent PR-5 (a pullulan molecular weight standard, number average molecular weight 50,000, with no low molecular weight s ugar contamination) were carried out using conditions designed 5 Paper in Japanese, abstract and figure legends in English, information from abstract Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 12to simulate conditions in the human gut (Okada et al. , 1990). For PI-20 digestion was sequential with the mixture being sampled and desa lted prior to proceeding to the next phase. Digestion was carried out using: (a) human saliva as a source of amylase, (b) artificial gastric juice (16.7 mM HCl-KCl, pH2.0), (c) commerc ial porcine pancreatic amylase and (d) a commercially available rat small intestinal enzy me preparation. The molecular weight of the hydrolysed pullulan was analysed by HPLC and s howed that PI-20 was sequentially reduced in size to around 70,000 daltons foll owing digestion with the rat intestinal enzyme preparation. PI-20 was cleaved by human saliva and pancreatic amylase without glucos e release, but with a small increase in reducing sugar content (0.6 and 0.7% respectively). Digestion with the intestinal enzyme extract resulted in a 6.6% increase in glucose. PR-5 (50,000 daltons molecular weight) was hydrolysed by the rat inte stinal enzyme preparation to produce 2.7% glucose but was not affected by any of the ot her treatments. The authors suggest that the glucose is produced by hydrolysis of the 14 bond from the non-reducing end of the molecule and terminates at the 16 bond. Pullulan standards with molecular weights ranging from 380,000 to 990 da ltons were digested with small intestinal enzymes in vitro (as above). Above 100,000 daltons the amount of gluc ose released was 1.5% but increased with decreasing size to a maximum of 36% for the smallest sample. Using their modification (Wolf et al. , 1999) of Muir and O'Dea's (1992, 1993) validated in vitro protocol for mimicking physiological digestion conditions fo r \"resistant starch\" Wolf et al., (2003), report that 95% of a pullulan prep aration was hydrolysed in a five hour period compared to 0.5 hours for 98-100% hydrolysis of a maltodextose solution under the same conditions. They use these data to support th eir view that pullulan is a slowly digested carbohydrate (see human studies below). Animal studies . Fasted male Wistar rats (150-170g, 5 animals per group) were administered 2ml of a 10% pullulan (49,000 daltons, 302 glucos e molecules) solution by gavage. Animals were killed 60 minutes later. Homogenates of the stomach and small intestine were analysed for glucose to estimate the extent of pullulan hydrolysis. Comparison of the glucose concentrations in homogenates of pullulan treated animals with those of control animals s uggested that about 3% of the pullulan was hydrolysed, resulting in the release of glucose (measured as reducing sugar equivalents). The authors did not determine whether the pullul an hydrolysis products were absorbed in the small intestine. Data on the increase in reducing sugar obtained following Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 13gavaging rats with a pullulan solution are clos e to the authors' theoretical estimate of approximately 2.5% hydrolysis of pullulan of th is size calculated on the basis that 93% of the glucose molecules of the pullulan used in this study were maltotriose molecules and 7% maltotetrose molecules (w hich contain one alpha 1 4 linkage that would be susceptible to amylase, Cately et al. , 1986). However the authors also not ed that the gut contains low level glycoamylase activity which is capable of hydrolysing alpha 1 4 and alpha 1 6 bonds from the non-reducing end (albeit very slowly) (Oku et al., 1979). Toxicology Acute Toxicity An oral LD50 of 14 g/kg was reported for pullulan (in ol ive oil suspension) in dd mice, based on 100% survival of animals given this dose. Similarly in a study using the same strain of mice the LD50 for Aureobasidium pullans, a pullulan producing yeast (sus pended in distilled water) was reported as > 24 g/kg (Anon. a & b, 1974). There were no signs of toxicity in groups of 5 male and 5 female Sprague Dawley rats (Crj: CD, SPF) in the 14 days following a si ngle oral dose of a 66.7% lysate of Aureobasidium pullans at 10 or 20 g/kg (Ohnishi and Tsukamoto 1996). Sub-chronic Toxicity Animal studies Pullulan (molecular weight unspecified) supplied by the petitioner was administered in the diet to groups of fifteen 4 week old male and fema le Sprague Dawley rats (SD-JCL) for 62 weeks, when the study was terminated due to high mortality in all groups . Animals were fed ad libitum on a standard solid diet supplemented with 0, 1, 5 or 10 % pullulan, thus the diets were not isocaloric (Kotani et al. 1976, Kimoto et al . 1997). Animals were observed daily, body weights and food intake were recorded on a weekly basis. At termination internal organs were weighed and examined (macro and microscopically ), blood and urine were taken for analysis. Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 14Blood was tested for standard haematology: blood sugar, seru m protein, albumin/globulin ratio, total cholesterol, transaminase s (GOT, GTP), alkaline phosphatase. Urine was analysed for protein, sugar, blood, ketones and pH. Mortality was high in all groups , and was reported to be due to pneumonia. Survival to termination showed a dose-related trend in fema les (87, 67, 67 and 40% at 0, 1, 5 and 10% pullulan, respectively) but not in males (47, 60, 27 and 47% at 0, 1, 5 and 10% pullulan, respectively). There were no significant differen ces in bodyweight gain or food consumption. For male rats food consumption ranged from between 123 and 144 g/kg bw/day at week one to 34 - 41 g/kg bw/day at week 62; average intake of control animals over the 62 weeks was 46 g/kg bw/day. Food intake for females was 110 to 132 (week 1) to 42 to 47 g/kg bw/day (week 62), average intake of the control animals over the 62 week period was 56 g/kg bw/day. Average pullulan intakes over the 62 week period were: bw/day pullulan group and 0.5 g/kg bw/day for the 1% group. Similarly the average pullulan intakes for female s over the same period were: 5.2, 2.6, and 0.5 g/kg bw/day for the 10%, 5 and 1% pullulan fe d groups. The terminal bodyweights of the low and high dose males were significantly lower than those of the controls, but this effect was not dose-related (89, 96 and 91% of control at 1, 5 and 10% pullulan, respectively). There were no significant differences in the females. Some significant differences were observed in absolute organ weights. In males the absolute weight of brain was increased (low dose), absolute weights of heart, liver, kidney and submandibular gland were decreased. In females, the absolute weight of the brain was decreased (l ow and mid dose), absolu te weights of heart, liver, caecum and spleen were increased at some doses. Since these changes were not clearly dose-related and relative organ weights did not di ffer significantly, they are unlikely to be of biological relevance. The authors suggested that the 46% increase in absolute caecal weight in the females treated with 10% pullulan was a phys iological response to undigested pullulan. A small number of statistically si gnificant changes were observed in haematological and clinical chemistry parameters, which were not dose-relate d. No significant di fferences were observed in urine analysis for any of the groups. Reporte d histopathological observations did not suggest any dose-related effects but conf irmed that animals from all gr oups had bronchitis. This study indicates that 62 weeks administration of pu llulan at dietary concentrations up to 10%, (4.4g/kg bw day for males and 5.2g/kg bw day for females) did not result in adverse effects. However, the value of the study is limi ted by the infection and poor survival. Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 weight 49,000 daltons, circa 302 glucose mol ecules) was administered in the diet to groups of 5-10 male Wistar rats (50-60g) in two separate studies (Oku et al. , 1979). In the first study doses of 0, 20 and 40% pullulan (approximately 10 and 20 g pullulan/kg bw/day) were fed for 4 or 9 weeks. In th e second study doses of 0, 5 and 10% pullulan (approximately 2.5 and 5 g pullulan /kg bw/day) were fed for 4 or 7 weeks (pullulan) or 4 or 9 weeks (control). The control and pullulan di ets contained 4% cellulose with a total carbohydrate content of 69%, achieved by additi on of cornstarch. Bodyweights were recorded at unspecified intervals throughout the studies. At termination, in ternal organs were weighed. The authors noted that \"several\" rats in the 40% pullulan groups occasionally developed diarrhoea or soft faeces throughout the study peri od, whereas rats in other dose groups did not. Pullulan administration resulted in a dose-related decrease in bodyweight gain, with bodyweights significantly di fferent from control in the 20 an d 40% dose groups from about 10 days until the end of the study at 9 weeks (terminal bodyweights 86 and 78% of control, respectively). At 5 and 10% pullulan, bodyweights were significantly reduced after 10-14 days, but not at the end of the study (7 weeks). After 4 weeks of treatment, the relative stomach weights were significan tly increased (to about 120% of control) at 5 and 10% pullulan, but not at 20 or 40% pullulan. This pattern was apparently reversed by longer administration, wi th increased relative stomach weight (112% of control) after 9 weeks at 20 and 40% pullula n and no change after 7 weeks at 5 and 10% pullulan. The relative small intestine weights were increased at 20 and 40% pullulan after 4 weeks (140 and 160% of control, respectively), and by about 20% at all doses at the longer time points. The relative large intestine weights were increased after 4 weeks at all doses of pullulan (130-169% of control), a nd at the two higher doses at the longer time points (about 130% of control). Relative caecal weights were also significantl y increased at the 20 and 40% pullulan (4 weeks: 251 and 279%; 9 weeks: 202 and 212% of control, respectively). The authors considered that the differences betw een 4 weeks and 7/9 week s were indicative of physiological adaptation. However, it should be noted that there were no control animals sacrificed at the 7 week time point for direct comparison with the 5 and 10% pullulan treated animals. The authors reported that there were no changes in the weights of other organs (\"liver, spleen, heart, kidney, adrenal glands, lung, br ain, etc.\") but no data were presented. Appendix C Pullulan EFSA Journal (2004) 85, mucosal homogenates prepared from the 9 week pullulan treated animals from the above study showed no signi ficant differences in the activity of intestinal maltase, sucrase or isomaltase compared to homogenates from control animals (Oku, 1979). Six week old male Sprague-Dawle y rats (8 animals per group) were fed diets containing 1% and 10% pullulan (no details on specification) for 4 weeks and compared to a control group on a diet containing 5% cellu lose (Sugawa-Katayama et al. , 1993) 6. Carbohydrate content was normalised to 68% with corn starch, thus the diets were not isocalor ic. The colon mucosae were analysed for cell size, by comparing pr otein to DNA ratios, and by scanning electron microscopy. Statistically significant increases were observed in the wet weight of the colon mucosa in the 10% pullulan fed group. Mucosal protein content was decreased in the pullulan fed rats, with a greater effect at 1% than at 10%. DNA content was significantly increased in the 10% pullulan fed group. The authors suggested that these data indicated that pullulan decreased the size of the colon mucosal cells. Faecal weight was decreased by pullulan in a dose-related manner Scanning electron microscopy of colons suggested that the haustra coli were broader than the control in pullulan fed animals (Sugawa-Katayama et al., 1993) 7. Intestinal calcium absorption ha s been reported as being reduced following the consumption of large doses of non-digestible carbohydrate (Reinhold et al. , 1976 and reviewed by Gordon et al., 1995). Pullulan (molecular weight unspecified) was administered to male Wistar rats (40- 50 g, 6/group) at 20% in the diet for 8 weeks. Diets were normalised to a total carbohydrate content of 67% with corn starch and were therefore not isocalor ic. Animals were fasted for 16 hours before sacrifice and then a partiall y purified duodenal homogenate was prepared. Calcium binding (measured by competitive bindi ng with a cation exchange resin) in the duodenal supernatant was significan tly reduced compared to contro l (64% of control). Alkaline phosphatase activity was reduced by about 50% and sucrase by about one third 8. The authors suggested that these data were indications of mechanical damage to the mucosal surfaces resulting in loss of calcium binding protein and enzyme leakage from th e mucosal cells (Oku et al., 1982). Mutagenicity 6 abstract and figures in English, text in Japanese 7 abstract and figures in English, text in Japanese Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 17 Information on mutagenicity testing of pullulan is limited, with inadequate experimental detail and no information on the specification of the tested material. However, considering the structure and molecular we ight of pullulan, genotoxi city is not expected. Pullulan at 10 to 10,000 \u00b5g per plate did not increase numbers of revertants in S. typhimurium strains TA1535, TA100, TA1537 and TA 98 with and without S-9 activation in a plate incorporation assay (Anon 1978, Kimoto et al., 1997). No firm conclusion on genotoxicity can be dr awn from tests on diffe rential toxicity in B. subtilis strains (Hachiya9 et al. 1985, Kuroda et al. 198910). Pullulan did not induce chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster cells (CHL strain) at concentrations up to 12 mg/ml with 24 and 48 hour harvest times (Ishidate et al., 1985)11. Pullulan was negative in a mouse micronucleus assay when administered by intraperitoneal injection at 1800 mg/kg once or 1000 mg/kg 4 time s over a 24 hour period to groups of 6 male mice (ICR strain CD1-mice) aged about 8 weeks old (Ishidate et al., 1988) 12. Carcinogenicity, Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity. No data available Other Studies Human volunteer studies Thirteen male volunteers (24 -53 years, averag e age of 34.5), were given 10g (approximately 0.17g/kg bw assuming a 60 kg individual) of reagent grade PR-5 pullulan (50,000 dalton 8 based on histograms 9. Figures in English, text in Japanese 10 Abstract and figures in English, text in Japanese 11 Paper in Japanese, short English extract provided 12 details of positive controls were not provided in the short English translation Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 18molecular weight) daily for 14 days. Pullul an powder was dissolved in soup or water and given to volunteers at lunchtim e each day. Apart from a request not to consume excessive alcohol no restrictions were pl aced on the volunteers. Six of the 13 volunteers (average age 32, range 24 -53) provided complete stool sample s on the morning of the first dose of pullulan and on the morning after the 14 days of pullulan consumption. Stools were also collected and weighed for the 48 hours prior to pullulan intake and for the final 48 hours of pullulan intake. Faecal pH, SCFA concentration, levels of water soluble saccharides and faecal microflora were analysed. All 13 volunteers had their blood pressure measured together with a range of blood tests (total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, -lipoprotein, total fat, phos pholipid, neutral fat, Ca, Na, K, Cl, GOT, GTP and bl ood glucose). There was no treatment related change in stool frequency among volunteers. Post abdominal fu llness after consuming pullulan was reported in \"some\" of the volunteers. No other effects were reported. There was an apparent decrease in faecal pH and increase in faecal SCFA conten t in 5/6 test subjects after treatment with pullulan, but these were not st atistically significant. Water soluble saccharide content and blood test results were within the normal range. There was no significant difference in the total number of faecal micro-organisms per g faeces before and after pullulan intake, but pullulan appeared to alter the spectrum of bact erial flora in a number of individuals, the most marked difference being an increase in Bifidobacteria in 5/6 volunteers. Pullulan was not detected in the faeces. The authors suggested that pullulan was metabolised to SCFAs by the intestinal micro-organisms in the large intestin e and that most of the SCFAs are absorbed by the intestinal tract (Yoneyama et al., 1990). Another volunteer study investigated the effects of pullulan, dextran and soluble starch on bacterial flora in human volunteers (Mitsuhashi et al. , 1990). Eight male volunteers (average age 33.4 years, weight 62.8 kg) were treated sequentially with 10 g/day (0.16 g/kg bw/day) pullulan (molecular weight unspecified), dextran or soluble starch I in soup for 14 days at lunch time. There was a 14 day wash out pe riod between each treatment so that each individual acted as his own control. On a per gm basis there was little overall change in faecal bacterial count with any of the treatments used. Administration of both pullulan and dextran resulted in an increase in faeces weight and pe rcentage bifidobacteria after 14 days treatment. Faecal wet weights increased from 129 \u00b1 30 g/da y to 188 \u00b1 35 g/day (146%) with pullulan and from 127 \u00b1 144 \u00b1 30 g/day with de (113%). equivalent percentage of Appendix Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 19bifidobacteria as a proportion of the total ba cterial cell count was approximately doubled for pullulan (24.8 compared to 12.0). A number of other studies have addressed the issue of whether pullula n affects blood glucose levels. Wolf et al. (2003) investigated the digestibility and gl ycemic effect of pullulan in non-diabetic, healthy male and female volunteers (average weight 73.4 kg, range 53 - 105). Nineteen male and nine female volunteers took part in a ra ndomised double blind tw o treatment, two period crossover meal tolerance tests. Volunteers were asked to cons ume a high carbohydrate diet for 3 days prior to the experiment, and avoid exerci se for the 24 hours prior to dosing. Individuals were randomly assigned to treatme nt groups and on the evening befo re a \"treatment day\" they were given a low residue liquid food and solid en ergy bar meal designed to provide a third of their daily energy requirement X 1.3. After an overnight fast a blood sa mple (pin prick) was obtained for blood glucose measurement prior to the administration of a sterilised flavoured drink containing 50g pullulan (100,000 daltons molecular wei ght) or 50g maltodextrin. Following the meal blood glucose was measured every 15 minutes for the first 60 minutes and then every 30 minutes up to for 180 minutes. In addition a breath hydrogen analysis was carried out to evaluate carbohyd rate malabsorbtion and volunteers were asked to report any symptoms due to ingestion for the two 24 hour periods following inge stion of the pullulan meal. The crossover experiment wa s carried out 5 to 13 days after the first meal. Postprandial blood glucose concentrations were reduced in individuals consuming th e pullulan based drink when compared to those consuming maltod extrin. Pullulan increased carbohydrate malabsorption and led to increased intolera nce symptoms compared to the maltodextrin [largely flatulence which was more common in the first 24 hour post-prandial period (22 \u00b1 6 of 28 individuals compared to 5 \u00b1 3) than the second (8 \u00b13 of 28 compared to 4 \u00b1 2)]. Time to peak glucose concentration is delayed in the pullulan treated individua ls, with a significant difference (P< 0.0001) in the in cremental AUC of pullulan compared to 268 mmol min/L for maltodextrin. Th e authors conclude that their in vivo and in vitro data show that pullulan is slowly dige sted in the human gut and leading to a broader flatter rise in blood glucose compared with maltodextrose. Hiji (1990) reported that a 1:20 to 1:400 pullulan to starch or sucrose ratio reduced peak blood glucose levels in man though there was cons iderable variation in the required dosage Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 20depending on a range of factors including the pullulan molecular we ight, the age and health of the individual. (The same patent reports similar results in anim al studies). In another study a 39 year old human volunteer was give n a solution of 50 g glucose pl us 0, 5 or 10 g pullulan in 200 ml water. Blood glucose was monitored ev ery 30 minutes for 180 minutes. The addition of pullulan to the glucose solution had no effect on blood glucose leve ls that were near identical with all three treatments (Oku13 et al. , 1983). Allergenicity and Immunogenicity Allergic alveolitis and hypersensitivity pneumonia has been linked to inhalation of A. pullulan spores and not the vegetative form. The petiti oner claims that other fungi which are equally allergenic have been safely used for the produc tion of food or food enzymes for decades. There are a number of reports of environmental exposure to Aureobasidium pullulans, the source organism for pullulan production, leading to respiratory symptoms including hypersensitivity pneumonitis (Woodard et al. , 1988; Apostolakos et al. , 2001) and other lesions (Ajello, 1978). The fungus is also reported to be a freque nt source of respirat ory allergy (Kurup et al., 2000) and IgE antibodies to Aureobasidium pullulans have been identified in sera from individuals with suspected mould allergy (Karlsson-Borga et al. , 1989). Experimentally it has been demonstrated to cause extrinsic allergic alveolitis in the rabbit (Bulman, 1974). Aureobasidium pullulans was identified as being associated with fungal peritonitis in a small number of patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Pritchard and Muir (1987) screened 556 dematiaceous hyphomyc etes (black fungi that include Aureobasidium pullulans ) received in their laboratory over a five year period. Th irty five isolates were considered to be of \"probable pathogenic significance\". Five hundred and four teen isolates (2/3 of which were Aureobasidium pullulans ) were considered \"unlikel y\" to be of pathogenic significance (the remaining 7 (none Aurobasidium pullulans) of \"possible pathogenic significance\" Opportunistic infection with Aureobasidium pullulans has been reported in immunocompromised patients by Salkin et al. (1986), Kaczmarski et al. (1986) and Giradi et al. (1993). 13 Paper in Japanese, abstract and figure legends in English. Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 21Over a 25 year period there have been no occurrences of al lergic reaction to A. pullulans amongst workers at the production site (letter provided by a phys ician from the petitioner's company clinic, March 26, 2002). There do not appear to be any specifc data on the allergenicity of ingested pullulan. DISCUSSION Usage levels have been proposed for pullulan as a new food additive used in the production of capsule and tablet shells as a substitute for gelatine and as a flavour matrix in breath freshening films. An estimate of consum ption was based on these usage le vels and the assumption that individuals will not normally exceed 6 capsules per day and that extrem e consumers will not take more than double this amount. Another assumption was that they would not consume more than a standard packet (containing 24 i ndividual films) of breath freshening films per day. On this basis the maximum intake woul d be around 2.3 g pullulan per day. This assumes all supplements are taken as capsules with 150 mg shells containing 90 % pullulan and the individual consumes a packet of breath freshening strips containing 90% pullulan. This intake may be considered a worse case intake fo r adults, teenagers and older children. The Panel noted that the manufacturer claims a non-toxin producing strain of Aureobasidium pullulans is used for the production of PI-20, this should be included in the specification The toxicological database is limited. The pul lulan product under consideration is PI-20, with an average molecular weight of 200,000 dalt ons. Many of the availa ble studies provided no information on the type of pullulan used. Of those that did, the ma jority used a material with a molecular weight of about 50,000 daltons. In vitro studies suggest that PI-20 is broken down into smaller polymers (of around 70, 000 daltons) by salivary and pancreatic amylases (Okada et al. 1990). In vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that it may be fermented to short chain fatty acids in the colon. It is assumed to be completely fermented but in vivo evidence for this is unclear and there are no data to indicate wh ether the rate of fermen tation depends on the size of the polymer. No adequate chronic toxicity studies are available nor are there data on carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity or de velopmental toxicity. Subchronic (9-62 week) studies in the rat indicate that pullulan is of low toxicity. Pu llulan is a soluble carbohydrate Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 22polymer that is poorly digested by intestin al enzymes. Studies in which pullulan was administered in the diet to rats for up to 9 weeks suggest that pullulan has local effects in the gastrointestinal tract but provided no evidence of systemic effects. Increased relative weights of the stomach, small intestine, large intestine and caecum and evidence of changes in the size and shape of intestinal pouches (the haustra coli ) in the intestinal mucosa were reported at dietary concentrations of 1% pullulan (around 0.5 g pullulan/kg bw/day) and greater. Limited evidence indicated a decrease in severity of effects with time of administration, suggesting possible adaptation. Human volunteer studies have reported mild gastrointestinal symptoms at doses of 10g pullulan per day and greater (i .e. approximately 0.17 g/kg bw/d ay for a 60 kg individual). At 10g the only reported gastrointestinal sympto m was abdominal fullness. The estimated exposure in adults using the specified worst case assumptions (12 tablets and a packet of breath freshening films) would be around 23% of this amount. If the same worse case assumptions were applied to children weighing 30 kg, ex posure expressed per kg body weight would be 46% of this amount. Pullulan has similarities to a number of ot her poorly digestible carbohydrate polymers including modified celluloses. In 1992 the Sc ientific Committee on Food (SCF) reviewed 5 modified celluloses. The SCF noted that modifi ed celluloses are practically non-absorbed, are of low toxicity and do not posse ss carcinogenic properties. The SCF considered \"the observed gastro-intestinal effects in feeding studies were related to the physical effects of the bulk and hydrophilic properties of the material\" and traditi onal toxicological evalua appropr iate (SCF, 1994; 1999). CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. The Panel noted that the manufacturer claims a non-toxin producing strain of Aureobasidium pullulans is used for the production of PI-20, this should be included in the specification. On the basis that pullulan is similar to other poorly digested carbohydrates and that the current proposed usage levels are below the level lik ely to cause abdominal fullness, the Panel consider that the expected inta kes of pullulan would not present any concern when used as a Appendix C Pullulan PI-20 The EFSA Journal (2004) 85, 1-32 23food additive in the proposed uses and at the usag e levels requested. If hi gher levels of use or other uses were to be requested then more data might be required.

INTRODUCTION AND USE INFORMATION M AXIMUM INTRODUCTION VOLUME OF NOTIFIED CHEMICAL (100%) O VER NEXT 5 YEARS Year 1 2 3 4 5 Tonnes 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 U SE AND MODE OF INTRODUCTION AND DISPOSAL Mode of Introduction The notified polymer will be imported as a powder in 10 kg polyethylene bags with rubber seals inside cardboard boxes. The notified polymer will be tran sported by road to the notifier's warehouse, dedicated to the storage of chemical products, before being transported to customer sites (cosmetic formulators). The notified polymer may also be imported as part of preformed articles (up to 30% notified polymer). Reformulation/manufacture processes The notified polymer will not be manufactured in Australia. Cosmetics Reformulation is anticipated to occur at a number of cosmetics manufacturing sites. This will involve blending the notified polymer with other ingredients, and will not involve reaction of the notified polymer. In a typical process, a compounder will weigh out the notified polymer manua lly. This will then be manually added to a mixing tank, along with other ingredients. During the blending a chemist may take samples of the product containing the notified polymer (concentration up to 20%) using a dip tube. After the blending is complete a packer will supervise the use of a line filler and capper to transfer the finished produc t into the retail bottles. Th e packaged cosmetic produc ts will then be stored and handled by a store person. Biodegradable articles There are currently no plans to manufacture biodegradable articles containing the notified polymer in Australia. Appendix DMay 2007 NICNAS FULL PUBLIC REPORT: PLC/693 Page 6 of 10 Use The notified polymer is used in biodegradable articles (concentration up to 30%), or in cosmetic products, such as: - Shampoos (< 4%) - Creams and lotions (< 1%) - Styling products (as an impermeable, antistatic solid film) (< 10%) - Toothpastes (< 20%) 6. HUMAN HEALTH IMPLICATIONS 6.1. Exposure Assessment O CCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE Transport and storage Transport and warehousing workers are expected to ha ve dermal and ocular contact with the notified polymer and products containing th e notified polymer only in the event of accidental spillages. Inhalation exposure to the polymer powder may also occur if the p ackaging is breached. Reformulation Dermal, ocular and inhalation exposure to the no tified polymer powder may occur during weighing out prior to reformulation. However, exposure to significant amounts of the notified polymer is typically reduced by the use of ventilation at the site of wei ghing, such as a dust extract hood, or by the use of a vacuum tube. The compounder is also expected to w ear personal protective equipment such as glasses, gloves and coveralls. Dermal and ocular exposure to the polymer solutions may also potentially occur during certain processes involving the notified polymer such as sa mpling, cleaning, maintena nce, or by accidental spills during the packing process. However, exposur e to significant amounts of the notified polymer is limited because of the largely au tomated processes, and the engineering controls and personal protective equipment worn by workers. Beauty Industry Intermittent, wide-dispersive use with direct ha ndling is expected to occur among hairdressers, cosmeticians, and beauticians. According to EASE ( 1997) modelling of this work environment, dermal exposure in the range of 1-5 mg/cm 2/day of products containing up to 10% of the notified polymer (assuming maximum concentration from cosmetic /styling products) could result. Assuming 100% dermal absorption, a surface area of 420 cm2 (half the area of the hands) and a bodyweight of 60 kg, this equates to a maximum systemic exposure of 3.5 mg/kg bw/day. Retail Industry Workers in the retail industry will onl y be exposed to the notified polym er (up to 20%) in the event of packaging breaches or accidental spillages. P UBLIC EXPOSURE Biodegradable Articles The notified polymer will not be sold to the public except in the form of finished articles. There are no specific details on the types of articles, or their uses. However one possibility is trays comprised partly of the notified polymer. Although there is potential for extensive public exposure to these articles, blooming/leeching of the notified polymer from the articles is not expected and hence exposure to the notified polymer is considered to be low. Cosmetics Since the notified polymer will be in products sold to the general pub lic, widespread public exposure is expected. Exposure to the notified chemical will vary depending on th e type of cosmetic product and individual use patterns. Based on exposure estimates fo r a range of cosmetic products in Europe (SDA, Appendix DMay 2007 NICNAS FULL PUBLIC REPORT: PLC/693 Page 7 of 10 2005), public exposure (dermal and oral) to the notified polymer in Australia has been estimated using the following assumptions: - Bodyweight of 60 kg; - 100% dermal and oral absorption - Product usage is similar in Australia to Europe. Product used and exposure type Amount of product used per day (g/day) Product retained/ingested (%) Concentration in product (%) Exposure (mg/kg bw/day) Skin lotions (dermal) 5.68 100 < 1 0.95 Shampoos (dermal) 8 1 < 4 0.05 Styling products (dermal) 10 5 < 10 0.83 Toothpastes (oral) 2.4 35 < 20 2.8 Range of cosmetic products (dermal and oral) 4.63 The estimate of combined exposure to a range of cosmetic products (skin lotion, shampoo, styling product and toothpaste), 4.63 mg/kg bw/day, is expected to be an overestimate as it assumes all products used by one person contain the notified polymer and uses the maximum 'product amount used' from the range in the dataset. Since products containing the notified chemical are stored and used in a domestic environment, there is the possibility of accidental ingestion by a child. 6.2. Toxicological Hazard Characterisation The notified polymer meets the PLC cr iteria and can therefore be consider ed to be of low hazard. This is supported by toxicological endpoints observed in testing conducted on the notified polymer. Only studies for which reports were provided are summarised in the table below. Endpoint Result Classified? Effects Observed? Test Guideline Skin irritation - human patch test non-irritating at 25% no no In-house method Eye irritation, HET-CAM* test no ocular irritation potential in vivo predicted at 100% no no In-house method Eye irritation, Bovine corneal opacity and permeability test no negative effect at 20% compared to the control no no In-house method Skin sensitisation - human repeat insult patch test no evidence of sensitisation or irritation at 25% no no In-house method Rat, oral repeat dose toxicity - 13 weeks (notified polymer in feed) NOAEL: 7914 mg/kg bw/day TG 407 Genotoxicity - bacterial reverse mutation non mutagenic no no In-house method * HET-CAM: Hen's egg test-chorio allantoic membrane. Although the in vitro eye irritation tests and human patch tests are not validated for classification, the negative results in all tests indicat e low hazard of the notified polymer. In a 13 week repeat dose study in which the notified polymer was given to the rats in the feed, no adverse effects were observed. Test item-related macroscopic changes were restricted to a dose- Appendix DMay 2007 NICNAS FULL PUBLIC REPORT: PLC/693 Page of 10 dependently increased caecum weight and a distension of the caecum at necropsy in 1/10 males in the low dose group, 3/10 males in the mid dose group and 1/10 males in the high dose group. Since no microscopic changes were seen in the affected caeca th ese findings were not cons idered to be adverse. The NOAEL was therefore determined from the dose given to the high dose group (10% in feed). No mutagenicity was observed in the strains Salmonella typhimurium TA1535, TA100, TA1537 or TA98 both with and without metabolic activation when tested with the notified polymer up to 10 mg/plate. All results were indicative of low hazard. In add ition, although no studies were cited the results for testing on the notified polymer are reported as: no adverse treatment related effects in a 62 week repeat dose study when treated at a maximum dose of 4500 mg/kg bw/day (males) / 5100 mg/kg bw/day (females); negative in a DNA repair test; negative in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay; negative in an in vivo mouse micronucleus test. The notified polymer is a soluble polymer with molecular weight > 13,000, and may therefore have the potential to cause lung overloading effects due to decreased clearance from the lung. 6.3. Human Health Risk Assessment O CCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY Although limited exposure to the notified polymer could occur during reformulation processes and during use in the beauty industry, the risk to workers is considered to be low due to the intrinsic low hazard of the notified polymer. The maximum dermal exposure for workers involved in the beauty industry is estimated to be 3.5 mg/kg bw/day. A dermal NOAEL was not determined, however a lowest NOAEL of 7914 mg/kg bw/day was established in a 90-day feed study in the rat. The use of this NOAEL results in a margin of exposure (MOE) of 2261. MOE greater than or equal to 100 are considered acceptable to account for intra- and inter-species differences. In addition the MOE is based on conservative assumptions and may overestimate the risk. Given the low percentage of inhalabl e/respirable particles and the typi cal engineering controls in place, the risk of lung overloading effects is considered to be low. However, the level of atmospheric nuisance dust should be maintained as low as possible. The NOHSC exposure standard for atmospheric dust is 10 mg/m 3. P UBLIC HEALTH Members of the public may make dermal contact with biodegradable products containing the notified polymer. However, the risk to public health will be neglig ible because the notifie d polymer is of low hazard, and is bound within a matrix. The public will be exposed to the notified polymer during use of cosmetic and personal care products. The combined exposure to a range of cosmetic a nd personal care products is estimated to be 4.63 mg/kg bw/day. A dermal NOAEL was lowest NOAEL of 7914 mg/kg bw/day was established in a 90-day feed study in the rat. The use of this NOAEL results in a margin of exposure (MOE) of 1709. MOE greater than or equa l to 100 are considered acceptable to account for intra- and inter-species differences. In addition the MOE is based on conservative assumptions and may overestimate the risk. In addition the risk of local effects after use of product containing the notified polymer is considered to be low due to the predicted low hazard of the notified polymer. Appendix DMay 2007 NICNAS FULL PUBLIC REPORT: PLC/693 Page 9 of 10 7. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS 7.1. Exposure Assessment ENVIRONMENTAL RELEASE The notified polymer is not manufactured in Australia but will be reformulated into cosmetic consumer products at customer sites. As the polymer is so lid only a small quantity (<0.1%; < 0.5 kg per annum) is expected to remain in import packaging. Up to 3% (< 15 kg per annum) is expected to remain in blending tanks during reformulation. This will be flushed to sewer. It is expected that approximately 1% (< 5 kg per annum) of the formulated product w ill remain in the consumer product packaging. The remainder is expected to be used as intended, in consumer cosmetic products and will be eventually flushed to sewer. E NVIRONMENTAL FATE No biodegradation test was submitted, but two studies were provided which show that relatively rapid biodegradation is expected. The polys accharide polymer is expected to degrade to simple sugars then to oxides of carbon and water vapour. The residue in packaging, and biodegradable articles containing the notified polymer, are expected to be sent to landfill where they will degrade. Similarly, the notified chemical is expected to degrade in the sewage treatment plant or in natural waterways after release. 7.2. Environmental Hazard Characterisation No ecotoxicological data were submitted. PLCs without significant ionic functionality are of low concern to the aquatic environment. 7.3. Environmental Risk Assessment The predicted environmental concentration (PEC ) for a worst case scenario, where 99% of the polymer is flushed to sewer, throughout Australia without degradation or adsorption to sludge is calculated as 0.33 \u00b5g/L (495 kg per annum \u00f7 ( 200 L per person per day \u00d7 365 days \u00d7 20.5 million persons). A predicted no effect concentration (P NEC) cannot be calculated, but PLCs without significant ionic functionality are of low concern to the aquatic envi ronment. Although a risk quotient (RQ) cannot be calculated from the PEC/PNEC ratio, there will be an adequate safety margin and the risk to the aquatic environment is expected to be acceptable. Fu rthermore the notified polymer is expected to degrade by biotic and abiotic processes, thus further reducing the risk to the environment. 8. CONCLUSIONS 8.1. Level of Concern for Occupational Health and Safety There is Low Concern to occupa tional health and safety under th e conditions of the occupational settings described. 8.2. Level of Concern for Public Health There is No Significant Concern to public health when used in the proposed manner. 8.3. Level of Concern for the Environment The polymer is not considered to pose a risk to the environment based on its reported use pattern. 9. MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET 9.1. Material Safety Data Sheet The notifier has provided MSDS as part of the notif ication statement. The accu racy of the information on the MSDS remains the res ponsibility of the applicant. Appendix DMay 2007 NICNAS FULL PUBLIC REPORT: PLC/693 Page 10 of 10 10. RECOMMENDATIONS C ONTROL MEASURES Occupational Health and Safety No specific engineering controls, work practices or personal protective equipment are required for the safe use of the notified polymer itself, however, these should be selected on the basis of all ingredients in the formulation. Guidance in selection of personal protective equipment can be obtained from Australian, Australian/New Zealand or other approved standards. A copy of the MSDS should be easily accessible to employees. If products and mixtures containi ng the notified polymer are classi fied as hazardous to health in accordance with the NOHSC Approved Criteria for Classifying Hazardous Substances , workplace practices and control procedures consis tent with provisions of State and Territory hazardous substances legisla tion must be in operation. Disposal The notified polymer should be dis posed of by authorised landfill. Emergency procedures Spills and/or accidental release of the notif ied polymer should be handled by removing possible leaking containers and sweeping up spills for reuse to the extent practicable or disposal. Wash the area with water. 10.1. Secondary Notification The Director of Chemicals Notification and Assessment must be notified in writing within 28 days by the notifier, other importer or manufacturer: (1) Under subsection 64(1) of the Act ; if the notified polymer is introduced in a ch emical form that does not meet the PLC criteria. or (2) Under subsection 64(2) of the Act: - if any of the circumstances listed in the subsection arise. The Director will then decide whethe r secondary notifica tion is required.
