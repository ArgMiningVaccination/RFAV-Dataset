Kerr Copyright \u00a9 2007 Orin S. Kerr Intro to Law Page 7Electronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1160925/g561 S. Kerr This essay is designed to help new law students prepare for the first few weeks of class. It explains what judicial opinions are, how they are structured, and what law students should look for when reading them. I./g561W HAT'S/g561IN/g561A/g561LEGAL /g561OPINION ?/g561 hen two people disagree and that disagreement leads to a lawsuit, the lawsuit will sometimes end with a ruling by a judge in favor of one side. The judge will explain the ruling in a written document referred to as an \"opinion.\" The opinion explains what the case is about, discusses the relevant legal principles, and then applies the law to the facts to reach a ruling in favor of one side and against the other. Modern judicial opinions reflect hundreds of years of history and practice. They usually follow a simple and predictable formula.

W Intro to Law Page 9Orin/g561S./g561Kerr/g561 52/g561 11/g561G REEN /g561BAG/g5612D/g561section takes you through the basic formula. It starts with the intro- ductory materials at the top of an opinion and then moves on to the body of the opinion. The/g561Caption/g561 The first part of the case is the title of the case, known as the \"cap-tion.\" Examples include Brown v. Board of Education and Miranda v. Arizona. The caption usually tells you the last names of the person who brought the lawsuit and the person who is being sued. These two sides are often referred to as the \"parties\" or as the \"litigants\" in the case. For example, if Ms. Smith sues Mr. Jones, the case caption may be Smith v. Jones (or, depending on the court, Jones v. Smith ). In criminal law, cases are brought by government prosecutors on behalf of the government itself. This means that the government is the named party. For example, if the federal government charges John Doe with a crime, the case caption will be United States v. Doe . If a state brings the charges instead, the caption will be State v. Doe, People v. Doe , or Commonwealth v. Doe , depending on the practices of that state. 1 The/g561Case/g561Citation/g561 Below the case name you will find some letters and numbers. These letters and numbers are the legal citation for the case. A citation tells you the name of the court that decided the case, the law book in which the opinion was published, and the year in which the court decided the case. For example, \"U.S. Supreme Court, 485 U.S. 759 (1988)\" refers to a U.S. Supreme Court case decided in 1988 that appears in Volume 485 of the United States Reports starting at page 759. The/g561Author/g561of/g561the/g561Opinion/g561 The next information is the name of the judge who wrote the opin-ion. Most opinions assigned in law school were issued by courts 1 English criminal cases normally will be Rex v. Doe or Regina v. Doe. Rex and Regina aren't the victims: the words are Latin for \"King\" and \"Queen.\" During the reign of a King, English courts use \"Rex\"; during the reign of a Queen, they switch to \"Regina.\" Intro to Law Page 10How/g561to/g561Read/g561a/g561Legal/g561Opinion/g561 AUTUMN /g5612007/g561 53/g561with multiple judges. The name tells you which judge wrote that particular opinion. In older cases, the opinion often simply states a last name followed by the initial \"J.\" No, judges don't all have the first initial \"J.\" The letter stands for \"Judge\" or \"Justice,\" depending on the court. On occasion, the opinion will use the Latin phrase \"per curiam\" instead of a judge's name. Per curiam means \"by the court.\" It signals that the opinion reflects a common view among all the judges rather than the writings of a specific judge. The/g561Facts/g561of/g561the/g561Case/g561 Now let's move on to the opinion itself. The first part of the body of the opinion presents the facts of the case. In other words, what happened? The facts might be that Andy pulled out a gun and shot Bob. Or maybe Fred agreed to give Sally $100 and then changed his mind. Surprisingly, there are no particular rules for what facts a judge must include in the fact section of an opinion. Sometimes the fact sections are long, and sometimes they are short. Sometimes they are clear and accurate, and other times they are vague or in- complete. Most discussions of the facts also cover the \"procedural history\" of the case. The procedural history explains how the legal dispute worked its way through the legal system to the court that is issuing the opinion. It will include various motions, hearings, and trials that occurred after the case was initially filed. Your civil procedure class is all about that kind of stuff; you should pay very close attention to the procedural history of cases when you read assignments for your civil procedure class. The procedural history of cases usually will be less important when you read a case for your other classes. The/g561Law/g561of/g561the/g561Case/g561 After the opinion presents the facts, it will then discuss the law. Many opinions present the law in two stages. The first stage dis-cusses the general principles of law that are relevant to cases such as the one the court is deciding. This section might explore the history of a particular field of law or may include a discussion of past cases (known as \"precedents\") that are related to the case the court is de- Intro to Law Page 11Orin/g561S./g561Kerr/g561 54/g561 11/g561G REEN /g561BAG/g5612D/g561ciding. This part of the opinion gives the reader background to help understand the context and significance of the court's decision. The second stage of the legal section applies the general legal principles to the particular facts of the dispute. As you might guess, this part is in many ways the heart of the opinion: It gets to the bottom line of why the court is ruling for one side and against the other. Concurring/g561and/or/g561Dissenting/g561Opinions/g561 Most of the opinions you read as a law student are \"majority\" opin-ions. When a group of judges get together to decide a case, they vote on which side should win and also try to agree on a legal ra-tionale to explain why that side has won. A majority opinion is an opinion joined by the majority of judges on that court. Although most decisions are unanimous, some cases are not. Some judges may disagree and will write a separate opinion offering a different approach. Those opinions are called \"concurring opinions\" or \"dis-senting opinions,\" and they appear after the majority opinion. A \"concurring opinion\" (sometimes just called a \"concurrence\") ex- plains a vote in favor of the winning side but based on a different legal rationale. A \"dissenting opinion\" (sometimes just called a \"dis-sent\") explains a vote in favor of the losing OMMON /g561LEGAL /g561TERMS /g561 FOUND /g561IN/g561OPINIONS /g561 ow that you know what's in a legal opinion, it's time to learn some of the common words you'll find inside them. But first a history lesson, for reasons that should be clear in a minute. In 1066, William the Conqueror came across the English Chan- nel from what is now France and conquered the land that is today called England. The conquering Normans spoke French and the de- feated Saxons spoke Old English. The Normans took over the court system, and their language became the language of the law. For sev-eral centuries after the French-speaking Normans took over Eng-land, lawyers and judges in English courts spoke in French. When English courts eventually returned to using English, they continued to use many French words. N Intro to Law Page 12How/g561to/g561Read/g561a/g561Legal/g561Opinion/g561 AUTUMN /g5612007/g561 55/g561Why should you care about this ancient history? The American colonists considered themselves Englishmen, so they used the Eng- lish legal system and adopted its language. This means that Ameri-can legal opinions today are littered with weird French terms. Ex- amples include plaintiff, defendant, tort, contract, crime, judge, attorney, counsel, court, verdict, party, appeal, evidence, and jury. These words are the everyday language of the American legal sys-tem. And they're all from the French, brought to you by William the Conqueror in 1066. This means that when you read a legal opinion, you'll come across a lot of foreign-sounding words to describe the court system. You need to learn all of these words eventually; you should read cases with a legal dictionary nearby and should look up every word you don't know. But this section will give you a head start by intro- ducing you to some of the most common words, many of which (but not all) are French in origin. Types/g561of/g561Disputes/g561and/g561the/g561Names/g561of/g561Participants/g561 There are two basic kinds of legal disputes: civil and criminal. In a civil case, one person files a lawsuit against another asking the court to order the other side to pay him money or to do or stop doing something. An award of money is called \"damages\" and an order to do something or to refrain from doing something is called an \"in- junction.\" The person bringing the lawsuit is known as the \"plaintiff\" and the person sued is called the \"defendant.\" In criminal cases, there is no plaintiff and no lawsuit. The role of a plaintiff is occupied by a government prosecutor. Instead of filing a lawsuit (or equivalently, \"suing\" someone), the prosecutor files criminal \"charges.\" Instead of asking for damages or an injunction, the prosecutor asks the court to punish the individual through either jail time or a fine. The government prosecutor is often referred to as \"the state,\" \"the prosecution,\" or simply \"the government.\" The person charged is called the defendant, just like the person sued in a civil case. In legal disputes, each party ordinarily is represented by a law- yer. Legal opinions use several different words for lawyers, includ- Intro to and \"counsel.\" There are some historical differences among these terms, but for the last century or so they have all meant the same thing. When a lawyer addresses a judge in court, she will always address the judge as \"your honor,\" just like lawyers do in the movies. In legal opinions, however, judges will usually refer to themselves as \"the Court.\" Terms/g561in/g561Appellate/g561Litigation/g561 Most opinions that you read in law school are appellate opinions, which means that they decide the outcome of appeals. An \"appeal\" is a legal proceeding that considers whether another court's legal deci-sion was right or wrong. After a court has ruled for one side, the losing side may seek review of that decision by filing an appeal be- fore a higher court. The original court is usually known as the trial court, because that's where the trial occurs if there is one. The higher court is known as the appellate or appeals court, as it is the court that hears the appeal. A single judge presides over trial court proceedings, but appel- late cases are decided by panels of several judges. For example, in the federal court system, run by the United States government, a single trial judge known as a District Court judge oversees the trial stage. Cases can be appealed to the next higher court, the Court of Appeals, where cases are decided by panels of three judges known as Circuit Court judges. A side that loses before the Circuit Court can seek review of that decision at the United States Supreme Court. Supreme Court cases are decided by all nine judges. Su-preme Court judges are called Justices instead of judges; there is one \"Chief Justice\" and the other eight are just plain \"Justices\" (technically they are \"Associate Justices,\" but everyone just calls them \"Justices\"). During the proceedings before the higher court, the party that lost at the original court and is therefore filing the appeal is usually known as the \"appellant.\" The party that won in the lower court and must defend the lower court's decision is known as the \"appellee\" (accent on the last syllable). Some older opinions may refer to the appellant as the \"plaintiff in error\" and the appellee as Law Page 14How/g561to/g561Read/g561a/g561Legal/g561Opinion/g561 AUTUMN /g5612007/g561 57/g561in error.\" Finally, some courts label an appeal as a \"petition,\" and require the losing party to petition the higher court for relief. In these cases, the party that lost before the lower court and is filing the petition for review is called the \"petitioner.\" The party that won before the lower court and is responding to the petition in the higher court is called the \"respondent.\" Confused yet? You probably are, but don't worry. You'll read so many cases in the next few weeks that you'll get used to all of this very soon. III./g561W HAT/g561YOU/g561NEED/g561TO/g561LEARN /g561FROM /g561 READING /g561A/g561CASE/g561 kay, so you've just read a case for class. You think you under-stand it, but you're not sure if you learned what your profes- sor wanted you to learn. Here is what professors want students to know after reading a case assigned for class: Know/g561the/g561Facts/g561 Law professors love the facts. When they call on students in class, they typically begin by asking students to state the facts of a particu-lar case. Facts are important because law is often highly fact-sensitive, which is a fancy way of saying that the proper legal out- come depends on the exact details of what happened. If you don't know the facts, you can't really understand the case and can't un-derstand the law. Most law students don't appreciate the importance of the facts when they read a case. Students think, \"I'm in law school, not fact school; I want to know what the law is, not just what happened in this one case.\" But trust me: the facts are really important. 2 2 If you don't believe me, you should take a look at a few law school exams. It turns out that the most common form of law school exam question presents a long description of a very particular set of facts. It then asks the student to \"spot\" and analyze the legal issues presented by those facts. These exam questions are known as \"issue-spotters,\" as they test the student's ability to understand the facts and spot the legal issues they raise. As you might imagine, doing well on an issue-O Intro to Law Page 15Orin/g561S./g561Kerr/g561 58/g561 11/g561G REEN /g561BAG/g5612D/g561Know/g561the/g561Specific/g561Legal/g561Arguments/g561Made/g561by/g561the/g561Parties/g561 Lawsuits are disputes, and judges only issue opinions when two par- ties to a dispute disagree on a particular legal question. This means that legal opinions focus on resolving the parties' very specific dis- agreement. The lawyers, not the judges, take the lead role in fram- ing the issues raised by a case. In an appeal, for example, the lawyer for the appellant will ar- ticulate specific ways in which the lower court was wrong. The ap-pellate court will then look at those arguments and either agree or disagree. (Now you can understand why people pay big bucks for top lawyers; the best lawyers are highly skilled at identifying and articulating their arguments to the court.) Because the lawyers take the lead role in framing the issues, you need to understand exactly what arguments the two sides were making. Know/g561the/g561Disposition/g561 The \"disposition\" of a case is the action the court took. It is often announced at the very end of the opinion. For example, an appeals court might \"affirm\" a lower court decision, upholding it, or it might \"reverse\" the decision, ruling for the other side. Alterna- tively, an appeals court might \"vacate\" the lower court decision, wiping the lower-court decision off the books, and then \"remand\" the case, sending it back to the lower court for further proceedings. For now, you should keep in mind that when a higher court \"af-firms\" it means that the lower court had it right (in result, if not in reasoning). Words like \"reverse,\" \"remand,\" and \"vacate\" means that the higher court though the lower court had it wrong. Understand/g561the/g561Reasoning/g561of/g561the/g561Majority/g561Opinion/g561 To understand the reasoning of an opinion, you should first identify the source of the law the judge applied. Some opinions interpret the Constitution, the founding charter of the government. Other cases spotter requires developing a careful and nuanced understanding of the impor- tance of the facts. The best way to prepare for that is to read the fact sections of your cases very carefully. Intro to Law Page 16How/g561to/g561Read/g561a/g561Legal/g561Opinion/g561 AUTUMN /g5612007/g561 59/g561interpret \"statutes,\" which is a fancy name for written laws passed by legislative bodies such as Congress. Still other cases interpret \"the common law,\" which is a term that usually refers to the body of prior case decisions that derive ultimately from pre-1776 English law that the Colonists brought over from England. 3 In your first year, the opinions that you read in your Torts, Con- tracts, and Property classes will mostly interpret the common law. Opinions in Criminal Law mostly interpret either the common law or statutes. Finally, opinions in your Civil Procedure casebook will mostly interpret statutory law or the Constitution. The source of law is very important because American law follows a clear hierar-chy. Constitutional rules trump statutory (statute-based) rules, and statutory rules trump common law rules. After you have identified the source of law, you should next identify the method of reasoning that the court used to justify its decision. When a case is governed by a statute, for example, the court usually will simply follow what the statute says. The court's role is narrow in such settings because the legislature has settled the law. Similarly, when past courts have already answered similar questions before, a court may conclude that it is required to reach a particular result because it is bound by the past precedents. This is an application of the judicial practice of \"stare decisis,\" an abbrevia-tion of a Latin phrase meaning \"That which has been already decided should remain settled.\" In other settings, courts may justify their decisions on public pol- icy grounds. That is, they may pick the rule that they think is the best rule, and they may explain in the opinion why they think that rule is best. This is particularly likely in common law cases where judges are not bound by a statute or constitutional rule. Other courts will rely on morality, fairness, or notions of justice to justify 3 The phrase \"common law\" started being used about a thousand years ago to refer to laws that were common to all English citizens. Thus, the word \"common\" in the phrase \"common law\" means common in the sense of \"shared by all,\" not common in the sense of \"not very special.\" The \"common law\" was announced in judicial opinions. As a result, you will sometimes hear the phrase \"common law\" used to refer to areas of judge-made law as opposed to legislatively-made law. Intro to Law Page 17Orin/g561S./g561Kerr/g561 60/g561 11/g561G REEN /g561BAG/g5612D/g561their decisions. Many courts will mix and match, relying on several or even all of these justifications. Understand/g561the/g561Significance/g561of/g561the/g561Majority/g561Opinion/g561 Some opinions resolve the parties' legal dispute by announcing and applying a clear rule of law that is new to that particular case. That rule is known as the \"holding\" of the case. Holdings are often con- trasted with \"dicta\" found in an opinion. Dicta refers to legal state- ments in the opinion not needed to resolve the dispute of the par-ties; the word is a pluralized abbreviation of the Latin phrase \"obiter dictum,\" which means \"a remark by the way.\" When a court announces a clear holding, you should take a min- ute to think about how the court's rule would apply in other situa-tions. During class, professors like to pose \"hypotheticals,\" new sets of facts that are different from those found in the cases you have read. They do this for two reasons. First, it's hard to understand the significance of a legal rule unless you think about how it might apply to lots of different situations. A rule might look good in one setting, but another set of facts might reveal a major problem or ambiguity. Second, judges often reason by \"analogy,\" which means a new case may be governed by an older case when the facts of the new case are similar to those of the older one. This raises the question, which are the legally relevant facts for this particular rule? The best way to evaluate this is to consider new sets of facts. You'll spend a lot of time doing this in class, and you can get a head start on your class discussions by asking the hypotheticals on your own before class begins. Finally, you should accept that some opinions are vague. Some- times a court won't explain its reasoning very well, and that forces us to try to figure out what the opinion means. You'll look for the holding of the case but become frustrated because you can't find one. It's not your fault; some opinions are written in a narrow way so that there is no clear holding, and others are just poorly reasoned or written. Rather than trying to fill in the ambiguity with false cer-tainty, try embracing the ambiguity instead. One of the skills of top-flight lawyers is that they know what they don't know: they know Intro to Law Page 18How/g561to/g561Read/g561a/g561Legal/g561Opinion/g561 AUTUMN /g5612007/g561 61/g561when the law is unclear. Indeed, this skill of identifying when a problem is easy and when it is hard (in the sense of being unsettled or unresolved by the courts) is one of the keys to doing very well in law school. The best law students are the ones who recognize and identify these unsettled issues without pretending that they are easy. Understand/g561Any/g561Concurring/g561and/or/g561Dissenting/g561Opinions/g561 You probably won't believe me at first, but concurrences and dis- sents are very important. You need to read them carefully. To un-derstand why, you need to appreciate that law is man-made, and Anglo-American law has often been judge-made. Learning to \"think like a lawyer\" often means learning to think like a judge, which means learning how to evaluate which rules and explanations are strong and which are weak. Courts occasionally say things that are silly, wrongheaded, or confused, and you need to think independ-ently about what judges say. Concurring and dissenting opinions often do this work for you. Casebook authors edit out any unimportant concurrences and dis-sents to keep the opinions short. When concurrences and dissents appear in a casebook, it signals that they offer some valuable insights and raise important arguments. Disagreement between the majority opinion and concurring or dissenting opinions often frames the key issue raised by the case; to understand the case, you need to under- stand the arguments offered in concurring and dissenting opinions. IV./g561W HY/g561DO/g561LAW/g561PROFESSORS /g561 USE/g561THE/g561CASE/g561METHOD ?/g561 'll conclude by stepping back and explaining why law professors bother with the case method. Every law student quickly realizes that law school classes are very different from college classes. Your college professors probably stood at the podium and droned on while you sat back in your chair, safe in your cocoon. You're now starting law school, and it's very different. You're reading about actual cases, real-life disputes, and you're trying to learn about the law by picking up bits and pieces of it from what the opinions tell I Intro to Law Page 19Orin/g561S./g561Kerr/g561 62/g561 11/g561G REEN /g561BAG/g5612D/g561you. Even weirder, your professors are asking you questions about those opinions, getting everyone to join in a discussion about them. Why the difference?, you may be wondering. Why do law schools use the case method at all? I think there are two major reasons, one historical and the other practical. The/g561Historical/g561Reason/g561 The legal system that we have inherited from England is largely judge-focused. The judges have made the law what it is through their written opinions. To understand that law, we need to study the actual decisions that the judges have written. Further, we need to learn to look at law the way that judges look at law. In our sys- tem of government, judges can only announce the law when decid-ing real disputes: they can't just have a press conference and an-nounce a set of legal rules. (This is sometimes referred to as the \"case or controversy\" requirement; a court has no power to decide an issue unless it is presented by an actual case or controversy be- fore the court.) To look at the law the way that judges do, we need to study actual cases and controversies, just like the judges. In short, we study real cases and disputes because real cases and disputes his-torically have been the primary source of law. The/g561Practical/g561Reason/g561 A second reason professors use the case method is that it teaches an essential skill for practicing lawyers. Lawyers represent clients, and clients will want to know how laws apply to them. To advise a cli-ent, a lawyer needs to understand exactly how an abstract rule of law will apply to the very specific situations a client might encoun-ter. This is more difficult than you might think, in part because a legal rule that sounds definite and clear in the abstract may prove murky in application. (For example, imagine you go to a public park and see a sign that says \"No vehicles in the park.\" That plainly for-bids an automobile, but what about bicycles, wheelchairs, toy automobiles? What about airplanes? Ambulances? Are these \"vehi- cles\" for the purpose of the rule or not?) As a result, good lawyers Intro to Law Page 20How/g561to/g561Read/g561a/g561Legal/g561Opinion/g561 AUTUMN /g5612007/g561 63/g561need a vivid imagination; they need to imagine how rules might ap- ply, where they might be unclear, and where they might lead to unexpected outcomes. The case method and the frequent use of hypotheticals will help train your brain to think this way. Learning the law in light of concrete situations will help you deal with par- ticular facts you'll encounter as a practicing lawyer. Good luck!

In general, evidence is admissible and entitled to consideration if it is relevant to an issue in the case and reliable ( that is, likely to be true). Why? /g120Small claims court is not subject to re view on appeal in the same way other trial courts are, so whether evidence does or does not become part of the record is not relevant in the same way. /g120Small claims cases never involve juries, and so the legal principles governing consideration of evidence that apply to trials before the judge without a jury are more relevant than are the rules used in jury trials. Unless evidence is objected to, or unless you, the judge, feel that the evidence is such that it might improperly bias your decision, it should be freely admitted - and given appropriate weight. When evidence is objected to, it is appropriate to rule on the objection by admitting the evidence but pointing out that its weight is to be determined. When an attorney repeatedly objects\u2014or when you anticipate that this may happen - it is proper to instruct the attorney to hold objections until the close of the evidence, at which point the attorney may be allowed to present arguments about its weight and admissibility. What you might say: \"As you know, we are about to conduct a trial before the judge without a jury, and one of the parties is not represented by an attorney, which is often the case in this court. My policy in such situations is to be lenient in allowing evidence to be offered, so that parties may testify without interruption. At the close of the evidence, I will hear any argument the parties would like to offer about evidence that you believe I should not consider. After hearing your argument, I will carefully consider all the relevant admissible evidence and determine what weight I will give it before arriving at my decision.\" Factors to consider in assessing credibility: Motive to lie Corroborating evidence Person in best position to observe Demeanor Ability to provide details Which version seems more likely? Small Claims Procedure Page 19 Notes: A Note on Dealing With Attorneys ~ Remember that attorneys have a different role, and thus a different agenda, than you in your role as a judge. ~Don't expect that an attorney will necessarily approve of or agree with your decisions, or the way you run your courtroom. Be respectful and polite, but be prepared to be assertive if necessary in maintaining control of the courtroom. ~ Like everyone else, attorneys vary in skill and abili ty. Don't assume that an attorney is more knowledgeable than you about the law, and don't accept general proclamations about what \"the law says\" at face value. ~ Let attorneys know that you will not rule in their favor un less they explain their argument clearly, in a way that everyon e in the courtroom can unders tand. Communicate that you won't be intimidated into ruling favorably by a complicated jargon-laden legal argument made quickly and without regard for your ability to un derstand. This is an appropriate requirement, and one that an advocate should anticipate and respect. ~Never hesitate to require an attorney to establish the truth of his or her contentions by supplying a copy of a case or statute, granting a brief continuance if necessary for the attorney to obtain a copy or for you to read it carefully. Insist that copies of cases and statutes be complete, and specifically ask whether the law provided is current as of the date of trial if you have any reason to be doubtful. ~Be aware of procedural errors fr equently made by attorneys unused to small claims practice. ~Particularly when confronted with an attorney who is disruptive or insists on interrupting the testimony of the unrepresented party, be prepared to cite GS Ch . 8C, Rule 611, which provides: The court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presen ting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascert ainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect wi tnesses from harassme nt or undue embarrassment. ~Similarly, when confronted with an attorney who objec ts to your questioning of parties or contends that your participation is inappropriate be cause you are \"helping,\" be prepared to cite Rule 614, which says . . . The court may, on its own motion or at the suggestion of a party call witnesses, and all parties are entitled to cross-examine witnesses thus called. . . . The court may interrogate witnesses, whether called by itself or a party. Small Claims Procedure Page 20Four Rules of Evidence You Should Know Business records exception to hearsay rule Writing or records of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnosis, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge are admissible if kept in the regular course of business and if it was the regular course of business to make that record, unless the source information or circumsta nces of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness. G.S. 8-45: Verified stat ement of account In an action on an account for goods sold, rents, services rendered, or labor performed, or any oral contract for money loaded, a verified itemized statement of the account is admissible into evidence and is deemed corr ect unless disputed by the defendant. Verified: Accompanied by an affidavit from a person who (1) would be competent to testify at trial; (2) has personal knowledge of the particular account, or of the books and records of the business in general; and (3) swears that the account is correct and presently is owed by defendant to plaintiff. Itemized: Describes each item with price and item number, if there is one. Best Evidence Rule (paraphrased) When an action by a party is based on a right creat ed by a written co ntract, and the content of that contract is in dispute, the party must either produce the contract or adequately explain why he is unable to do so. Parole Evidence Rule When contract is in writing, parties may not introduce evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreement that varies the terms of the written contract Note that the rule has no application in two circumstances: (1) When the evidence is offered to assist the court in determining the meaning of an ambiguous term in the contract; and (2) when the evidence offered relates to an oral agreement taking place after the written contract and thus in support of an allegation tha t the written contract was subsequently modified by a later oral agreement. Small Claims Procedure Page 21 Small Claims Procedure Page 22Words of Wisdom About Small Claims Procedure Always begin with \"Who is suing whom, for what?\" Who are the parties, and what are the claims? If the answers to these questions are not crystal clear from the complaint & summons, get those answers first. Focusing on this question at the very beginning helps you remember the most important rule: Notice is a very big deal. And so is jurisdiction. There is a difference between an order \u2014which does something with a pending lawsuit\u2014and a judgment, which makes a determination based on the evidence about the merits of a case. Your judgment should dispose of all the parties and all the claims. These three things should be identical : Your written judgment Your spoken judgment Your actual decision Finality of judgments is a very big deal. Everyone makes errors, and professional decision-makers make lots of them. The remedy for legal errors made by a judicial official is appeal. Not changing your judgment. See previous principle. Decide the case in front of you. Small Claims Procedure Page 25 Small Claims Procedure Page 268/21/2013 53WHAT HAPPENS AFTER SMALL CLAIMS COURT Location of Clerk's Office: __________________________________ Notice to Both Parties If you are either the plaintiff (the person suing) or defendant (the person being sued) and are unhappy with the decision of the magi strate, you may appeal the case to district court. You may appeal either by telling the magistrate at the trial that you want to appeal or by filing a written request with the clerk of court within 10 days after the magistrate ruled in your case. If you want to file a written request, ask the clerk to give you a copy of form AOC-CVM-303, which is the notice of appeal form. If you give written notice of appeal to the clerk, you must also send a copy of the form to the opposing parties in your case. Whether you appeal in open court or file a written appeal, you MUST PAY $150 court costs to the clerk. These costs must be paid within 20 days of the magistrate's ruli ng, unless you are a tenant appealing from judgment in a summary ejectment action, in which case the costs must be paid within 10 days of the magistrate's ruling. If you cannot pay the appeal cost s, you may be able to qualify to file your appeal as an indigent. If you are a te nant appealing an eviction and you want to continue to live at the premises until the case is heard on appeal, you will be required to pay past due rent to the clerk and to sign an undertaking that you will pay rent into the court as it becomes due to keep the judgment from being carried out. If you meet the requirements for appeal as an indigent, you may be excused from the requirement that you pay past due rent in order to remain on the premises while the appeal is pending. If one party appeals, there will be a completely new trial before a district court judge. (In some cases, the matter may be assigned first to an arbitrator. If that occurs contact the clerk to have the procedure explained to you.) The clerk will notify both parties of the trial date (usually by mailing the trial calendar), and both must appear at that time. If you are the defendant and don't appear at trial, the plaintiff will probably win the case. Both parties should bring all y our evidence and witnesses to the trial. The trial before the district court judge will be more formal than the one before the magistrate; therefore, you may wish to consider hiring an attorney to represent you. Notice to Plaintiff (Party Suing) If you won your case, your judgment against the defendant is good for 10 years. Before the end of the 10 years, you may bring another lawsuit to extend the judgment an additional 10 years. If you have won a money judgment, it becomes a lien against any land owned by the defendant, which means the defendant cannot sell that land without paying your judgment. Just because you have a judgment does not mean that you will be able to collect it. The defendant must have enough property to enable the sheriff to sell the property to satisfy the judgment. You may tr y as many times in the 10-year period as you wish to collect the judgment. If you have won a judgment that the defendant owes y ou money, the court cannot try to help you collect that money unless you have given the defendant an opportunity to claim his or her exemptions. \"Exemptions\" is a legal term referring to a judgment debtor's right to shelter certain property from being seized and sold to satisfy a judgment. After the judgment is rendered, you must get two forms (Notice of Rights and Motion to Claim Exempt Property) from the clerk. You must serve these on the defendant. The back of the Notice of Rights tells you how to serve the forms. If you have not heard anything from the defendant within 20 days after you have served the Noti ce of Rights and Motion, you may go to the clerk ask to have an execution issued. The back of the Notice of Ri ghts form tells you what you have to bring to the clerk. If the defendant responds to your notice and cl aims exemptions, you may either (1) agree with the exemptions claimed and ask the clerk to i ssue an execution for non-exempt property or (2) object to the Small Claims Procedure Page 27/g3 54claimed exemptions and have the distri ct court judge determine the exempt property. After the district judge determines the defendant's exemptions, you ma y ask the clerk to issue an execution for all nonexempt property. You will have to pay $55 to have an execution issued--$25 for the court and $30 for the sheriff. Those costs will be added to the judgment to be repaid by the defendant. An execution is an order to the sheriff to seize and sell property of the defendant to satisfy the judgment. If you know of any property that belongs to the defendant, you should attach to the execution a description of the property and where it may be found to help the sheriff. The sheriff will sell any property that can be found and turn the proceeds over to the clerk of court, who will then turn the money over to you. If the defendant pays all or part of the money owed to you directly, you MUST go to the clerk's office and indicate how mu ch you have been paid. If you have a judgment ordering the defendant to turn personal property over to you and if the defendant has not turned it over within 10 days after the magistrate enters the judgment, you may ask the clerk to issue a writ of possession to the sheriff. The cost to you for having the writ issued is $25, plus $30 for the sheriff. The sheriff will then try to recover the property from the defenda nt and turn it over to you. You may be asked to advance the costs of having the sheriff pick up the property. If you are a landlord and have a judgment for eviction and the tenant fails to leave the premises within 10 days after the judgment was rendered, you may pay $25 and have the clerk issue a writ of possession to the sheriff. The sheriff will then remove th e defendant from the premises. You will have to pay the sheriff $30. You may be asked to advance the costs of removing the tenant's property and one month's storage costs or you may request the sheriff, in writing, to lock the premises and you will then be responsible for handling the tenant's propert y in the manner required by the law. If the defendant won a judgment against you on a counterclaim, read the section below for defendants. Notice to Defendant (Party Being Sued) If a judgment is entered against you stating that you owe the plaintiff money and you want to pay the amount owed, it would be safer to pay the money to th e clerk of court rather than to the plaintiff. If you do pay the plaintiff directly , make sure he or she notifies the clerk so the judgment won't continue to be listed against you. If you cannot or do not pay the judgment, the plaintiff will serve a notice of rights on you, telling you that you must claim your exemptions or they will be waived. It is very important that you respond to that notice. Exemptions are property the law allows you to keep from being taken from you to pay off judgments against you. If you fail to claim your exemptions, the sheriff will be able to seize and sell any property you own. If you fail to claim your exemptions when notifie d, you may ask the clerk to set aside your waiver if you have the grounds. Also, even if you have waived your st atutory exemptions, you may go to the clerk any time up until the proceeds of the sale of your property have been distributed to the plaintiff and request your constitutional exemptions. The judgment is good against you for 10 years and may be extended for another 10 years. It becomes a lien against any land you own now or buy later until it is satisfied. If you have a judgment against you to turn personal property over to th e plaintiff, you may not prevent the property from being turned over to the plainti ff unless the plaintiff is a finance company and the judgment against you is to recover household goods that you listed as co llateral in a security agreement with the finance company and the finance company did not lend you the money to buy those goods. In that case, the finance company must give you notice of y our right to claim exemptions as described in the paragraph above and you may keep the household goods from being repossessed by claiming them as exempt. If you are a tenant and have an eviction judgment against you, you will have to leave the premises. If you do not leave voluntarily, the sheriff may forcibly evict y ou and remove and store your belongings for you or may leave them with the landlord who may dispose of them in the manner allowed by the law. You will be held responsible for the costs of moving you out. Small Claims Procedure Page 28/g3 54If you won a counterclaim against th e plaintiff in which y ou were awarded money, read the section for plaintiffs to see what to do. Small Claims Procedure Page 29 Small Claims Procedure Page 33/g561 Small Claims Procedure Page 34The Difference between an Order and a Judgment When a magistrate has heard evidence in a case and makes a decision based on that evidence, the formal document reflecting that decision is a judgment of the court. It is recorded on the appropriate AOC-CVM judgment form, signed by the magistrate, and filed with the clerk. Entry of judgment is one of the law's Momentous Moments\u2014like the effect of a deed, a divorce decree, or an honorable discharge, the rights of an individual are significantly different the moment after judgment is entered than the moment before. Because of this, a fundamental legal preference is expressed in the phrase \"finality of judgments.\" A judgment can be modified or set asid e, but not without observation of formal legal requirements and ne ver without good reason. One of many confusing facts in the world of small claims law is that when a plaintiff fails to prove the case by the greater weight of the evidence, the law (and the AOC forms) uses the term dismissal to describe the outcome. In the larger legal world, to say a case is dismissed means that it has been finally disposed of without the parties having produced evidence and the court deciding it on the merits. In Small Claims Land, that's also true, but the word is used more broadly to encompass a decision on the merits against the plaintiff. While the terminology overlaps, it's important to distinguish the two very different outcomes, one of which is a judgment on the merits and the other is . . .not. Instead, the other (confusingly termed a dismissal ) brings a case to an end without a judgment being entered. The AOC form for recording a dismi ssal\u2014and actually other significant events occurring during the lifetime of a case\u2014is G-108, the generic Order form. G-108 is used to record a dismissal in any of the following events: 1) The plaintiff has decided not to proceed with the case at this time, and has not yet finished presenting evidence (a voluntary dismissal ). 2) The plaintiff has completed presenting eviden ce, but asks to dismiss and the court allows it (also a voluntary dismissal ). 3) The plaintiff failed to appear for trial (an involuntary dismissal ). 4) Neither party appeared for trial (an involuntary dismissal ). The AOC Order form has checkboxes allowing a magistrate to indicate that a dismissal is with or without prejudice. A dismissal with prejudice bars the plaintiff from later filing an identical action. A dismissal without prejudice , on the other hand, preserves the plaintiff's right to sue the defendant at a later point for the same alleged wrong. Generally, a voluntary dismissal is without prejudice. A magistrate should check the box indicating with prejudice only if the plaintiff so indic ates. An example of an appropriate fact situation would be if the plaintiff informs the court that the plaintiff wishes to take a voluntary dismissal because the defendant has paid all that is owed. Generally, an involuntary dismissal is with prejudice. If the plaintiff fails to appear and the defendant appears and requests a dismissal, the law provides that the dismissal is with prejudice. When neither party appears, the same result generally applies, although a magistrate may dismiss without prejudice if justice requires. In some cases it may be best for the magistrate to check neither box and instead explain the dismissal. A common example arises when a plaintiff files a case in small claims which Small Claims Procedure Page 35DGL/SOG/2015 is not eligible for hearing in that court. A dismissal with prejudice is subject to being understood as a ruling that the plaintiff may not refile the action in any court. A dismissal without prejudice is sometimes misunderst ood by a plaintiff unfamiliar with the law to mean the case can be refiled in small claims court.

I have been married to my husband for ten years. I became pregnant with my first child shortly after we were married. We now have three children, ages nine, seven and six. Even from the beginning, my husband has made all of the decisions for our family. He told me that my job was to be a good wife\u2014 to take care of the children and to cook and clean for him. The first time he hit me was when I was pregnant with my first child. We had come home from my mother's house and he was angry about something. I think I had forgotten to buy a kind of food item that he wanted, and then he slapped me. I thought it was just an isolated event. I never thought he would do it again. Since then, he has hit, kicked, choked, slapped and burned me. He does not hurt me physically that often, though, maybe only once a month. Mainly, when I do something he doesn't like, such as visiting my mother or talking on the phone to a friend, he calls me a prostitute and other bad names, and tells me that he will take the children and go to his mother's home if I am not a good wife. He refuses to let me take a job, even though all of our children are in school, and I would be qualified for many different kinds of jobs. He does not let me have any money, except for a little for grocery shopping. He is very jealous and possessive. A few months ago, he became very angry because I was late getting home from the store. He accused me of seeing another man and punched a hole in the door between the kitchen and the living room. My sons were ther e and saw this, and he yelled at them to go to their rooms. I recently overheard him talking to my seven-year-old son. He was asking if my son ever saw me talking to \"other men.\" He told my son that I was crazy and that my son should watch me and tell him if I did anything strange. Another time, we went to a party given by a friend of his from work. I met the wife of one of the people my husband works with. We spent a long time talking. After some time, my husband came up to me, grabbed my arm so tightly it hurt and left bruises, and whispered in my ear, \"We're leaving.\" Just by the look he gave me, I knew he was angry that I spent so much time talking with the woman, and that he would likely beat me when we got home. When we got home, he smashed a framed picture I have of myself with a group of my friends at the university, before I was married, by throwing it at the wall near where I was standing. He told me that I \"knew\" what would happen if I continued to disobey him. A few months ago, my husband came home late with friends and made me get up to cook them food. He started joking with his friends about how much I weighed, and that I was like all other women who let themselves go once they got married. He called me many bad names. After his friends left, he woke me up again and forced me to have sex with him, even though I didn't want to and was feeling sick. Recently, I tried to talk to my husband about the abuse. He got very angry. He said he doesn't hurt me any more than is to be expected of a husband and that in fact he thinks that he is too nice to me. He said that if he did happen to be a bit harsh with me sometimes, it was my fault anyway for not being a good wife and letting myself become so unattractive. I love my husband, but I do not think I can continue to live with him. He has threatened to kill me, the children, and himself if I leave him, and I don't have anywhere to go. I don't have a job or any money, and would not be able to find another place to s tay even if I did leave. Domestic Violence - Page 41 Domestic Violence - Page 42Do's and Don'ts of Handling Domestic Violence Victims DO DON'T /g120/g3Explain the services available in a simple and direct manner. /g120/g3Assume that battered women know about their options and the services available. /g120/g3Prioritize the victim's needs. /g120/g3Overload the victim with services and decisions. /g120/g3Express concern for their safety and that of their children. Empower the victim with information that increases their choices. /g120/g3Ever ask the victim why they stay. This is a shaming remark, which insinuates the victim is at fault. Leaving does not always solve the problem. /g120/g3Be aware of your own attitude, experiences and reactions to abuse. It is appropriate to disagree with the victim's behavior and/or attitude while remaining objective, empathetic and understanding. /g120/g3Impose your own values and make quick judgments. Your reaction to the victim's responses will be communicated strongly. /g120/g3Help the victim understand the danger and repetitiveness of the violence. /g120/g3Expect the victim to exaggerate or invent the violence. /g120/g3Encourage the victim to take small steps, which will promote independence and build self-confidence. /g120/g3Try to rescue the victim. /g120/g3Take into consideration cultural values and beliefs. /g120/g3Lump all victims into one category. /g120/g3Challenge any efforts on the victim's part to justify the abuse through religion. /g120/g3Reject the woman's religion or ignore references to religious beliefs. /g120/g3Convey fears for the victim's safety and respect their reasons for staying. Separation from the abuser can be the most dangerous time for the victim. /g120/g3Convey disappointment if the victim chooses to stay. This can elicit feelings of failure and worthlessness. /g120/g3Define your role as a court official; be realistic about what you can and cannot do with regards to the relationship. /g120/g3Get caught up in the role of marriage counselor, mediator and/or referee. /g120/g3Recognize that the victim's reactions and responses may change frequently and be unpredictable. Reactions will range from resistance to cooperation. /g120/g3Become cynical with the victim's failure to take the action or respond the way you believe they should. Your frustration can result in victim blaming and impact your ability to intervene effectively. /g120/g3Express your concerns if the situation is lethal and take appropriate action. /g120/g3Ignore or minimize the potential dangerousness of the situation. /g120/g3Be patient and honest with the victim. /g120/g3Expect instant decision-making by the victim or contribute to unrealistic expectations. /g120/g3Emphasize the abuser's responsibility for his/her own choices. /g120/g3Let the victim blame themselves or other factors for the abuse. /g120/g3Expect the \"honeymoon\" period to emerge following an abusive episode. /g120/g3Delay in responding to a reported incident of violence. Timing is a key factor in gathering evidentiary information. /g120/g3Challenge the victim's explanation of the incident and openly ask if their partner is hurting them. The approach must be sensitive and not threatening in nature. /g120/g3Accept unexplained injuries accompanied by implausible reasons. /g120/g3Be honest with the victim, especially about confidentiality issues. /g120/g3Make a promise you can't keep. Domestic Violence - Page 43 Domestic Violence - Page 44Danger Assessment * 1. Has the physical violence increased in severity or frequency over the past year? 2. Does he own a gun? 3. Have you left him after living together during the past year? 3a. (If you have never lived with him, check here___) 4. Is he unemployed? 5. Has he ever used a weapon against you or threatened you with a lethal weapon? 5a. (If yes, was the weapon a gun?____) 6. Does he threaten to kill you? 7. Has he avoided being arrested for domestic violence? 8. Do you have a child that is not his? 9. Has he ever forced you to have sex when you did not wish to do so? 10. Does he ever try to choke you? 11. Does he use illegal drugs? By drugs, I mean \"uppers\" or amphetamines, speed, angel dust, cocaine, \"crack\", street drugs or mixtures? 12. Is he an alcoholic or problem drinker? 13. Does he control most or all of your daily activities? (For instance: does he tell you who you can be friends with, when you can see your family, how much money you can use, or when you can take the car? (If he tries, but you do not let him, check here: ____) 14. Is he violently and constantly jealous of you? (For instance, does he say \"If I can't have you, no one can.\") 15.

Does he follow or spy on you, leave threatening notes or messages on an answering machine, destroy your property, or call you when you don't want him to? 20. Have you ever threatened or tried to commit suicide? One study has shown that women who score 8 or higher on the Danger Assessment are at very grave risk of being killed by their intimate partners; women who score 4 or higher are at great risk. . . .By simply asking the questions in the assessment, magistrates may raise a victim's awareness of the dangerousness of the situation. *\"Danger C.

At the beginning of a relationship, an abuser may say that jealousy (actually possessiveness) is a sign of love. Possessiveness has nothing to do with love. It is a sign of lack of trust. The abuser may question his partner about who she talks to, accuse her of flirting, or keep her from spending time with family, friends, or children. As the possessiveness progresses, he may call her frequently during the day or drop by unexpectedly. He may refuse to let her work for fear she'll meet someone else, or even engage in behaviors such as checking her car mileage or asking friends to watch her. 2.Controlling Behavior. At first the batterer will say this behavior is due to his concern for her safety, her need to use her time well, or her need to make good decisions. He will be angry if the woman is \"late\" coming back from the store or an appointment; he will question her closely about where she went and who she talked with. As this behavior progresses, he may not let the woman make personal decisions about the house, her clothing, or even going to church. He may keep all the money or even make her ask permission to leave the house or room. 3.Quick Involvement. Many battered women dated or knew their abuser for less than six months before they were married, engaged, or living together. He comes in like a whirlwind, claiming, \"you're the only person I could ever talk to\", or \"I've never been loved like this by anyone.\" He will pressure the woman to commit to the relationship in such a way that later the woman may feel very guilty or that she's \"letting him down\" if she wants to slow down involvement or break off the relationship. 4.Unrealistic Expectations. Abusive people will expect their partner to meet all their needs. He expects a perfect wife, mother, lover, and friend. He will say things such as \"if you love me, I'm all you need, and you're all I need.\" His partner is expected to take care of everything for him emotionally and in the home. 5.Isolation. The abusive person tries to cut his partner off from all resources. If she has male friends, she's a \"whore.\" If she has women friends, she's a lesbian. If she's close to family, she's \"tied to the apron strings.\" He accuses people who are the woman's supports of causing trouble. He may want to live in the country, without a telephone, or refuse to let her drive the car, or he may try to keep her from working or going to school. 6.Blames others for problems. If he is chronically unemployed, someone is always doing him wrong or out to get him. He may make mistakes and then blame the woman for upsetting him and keeping him from concentrating on the task at hand. He may tell the woman she is at fault for virtually anything that goes wrong in his life. 7.Blames others for feelings. The abuser may tell his partner \"you make me mad,\" \"you're hurting me by not doing what I want you to do,\" or \"I can't help being angry.\" He is the one who makes the decision about what he thinks or feels, but he will use these feelings to manipulate his partner. Harder to catch are claims, \"you make me happy,\" or \"you control how I feel.\" 8.Hypersensitivity. An abuser is easily insulted, claiming his feelings are hurt, when in actuality he is angry or taking the slightest setback as a personal attack. He will rant and rave about the injustice of things that have happened, things that are just a part of living (for example being asked to work late, getting a traffic ticket, being asked to help with chores, or being told some behavior is annoying). 9.Cruelty to animals or children. Abusers may punish animals brutally or be insensitive to their pain or suffering. An abuser may expect children to be capable of things beyond their abilities (e.g. punishes a 2 year old for wetting a diaper). He may tease children until they cry. Some studies indicate that about 60% of men who physically abuse their partners also abuse their children. 10.Sexual abuser. An abuser may physically assault private parts of a woman's body. He may show little concern about whether the woman wants to have sex and use violence to coerce her into having sex with him. He may begin having sex with his partner while she is sleeping. He may Domestic Violence - Page 49force her to do sexual acts that she finds uncomfortable, unpleasant, or degrading. He may demand sex after beating her. 11.Verbal abuse. In addition to saying things that are intentionally meant to be cruel and hurtful, verbal abuse is also apparent in the abuser's degrading of his partner, cursing her, and belittling her accomplishments. The abuser tells her she is stupid and unable to function without him. This may involve waking her up to verbally abuse her or not letting her go to sleep. 12.Rigid sex roles. The abuser expects his partner to serve him. He may even say the woman must stay at home and obey in all things - even acts that are criminal in nature. The abuser sees women as inferior to men, responsible for menial tasks, and unable to be a whole person without a relationship. 13.Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde personality. Many women are confused by the abuser's sudden changes in mood. She may think he has some sort of mental problem because one minute he's agreeable, the next he's exploding. Explosiveness and moodiness are typical of men who beat their partners. These behaviors are related to other characteristics, such as hypersensitivity. 14.Past battering. The abuser may say he has hit women in the past, but blame them for the abuse (e.g., they made me do it\"). The women may hear from relatives or ex-partners that he is abusive. A batterer will abuse any woman he is with if the relationship lasts long enough for the violence to begin; situational circumstances do not make one's personality abusive. 15.Threats of violence. This includes any threat of physical force meant to control the partner. \"I'll slap your mouth off,\" \"I'll kill you,\" \"I'll break your neck.\" Most people do not threaten their partners. Abusers will try to excuse their threats by saying that everybody talks that way. 16.Breaking or striking objects. Breaking loved possessions is used as a punishment, but mostly to terrorize the woman into submission. The abuser may beat on the table with his fist, or throw objects around or near his partner. There is great danger when someone thinks he has the right to punish or frighten his partner. 17.Any force during an argument. This may involve the abuser's holding the woman down, physically restraining her from leaving the room, or any pushing or shoving. He may hold his partner against the wall, telling her, \"You're going to listen to me.\" Domestic Violence - Page 50Domestic Violence and Children Children Exposed to Batterers Traits of Batterers /g131Controlling /g131Entitled/Self-Centered /g131Believe they are the victims /g131Manipulative /g131Skillfully dishonest (e.g. say they \"don't remember\") /g131Disrespectful, Superior Implications of Entitlement Thinking /g131Leads abusers to think they are the victim /g131Will stop partner from attending to children so she can attend to him /g131Wants children to meet his needs /g131Increases a child's vulnerability when conditioned to meet adult's needs Implications of Good Public Image /g131Keeps people from believing partner and children /g131Abuser looks like sensitive team player /g131Confuses the children obelieve no one else thinks anything is wrong with battering oLeads children to blaming the mom, because she is only one saying something is wrong Implications of Manipulation /g131Calm demeanor in court /g131File multiple harassing or retaliatory motions /g131Make false allegations against partner, (e.g. -flight risk, substance abuser, neglects children) /g131Use court process to avoid child support or get it reduced /g131Use parallel actions in different jurisdictions to gain advantage Batterers /g131Good early in a relationship /g131Externalize responsibility /g131Punish, retaliate /g131Batter serially /g131Danger increases post separation Domestic Violence - Page 51Information from Lundy Bancroft, author of The Batterer as ParentBatterer's Risk to Abuse Children Physical Abuse /g13150% of batterers abuse their children /g1317 times more likely to abuse their children than a non-battering parent Sexual Abuse /g131Six times more likely to sexually abuse their children than a non-battering parent /g131Correlated with presence of violence towards partner but not severity Post Separation Risk /g131Abuse mothers during exchanges /g131Use child as weapon for information on mother /g131Physical, sexual, or mental abuse of child /g131Child exposed to abuser's violence of new partner /g131Learn attitudes and behaviors that lead to violence /g131Batterer is not focused on needs of child Domestic Violence - Page Mark Botts, Associate Professor (2009) Criteria for Involuntary Commitment in North Carolina Mental Illness (Adults) an illness that so lessens the capacity of the individual to use self-control, judgment, and discretion in the conduct of his affairs and social relations as to make it necessary or advisable for him to be under treatment, care, supervision, guidance, or control. Mental Illness (Minors) a mental condition, other than mental retardation alone, that so impairs the youth's capacity to exercise age-adequate self-control or judgment in the conduct of his activities and social relationships that he is in need of treatment. Substance abuse the pathological use or abuse of alcohol or ot her drugs in a way or to a degree that produces an impairment in personal, social, or occupational functioning. Substance abuse may include a pattern of tolerance and withdrawal. Dangerous to self Within the relevant past, the individual has: 1. acted in such a way as to show that a. he would be unable, without care, s upervision, and the continued assistance of others not otherwise available, to exercise self-control, judgment, and discretion in the conduct of his daily responsibilities and social relations, or to satisfy his need for nourishment, personal or medical care, shelter, or self-protection and safety; and b. there is a reasonable probability of his suffering serious physical debilitation within the near future unless adequate treatment is given. Behavior that is grossly irrational, actions that the individual is unable to control, behavior that is grossly inappropriate to the situation, or other evidence of severely impaired insight and judgment creates an inference that the individual is unable to care for himself; or 2. attempted suicide or threatened suicide and there is a reasonable probability of suicide unless adequate treatment is given; or 3. mutilated himself or attempted to mutilate himself and there is a reasonable probability of serious self-mutilation unless adequate treatment is given. Previous episodes of dangerousness to self, when applicable, may be considered when determining the reasonable probability of serious physical debilitation, suicide, or serious self-mutilation. Dangerous to others Within the relevant past the individual has: 1. inflicted, attempted to inflict, or threatened to inflict serious bodily harm on another and there is a reasonable probability that this conduct will be repeated, or 2. acted in a way that created a substantial risk of serious bodily harm to another and there is a reasonable probability that this conduct will be repeated, or 3. engaged in extreme destruction of property and there is a reasonable probability that this conduct will be repeated. Previous episodes of dangerousness to others, when applicable, may be considered when determining the reasonable probability of future dangerous conduct. Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that an individual has committed a homicide in the relevant past is evidence of dangerousness to others.

You are a magistrate who receives a petition from an emergency room physician. The physician has checked box number 1 on the petition, which states that the respondent, Martin, is \"mentally ill and dangerous to self of others or mentally ill and in need of treatment in order to prevent further disability and deterioration that would predictably result in dangerousness.\" The facts upon which the physician's opinion is based, according to the petition, are: \"Patient behaving in a bizarre manner.

Her husband reports that Molly has forgotten to turn off the stove two times in the last week, resulting in the burning of some pots and pans and a Formica countertop. Molly is extremely forgetful, frequently talks to the wall, and appears to be out of touch with her real su rroundings. She has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder (manic-depressive disorder). Is Molly dangerous to herself or others? Why or why not? 3. John goes downtown, hangs out on the main street sidewalk, blocks people from walking by, preaches loud words, and refuses to leave after being directed by the city police. John's brother says that John is religiously preoccupied, has ideas of persecution, and delusions of grandeur. John cannot understand why City Hall will not give him a license. John's brother is afraid that if John persists in trying to convert someone on the street who is resisting John's idea, then this person might become physically aggressive toward John. John's brother does not get any indication that John is aggressively motivated in the sense of being physically violent. John's brother has prepared a petiti on/affidavit for commitment for the magistrate. John's brother has written down in the petition the facts stated above and added that he believes John is in a mentally ill state of mind, is dangerous to himself or others, and needs medical treatment. Is John dangerous to himself or others? Why or why not? 4. Same facts as in number 3, except the petitioner adds that John \"assaulted two people yesterday.\" Is John dangerous to himself or others?

She has not attempted to seek other employment and has been living in her car for the past two weeks, despite the cold weather (December). Jane believes that people are harassing her. Jane's daughter, Mary, was able to get her mother assesse d by a physician who diagnosed Jane as suffering from psychotic depression, and po ssibly paranoid schizophrenia. The doctor also noted to Mary that Jane was not eating well. Since this initial evaluation two weeks ago, Jane has refused treatment and begun living in her car. Mary reports that her mother seems to have imaginary friends visiting her car, has a flat affect, and believes that others are \"harming her.\" Mary believes that her mother is incapable of providing for herself in her present state and is not getting sufficient nourishment. Mary says that Jane does not appear to have eaten much in the last two weeks and is losing weight. Jane apparently runs the car engine periodically to keep warm. Mary fears that Jane might die of carbon monoxid e poisoning if Jane continues to live in her car the rest of the winter. Is Jane dangerous to herself? Why or why not? 6. Mary has a hammer in the house, breaks everything she can find, and told her husband that if he went to sleep she would bash his brains out. She has threatened to kill her daughter, granddaughter and sister. The daughter says, \"Upon coming home, I found the TV busted, the telephone had been cut away from the wall, and glass was all over the living room. When I asked what happened, mother became excited and said that she had broken the TV, cut the phone, and broke some of the glass. On the phone the night before, mother had threatened to kill father and aunt.\" Is Mary dangerous to herself? Why or why not? 7. David was found sitting on the edge of a busy airport runway. He had been observed in the woods with a rope around his neck and cutting his arm with a knife. He kept an iron pipe and hatchet under his bed and threatened his mother three days age by forcing her to sit in one chair and not move for two hours while he was screaming, shouting, and cursing. He threatened to \"bust\" his mother's head if she called anybody. He complained of demons and of feeling that his bones were being pulled out. Is David dangerous? Why or why not?

This order is not an order of commitment but only authorizes the person to be evaluated and treated until a court hearing. The individual making the request has filed a petition with the court for this purpose and is, therefore, called the \"petitioner.\" The individual to be taken into cust ody for examination will have an opport unity to respond to the petition and is, therefore, called the \"respondent.\" If you are taken into custody, the word \"respondent,\" below, refers to you. 1. A law enforcement officer or other person designated in the custody order must take the respondent into custody within 24 hours. If the respondent cannot be found within 24 hours, a new custody order will be required to take the respondent into custody. Custody is not for the purpose of arrest, but for the respondent's own safety and the safety of others, and to determine if the respondent needs treatment. 2. Without unnecessary delay after assuming custody, the law enforcement officer or other individual designated to provide transportation must take the respondent to a physician or eligible psychologist for examination. 3. The respondent must be examined as soon as possible, and in any event within 24 hours, after being presented for examination. The examining physici an or psychologist will r ecommend either outpatient commitment, inpatient commitment, substance abuse commitment, or termination of these proceedings. /g135Inpatient commitment : If the examiner finds the respondent meets the criteria for inpatient commitment, the examiner will recommend inpatient commitment. The law enforcement officer or other designated person must take the respondent to a 24-hour facility. /g135Outpatient commitment : If the examiner finds the respondent meets the criteria for outpatient commitment, the examiner will recommend outpatient commitment and identify the proposed outpatient treatment physician or center in the examination report. The pers on designated in the order to provide transportation must return the respondent to the respondent's regular residence or, with the respondent's consent, to the home of a consenting individual located in the origin ating county. The respondent must be released from custody. /g135Substance abuse commitment : If the examiner finds the respondent meets the criteria for substance abuse commitment, the examiner must recommend commitment and whether the respondent should be released or held at a 24-hour facility pending a district court h earing. Depending upon the physician's recommendation, the law enforcement officer or other designated individual will either release the respondent or take him or her to a 24-hour facility. /g135Termination : If the examiner finds the respondent meets neither of the criteria for commitment, the respondent must be released from custody and the proceedings terminated. If the custody order was based on the finding that the respondent was probably menta lly ill, then the person designated in the order to provide transportation must return the respondent to the respondent's regular residence or, with the respondent's consent, to the home of a consenting individual located in the originating county. 4. If the law enforcement officer transports the respondent to a 24 hour facility, another evaluation must be performed within 24 hours of arrival. This evaluat or has the same options as indicated in step 3 above. If the respondent is not released, the respondent will be given a hearing before a district court judge within 10 days of the date the respondent was taken into custody.

Brannon What is Involuntary Civil Commitment? Involuntary civil commitment is the process th at the state, through its courts, uses to order a person who meets certain statutory criteria to ob tain mental health treatment. The person ordered to receive treatment is called \"the respondent.\" Civil commitment is involuntary because the respondent is ordered to submit to mental health treatment without his or her consent. When a respondent is involuntarily co mmitted, the state has substituted its judgment about what is best fo r the respondent for the re spondent's ow n judgment. This substituted judg ment is a significant intrusion on the respond ent's right to liberty, as is the involunt ary commitment itself. Despite its intrusiveness, the commitment process before 1973 containe d very few safeguards to assure that the respondent was not arbitrarily deprive d of freedom. Procedural due process was lacking insofar as a person could be committed for twenty days, without notice or a hearing, if a physician certified that the pe rson was mentally ill or inebriate and dangerous to self or others. 1 Substantive due process was lac king in that a respondent could be committed for up to 180 days if , after an informal hearing, the cler k of court found that he or she was mentally ill or in ebriate. The respondent did not need to be dangerous to self or others to be committed.2 In 1973 the process was changed so that no respondent could be ta ken into custody without a hearing in which a magistrate found that the respond ent was either mentally ill or \"inebriate\" (later changed to /g374 The author is a faculty member of the School of Government.

The state must show some dangerousness. \"A state cann ot constitutionally confine without more a nondangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom by himself or with the help of a willing and responsible family members or friends.\" 4 Parts six, seven and eight of Article 5, Chapter 122C of the North Carolin a General Statutes establish the procedures for involuntary commitment. A brief overview of these procedures is set out below. Description of Commitment Process The statutory procedure for an involuntary commitment involves some or all of the following stages: The Petition for Commitment : A person who has knowledge of someone he or she believes needs mental health or substance abuse treatment petitions the magistrate to begin the involuntary commitment process. 5 (Petitions may also be presented to the clerk of superior court. Although this bulletin will refer to magistrates only, the same law and procedure applies if the petition is presented to a cler k.) This petition is an affidavit settin g out facts intended to show that the respondent me ets the statutory criteria for issuing an order (called a custody order) to ta ke the respondent into custody for examination by a physician or eligible psychologist. Review of the Petition : The magistrate reviews the petition to determine whether reasonable grounds exist to find that the respondent meets the criteria for a custody order. 6 If the magistrate does not find reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent meets the criteria, the magistrate must decline to issue the order. Custody Order : If the magistrate does find reasonable grounds to conclude that the respondent meets the criteria for a custody order, the magistrate must issue an order to a law enforcement officer to take the respondent into cu stody and transport him or 3.

Outpatient commitment means treatment in an outpatient setting and may include medication, individual or group therapy, day or partial day programming activities, services and training including educational and vocational activities, supervision or living arrangements, and any other services prescribed either to alleviate the individual's illness or disability, maintain semi-independent functioning, or to prevent further deterioration that may reasonably be predicted to result in the need for inpatient commitment to a 24-hour facility. G.S. 122C-3(27). 11. Inpatient commitment involves holding the respondent in the custody of a facility the state has designated \"24-hour\" facilities. A \"24-hour facility\" is one whose primary purpose is to provide services for the care and treatment of persons who are mentally ill or substance abusers and provides a structured living environment and services for a period of 24 consecutive hours or more. G.S. 122C-3(14)g. Such facilities include state operated psychiatric hospitals, public and private psychiatric and substance abuse hospitals, and general hospitals with inpatient psychiatric or substance abuse services. 12.

This hearing must occur within 10 days of the date the respondent is ta ken into custody by order of the magistrate. 16 At the hearing, if the court is persuaded by clear, cogent and convincing evidence that the respondent meets the commitment criteria, it will order involuntary commitment. 17 The magistrate's role in the involuntary commitment process is a small but important one. Magistrates decide whethe r to issue orders to ta ke respondents into custody for examination. Magistrates do not actually commit anyone; district court judges determine whether to commit. The role of the magistrate as an independent and neutral judicial official determining whether to initiate the process for involuntary comm itment is a safeguard to provide due process to a person before depriving that person of liberty as required by the United States Constitution. 18 The rest of this bulletin will focus on the magistrate's role in the pro cess that potentially leads to involuntary commitment. Criteria For Issuing A Custody Order When a person (called the petitioner) appears before a magistrate to initiate the process of involuntary commitment, the magistrate must determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent meets the statut ory criteria for issuing a custody order. Reasonable grounds exist when, taking into consideration all th e relevant information, a reasonable person would conclude that there is a fair li kelihood that the responden t meets the criteria for a custody order. The commitment); 122C-286(h) (substance abuse commitment). 18. See In re Reed, 39 N.C. App. 227, 249 S.E.2d 864 (1978). standard is synonymous with the probable cause standard that magistrates use in issuing warrants.19 There are three situations in which a magistrate can issue a custody order: 1. The respondent is mentally ill and dangerous to self or others. 2. The respondent is mentally ill and needs court-ordered treatment to prevent further disability or deterioration that would predictably lead to dangerousness. 3. The respondent is a substance abuser and dangerous to self or others. 20 The first standard, mentally ill and dangerous, is the most complicated of the standards. Mentally Ill and Dangerous to Self or Others Under this standard the magistrate must draw two conclusions from the facts presented before issuing a custody order: first, that the responden t is probably mentally ill; and next, that the respondent is probably dangerous to self or dangerous to others.21 Mentally Ill An adult respondent is mentally ill when his or her capacity to use self-control, judgment, and discretion in the conduct of his or her affairs and social relations has been so reduced by an illness that it becomes necessary or advisable for the respondent to be under treatment, care, supervision, guidance, or control. 22 A minor respondent is mentally ill when he or she has a mental condition, other than mental retardation alone, that so impairs his or her capacity to exercise age adequate self-control or judgme nt in the conduct of activities and social relationships th at he or she needs treatment. 23 In both cases, the important features of mental illness are: (1) an illness (2) that impairs judgment and self-control and (3) mak es treatment advisable. This is a legal standard, not a medical standard, and therefore does not require that the respondent have been diag nosed with a recognized mental illness by a physician or psychologist. Rather, 19. Id. at 229, 249 S.E.2d at 866. 20. A summary of the standards for involuntary commitment is found at Appendix I at the end of this bulletin. 21. G.S. 122C-261(b). 22. G.S. 122C-3(21)(i). 23. 33Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 4 the magistrate must listen fo r facts that show that the respondent needs treatme nt because of a mental condition that is impairi ng his or her ability to ma ke judgments or exercise self-control. In determining wheth er there are reasonable grounds to find that the respondent is mentally ill, a magistrate should loo k for conduct that is on the extreme ends of behaviors. Of course every person can, at times, engage in behavior that might be called extreme: a person can be so hostile that he slams the door in someone's face or so agitated that she drives off from the store with th e grocery bags on top of her car. But in a respondent who is mentally ill, this behavior should go one step further: hostility may be taken to the point of attac king someone or anxiety may be manifested by a complete inability to carry on with the other functions of daily life. Also the extreme behavior is continuing rather than a one-time occurrence. The magistrate must examine the information provided about the respondent's behavior, movements, speech, motions and thoughts. For example, is the respondent seeing things that are not really there? Is the respondent in constant motion or is he totally quiet and apathetic? Appendix II at the end of this bulletin gives examples of the kinds of extreme behaviors that might indicate mental illness. If a magistrate determines that the respondent is probably mentally ill, the next step is to determine whether the respondent is probably dang erous to self or others. Dangerous to Self A petitioner can show that the respondent is dangerous to self in three different ways: Respondent is unable to care for himself or herself, is suicidal, or has engaged in self-mutilation. Respondent is unable to care for self The first way of proving dangerousness is by showing that, within the rel evant past, the respondent has been unable to care for himself or herself and as a result is li kely to suffer serious physical debilitation in the near future if treatment is not given. 24 Magistrates should note that although the appellate cases cited in this bulletin are instructive, they are based on evidence presented at the district court hearing where the standard of proof\u2014clear, cogent, and convincing evidence\u2014is significantly higher than the reasonable grounds determination that the magistrate must mak e. The requirement that the behavior have occurred within the \"relevant past\" 24. G.S. 122C-3(11)a.1. does not mean that the be havior must have occurred within the \"recent past.\" There is no specific time within which the past behavior must have occurred to be relevant. (The concept of \"relevant past\" is discussed more thoroughly below at page 7.) The test for finding that the respondent is unable to care for self has two prongs and both must be satisfied before issuing a custody order. First, the magistrate must determine that the respondent has acted in such a way as to show that he or she probably would be unable, without care, supervision, and the continued assistance of others not otherwise available, to exercise self-control, judgment, and discretion in the conduct of daily responsibilities and social relations, or to satisfy the need for nourishment, person al or medical care, shelter, or self-protection and safety. Put more simply, the first prong requires the magistrate to find that the respondent probably wou ld be unable to care for himself or herself in regard to daily affairs without treatment. For example, a respondent, who required anti-psychotic medication but refused to ta ke it, would not eat properly, and refused recommended outpatient treatment was found dangerous to himself. Failure to care for medical, dietary, and grooming needs meets the test of dangerousness to self, the court said. 25 On the other hand, unusual eating habits alone may not show dangerou sness to self. The North Carolina Court of Appeals was hesitant to find that a respondent who fasted for a time, then ate a whole chicken or loaf of bread, and also ate about five pounds of sugar every two days was dangerous to himself.26 If the respondent seems unable to care for his or her daily needs, the magistrate must go on to ma ke a second, more specific, finding th at this inability to care for self creates a probability that the respondent will suffer serious physical debilitation within the near future. In the example above, where the respondent's dietary habits were irregular, the court noted that it could not find a li kelihood of serious debilitation because the state had presented no evidence of the effect of the irregular diet on the respondent, or any evidence on how long he had been eating that way. 27 The result might have been different if the respondent was diabetic. On the other 25. In re Lowery, 110 N.C. App. 67, 428 S.E.2d 861 (1993). 26. In re Monroe, 49 N.C. App. 23, 270 S.E.2d 537 (1980). The decision was an appeal from the district court's commitment so the standard of proof that was not met was clear, cogent and convincing rather than the magistrate's standard of reasonable grounds. 27. Id. at 29, 270 S.E.2d at 540. IVC - Page 34September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 5 hand, where a petitioner presented eviden ce that the respondent had been living in her car for two wee ks during the winter, had been unemployed for the last year, having left her job because she felt she was being harassed, and had no plans for earning income, and that her only means of subsistence was food brought by the petitioner, the court found that the respondent was at ris k of serious physical debilitation.28 In determining the reasonable probability of future dangerous conduct, the magistrate may consider previous episodes of dangerousness to self. 29 If the petitioner presents evidence that the respondent's behavior is gro ssly irrational, that the respondent is unable to cont rol his or her actions, that the respondent's behavior is grossly inappropriate to the situation, or that the respondent's insight and judgment are severely impaired, the magistrate may presume that the respondent probably meets this second prong.30 To summarize, a magistrate may find a respondent dangerous to self if the respondent seems unable to ta ke care of his or her daily needs and is likely to suffer serious physical debilitation in the near future if he or she does not receive treatment. However, the respondent cannot be found dangerous to self merely because he or she behaves in a way that may provo ke others to harm him or her. For example, a respondent who was not physically violent herself, but who aggressively preached on the street corner, trying to convert all passersby, was not dangerous to herself merely because someone who reacted negatively to her conversion attempt might react in a way that is physically harmful to her. 31 Respondent is suicidal A respondent also can be dangerous to self if he or she has attempted or threatened suicide and there is a reasonable probability of suicide unless the respondent receives adequate treatment. 32 The magistrate may choose to treat an attempt at suicide, alone, as sufficient evidence that there is a reasonable probability of suicide. The magistrate also may treat a threat of suicide as grounds for issuing a custody order and leave the determination of whether there is 28. In re Medlin, 59 N.C. App. 33, 295 S.E.2d 604 (1982). The finding that the respondent was mentally ill was not disputed. 29. G.S 122C-3(11)a. 30. G.S. 122C-3(11)a.1.II. 31. In re Hogan, 32 N.C. App. 429, 232 S.E.2d 492 (1977). 32. G.S. 122C-3(11)a.2. a future li kelihood of suicide to the examiners. Whether a statement constitutes a threat of suicide will depend on the responde nt's history and the context in which th e statement was made: for example, a statement lik e \"I could kill myself\" probably is not a threat of suicide when it comes from a person who has just done something enormously embarrassing, but it may be when it comes from someone who has suffered a dramatic loss of some kind. Respondent has engaged in self-mutilation The third way to show a respondent is dangerous to self is to prove that he or she has mutilated or attempted to mutilate himself or herself and that serious mutilation is li kely to occur again unless the respondent is committed. 33 No North Carolina appellate cases have discussed this ground for commitment. Self-harm or self-injurious behavior is fairly prevalent today, 34 particularly among adolescents and may include burning, biting, cutting, head banging, pic king at sk in, pulling out hair, bruising. But some self-harm , while needing treatment, does not rise to the level of self-mutilation necessary for involuntary commitment, and the magistrate must be careful to distinguish between the two. The involuntary commitment statute requires that the magistrate find that serious self-mutilation is likely to occur unless the respondent is committed. Therefore, the frequency and the severity or seriousness of the injury is critical. The magistrate should also loo k at other factors such as the reason for the self-harm, whether the respondent has access to weapons to do serious harm, and the progression of seriousness of the inju ries. One case from another state in which the facts showed dang erousness to self based on self-mutilative behavior indicated that the patient had a history of cutting himself, injuring 33. G.S. 122C-3(11)a.3. 34. About one percent of the United States population uses physical self-injury as a way of dealing with overwhelming feelings or situations, but the problem is more prevalent among teenagers where an estimated ten percent have experimented with self-mutilation. Teenagers and Self Mutilation: The Facts, http://www.psychiatric-disorders.com/warning-signs/self-mutilation.php. A recent study published in the August 2007 issue of the journal, Psychological Medicine, indicated 46% of U.S. high school students surveyed had practiced some form of self-mutilation in the past year. David Andreatta, Self-injury Might Be More Common Than Thought, R ALEIGH NEWS & OBSERVER , July 2, 2007 at A3. IVC - Page 35Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 6 himself very seriously to the point that he required blood transfusions.35 Dangerous to Others A magistrate must also issue a custody order for a mentally ill respondent if he or she is dangerous to others. A respondent is dangerous to others if, within the relevant past, he or sh e has: (1) inflicted or attempted to inflict serious bodily harm on another, or has acted in a way that creates a substantial ris k of serious bodily harm to anot her, or has engaged in extreme destruction of property, and (2) there is a reasonable probability that such conduct will be repeated. 36 Respondent has inflicted or attempted to inflict serious bodily harm on another Most cases coming before a magistrate probably will be fairly clear cut as to whether the respondent inflicted or attempted to inflict serious bodily harm on another person. But what if the respondent has only threatened to inflict serious bodily harm on another? Is the threat a sufficient basis for finding that the respondent is dang erous to others? Courts addressing the issue have concluded that overt dangerous actions are not necessary to conclude that a respondent is dangerous to others. For example, a respondent who threatened his aged and nervous mother and family with increasing frequency over several wee ks, saying he was going to \"get you all,\" in conjunction with evidence that he believed his family had sexually seduced him and that he appeared ready to fight an y time one of them said something to him, led th e court to conclude that the respondent was dangerous to others. 37 In another case, a respondent was found dangerous to others based on evidence that he kept an iron pipe and hatchet under his bed an d, through threats, had kept his mother in one chair, unmoving, while he screamed, shouted, cursed, and threatened to \"bust\" her head if she called anybody. 38 A respondent who had threatened many people in the neighborhood and 35. In re Best Interest of M.G. 2002 WL 31854887 (Tex. App.-Tyler 2002) 36. G.S. 122C-3(11)(b). 37. In re Monroe, 49 N.C. App. 23, 270 S.E.2d 537 (1980). 38. In re Collins, 49 N.C. App. 243, 271 S.E.2d 72 (1980). had threatened to cut her brother's throat was found dangerous to others.39 In order to find a respondent dangerous to others on the basis of threats alone, however, the petitioner must present specific evidence about the kind of harm the respondent threatened, when the threats were made, and in what context. For example, the mere allegation that the \"respondent ha[d] made statements to her husband of a threatening nature,\" without more, is insufficient.40 One issue that sometimes troubles magistrates is commitment of persons who are residing in nursing homes. For example, a resident of the nursing home who suffers from dementia or bipolar disorder becomes violent and attac ks another resident of the nursing home and the nursing home staff see ks to have the resident involuntarily committed. The fact that the respondent is in a nursing home or the fact that the respondent suffers from dementia should not result in any different decision by the magistrate. If the magistrate finds reasonable grounds to believe the respondent is mentally ill (i.e., has an illness\u2014and dementia and Alzheimer's disease are mental illnesses--that impairs judgment and self-control and makes treatment advisable) and is dangerous to self or others, the magistrate should issue a custody order. Respondent's behavior creates a substantial risk of serious harm There are no reported North Carolina cases that have addressed a respondent whose actions, though not intended to inflict seriou s bodily harm on another, have nonetheless created a substantial ris k of serious harm. Some situations, of course, will be clear cut: if the respondent, while pl aying with matches, sets fire to an occupied twenty-unit apartment building in the middle of the night, the res pondent's behavior creates a substantial ris k of serious harm. Other cases will require a judgment call: if th e respondent has a habit of digging man-sized holes in a field near his house, whether or not such conduct creates a substantial ris k of serious harm depends on the depth of the holes, the amount of pedestrian traffic in the field, and the visibility of the holes to pedestrians who do wal k in the field. If the field sees significant pedestrian traffic, and the respondent artfully covers the holes 39. In re Jac kson, 60 N.C. App. 581, 299 S.E.2d 677 (1983). This respondent had also cut her brother's hand within the last wee k, but the court did not discuss the seriousness of this cut or its role in the determination that she was dange rous to others. 40. In re Holt, 54 N.C. App. 352, 354, 283 S.E.2d 413, 415 (1981). IVC - Page 36September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 7 with grass, the holes may create a substantial ris k, but if the holes are only two in ches deep, they may not create a risk of serious physical harm. Respondent has engaged in extreme destruction of property The one reported case in North Carolina dealing with dangerousness to others based on engaging in extreme destruction of property emphasized the \"extreme\" requirement. In that case the respondent had used a hammer to brea k everything she could find in her house, includi ng the television, the telephone, and all available glass. 41 Reasonable probability of dangerous behavior being repeated Unlik e the second prong of the dangerousness to self test, the second prong of the dangerousness to others test\u2014a reasonable probability that the dangerous behavior will be repeated\u2014h as not been emphasized in court cases. The statute provides that the magistrate may consider previous episodes of dangerous behavior in de termining future probability of dangerous conduct. 42 Therefore, as long as the magistrate finds past acts of dangerousness this prong is satisfied. Within the relevant past The tests for dangerousness to self and others share the requirement that th e respondent's allegedly dangerous behavior has occurred within the relevant past. This requirement is no different than the requirement of relevance in evidence law, generally. That is, any information that tends to ma ke the existence of a material fact more or less li kely is relevant.43 In the context of i nvoluntary commitment, the respondent's behavior occurred within the relevant past if the behavior ma kes it more or less likely that the respondent is dangerous to self or others at the time commitment is considered. \"[The] acts are relevant because they occurred close enough in time to the district court [or magistrate's] hearing to have probative value on the ultimate question before the court of whet her there was a 'reasonable probability that such [violent] conduct [would] be 41. In re Williamson, 36 N.C. App. 362, 244 S.E.2d 189 (1978). There was also evidence that the respondent threatened to physically in jure family members. 42. G.S. 122C-3(11)b. 43. G.S. 8C-1, Rule 401. repeated.'\"44 So, for example, if the petitioner presents information that the mentally ill respondent, now thirty years old, went through a period when she was ten where she would only eat dirt, the behavior probably did not occur within the relevant past. The concept of within the relevant past does not depend solely on the passage of time, however, but on the totality of the circumstances as the petitioner presents them. For example, the petitioner presents evidence that the ment ally ill respondent tried to kill his brother three years ag o after refusing to ta ke medication prescribed for his mental illness. This information may seem remote in time. However, if the petitioner supplements this evidence with the information that the mentally ill respondent has once again stopped ta king his prescription medication and is exhibiting symptoms similar to those that preceded the three-year-old incident, that three-year-old evidence may have occurred within the relevant past. Although most information the magistrate hears will probably not be this remote, the important thing to remember is that there is no bright-line in time beyond which information is no longer relevant. In fact, one of the problems the General Assembly wanted to cure in changing the language of the standard from \"within the recent past\" to \"within the relevant past\" was the practice of some judicial officials of setting a specific limit on the time frame for the conduct. 45 Summary The magistrate must issue a custody order when he or she finds reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent is probably mentally ill and dangerous to self or others. Mental illness has three elements: (1) an illness (2) that impairs judgment and self-control (3) to a degree that ma kes treatment or supervision advisable. A respondent is dangerousness to self if he or she: (1) is unable to care for self and there is a reasonable probability of serious physical debilitation in the near future or (2) has attempted or th reatened suicide and there is a reasonable probab ility of suicide or 44. Davis v. N.C. Dep't of Human Res., 121 N.C. App. 105, 115, 465 S.E.2d, 2, 8 (1995) 45. See Joan Brannon \"Mental Health,\" N ORTH CAROLINA LEGISLATION 1989 at 127 (Institute of Government 1990). IVC - Page 37Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 8 (3) has mutilated, or attempted to mutilate, himself or herself and there is a reasonable probability of serious self-mutilation. A respondent is dangerous to others if (1) he or she has: (a) inflicted or attempted to inflict serious bodily harm on another or (b) acted in a way that creates a substantial risk of serious bodily harm to another or (c) engaged in extreme destruction of property and (2) there is a reasonable probability that such conduct will be repeated. Mentally Ill and in Need of Treatment Even if a mentally ill respon dent is not dangerous to self or others, a magistrate still must issue a custody order if the respondent, based on his or her psychiatric history, is in nee d of treatment to prevent further disability or deterioration that would predictably lead to dangerousness.46 Mental illness in this context means the same thing as mental illness in the inpatient commitment context: (1) an illness (2) that impairs judgment an d self-control (3) to the extent that treatment or sup ervision is advisable. Although this standard (unli ke the mentally ill and dangerous to self or ot hers standard) does not specifically require the petitioner to show that within the relevant past the respondent has engaged in, attempted, or threatened to eng age in condu ct that is dangerous to self or ot hers, such evidence seems necessary to show a psychiatric history indicating that deterioration leading to dangerousness is li kely. That is, psychiatric history that would mak e dangerous deterio ration predictable is bound to be a history of past instances in which the respondent did become dangerous. For example, if the petitioner presents evidence that the respondent has stopped taking her antipsychotic medication and states that the lac k of medication will ma ke the respondent dangerous, this statement alone probably is not sufficient grounds to issue a custody order: it should be supported by information that when the respondent has gone off he r medication in the past she has done, attempted, or threatened to do, something dangerous. Involuntary Commitment of Mentally Retarded Respondents 46. G.S. 122C-261(b). Special rules apply in issuing custody orders for mentally ill persons who are also mentally retarded. A mentally retarded respond ent may be involuntarily committed only if he or she meets one of the standards set out above; that is, the respondent must be mentally ill and dangerous to self or others or must be mentally ill and in need of treatment to prevent deterioration that would predictably lead to dangerousness. 47 It is often difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether the dangerous behavior is caused by th e mental retardation or mental illness, If the magistrate finds reasonable grounds to believe the respondent is mentally ill as well as mentally retarded and if the magistrate finds dangerousness to self or others, the magistrate should issue the commitment order and leave it to the professionals to determi ne whether involuntary commitment is appropriate for the respondent. Moreover, a mentally retarded person cannot be admitted to a state ps ychiatric hospital unless the respondent is so extremely dangerous as to pose a serious threat to the community and to other patients in a non-state hospital or is so gravely disabled by both multiple disorders and medical fragility or deafness that alternative care is inappropriate. In both of those situations the determination of whether the respondent meets the criteria for commitment to a state psychiatric hospital is made by the Local Management Entity for th e area where th e respondent resides or is found. 48 If a respondent is mentally retarded, the petitioner must produce facts indicating this on the petition, and the magistrate must specifically note it on the custody order. \"Mental retardation\" is defined as \"significantly subaverage general intellectu al functioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested before age 22.\" 49 Making such a diagnosis is beyond the knowledge of lay petitioners and magistrates ali ke and should be left to the professional examiner. Howev er, the petition must 47. G.S. 122C-261(b). In Thomas S. v. Flaherty, 699 F. Supp. 1178 (W.D.N.C. 1988) a federal district court held that North Carolina was inappropriately confining and treating mentally ill retarded persons in the state psychiatric hospitals and ordered the state to provide a full range of habilitative treatment for mentally re tarded persons confined in state psychiatric hospitals. The requirement limiting admission to state hospitals was enacted in 1995 in response to that case. See Joan Brannon, 1996 Legislation Amending the Involuntary Commitment and Domestic Violence Laws, A DMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE MEMORANDUM No. 96/04 at 1. 48. G.S. 122C-261(f). 49. G.S. 122C-3(22) (1996). IVC - Page 38September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 9 include facts indicating mental retardation. Four questions can help a magi strate determine whether the respondent is prob ably mentally retarded: (1) Has a doctor or psyc hologist ever said that the respondent has mental retardation? (2) Has the respondent ever been in special education classes for students with mental retardation? (3) Has the respondent ever received special services for respondents with mental retardation such as sheltered wor kshops or group home placement? (4) Did the problems relating to intelligence and functioning begin before age 22? In order to find the respondent mentally retarded, the answer to the fourth question must be \"yes\" and at least one of the other three questions must also be answered in the affirmative. 50 The special provisions regarding mentally retarded persons do not apply to substance abuse commitments. Substance Abuse Commitment Magistrates may also be as ked to issue custody orders for respondents wh o are substance abusers. The standard for issuing a custody order in these circumstances is: (1) the respondent is a substance abuser who is (2) dangero us to self or others.51 Substance abuse means the pathological use or abuse of alcohol or other drugs in a way, or to a degree, that produces an impairment in personal, social, or occupational functioning; it may include a pattern of tolerance and withdrawal.52 The use does not need to have occurred over any certain length of time or in any certain amount. To be pathological the use need only be habitual or compulsive and have a negative impact on the respondent 's functioning. Such functional impairment might mean, for example, that the respondent misses important meetings at work because of alcohol or drugs, verbally abuses friends and family members when drun k, or suffers delusions when she has gone too long without drugs or alcohol. A magistrate who finds that the respondent is probably a substance abuser and is dangerous to self or others must issue a custody order. The standard for assessing danger to self or others is the same as described under the standard for inpatient commitment of persons with mental illness. 50. Brannon, supra note 47 at 2-3. 51. G.S. 122C-281. 52. G.S. 122C-3(36). Unlik e the definition of mental illness, this definition is a medical one. Procedure for Initiating Involuntary Commitment To begin the process of involuntary commitment a person must petition for an order (the custody order) to have the respondent pic ked up for examination by a physician. Petitioning for a custody order differs in several significant ways from th e usual small claims court procedure. First of a ll, the procedure is not a trial; it is merely a mechanism to have the respondent taken into custody for ex amination. Petitioning for a custody order is an ex parte hearing: that is, the hearing ta kes place without notice to, or the presence of, the opposing party\u2014in this case, the respondent. The respondent normally is not present, but even if respondent is present, th e usual procedure for presentation of eviden ce is not followed. The respondent is not part of the process and does not present evidence in his or he r favor or get to cross examine the petitioner or petitioner's witnesses. Also, two fundamental rules of evidence are not followed in petitioning for invol untary commitment. First, the petitioner is deemed a competent witness even in cases where he or she has no personal, firsthand, knowledge of the respondent's state. This departure from the rules of evidence leads to the second, which is that a petitioner can prove his or her case, and the respondent may be ta ken into custody and transported for examination, entirely on the basis of hearsay evidence. 53 In this last respect, hearing a petition for a custody order is like the probable cause determination in issu ing criminal process. Who may initiate a petition? Anyone with information ab out the respondent may petition for a custody order..54 The respondent's family members or fr iends, neighbors, social work ers, teachers, physicians or law enforcement officers can all be petitioners. The petitioner's knowledge of the responde nt's condition does not have to be firsthand; hearsay information about the respondent is acceptable. For example, a law enforcement officer may petiti on for a custody order on the basis of information told to him or her by the respondent's neighbor, or a respondent's sister may petition based on information from the respondent's mother. In this respect, th e petition resembles an application for a warrant: hearsay evidence can be considered, but at the trial of the matter before a 53. In re Zollicoffer, 165 N.C. App. 462, 598 S.E.2d 696 (2004). 54. G.S. 122C-261(a), -281(a). IVC - Page 39Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 10 district court, the witness must have personal knowledge of the facts about which he or she is testifying. Who is subject to a custody order? Any person may be subject to a custody order (assuming the petitioner presents sufficient evidence), no matter his or her ag e. Involuntary commitment of minor children may occur less frequently than of adults because parents (or guardians) are given the power to consent to treatment for their minor children and can have them admitted to treatment without showing dangerousness. Involuntary commitment thus generally occurs only when a child's parents do not consent to treatment, the parents cannot be found, or because of the child's dangerousness, the parents believe it is best to involun tarily commit the child. However, if the petitioner presents sufficient facts to commit a minor, the magistrate cannot refuse to issue a custody order for a minor simply because the parent could see k a voluntary admission. Where is the petition initiated? Petitions may be made to a magistrate in the county where the respondent lives or in the county where the respondent is found.55 For example, if a resident of Cabarrus County is found wa ndering the streets of downtown Charlotte without proper clothing, speak ing to imaginary friends, either a magistrate in Cabarrus County or a magistrate in Mec klenburg County is authorized to issue a custody order for the respondent and the petitioner can go to either place. Most often the petition is brought in the county where the respondent is found. A respondent who is found in North Carolina need not be a resident of the state to be involuntarily committed. A Mec klenburg County magistrate could also issue a custody order for a resident of South Carolina who is found in Meck lenburg County. 56 How is a petition made? 55. G.S. 122C-261(a), -281(a). 56. If a resident of another state is involuntarily committed in North Carolina, the State psychiatric hospital may return the respondent to his or her home state. G.S. 122C-345. Personal Appearance Most petitioners must appear personally before the magistrate to execute the petition.57 The magistrate may have the petitioner fill out the petition or may complete it for the petitioner after the petitioner has conveyed the relevant facts about the respondent's condition. Either way, the petitioner must swear to the facts contained in the petition. An unsworn petition cannot serve as the basis for issuance of a custody order.58 Physician or Psychologist Petitioner One group of petitioners does not have to personally appear before the magistrate: when the petitioner is a physician or eligible psychologist59 who has examined the respondent, he or she may execute an affidavit before any official authorized to administer oaths (usually a notary public) and submit the affidavit to the magistrate by delivering the original to the magistrate or sending a copy by telefacsimile transmission. 60 The physician or psychologist examiner need not appear before the magistrate to testify, but the magistrate must have the notarized affidavit or a faxed copy of it in front of him or her and ma ke a determination from the facts contained in the affidavit that the respondent meets the custody order criteria. Because the physician's or psychologist's evaluation must comply with the requirements of an initial ex amination, the physician or psychologist petitioner frequently will attach a form called \"Examination and Recommendation to Determine the Necessity fo r Involuntary 57. G.S. 122C-261(a), -281(a). 58. In re Ingram, 74 N.C. App 579, 328 S.E.2d 588 (1985). 59. There is a pilot program operating in several western Local Management Entities (LMEs) allowing the initial evaluation to be performed by a licensed clinical social wor ker, a masters level psychia tric nurse or a masters level certified addictions specialist in addition to a physician or eligible psychologist. In those LMEs when these clinicians perform the initial evaluation, they are treated lik e physicians and eligible psychologists and do not have to personally appear before the magistrate when they are the petitioner. 60. G.S. 122C-261(d). A similar provision for transmission by telefacsimile is not included in the substance abuse statute. However, since the procedure could be followed without a statutory provision, it can be followed in substance abuse commitments also. IVC - Page 40September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 11 Commitment\"61 to the affidavit and the facts may be stated in the attachment. If the affidavit is submitted by telefacsimile transmission, the physician or psychologist must mail the original no later than five days after transmission to the clerk or magistrate to be filed in the case file. Sometimes rather than mailing the original, the physician or psychologist will give it to the law enforcement officer who comes to the physician or psychologist to ta ke the respondent into custody under the order. Petition Must Show Facts The \"Affidavit and Petition for Involuntary Commitment\" (AOC-SP-300) is a sworn affidavit setting forth facts that show that the respondent meets at least one of the standards for issuance of a custody order. The magistrate must issue a custody order if the petition shows that th e respondent is probably: (1) mentally ill and dangerous to self or others; (2) mentally ill and in need of treatment to prevent deterioration that would predictably lead to dangerousness; or (3) a substance abuser who is dangerous to self or others. The petition must set forth facts in support of petitioner's allegations and not just conclusions. Facts are assertions or statements about something having objective reality\u2014an actual event in time or space. Conclusions are judgments. Statements in a petition such as \"the respondent lac ks self-control and is unable to provide for himself\" or \"the respondent is a mentally ill ... person who is dangerous to [her]self or others [and] [r]espondent has strange behavior and irrational in her thin king\" 62 are conclusions. An example of a statement of facts is: \"For the past two wee ks the respondent has been hallucinating, claiming that an escaped convict is after him and that his wife is secretly keeping the convict in the basement of their home. On three occasions between April 23 and 25 he threatened to shoot his wife if she does not get rid of the convict. On April 26, the responden t purchased a gun, shot his wife in the arm, and told her that she had three days to get the convict out of the house.\" The facts stated in the petition must support all the criteria necessary for a custody order. The statement of facts above, for example, establishes that the respondent is pr obably mentally ill (hallucinating, claiming that an escaped convict is conspiring with his wife), that he inflicted serious physical harm on someone (shot his wife), and that there is a li kelihood 61. The form number is DMH 5-72-01 (Sept. 2001). 62. In re Ingram, 74 N.C. App. 579, 581, 328 S.E.2d 588, 589 (1985). such conduct will be repeated (past behavior and still hallucinating indicates conduct lik ely to reoccur); this statement of facts supports a finding that the respondent is mentally il l and dangerous to others. But recall the example of the mentally il l respondent who fasted for days at a time and then ate a whole loaf of bread or a chic ken, and ate five pounds of sugar every two days. While this statement of facts may have supported a find ing that the respondent was unable to care for himself, it did not show that he was in danger of serious physical debilitation, as required to find the respondent mentally ill and dangerous to himself. The following petiti on also was found to be insufficient to allege mental illness and dangerous to self: \"Respondent has stra nge behavior and irrational in her thin king. Leaves home and no one k nows of her whereabouts, and at times spends the night away from home. Accuses her husband of improprieties.\" 63 An example of a sufficient petition based on respondent's danger to self is: \"Respondent stopped taking her psychiatric medi cine (Haldol) three wee ks ago. She has begun having tr ouble sleeping at night and hasn't slept more than one hour in the past 48 hours. She hasn't bathed for a wee k and has been talking constantly for the last wee k even though normally she is a quiet pe rson. Last night when it was 25 degrees outside, I found her wal king around in the back yard in a short-sleeved shirt saying she was looking for her mother, who died fifteen years ago.\" A petition adequate to obtain a custody order for a substance abuser might be the following: \"The respondent has been smo king crack cocaine three times daily for the last two wee ks; he lost his job two days ago when he showed up at wor k high and now that he has no income of his own to bu y drugs today he beat his mother and father to steal their money.\" When a respondent is mentally retarded as well as mentally ill, the petition might allege (in addition to facts necessary to support the other required elements for commitmen t) something to the effect that the respondent was identified as mentally retarded when she was in second grade and has been receiving special education services for the mentally retarded since that time. It is not clear whether it is necessary to allege facts regarding the mental retardation since that is not a criteria for commitment, but rather a special provision that affects the choice of hospitals for the respondent. However, since the statute requires the magistrate to find that \"the respondent is also probably mentally ill\" 64 the safest practice is to include facts supporting that finding. 63. Id. 64. G.S. 122C-261(b). IVC - Page 41Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 12 Magistrate's Role in Ascertaining Facts Asking Questions A petitioner who appears before a magistrate see king a custody order is often in a state of crisis. Due to this emotional state and the fact that the petitioner is probably not acquainted with the custody order criteria, the magistrate may have to actively participate in getting information from the petitioner and in writing the petition. The magistrate should always feel free to as k specific questions necessary to determine whether to issue a custody order. Common questions to as k might include: 1.Has the respondent harmed or threatened to harm self or others within the past 24 hours? Within the last wee k? Month? Three months? a.What did the respondent do to himself or herself? b.What did the respondent do to you? c.What did the respondent do to others? 2.Is the respondent ha llucinating (seeing or hearing things that other people don't)? What kind of things is he or she hearing or seeing? 3. Can the respondent identify the day, where he or she is, his or her name or age? 4.Does the respondent have unreasonable thoughts that people are tal king about him or her or are going to kill or hurt him or her? Tell me what he or she said, or how you learned this information?. 5.Is the respondent ma king exaggerated or elaborate claims, such as: a.being on a special mission; b.being another important and powerful person; c.being part of a powerful organization? 6.Does the respondent have trouble sleeping at night? How long since the respondent had a normal night's sleep? 7.Has the respondent consumed more than one pint of alcohol per day for the past three to ten days? 8.Is the respondent ta king any medication? a.what is it? b.has the respondent tak en any illegal drugs within the past 24 hours? Month? Three months? What kind of drug? How much? 9.Has there been any change in the respondent's appetite? Has it grown or decreased? Is the respondent eating at all? 10.Is the respondent doing his or her normal activities? If not, what is the respondent doing differently? 11.Is the respondent unable to care for self because of his or her mental condition? Is he or she eating, sleeping, dressing, bathing, using the toilet, staying out of traffic? Writing Down All the Relevant Facts The magistrate must ma ke sure that the petition itself contains all the facts about a respondent's present condition as well as information about previous episodes of dangerousness that are relevant to determining that there is a reasonable probability of future dangerous conduct or that would show the current deterioration would predictably result in dangerousness if treatm ent is not provided. 65 The facts must support all the bases for commitment that are check ed on the order. For example, if the respondent is mentally ill and dangerous to self, the facts must support each of these prongs. If there is not enough space for this information on the petition itself, the magistrate should attach an extra sheet. Full detail is important for two reasons: First, the district court judge is li kely to dismiss the case if the petition is lac king in detail to support a custody order. 66 \"[A custody] order is essentially a judgment by which a person is dep rived of his liberty ..., and as a result, he is entitled to the safeguard of a determination by a neutral officer of the court that reasonable ground s exist for his original detention....\" 67 Even if the petitioner is a physician or psychologist, the petition must state sufficient facts to support the issuan ce of a custody order. Giving too much deference to physicians or psychologists, who are required to give facts li ke other petitioners, may result in the case being dismissed and is an abdica tion of the magistrate's role as an independent judicial official determining reasonable grounds to proceed. 65. G.S. 122C-261(a), -281(a). 66. In re Ingram, 74 N.C. App. 579, 328 S.E.2d 588 (1985). 67. In re Reed, 39 N.C. App. 227, 229, 249 S.E.2d 864, 866 (1978). IVC - Page 42September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 13 Second, because the physician or psychologist who examines the respondent may not spea k to anyone besides the respondent, the petition must convey to the examiner the respondent's current state and past history. Denying The Custody Order If, after hearing the petitione r, the magistrate does not find reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent meets one of the custody order standards, the magistrate must not issue a custody order. In this circumstance, the magistrate does not have to fill out a petition (in those cases where the petitioner has not filled out his or her own petition) and is not required to ma ke written findings of fact. The magistrate should give the petitioner the information necessary to contact the local mental health center and pursue whatever treatment option s the respondent will voluntarily accept. Issuing The Custody Order A magistrate who does find reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent meets one of the custody order standards must i ssue a custody order. Where the statutory criteria for issuing a custody order are met, the magistrate should issue a custody order even if the respondent, either in person or via the petitioner, agrees to submit to treatment voluntarily. The reason for this result is this: it is possible that the respondent, because of mental illness or substance abuse, may not have the capacity to consent to treatment. Whether the capacity to consent does exist is a determination that should be left to the professional examiner and, if the respondent has capacity to consent, the examiner may convert the involuntary commitment to a voluntary admission. In a case from Florida the respondent agreed to hospitalization but later cl aimed that he was deprived of his liberty without due process because he didn't have the mental capacity to understand his consent. He successfully claimed that the hospitalization should have occurred under the involuntary commitment process where he would have been afforded the due process safeguards inherent in that procedure. 68 The bottom line is that if a respondent meets the custody order criteria, the magistrate should issue the order. 68. Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 110 S.Ct. 975, 108 L.Ed. 2d 100 (1990). The kind of order the magistrate issues will depend on who the petitioner is. When the Petitioner is Not a Physician or Psychologist When the petitioner is not a physician or eligible psychologist, the magistrate will use the form entitled \"Findings and Custody Order Involuntary Commitment\" (AOC-SP-302). Findings In issuing the order itself the magistrate must first make \"findings\" of fact. The order contains three possible findings: (1) th e respondent is mentally ill and dangerous to self or others or in need of treatment to prevent deterioration that would predictably lead to dangerou sness; (2) the respondent, in addition to being mentally ill, is also mentally retarded; or (3) the respondent is a substance abuser and dangerous to self or others. The magistrate should chec k all that apply, and it is possible that all three could apply. The magistrate, however, may only chec k the mental retardation box [box (2)] if the respondent is also mentally ill and that box was also check ed. If the respondent is a substance abuser and also mentally retarded, there is no similar requirement to ma ke findings concerning mental retardation. Order Under the order the magistrate should chec k the block that directs \"any law enforcement officer\" to take the respondent into custody and ta ke the respondent for examination by a person authorized by law to conduct the examination (bloc k 1). The officer must tak e the respondent to an area facility69 for examination; if a proper person to perform the examination is not available in the area facility or no facility is available, the officer ta kes the respondent to any physician or ps ychologist locally available, 70 which typically is the em ergency department of the nearest general hospital. If the initial examiner recommends inpatient commitment, the order directs a law enforcement officer to transport the respondent to a designated 24-ho ur facility for a second examination. 69. An \"area facility\" is a facility operated by or under contract with an area mental health authority. G.S. 122C- 3(14). 70. G.S. Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 14 When the Petitioner is a Physician or Psychologist When the petitioner is a physician or psychologist71 who has already examined the respondent and has made a specific recommendation as to the respondent's disposition an d the magistrate finds reasonable grounds supporting the recommendation, then the order the magist rate issues depends on the examiner's recommendation fo r disposition, which is found in Section III of \"Examination and Recommendation to Determine Necessity for Involuntary Commitment\" (DMH 5-72-01). If the examination form is not attached and the physician has not specified the type of commitment\u2014mentally ill and dangerous; mentally ill and in need of treatment; or substance abuser and dangerous\u2014the magistrate must determine which type of commitment the facts support. When the physician or psychologist recommends inpatient commitment If the physician or psychologist petitioner recommends inpatient commitment and the magistrate finds reasonable grounds to affirm that recommendation, the magistrate must issue the regular custody order (AOC-SP-302), ma ke the appropriate finding, and chec k the box in the order directing the law enforcemen t officer to transport the respondent directly to a designated 24-hour facility for examination and custody pending a district court hearing (box 2).72 There is no need to ta ke the respondent to a local examiner because the physician or psychologist petitioner has already performed that examination. When the physician or psychologist recommends outpatient commitment If the physician or psychologist petitioner recommends outpatient commitment and the magistrate finds reasonable grounds to affirm the recommendation, the magistrate does not issue a custody order because the respondent will not be taken into custody. Rather, the magistrate issues the order entitled \"Findings and Order Involuntary Commitment Physician-Petitioner Recommends Outpatient Commitment\" (AOC-SP-305), which requires hearing a district court judge to hold a hearing to determine wheth er the respondent will be 71. See supra note 59. 72. G.S. 122C-261(d). involuntarily committed to outpatient treatment.73 The cler k will issue a notice of hearing to the respondent.74 Outpatient commitment means treatment in an outpatient setting and may include medication, individual or group th erapy, day or partial day programming activities, services and training including educational and vocational activities, supervision or living arra ngements, and any other services prescribed either to alleviate the individual's illness or disability, main tain semi-independent functioning, or to prevent further deterioration that may reasonably be predicted to result in the need for inpatient commitment to a 24-hour facility.75 When the physician or psychologist recommends substance abuse commitment If the physician or psychologist petitioner recommends substance abuse commitment and the magistrate finds reasonable grounds to affirm that recommendation, the type of order issued by the magistrate depends upon the recommendation of the physician or eligible psychologist as stated in the \"Examination and Recommendation\" form. 76 If the physician recommends that the respondent be held at a 24-hour facility, the magistrate issues a custody order to transport th e respondent directly to the designated 24-hour facility for examination and custody pending a district court hearing AOC-SP-302, bloc k 2). If the physician recommends that the respondent be released pending a hearing, the magistrate issues an order that a hearing before a district court judge be hel d to determine whether the respondent will be involuntarily committed (AOC-SP-305). Designate the 24-Hour Facility To Which Respondent Taken In the final part of the first page of the custody order, the magistrate must fill in the name of the designated 24-hour facility77 to which the respondent may be 73. Id. 74. The form is \"Notice of Hearing/Rehearing for Involuntary DMH 5-72-01. 77. Under G.S. 122C-252 hospitals must be designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to receive and treat involuntarily committed respondents. Any facility IVC - Page 44September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 15 taken if the first examiner finds that the respondent is an appropriate candidate for inpatient commitment or if the petitioner is a physician or psychologist who recommends inpatient co mmitment. No te that the magistrate does not put the place for the officer to take the respondent to the first evaluation (in other words the mental health center or local hospital emergency room) in this bloc k. The form and statute require that the magistrate put the designated 24-hour facility to which the respondent will be ta ken for the second evaluation and at which he or she will be held for a district court hearing. The Department of Health and Human Services maintains a list of designated 24-hour facilities on its website at http: //www/ ncdhhs.gov/mhddsas/ ivc/ ivcdesignatedfacilities_6-14-07.pdf. In order to ensure th at the respondent will be admitted to any de signated 24-hour facility (state psychiatric hospital or local public or private hospital that has been designated by the State to ta ke involuntary commitments) to which he or she might be tak en, the magistrate should name the 24-hour facility to which most responden ts are sent and then put \"any designated 24-hour facility,\" (e.g. \"Broughton Hospital or any designated facility\"). Some magistrates merely put \"any designated 24-hour facility\" with out naming any specific facility. Private Hospital Placements A respondent who has the resources to pay for the cost of inpatient hospital care without the use of any public funds may select a private facility for treatment and care. In those cases where the respondent is able to choose a private placement, the petitioner must have already have made arrangements with the chosen facility and if it is clear that the private facility has agreed to accept the respondent, the magistrate should fill in the name of that facility on the order. 78 If the family has not made prior arrangements for admission to a private facility, the magistrate should send the resp ondent to the usual designated could ta ke the respondent, but private hospitals may not ta ke indigent respondents. 78. G.S. 122C-263(d)(2) implies that direct commitment to a private hospital is appropriate when it provides that if the first examiner recommends inpatient commitment, \"the law enforcement officer ... shall ta ke the respondent to a [designated] 24-hour facility.... If there is no area 24-hour facility and if the respondent is indigent and unable to pay for care at a private 24-hour facility, the law enforcement officer ... shall take the respondent to a State facility for the mentally ill....\" 24-hour facility and the Lo cal Management Entity or facility staff can transfer a resp ondent who qualifies for admission to a private hospital. Requirement to Contact Area Authority Before Issuing Custody Order In two different circumstances, the magistrate must contact the local mental health center before issuing a custody order. First, in cases where the magistrate has found that the responden t is probably mentally retarded, in addition to being mentally ill, he or she must contact the area authority (local mental health center) before issuing any order.79 When the petitioner is not a physician or an eligible psychologist, the area au thority will tell the magistrate where to ta ke the respondent for the initial and second examinations. The magistrate should indicate to the officer where to ta ke the respondent for the first evaluation and should write the location of the second evaluation in the bloc k on the form \"name of 24-hr. facility for mentally ill.\" When the petitioner is a physician or el igible psychologist, the area authority will designate th e 24-hour facility to which the respondent should be ta ken and the magistrate should write this location down on the order in the bloc k for the 24-hour facility for mentally ill. In the event that a mentally retarded person gets beyond the magistrate without the petitioner asserting and the magistrate finding that the person is mentally retarded and the mental retardation is discovered at the first evaluation, the examiner at the first evaluation can fill in a non-state facility in the box designated \"or following facility designated by area authority.\" Second, some counties have local policies that require the magistrate to contact the local mental health center before issuing a custody order. If the chief district co urt judge has approved the policy, it should be followed by the magistrates. Who Serves the Custody Order When the magistrate issues a custody order, generally a law enforcement officer serves the order. City police officers are responsible for transportation to a location within the county if the respondent resides, or was ta ken into custody, within city limits. If the respondent resides, or was ta ken into custody, in the county but outside city li mits, the county deputy sheriffs are responsible for transportation, including 79. G.S. 122C-261(b). IVC - Page 45Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 16 transportation to locations outsid e the county.80 This statute is confusing if a resp ondent resides in the city but is found in the coun ty outside the city limits or vice versa since in those situations both the police and sheriff are designated to transport for evaluations within the county. The local law enforcement agencies must determine which agency transports in those circumstances. There are two situations where persons other than law enforcement officers may provide transportation under a custody order. The city or county may designate volunt eers or other personnel to provide transportation rat her than using law enforcement officers. 81 The persons designated by the city or county follow the same procedure as law enforcement officers. Magistrates may authorize family members or immediate friends of the respondent to carry out the custody order if the following criteria are met: first, a family member or immediate friend must ma ke a request to transport the respondent; and second, the magistrate must find that the respondent does not pose substantial danger to the public. 82 The critical word is \"substantial\" since all respondents must be dangerous. For example the second criterion might be met in a case where the respon dent is an older person who has been found dangerous to self because he is unable to care for himsel f but becomes extremely agitated when dealing with law enforcement officers. If the magistrate authorizes transportation by a family member or friend, in addition to completing the custody order, the magi strate must also complete the form entitled \"Request and Authorization to Deliver Respondent\" (AOC-SP-902M) . The magistrate should inform the family me mber or friend providing the transportation where to ta ke the respondent for the initial evaluatio n and where to ta ke the respondent for the second evaluation if necessary (which is the 24-hour facility designated by the magistrate on the custody or der). The magistrate also should inform the person that he or she must return to the clerk of court the form entitled \"Request and Authorization to Deliver Respondent\" with the acknowledgement of delivery filled in and the \"Custody Order\" with th e \"preliminary examination\" section filled in. Validity of Order 80. G.S. 81. G.S. 122C-251(g). 82. G.S. 122C-251 (f). The magistrate's custody order directs any law enforcement officer to ta ke the respondent into custody and transport him or her as directed in the order within 24 hours af ter the order is issued and without unnecessary delay after assuming custody. 83 If the respondent is not ta ken into custod y within 24 hours of issuance of the order, the order is no longer valid and the officer may not tak e the respondent into custody after that time. What is not clear is the procedure that must be follow ed if the respondent is not ta ken into custody with in 24 hours and the petitioner still wishes to commit the respond ent. One possibility is for the magi strate to issue a second custody order based on the first petition. The other course of action would be to require the petitioner to present evidence of the respondent's continued dangerousness in a new petition and issue a new order based on that petition. The procedure the magistrate follows may depend on the nature of the facts presented in the first petition. Some facts would support the issuance of a custody order even though one or more days might have passed since anyone has seen the respondent and since the issuance of the custody order. Other facts may present a wea ker case with the passage of a day or more. If at the time the request for a new custod y order is made, the magistrate determines that th e facts alleged in the first petition lead the magistrate to find reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent now meets the criteria for commitment, the magistrate can issue a second order based on the first petition. 84 Where is the order valid? For example, what if a respondent moves bac k and forth between counties? As long as the custody order was issued by an appropriate magistrate\u2014one sitting in a county where the respondent eith er resided or was found\u2014it can be served on the respondent anywhere in North Carolina.85 The only difficulty with service is a practical one of getting the order to the appropriate law enforcement agency in the county where the respondent is to be ta ken into custody. Generally, an officer from the magistrat e's county delivers the order to the appropriate agency. Although there are no cases or statute governing the situation, it probably is sufficient for the officer holding the original custody order to fax a copy of the order and petition to a law enforcement agency in the county where the respondent is now believed to be found for service. 83. G.S. 122C-261(e), -281(e). 84. There are no reported cases in North Carolina dealing with this issue. 85. G.S. 122C-261(e), -281(e). IVC - Page 46September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 17 Inform Petitioner of Next Steps If the magistrate issues a custody order for a mentally ill respondent, the magistrate must provide the petitioner (and respondent, if present) with information regarding the next steps in the process. 86 Although the statute cont aining this requirement does not enumerate specific pieces of information that should be relayed, the magistrate should inform the petitioner that: (1) the custody order is a document that initiates the process leading to commitment; it is not the commitment order itself; (2) the respondent will be ta ken into custody by a law enforcement officer and taken to a local facility to be exam ined by a physician or psychologist who will ma ke one of three recommendations: (a) release the respondent because he or she does not meet the commitment criteria; (b) release the responden t but schedule a district court hearing within 10 days because the respondent meets the criteria for outpatient commitment; (c) ta ke the respondent to a 24-hour facility because he or she meets the criteria for inpatient commitment. (3) if the second examiner recommends inpatient commitmen t, the respondent will be held at the 24-hour facility for observation and treatment pending a district court hearing to be held within 10 days. The facility staff must release the respondent when he or she no longer meets the criteria for involuntary commitment. A model notice of next steps is found at Appendix III at the end of this bulletin. 87 Inquiry Into Respondent's Indigence Upon issuing a custody order for inpatient commitment, the magistrate is required by law to inquire as to wheth er the respondent is indigent (and thus entitled to have appo inted counsel at the district court hearing).88 However, many magistrates no longer mak e this inquiry because indigent respondents who are sent to a state psychiatric 86. G.S. 122C-261(b). 87. The notice is a slightly modified version of one drafted by Mar k Botts, a School of Government faculty member who specializes in mental health law. 88. G.S. 122C-261(c), -281(c). hospital are entitled to receive representation from the special counsel and in that situation determining whether a respondent is indigent is the responsibility of the special counsel.89 At hearings for mentally ill persons in counties other than where state hospitals are located, counsel is appointed for indigent respondents in accordance with the rules adopted by the Office of Indigent Defense Services. 90 However, even if a mentally ill responde nt is not indigent, but refuses to retain counsel, the Office of Indigent Defense Services must appoint counsel for him or her anyway.91 Therefore, for most mentally ill respondents counsel is going to be appointed so a magistrate's determination of indigence is unnecessary. For substance abuse respondents, the statute provides that the clerk of court, upon direction of the district court ju dge, assigns counsel 92 who represents the respondent at the trial lev el, and upon appeal the Office of Indigent Defense Services appoints counsel.93 Respondents who are recommended only for outpatient treatment (that is, those who are not at a state psychiatric hospital) do not have the right to counsel at their district court hearing. However, a judge may appoint counsel for an indigent respondent who is recommended only for outpatient commitment if the judge determines th at the issues involved in the outpatient commitment are of significant complexity or that the respondent is unable to spea k for himself or herself. 94 Magistrates who do con duct an indigence inquiry should use the form \"Affida vit of Indigency,\" AOC- CR-226. Emergency Commitments In addition to the regular procedure for initiating an involuntary commitment, there are two emergency procedures for circumstances where the respondent requires immediate hospitalizati on to prevent harm to self or others. 89. G.S. 122C-270(a). 90. G.S. 122C-270(d). Currently the judge or clerk the appointments. G.S. 122C-268(d). 47Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 18 Emergency Commitments for Mentally Ill Magistrates are not involved in emergency commitments of mentally ill respondents. The criteria for the special emergency procedure is that the person not only meet the criteria for a regular commitment but also that person is in need of immediate hospitalization to prevent harm to themselves or others. The emergency commitment procedure allows anyone, including law enforcement officers, to ta ke the respondent directly to a local physician or psychologist or directly to a State facility for examination. 95 If the examiner finds that the respondent is, in fact, (1) mentally ill, (2) dangerous to self or others, and (3) in need of immediate hospitalization, the examiner will send sworn certification of this finding to the cler k of superior court on the form entitled \"Supplement to Support Immediate Hospitalization\" (DMH 5-72-01-A). This supplement must accompany the examiner's usual examination form (\"Examination and Recommendation To Determine Necessity for Involuntary Commitmen t,\" DMH 5-72-01). 96 The certification ta kes the place of the magistrate's custody order and requires a law enforcement officer to transport the resp ondent to a 24 -hour facility for a second examination. If a person comes to the magistrate with an evaluation by a physician and the additional supplement certifying the need for immediate hospitalization, the magistrate should not issue a custody order but should indicate to the law enforcement officer that the certificate takes the place of a custody order. Emergency Commitment of Substance Abusers The special procedure for emergency commitment of substance abusers does involve magistrates. Only law enforcement officers may petition for emergency commitment of substance abusers. If a substance abuser is violent and requires restraint, and if delay in taking him or her to a physician or eligible psychologist for examination would probably endanger life or property, the law enforcement officer may tak e the substance abuser into custody and tak e 95. G.S. 122C-262. 96. Both forms are needed because the examiner must give facts supporting the mental illness and dangerousness as well as the need for immediate hospitalization, and the certificate for emergency commitment does not require facts supporting the mental illness and dangerousness. G.S. 122C-262(b), -264(b1). him or her immediately before a magistrate to see k a custody order.97 If magistrate finds by clear, cogent, and convincing ev idence (note th at this evidentiary standard is higher than that required in the non- emergency case) that (1) the facts in the affidavit are true, (2) that the respondent is in fact violent and in need of restraint, and (3 ) that delay in ta king the respondent to a physician or eligible psychologist would endanger life or prop erty, the magistrate must issue an emergency commitment order to ta ke the respondent directly to a 24-hour facility, bypassing the first examination. The form is entitled \"Petition for Special Emergency Substance Abuse Involuntary Commitment Petition and Custody Order\" (AOC-SP- 909M). Transportation Orders In addition to issuing cu stody orders that require officers to transport the respondent for examination in response to a petition for involuntary commitment, magistrates may order law enforcement officers to provide transpor tation in two other situations. First, if a substance abuser who is under an order for outpatient treatment fails to comply with that order, the area mental health authority or supervising physician may, after reasonable efforts to solicit the respondent's compliance, as k the magistrate to order that the respondent be ta ken into custody and transported to the area autho rity or physician for examination. 98 Also if a substance abuser who has been discharged from i npatient commitment and breaches the conditions of his or her release, the area mental health authority or physician may request that the respondent be ta ken into custody and transported to the area authority or physician for examination.99 Upon request, the magistrate must issue an order a law enforcement officer to transport the respondent to a designated physician for examination. The form is \"Request for Transporta tion Order and Order (Committed Substance Abus er Fails to Comply With Treatment or Is Discharged From 24-Hour Facility)\" (AOC-SP-223). The second situatio n in which the magistrate may be asked to issue a custody order is where transportation is needed to transfer certain respondents from one 24-hour facility to another. 100 In this situation, a respondent being held for a district court hearing or already committed by a district court 97. G.S. 122C-282. 98. G.S. 122C-290(b). 99. Id. 100. G.S. 122C-206(c1). - Page 48September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 19 judge needs to be transferred from the 24-hour facility in which he or she is being held to another 24-hour facility. Frequently th is occurs when the respondent was sent to a local hospital but that hospital is unable to handle the respondent and wants the respondent sent to a state psychiatric hospital. The magistrate may also be as ked to transfer a minor or incompetent adult who was voluntarily admitted from one facility to anoth er. If a responsible professional at the orig inal facility notifies the magistrate to issue an or der, the magistrate must order a law enforcement agency to transfer the respondent. The form is \"Notice of Need For Transportation Order and Order (From One 24-Hour Facility to Another)\" AOC-SP-222. Conclusion After a magistrate has issued an order to ta ke a respondent into custody and transport him or her for examination, the magistrate's involvement in the process of involuntary civ il commitment ends. From this point the respondent is exam ined by two professionals and, if these examinations reveal that the respondent meets the criteria for commitment, the respondent will receive a hearing in the district court, at which time the judge may commit the respondent.

Page 52September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 23 Appendix III Steps Following the Issuance of a Custody Order for Involuntary Commitment Upon request, the magistrate or cler k of court has issued an order for custody and transportation of a person alleged to be in need of examination and treatment. This order is not an order of commit ment but only authorizes the person to be evaluated and treated until a court hearing is held. The individual ma king the request has filed a petition with the court for this purpose and is , therefore, called the \"petitioner.\" The individual to be ta ken into custody for examination will have an opportunity to respond to the petition and is, therefore, called th e \"respondent.\" If you are ta ken into custody, the word \"respondent,\" below, refers to you. G.S. 122C-261(b) requ ires that the petitioner and the resp ondent, if present, be inform ed of the next steps that will occur for the respondent. 1. A law enforcement officer or other person designated in the cust ody order must ta ke the respondent into custody within 24 h ours. If the respondent cannot be found within 24 hours, a new custody order will be required to tak e the respondent into custody. Custody is not for the purpose of arrest, but for the respondent's own safety and the safety of others, and to determine if the respondent is in need of treatment. 2. Without unnecessary delay af ter assuming custody, the law enforcement officer or other individual designated to provide transportation must ta ke the respondent to a physician or eligible psychologist for examination. 3. The respondent must be examined as soon as possible, and in any event within 24 hours, after being presented for examination. 4. Upon examination, the physician or psycholog ist will recommend either outpatient commitment, inpatient commitment, substance abuse commitment, or termination of these proceedings. /g120 Inpatient commitment: If the examiner finds the respond ent meets the criteria for inpatient commitment, the examiner shall recommend inpatient commitment. The law enforcement officer or other designated person shall ta ke the respondent to a 24-hour facility. /g120 Outpatient commitment: If the examiner finds the respondent meets the criteria for outpatient commitment, the exam iner will recommend outpatient commitment and identify the proposed outpatient treatment physician or center in the examination report. The person designated in the order to provide transportation must return the respondent to the respondent's regular residence or, with the respondent's consent, to the home of a consenting in dividual located in the originating county. The respondent shall be released from custody. /g120Substance abuse commitment: If the examiner finds the respondent meets the criteria for substance abuse commitment, the ex aminer shall recommend commitment and whether the respond ent should be released or held at a 24-hour facility pending a district court hearing. Based on the physician's recommendation, the law enforcement officer or other designated individual shall ta ke respondent to a 24-hour facility or release the respondent. /g120 Termination: If the examiner finds the respondent m eets neither of the criteria fo r commitment, the respondent must be released from custody and the procee dings terminated. If the custody order was based on the finding that respondent was prob ably mentally ill, then the person designated in the order to provide transportation must return responden t to the respondent's regular residence or, with the respondent's consent, to the home of a consenting individual located in the orig inating county. 5. If inpatient treatment is recommended, the law enforcement officer transports the res pondent to a designated 24 hour facility where another evaluation must be performed within 24 hours. Th is evaluator has the same options as indicated in step 4 above. If the evaluator determines th at the respondent needs inpatient treatment, the respondent is admitted to the facility for care and treatment. 6. The inpatient treatment provider must release the responde nt when in the provider 's professional opinion the respondent no longer meets commitment criteria. If the resp ondent is not released , the respondent will be given a hearing before a district court judge within 10 days of date respondent ta ken into custody. The hearing is usually held in the county where the 24-hour facility is located unless the respondent request a hearing in the county where the petition was initiated.

NCREC Standard Form 410-T (2006) Landlord-Tenant Law - Page 12BE AWARE OF THESE PROCEDURAL RULES FOR SUMMARY EJECTMENT CASES In the absence of a \"simple landlord-tenant relationship,\" both small claims magistrate and district court judge lack subject matter jurisdiction to hear action labeled as \"summary ejectment.\" Agent with personal knowledge may sign complaint and represent LL. GS 7A-223(a). Property owner is rpii and must be listed as plaintiff in complaint. Action must be calendared within 7 business days of complaint being filed. Sheriff must serve summons and complaint within 5 days of complaint being filed. Service of process must occur at least 2 days prior to trial date. Service by first class mailed + posting on rental premises is sufficient for award of possession only. If landlord is seeking both money damages and possession, service is by posting, and defendant is not present, 2017 amendment allows plaintiff to ask that the claims be \"severed,\" with claim for possession heard immediately and money damages claim heard at later time after defendant has been personally served. Service by private process server not allowed even after unsuccessful attempt by sheriff for possession claim, but private process server allowed to serve severed claim for money damages.. Plaintiff is entitled to judgment on the pleadings if: /g124Defendant was served, but has not filed answer nor appeared for trial /g124Complaint lists breach of lease condition for which re-entry is specified as grounds /g124Plaintiff requests JOTP in open court Continuances are available only for good cause and for no more than five days or next session of court, whichever is greater, unless parties consent to longer period Magistrate prohibited from reserving judgment unless parties agree or court finds the case is \"more complex.\" In case of complex case, magistrate required to enter judgment within 5 business days. If judgment is for landlord in small claims court and tenant appeals, tenant is subject to being evicted while appeal is pending unless tenant satisfies statutory requirements for obtaining stay. Landlord-Tenant Law - Page 13Costs of appeal for trial de novo must be paid within 10 (not 20) days of entry of judgment. Appeal subject to dismissal in district court under some conditions, requiring magistrate to make a finding when tenant presents a defense in small claims court. Sheriff must execute a writ of possession within 5 days of issuance. Landlord-Tenant Law - Page 14LL-T Notetaking Outline Remember contract analysis applies to these cases, and so do The Ten Mandatory Rules of Procedure. Is there a (rental) contract? May be written or oral (usually), but must be agreement between person entitled to possession of land and Person #2 that Person #2 has right to possess property in exchange for paying rent or providing some other service. This is a conditional agreement: \"T has possession on condition that T do _____.\" T is purchasing the right to possession of the property for a limited time, while LL retains ownership of property. ___________________________________________________________ __________________ ___________________________________________________________ __________________ to MR#1: do you have jurisdiction? In SE action for possession only, amount in controversy N/A, defendant must reside in your county, and there must be LL-T relationship between plaintiff relationship exists between the parties, the magistrate should dismiss the action and note on the dismissal form that the small claims court is without jurisdiction due to the lack of a landlord-tenant relationship. Who are the parties? As to the named plaintiff, remember MR#6: the real party in interest is the owner of the property, and the lawsuit must be brought in that person's name. An exception to the general rule applies in SE actions, however, allowing an agent of the owner with personal knowledge to sign the complaint and present the case . (MR #3). The defendant in a SE action is the person(s) who contracted with the LL to rent the property. Other occupants have no contract ual relationship with the owner; they are there with the tenant's agreement and lose th eir right to occupancy automatically when the tenant is procedural considerations MR#2: Service of process or appearance is required. In SE cases only, sheriff may serve process by mailing to defendant's last known address and posting on door of premises. See Return of Service re posting on back of summons. When service is accomplished by mail/posting and defendant does not appear in co urt, no money judgment is present, SCRA affidavit required. MR #5: Defendant must have been served at least 2 days prior to trial. Statute excludes legal holidays, suggesting that requirement is 2 calendar days: service on Friday PM sufficient for case to be heard Monday AM. Special Rule for Continuances: In 2013 GS 7A-223(b) was amended to provide that (1) an action for SE should be continued only for good cause shown, and (2) a continuance in SE cases only should not exceed 5 days or until the next session of small claims court unless the parties agree to a longer delay. Disputed title to real property will not be resolved in small claims court. If a defendant files an answer raising this issue, assignment to small claims court is withdrawn and the case is put on the district court docket. must produce evidence in support of claim even if defendant is not present. Subject to one exception, discussed below, a LL must introduce evidence of each essential element of the claim even if defendant is not present. Just as in other civil cases, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing a prima facie right to relief before the defendant is required to produce any evidence in defense. Exception: Judgment on the Pleadings. (see requirements on p. 30, Small Claims Law) What Are the terms of the contract? Did Defendant Breach? What Are the Damages? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Landlord-Tenant Law - Page 16Magistrate must either render judgment in open court or reserve judgment.* In 2013 GS 7A-22 was amended to re strict reservation of judgment in SE actions unless (1) the parties agree, or (2) the case is \"more complex,\" in which case judgment must be entered within 5 business days. The statute provides e examples of issues that might render an action more complex (e.g., subsidized housing cases, counterclaims, criminal activity), but circumstances are not limited to the examples listed. Two other recent legislative amendments re late to appeals from SE cases, but both require modification of usual procedure by the magistrate at the small claims level. First, a litigant who wishes to appeal from a small claims judgment is required to pay costs of appeal within a certain period. Failure to make timely payment results in automatic dismissal of the appeal. In SE actions only, costs must be paid within 10 days of entry of judgment. In all other small claims cases, the appellant has 20 days to pay costs. (Note that parties who qualify as indigent make be excused from this requirement.) GS 7A-228. The second legislative change to GS 7A-228 establishes a procedure for dismissal of a tenant's appeal under certain circumstances related to the degree of a tenant's participation in the action. The sole involvement of the magistrate in this procedure is to make a notation on the judgment if the defendant raised a defense in the small claims action. If a tenant raised a defense in writing, that will be part of the record, but an oral defense will not\u2014thus the importance of the magistrate's notation. It is important to note that the magistrate need not have found the defense persuasive\u2014indeed, there would be no appeal by the tenant if that were the case. An unpersuasive defense has legal significance in this context, and must be noted.

Connie doesn't have the money to pay the entire purchase price, though. So FF offers to sell her the furniture on an installment plan\u2014in other words, to \"finance\" her purchase. Of course, there's a possibility that Connie will take the furniture but not finish paying for it. If that happened, FF could certainly sue Connie for breach of contract. But there's a good chance that Connie might turn out to be \"judgment-proof,\" and even if she isn't, it would involve a lot of effort and expense on FF's part to collect. An alternative, which helps FF feel more secure, and thus more interested in selling to low-income customers, is for FF and Connie to enter into another contract saying that if Connie misses a payment, FF can repossess the furniture. FF doesn't even have to come to court, unless its effort to retrieve the furniture might cause a breach of the peace. As you know, a business deal is often referred to as a transaction, and this special type of two-contracts-in- one is called a __________________ ______________________. To create a secured transaction, the debtor must sign a written, dated ___________________ _________________that describes the property involved specifically enough so that it may be identified. The parties to this agreement are Connie, the debtor, and FF, the _________________ ___________________. The property that secures the transaction is called _______________________ . Rather than saying that FF and Connie entered into a security agreement in which FF obtained the right to repossess the collateral if Connie doesn't pay, it's easier to simply say that FF took a ________________ _______________ in the property. The legal term for Connie's failure to pay, which triggers FF's right to repossess, is _____________________. The rules about what FF does after repossessing the property are complex. If FF sells the property, it is required to conduct the sale in a _____________________ ___________________ manner. Any amount still owing after the sale is called a __________________, and FF's lawsuit seeking that amount is an action on the deficiency .

David rented a tuxedo for his wedding from Pretty Fashion Rental Company. He didn't get around to returning it until after his honeymoon, although the rental period was 24 hours. When the tux was two days late, Pretty Fashion was forced to rent a tux from its arch-competitor in order to fill an order for another wedding. That cost PF $100. When David finally brought it back, the tux was torn and had grass and wine stains on it. Cleaning and repair would cost $150, which David refused to pay, causing PF to refuse the tux. What action(s), requiring what complaint form(s), could PF use in small claims court on these facts? What would PF sue for? 2. Fantastic Furniture Co. brings an action to recover possession of a dining room table and chairs sold to The Skull and his wife, Morticia. At trial the manager testifies that he entered into an agree ment with the couple when they bought the furniture that it would be c ollateral for the debt. He then introduces his account record, which shows 2 payments and then a default. Do you need more information before you rule? If so, what do you need to know? 3. Paul has filed an action for conversion against Danny's Motors, Inc. based on the repossession of his truck. The evidence is undisputed that Danny's had a valid security interest in the truck and that Paul was in default. Nevertheless, Paul asserts that the repossession was wrongful because it involved a breach of the peace. In support of this claim, Paul introduces testimony by his neighbor, to the effect that he witnessed the repossession from his bedroom window around 1:00 AM, believed the truck to have been st olen, and called 911. He testifies that after the police came, other neighbors came out of their houses into the street, resulting in considerable confusion and chaos. How do you rule on Paul's claim for conversion? 4. Womble Furniture Co. sues to recover a dining room table, six chairs, one couch, a cocktail table and an upholstered wing chair. At the trial, Womble introduces a written security agreement in which de fendant agreed that the items listed would be collateral for the extension of credit for their purchase on that day from Womble. Womble proves default by the defendant-debtor. Defendant admits default, but argues that he's paid off all but $150 and the items Womble seeks to recover are worth more than that. He wants you to limit your judgment to recover the dining room table and chairs only, based on evide nce that their value alone exceeds $150. How do you rule, and why?

Easy Credit Appliance Co. filed a civil action on July 1, 2016 to recover a refrigerator purchased on June 1, 2010; a clothes dryer purchased on June 1, 2011; a DVD player purchased on June 1, 2012; a tele vision purchased on June 1, 2013, and a washing machine purchased on June 1, 2014. As each item was purchased, the buyer signed a security agreement listing the item just purchased and all the items previously purchased as security for th e debt. The buyer defaulted on his payments on March 5, 2016. Easy Credit asked for a judgment to repossess all of the items listed as collateral. The defendant argued that he had been paying $75 on the contract since 2010 and he believed Easy Credi t was not entitled to recover all of the items listed since he must have paid off some of the first items purchased.

Can Code of Judicial Conduct Adopted April 2003 The North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct is hereby amended to read as follows: Preamble An independent and honorable judiciary is indispensable to justice in our society, and to this end and in furtherance thereof, this Code of Judicial Conduct is hereby established. A violation of this Code of Judicial Conduct may be deemed conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute, or willful misconduct in office, or otherwise as grounds for disciplinary proceedings pursuant to Article 30 of Chapter 7A of the General Statutes of North Carolina. No other code or proposed code of judicial conduct shall be relied upon in the interpretation and application of this Code of Judicial Conduct. Canon 1 A judge should uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary. A judge should participate in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing, and should himself observe, appropriate standards of conduct to ensure that the integrity and independence of the judiciary shall be preserved.

A.A judge should respect and comply with the law and should conduct himself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. B.A judge should not allow his family, social or other relationships to influence his judicial conduct or judgment. He should not lend the prestige of his office to advance the private interest of others; nor should he convey or permit others to convey the impression that they are in a special position to influence him. A judge may, based on personal knowledge, serve as a personal reference or provide a letter of recommendation. He should not testify voluntarily as a character witness. C. A judge should not hold membership in any organization that practices unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion or national origin. Canon 3 A judge should perform the duties of his office impartially and diligently. The judicial duties of a judge take precedence over all his other activities. His judicial duties include all the duties of his office prescribed by law. In the performance of these duties, the following standards apply. A. Adjudicative responsibilities. /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g28294 (1) A judge should be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it.

(6) A judge should abstain from public comment about the merits of a pending proceeding in any state or federal court dealing with a case or controversy arising in North Carolina or addressing North Carolina law and should encourage similar abstention on the part of court personnel subject to his direction and control. This subsection does not prohibit a judge from making public statements in the course of official duties; from explaining for public information the proceedings of the Court; from addressing or discussing previously issued judicial decisions when serving as faculty or otherwise participating in educational courses or programs; or from addressing educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, political, or civic organizations. (7) A judge should exercise discretion with regard to permitting broadcasting, televising, recording, or taking photographs in the courtroom and areas immediately adjacent thereto during civil or criminal sessions of court or recesses between sessions, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 15 of the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District Courts. B. Administrative responsibilities. (1) A judge should diligently discharge his administrative responsibilities, maintain professional competence in judicial administration, and facilitate the performance of the administrative responsibilities of other judges and court officials. (2) A judge should require his staff and court officials subject to his direction and control to observe the standards of fidelity and diligence that apply to him. (3) A judge should take or initiate appropriate disciplinary measures against a judge or lawyer for unprofessional conduct of which the judge may become aware. (4) A judge should not make unnecessary appointments. He should exercise his power of appointment only on the basis of merit, avoiding nepotism and favoritism. He should not approve compensation of appointees beyond the fair value of services rendered. C. Disqualification. (1) On motion of any party, a judge should disqualify himself in a proceeding in which his impartiality may reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where: (a) He has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceedings; (b) He served as lawyer in the matter in controversy, or a lawyer with whom he previously practiced law served during such association as a lawyer concerning the matter, or the judge or such lawyer has been a material witness concerning it; (c) He knows that he, individually or as a fiduciary, or his spouse or minor child residing in his household, has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding, or any other interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding; /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g20/g19295 (d) He or his spouse, or a person within the third degree of relationship to either of them, or the spouse of such a person: (i) Is a party to the proceeding, or an officer, director, or trustee of a party; (ii) Is acting as a lawyer in the proceeding; (iii) Is known by the judge to have an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding; (iv) Is to the judge's knowledge likely to be a material witness in the proceeding.

D. Remittal of disqualification. Nothing in this Canon shall preclude a judge from disqualifying himself from participating in any proceeding upon his own initiative. Also, a judge potentially disqualified by the terms of Canon 3C may, instead of withdrawing from the proceeding, disclose on the record the basis of his potential disqualification. If, based on such disclosure, the parties and lawyers, on behalf of their clients and independently of the judge's participation, all agree in writing that the judge's basis for potential disqualification is immaterial or insubstantial, the judge is no longer disqualified, and may participate in the proceeding. The agreement, signed by all lawyers, shall be incorporated in the record of the proceeding. For purposes of this section, pro se parties shall be considered lawyers. Canon 4 A judge may participate in cultural or historical activities or engage in activities concerning the legal, economic, educational, or governmental system, or the administration of justice. A judge, subject to the proper performance of his judicial duties, may engage in the following quasi-judicial activities, if in doing so he does not cast substantial doubt on his capacity to decide impartially any issue that may come before him: A.He may speak, write, lecture, teach, participate in cultural or historical activities, or otherwise engage in activities concerning the economic, educational, legal, or governmental system, or the administration of justice. B.He may appear at a public hearing before an executive or legislative body or official with respect to activities permitted under Canon 4A or other provision of this Code, and he may otherwise consult with an executive or legislative body or official. C.He may serve as a member, officer or director of an organization or governmental agency concerning the activities described in Canon 4A, and may participate in its management and investment decisions. He may not actively assist such an organization in raising funds but may be /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g20/g20296 listed as a contributor on a fund-raising invitation. He may make recommendations to public and private fund-granting agencies regarding activities or projects undertaken by such an organization. Canon 5 A judge should regulate his extra-judicial activities to ensure that they do not prevent him from carrying out his judicial duties. A. Avocational activities.

B. Civic and charitable activities. A judge may participate in civic and charitable activities that do not reflect adversely upon his impartiality or interfere with the performance of his judicial duties. A judge may serve as an officer, director, trustee, or non-legal advisor of an educational, religious, charitable, fraternal or civic organization subject to the following limitations. (1) A judge should not serve if it is likely that the organization will be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before him. (2) A judge may be listed as an officer, director or trustee of any cultural, educational, historical, religious, charitable, fraternal or civic organization. He may not actively assist such an organization in raising funds but may be listed as a contributor on a fund-raising invitation. (3) A judge may serve on the board of directors or board of trustees of such an organization even though the board has the responsibility for approving investment decisions. C. Financial activities. (1) A judge should refrain from financial and business dealings that reflect adversely on his impartiality, interfere with the proper performance of his judicial duties, exploit his judicial position or involve him in frequent transactions with lawyers or persons likely to come before the court on which he serves. (2) Subject to the requirements of subsection (1), a judge may hold and manage his own personal investments or those of his spouse, children, or parents, including real estate investments, and may engage in other remunerative activity not otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this Code but should not serve as an officer, director or manager of any business.

(4) Neither a judge nor a member of his family residing in his household should accept a gift from anyone except as follows: (a) A judge may accept a gift incident to a public testimonial to him; books supplied by publishers on a complimentary basis for official or academic use; or an invitation to the judge and his spouse to attend a bar-related function, a cultural or historical activity, or an event related to the economic, educational, legal, or governmental system, or the administration of justice; (b) A judge or a member of his family residing in his household may accept ordinary social hospitality; a gift, favor or loan from a friend or relative; a wedding, engagement or other special occasion gift; a loan from a lending institution in its regular course of business on the same terms generally available to persons who are not judges; or a scholarship or fellowship awarded on the same terms applied to other applicants; /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g20/g21297 (c) Other than as permitted under subsection C.(4)(b) of this Canon, a judge or a member of his family residing in his household may accept any other gift only if the donor is not a party presently before him and, if its value exceeds $500, the judge reports it in the same manner as he reports compensation in Canon 6C. (5) For the purposes of this section \"member of his family residing in his household\" means any relative of a judge by blood or marriage, or a person treated by a judge as a member of his family, who resides in his household. (6) A judge is not required by this Code to disclose his income, debts or investments, except as provided in this Canon and Canons 3 and 6. (7) Information acquired by a judge in his judicial capacity should not be used or disclosed by him in financial dealings or for any other purpose not related to his judicial duties. D. Fiduciary activities. A judge should not serve as the executor, administrator, trustee, guardian or other fiduciary, except for the estate, trust or person of a member of his family, and then only if such service will not interfere with the proper performance of his judicial duties. \"Member of his family\" includes a spouse, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent or any other relative of the judge by blood or marriage. As a family fiduciary a judge is subject to the following restrictions: (1) He should not serve if it is likely that as a fiduciary he will be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before him, or if the estate, trust or ward becomes involved in adversarial proceedings in the court on which he serves or one under its appellate jurisdiction. (2) While acting as a fiduciary a judge is subject to the same restrictions on financial activities that apply to him in his personal capacity. E. Arbitration. A judge should not act as an arbitrator or mediator. However, an emergency justice or judge of the Appellate Division designated as such pursuant to Article 6 of Chapter 7A of the General Statutes of North Carolina, and an Emergency Judge of the District Court or Superior Court commissioned as such pursuant to Article 8 of Chapter 7A of the General Statutes of North Carolina may serve as an arbitrator or mediator when such service does not conflict with or interfere with the justice's or judge's judicial service in emergency status. A judge of the Appellate Division may participate in any dispute resolution program conducted at the Court of Appeals and authorized by the Supreme Court. F. Practice of law. A judge should not practice law. G. Extra-judicial appointments. A judge should not accept appointment to a committee, commission, or other body concerned with issues of fact or policy on matters other than those relating to cultural or historical matters, the economic, educational, legal or governmental system, or the administration of justice.

Canon 6 A judge should regularly file reports of compensation received for quasi-judicial and extra-judicial activities. A judge may receive compensation, honoraria and reimbursement of expenses for the quasi- judicial and extra-judicial activities permitted by this Code, subject to the following restrictions: A. Compensation and honoraria. Compensation and honoraria should not exceed a reasonable amount. /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g20/g22298 B. Expense reimbursement. Expense reimbursement should be limited to the actual cost of travel, food and lodging reasonably incurred by the judge and, where appropriate to the occasion, by his spouse. Any payment in excess of such an amount is compensation. C. Public reports. A judge shall report the name and nature of any source or activity from which he received more than $2,000 in income during the calendar year for which the report is filed. Any required report shall be made annually and filed as a public document as follows: The members of the Supreme Court shall file such reports with the Clerk of the Supreme Court; the members of the Court of Appeals shall file such reports with the Clerk of the Court of Appeals; and each Superior Court Judge, regular, special, and emergency, and each District Court Judge, shall file such report with the Clerk of the Superior Court of the county in which he resides. For each calendar year, such report shall be filed, absent good cause shown, not later than May 15th of the following year. Canon 7 A judge may engage in political activity consistent with his status as a public official. The provisions of Canon 7 are designed to strike a balance between two important but competing considerations: (1) the need for an impartial and independent judiciary and (2) in light of the continued requirement that judicial candidates run in public elections as mandated by the Constitution and laws of North Carolina, the right of judicial candidates to engage in constitutionally protected political activity. To promote clarity and to avoid potentially unfair application of the provisions of this Code, subsection B of Canon 7 establishes a safe harbor of permissible political conduct. A. Terminology. For the purposes of this Canon only, the following definitions apply. (1) A \"candidate\" is a person actively and publicly seeking election to judicial office. A person becomes a candidate for judicial office as soon as he makes a public declaration of candidacy, declares or files as a candidate with the appropriate election authority, authorizes solicitation or acceptance of contributions or public support, or sends a letter of intent to the chair of the Judicial Standards Commission. The term \"candidate\" has the same meaning when applied to a judge seeking election to a non-judicial office. (2) To \"solicit\" means to directly, knowingly and intentionally make a request, appeal or announcement, public or private, oral or written, whether in person or through the press, radio, television, telephone, Internet, billboard, or distribution and circulation of printed materials, that expressly requests other persons to contribute, give, loan or pledge any money, goods, labor, services or real property interest to a specific individual's efforts to be elected to public office. (3) To \"endorse\" means to knowingly and expressly request, appeal or announce publicly, orally or in writing, whether in person or through the press, radio, television, telephone, Internet, billboard or distribution and circulation of printed materials, that other persons should support a specific individual in his efforts to be elected to public office. B. Permissible political conduct. A judge or a candidate may: (1) attend, preside over, and speak at any political party gathering, meeting or other convocation, including a fund-raising function for himself, another individual or group of individuals seeking election to office and the judge or candidate may be listed or noted within any publicity relating to such an event, so long as he does not expressly endorse a candidate (other than himself) for a specific office or expressly solicit funds from the audience during the event; /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g20/g23299 (2) if he is a candidate, endorse any individual seeking election to any office or conduct a joint campaign with and endorse other individuals seeking election to judicial office, including the solicitation of funds for a joint judicial campaign; (3) identify himself as a member of a political party and make financial contributions to a political party or organization; provided, however, that he may not personally make financial contributions or loans to any individual seeking election to office (other than himself) except as part of a joint judicial campaign as permitted in subsection B(2); (4) personally solicit campaign funds and requ est public support from anyone for his own campaign or, alternatively, and in addition thereto, authorize or establish committees of responsible persons to secure and manage the solicitation and expenditure of campaign funds; (5) become a candidate either in a primary or in a general election for a judicial office provided that he should resign his judicial office prior to becoming a candidate either in a party primary or in a general election for a non-judicial office; (6) engage in any other constitutionally protected political activity. C. Prohibited political conduct. A judge or a candidate should not: (1) solicit funds on behalf of a political party, organization, or an individual (other than himself) seeking election to office, by specifically asking for such contributions in person, by telephone, by electronic media, or by signing a letter, except as permitted under subsection B of this Canon or otherwise within this Code; (2) endorse a candidate for public office except as permitted under subsection B of this Canon or otherwise within this Code; (3) intentionally and knowingly misrepresent his identity or qualifications. D. Political conduct of family members. The spouse or other family member of a judge or a candidate is permitted to engage in political activity. Limitation of Proceedings Disciplinary proceedings to redress alleged violations of Canon 7 of this Code must be commenced within three months of the act or omission allegedly giving rise to the violation. Disciplinary proceedings to redress alleged violations of all other provisions of this Code must be commenced within three years of the act or omission allegedly giving rise to the violation; provided, however, that disciplinary proceedings may be instituted at any time against a judge convicted of a felony during his tenure in judicial office. Scope and Effective Date of Compliance The provisions of Canon 7 of this Code shall apply to judges and candidates for judicial office. The other provisions of this Code shall become effective as to a judge upon the administration of the judge's oath to the office of judge; provided, however, that it shall be permissible for a newly installed judge to facilitate or assist in the transfer of his prior duties as legal counsel but he may not be compensated therefor. /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g20/g24300 /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g20/g25Published in The Judges' Journal, Volume 48, Number 1, Winter 2009. \u00a9 2009 by the American Bar Association.

Practical Tips for New Judges Making the Transition to the Bench By Judge Douglas S. Lavine HHon. Douglas S. Lavine was appointed to the trial bench by Connecticut Governor Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in 1993 and to the Connecticut Appellate Court in 2006 by Governor M. Jodi Rell. The views expressed in this article are strictly his own. He can be reached at Douglas.Lavine@connapp.jud.ct.gov. Congratulations! You have been appointed to the bench. I can as sure you that you will find your new jo b to be enormously gratifying and challenging. You w ill have a rare opportunity to use your legal and personal skills, honed by the practice of law, to serve the community. I can honestly say that I have enjoyed going to work on all but a few days of the nearly sixteen years I have been on the bench. Almost all of my judge friends feel the same way. With your new position comes a significant passage. You are beginning something exciting, but you are also ending an impor- tant phase of your life. You will be moving out of your previous comfort zone, one in which you may have had a high degree of control over your daily life and significant confidence in your abilities. In your new milieu, it is likely that almost everyon e you deal with\u2014other judges, lawyers, court staff\u2014will initially understand the way the system operates better than you. It will take tim e to adapt to your new surroundings in what one writer has called the \"neutral zone\"\u2014a time of reorientation to new circumstances and surroundings. 1 Be patient with yourself. In a relatively short period of time, you will emerge, like the proverbial butterfly from the cocoon, relaxed and confident, ready to fly. Everyone will call you \"Your Honor,\" doors will be held open, an d lawyers will laugh at your jokes\u2014even when they are not funny. Especially when they are not funny. You will carry an elevated status in your community, particularly in the legal world you inhabit. People will view you differently, and you will view yourself differently. You will be held to higher, more exacting st andards. Everyone will stand when you enter the courtroom. I have a colleague who recalled the first time she headed out onto the bench. Everyone stood. She reflexively turned around, asking herself, \"Whom are they standing for?\" From now on, they will be standing for you. This is heady stuff and can result in a severe attack of early onset robitis, a dreaded disease sometimes afflicting new judges which I will discuss later. It takes some time to adjust. Presumably, mentors, colleagues, and others you trust will offer advice. Like everyone who came before you, you w ill need to find your own way. No matter the advice you receive from other judges, every decision you make will be your own. It will become part of your judicial DNA. I wish you the best in ruling on the myriad issues you wil l confront over the years, issues often critical in the lives of the people who come before you and in the communities in which you live. I do not claim to have any sage advice when it comes to the art of judging. But in more than fifteen years on the bench\u2014 thirteen as a trial judge, and almost three on the Connecticut Appellate Court\u2014I have learned a few things about how to deal with recurring issues, some on the bench and many o ff, that you are sure to enc ounter. I claim to speak for no one but myself and underscore that the points raised here are based on my own experiences and observations, and sometimes, mistakes. As a judicial colleague, I hope these nuts-and-bolts suggestions will help you successfully cope with some of the mundane issues that you will face in your new role. Dealing with Friends Some people will take your new status in stride. But others, including people you have known your whole life, may act dif- ferently. Some acquaintances might be a bit standoffish or app ear to be slightly intimidated . Others will teas e you about hav- ing all the answers. Dealing with lawyer friends and colleagues\u2014people you used to practice with or against\u2014will present special challenges, especially when faced with issues of recusal or disqualification. It is important to be familiar with profe s- sional requirements relating to these issues. I recommend speaking to experienced judges with a good sense of local prac-tices and mores before making recusal or disqualification decisions. Of course, judges have a duty not to remove themselves from a case merely because a motion has been made. But experience teaches that even if litigants lose their cases, they can accept their disappointment if they think they have had a fair hearing. Appearances matter. Obviously every case is dif-ferent, but be very careful about remaining in a case if your fairness or objectivity can be reasonably questioned. You must be the guardian of your own reputation for fairness and impartiality. The Line Between Public and Private Behavior In a nutshell, it is best, under most circumstances, to act as if this line no longer exists. What I mean is this: whatever you say and do, anywhere and to anyone, can be grist for the mill if it reflects upon your fitness to dispense justice. I suggest t he following approach: except, perhaps, when dealing with immediate family and friends, imagine that what you say or do will appear in your local newspaper. Much as you may try, you really cannot be a judge just during the hours you are at court, or in your chambers. You are a judge all the time. Let me give a few hypotheticals. (1) Every year, prior to your appointment, you have hosted a big party at which alcohol is served. In the past, if someone was stopped on the way home for a DUI, it might have been a cause for concern. Now, it could mushroom into a major career blemish. (2) In the past, you sat and smiled uncomfortably when someone told an inappropriate joke. Now, doing or saying nothing might be understood by oth- /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g20/g26Published in The Judges' Journal, Volume 48, Number 1, Winter 2009. \u00a9 2009 by the American Bar Association.

(3) In the past, when someone was tailgating at high speeds you might have been tempted to slow down, or yell at them, or gesticulate. Now, taking any of these actions could lead to an allegation that you exhibited \"road rage\" and lack appropriate judicial temperament. (4) In the past, you might talk freely in an elevator no matter who was in it. Now, any words you utter could have an impact on a case or a juror or could be repeated in another courtroom. The simple truth is this: the line between private and public behavior has become blurred beyond recognition now that you are a judge. As a judge, you are a public figure. Your private conduct, therefore, is of interest to the public\u2014and the press. Ther efore, you must conduct yourself with the utmost care in private matters as well as public. R Requests for Legal Advice Here is the usual scenario. You are at a party when the friend of a friend approaches you, introduces himself, and states he knows you are a judge. He makes small talk. He says that he knows you are not allowed to give legal advice. Actually, he tells you, he is not seeking legal advice, but he has just one question, and maybe you can assist. It seems that his brother-in - law has been kicked out of the house by his spouse and he wants to go in to get his clothes and other personal belongings. Any problem? Or \"a friend's son\" got caught in the school bathroom smoking marijuana and was manhandled by the school's personnel. Can't they sue the school? Or his elderly mother got this speeding ticket and . . . . You get the idea. As a lawyer, you have undoubtedly dealt with such questions throughout the ye ars. But as a judge, it becom es more important still that you absolutely, positively say or do nothing that could be construed\u2014or misconstrued\u2014as giving legal advice. First of all, judges are prohibited from giving such advice. Secondly, it is not uncommon for laypeople to misunderstand or misinterpret legal concepts\u2014or to hear what they want to hear. So even if you decide to be polite and give some seemingly innocuous counsel with a disclaimer, the disclaimer is likely to be ignored. The last thing you want to learn is that Joe Smith's friend went into criminal court and told the judge that he went into the house to retrieve his belongings because \"Judge Jones told me I could.\" My advice? Tell the simple truth. Explain that you would like to be of assistance but that you are strictly prohib - ited, for professional reasons, from giving legal advice. And never, ever succumb to the temptation to do so. Mentioning that You Are a Judge Years ago, I worked as an assistant U.S. attorney. Often, I would be sitting next to someone on an airplane and the con- versation would be relaxed and friendly until I mentioned that I was a prosecutor. Then everything stopped. I always as-sumed that people thought that I would initiate a tax investigation if they said the wrong thing. In your new role, people will react differently to you when they learn you are a judge. Some people will want to treat you more favorably because of your position. My advice is to resist, except in social situations where the subject arises naturally, the temptation to tell people that you are a judge unless you are asked. What that means is this. (1) If you are on a waiting list at a local restaurant, do not mention that you are a judge in the hope of getting seated before your time, and don't permit your spouse, significant other, or partner to do so either. (2) If you are pulled over for speeding, do not disclose that you are a judge in the hope of gainin g favored treatment. And do not put your judicial credentials next to your driver's license so the officer will inevitably discov er that you are a judge. (3) If your spouse has a dispute with the local mechanic because he charged more than he said he would, do not make that angry phone call claiming that, as a judge, you know what he is doing is unlawful, a violation of con-sumer protection laws, that you decided a case just like this, etc. (4) If your child is arrested for possession of marijuana, do not try to use your status to obtain preferential treatment for him or her. And so on. The bottom line is that the inappropriat e use of your position to obtain special treatment is an abuse of power. Charities Some people will try to use your presence at an event or your name on a letterhead to raise funds. No matter how worthy the charity or cause, this should be resisted. Check relevant ethical rules, guidelines, and decisions to determine to what ex-tent you can be involved in charitable events, including those with which you have had a long-time involvement. Political Activities Different considerations may apply, of course, in states in which judges are elected. But for appointed judges in places like Connecticut, the rule is simple. Political activity is strictly verboten. Avoid rallies, fund-raisers, making contributions, bu mper stickers, and signs or posters on your lawn. If your spouse is involved in politics, steer clear of situations in which it appe ars that you yourself are engaging in political conduct. Email It is probable that at home you have received unsolicited email that is offensive to you. Be careful not to allow any such unsolicited material to be forwarded to your work computer. When writing email messages at work, avoid language that would embarrass you if printed in the local newspaper. Tell friends and colleagues not to send you jokes, articles, and pic- tures at work. When online at work, avoid sites or searches that could call up offensive material. Use your home computer to communicate with friends to avoid contamination of your work computer. /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g20/g27Published in The Judges' Journal, Volume 48, Number 1, Winter 2009. \u00a9 2009 by the American Bar Association.

WWork Interactions All of your contacts with everyone in the work setting should be polite, professional, and courteous. You are a role model and should set the appropriate tone. This includes lawyers, secretaries, marshals, probation officers, the cleaning crew, fam-ily relations officers, stenographers, court reporters, members of the public, foreign visitors, school children on a class tri p\u2014 virtually everyone. Court systems are huge echo chambers. Ever ything you say and do is grist for the mill. Rumors and an- ecdotes fly from court to court. If you are rude or inconsiderate, that will be known to everyone quickly. Jokes or comments that might have been appropriate in your past life, when talking to longtime associates or employees, are better left unsaid in your new role. Discussing Cases or Opinions in Public The scenario is a fam iliar one. Y ou are out to lunch with judge friends and the discussion turns to a trial you are presiding over. You offer a few tart opinions on the performance of a lawyer or the merits of the case. Oops! You didn't notice, but in the next booth is the very lawyer you have been discussing, or the plainti ff, or a juror. The prospect of a mistrial in your first trial now dangles before you. Be very, very discreet when discussing legal matters, particularly a case, with a colleague. Talking about cases or decisions in a public setting\u2014a restaurant, a hallway, an elevator\u2014frequently invites disaster. Simi-larly, do not leave files, drafts of opinions, or anything else relating to a case lying around\u2014in a car, at a restaurant, or a ny- where. Ruling Before You Are Ready Your job is now to analyze arguments and make decisions. In a variety of settings, the problems requiring a decision will come at you very quickly. Nonetheless, my advice is to never rule unless you are comfortable with what you are doing. It is often said that lawyers prefer a timely decision, any decision, even if it is at odds with their positions, to being forced to wait. And there will be times when numerous factors\u2014a heavy docket, a crowded court, the presence of people who have come from a long distance to attend a proceeding\u2014will militate toward just ruling and moving on. I am not counseling timidity or indecision. But if that little internal voice that sometime speaks to you tells you that you are not ready to rule, listen to i t. Take a recess. Hear more argument and think it over. Seek out advice from a senior colleague. Order additional briefs. Or just sleep on it. Very few decisions are so urgent that they cannot wait a few more hours or days. Expressions of Personal Opinions on the Bench During my first judicial assignment, a crusty veteran gave me two bits of advice. First, he said, always stop in the bath- room before going out onto the bench. Second, KYBMS\u2014Keep Your Big Mouth Shut. I leave to you whether you choose to follow his first bit of advice. But over the years I have come to appreciate his blunt advice about keeping personal comments and observations to an absolute minimum. Pleasantries are okay. Occasional conversation can be alright. But always re-member that we are not being paid to express our personal or political views on the matters of the day or share our thoughts on the pennant race, the state of the economy, or anything else. Nor are we a sort of master of ceremonies in a robe, presid-ing over an entertainment event. Except for court personnel, lawyers and the like, the people in the courtroom almost always do not want to be there. They are a captive audience. It is, frankly, somewhat egocentric to think otherwise and an abuse of your authority to force people to listen to opinions they would just as soon not hear. Humor on the Bench or in Written Opinions Off the bench, a lively and irreverent sense of humor can be charming. I used to think I was funny until my now-twenty- two-year-old daughter somewhere back in the eighth grade or so stopped laughing at my jokes and just sighed. But on the bench, or in written opinions, joke-telling runs the risk of detracting from the solemnity of the proceedings, being boorish, a nd veering off into abusiveness. A joke\u2014particularly at someone's expense\u2014may earn you snickers from some observers, but what seems funny to you will be deeply off ensive to someone else. Criminal defendants, litigants in a divorce, plaintiffs in a malpractice case, and others forced into court, see nothing at all humorous about their situation. Never forget that for most people, a court case represents a traumatic event and frequently involves matters of the utmost importance in their lives. Even when you are acting with the best of intentions or trying to lessen the tension in the courtroom, attempts at humor are almost always likely to be misunderstood. My advice? Avoid the laugh lines; think it, but don't say it. The same applies to written opinions. Jokes, or opinions in verse, may seem clever when written, but they are not likely to seem funny to the peo-ple on the receiving end whose cases you are deciding. Treating Everyone with Courtesy and Respect You should strive to treat everyone\u2014underline everyone \u2014with patience, courtesy, and respect. This includes the corpora- tion president and the convicted felon, the elderly alcoholic and the star athlete, the pro se litigant and the top flight lawy er. You speak for the community, so at times, you will be required to make harsh decisions\u2014particularly when sentencing de-fendants convicted of serious crimes. But even as you voice the community's concerns, there is never a reason to treat any- /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g20/g28Published in The Judges' Journal, Volume 48, Number 1, Winter 2009. \u00a9 2009 by the American Bar Association.

Your job is to set the appropriate tone of dignity and fairness in the courtroom and to apply the rules fairly to every-one. D Dealing with the Media How do you deal with the media? With extreme care. This is particularly the case if you receive a call asking you to com- ment on a pending matter. In most, if not all, jurisdictions, judges are prohibited from commenting on a pending case. In many jurisdictions, the judicial branch will have designated a person to handle calls and manage press relations. If you are uncomfortable returning reporters' calls, you can delegate that job to someone else. However, as a former reporter who cov-ered legal matters, I can attest to the fact that often reporters are working under tight deadlines. Therefore, even if you can - not or do not wish to comment, the courteous thing to do is to return the call personally or to direct someone else to do it so that the reporter is informed that you cannot, or will not, comment. Robitis We turn now to the dreaded disease, robitis. Robitis is defined as a condition that befalls a judge when he or she dons a robe which causes the judge to assume a self-important, arrogant attitude. In your years in practice, you have undoubtedly practiced before judges with this dreaded affliction. Robitis can be fatal to a judge's career. Friends and colleagues will probably be reticent to tell you if you have come down with it. Figure out a way to have someone\u2014perhaps a mentor or more experienced colleague who you respect\u2014close the door and tell you if you are showing symptoms of the disease. Com-ments from lawyers and jurors, if you have access to them, can be helpful. If you see a recurring theme emerging in these comments, resist the human urge to resent them and ignore them. Also try to step outside of yourself\u2014mentally\u2014on occa-sion, look dispassionately down at your own behavior, and ask yourself if you like what you see. Your work is important; take it seriously. Try not to take yourself too seriously. A touch of humility goes a long way. So does a willingness to acknowledge that you have made a mistake or misunderstood an argument or would like to be educated on a point of law. Ethical Concerns You must be the guardian of your own integrity and reputation. Friends and family may ask you to do things not under- standing that a different set of rules applies to you. My wife still makes fun of me when we are walking our dogs because I refuse to walk over a small patch of waterfront property near our home that has a \"No Trespassing\" sign posted. Explain to your family in emphatic terms that you are now living under a set of rules that is different from other people's and that you need to be scrupulous in ways that others may find excessive. Periodically review the Code of Judicial Conduct. When in doubt about the propriety of conduct, check with a senior colleague or a designated person in your judicial branch. Keep your ethical antennae up. Never do anything if you have qualms about its propriety. A Final Comment Again, congratulations to you. I guarantee that you will love being a judge. It is an honor and a privilege to be appointed or elected a judge. It is also a great responsibility. I wish you the best. I hope these suggestions are helpful to you as begin this exciting passage.

W ILLIAM BRIDGES , TRANSITIONS : MAKING SENSE OF LIFE'S CHANGES (1980). /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g21/g191 JUDICIAL ETHICS AND SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES Michael Crowell UNC School of Government August 2012 (Updated) One of the significant developments in communi cation in recent years is the astounding growth of social networking websites. Huge numbers of pe ople have joined Facebook or LinkedIn or Twitter or other on-line social networks as a means to notify others of news in their lives, to learn what their friends and relatives and acq uaintances are doing, and to generally stay in touch with other people with whom th ey have something in common. Businesses, organizations and government agencies use social ne tworks to communicate information about their products and services and get limited fee dback. For individuals, and for some kinds of organizations, the appeal of such sites is the opportuni ty for ongoing back-and-forth communication among large groups of people. Typi cally a social network allows someone to post a profile and photographs, videos, music, etc., and invite others to become \"friends\" or \"fans.\" Some information may be shared with the whole world; other parts may be restricted to a select, small group. As with the general population, the number of judges using social media sites continues to increase. A 2012 report says that 46.1 percent of judges su rveyed use a social media profile site. Among those judges, Facebook is most popu lar, being the choice of 86.3 percent of the users. For some time now state bar regulatory agencies have been addressing the effect of electronic communication on traditional ethical rules for lawyers the extent to which law firm websites constitute advertising, whether e-mail inquiries establish an attorney/client relationship, and so on. Likewise, judges hear ing cases have faced new legal issues involving electronic discovery and searches of computers. Judges are becoming familiar, too, with problems of jurors communicating with the outside world and conducting their own research via their smart phones and other devices. Until recently, though, there has been relatively little reference material for judges concerning their own social networking and the Code of Judicial Conduct. Th e purpose of this paper is to share some information addressing questions of judges' personal use of social networks. I welcome any additional materi al anyone knows about. /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g21/g202 Judges' use of social networks A good overview of social networking issues for ju dges appears in an April 30, 2010, on-line article from Slate entitled \" Tweet Justice .\" The article reports that some judges search Facebook and other sites to check on what lawyers and parties are up to, and it tells of one judge who requires all juveniles appearing before her to friend her on Facebook or MySpace so she can monitor their activities. As the article says, the new social media can generate ethical issues for judges. One question is the appearance created by a judge and lawyer \"friending\" each other on a social network. Another potential pitfall is the increased opportunity for ex parte communication. The article cites a North Caro lina judicial discipline case arising from a Facebook friendship. North Carolina disciplinary case The North Carolina disciplinary case menti oned in the Slate article is an April 2009 reprimand issued by the Judicial Stan dards Commission. The judge and lawyer had decided at the beginning of a child custody/sup port proceeding to friend each other on Facebook and then exchanged comments about the case on the social network. That contact led to the reprimand for ex parte communication. Th e judge was also reprimanded for his independent research on the parties, without informing eithe r side, through his visits to the wife's business website, a photography business where she posted both photographs and poems. Articles about judges and social networks For another example of how a judge's use of Facebook can lead to trouble, there is the resignation of Georgia judge Ernest Wood as reported in both the ABA Journal . Another example, also reported in a local newspaper , involves a lawyer who served as a substitute judge in North Las Vegas. He was removed from the office once the district attorney discovered that the judge's MySpace page said on e of his personal in terests was \"Breaking my foot off in a prosecutor's ass.\" There are also two articles on social networking in American Judicature Society publications, but they are not on-line. One is \"Judges and Social Networks\" in the Judicial Conduct Reporter, Vol. 32, No. 1, p. 1. The other is \"The Too Friend ly Judge? Social Netw orks and the Bench,\" by Cynthia Gray in Judicature magazine, Vol. 93, p. 236 (May-June 2010). Ethics opinions The question of whether judges may join social networks and wheth er they may be social networking friends with lawyers, law enforcement officers and others now has been addressed /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g21/g213 by eight state ethics committees. All the opin ions say that judges may join social networks, but they disagree on the propriety of friending la wyers. Florida, Oklahoma and Massachusetts say no; New York, Kentucky, South Carolina, Ohio and California say yes, though usually with qualifications. All the opinions warn judges about the potential pi tfalls of social networks for embarrassment and damage to the di gnity and integrity of the office. The short reviews of the ethics opinions below explain the issues that may arise under the Code of Judicial Conduct. Florida The Florida Supreme Court's Judicial Ethics Advisory Committee's opinion 2009-20 , issued on November 17, 2009, received a great deal of pub licity because it was one of the earliest opinions and because it concluded that judg es may not add lawyers as friends on a social network. The opinions from several other jurisdic tions have taken a different view, as discussed below. The Florida committee opined tha t a judge could join a social network and post comments and other materials so long as the material did not o therwise violate the Code of Judicial Conduct, but that the judge could not add as friends la wyers who appear before the judge, nor allow lawyers to add the judge as a fr iend. The committee further said that a judge's election campaign committee could post material on a social network and could allow lawyers and others to list themselves as \"fans,\" provided the judge or campaign committee did not control who could list themselves in that manner. The committee's concern was that the judge's acceptance of a law yer as a friend on the judge's page on the social network woul d violate the canon which prohib its a judge from conveying the impression, or allowing others to convey the impression, that a person is in a special position to influence the judge. The comparable provision in North Carolina's Code of Judicial Conduct is in Canon 2B. The Florida's committee noted that being listed as a friend as the term is used on social network would not necessarily mean that th e lawyer actually was in a special position, but the listing would convey that impression. The original Florida opinion generated additional inquiries resulting in three follow-up opinions. The first is Opinion Number 2010-04 which advises that judicial assistants may add as Facebook friends lawyers who may appear before the judg e for whom the assistant works, so long as the assistant's Facebook activity is conducted indepe ndently of the judge and does not mention the judge or court. The next Florida opinion, Number 2010-05 , advised that candidates fo r judicial office are not subject to the original opinion and that they, thus, may add as Facebook friends lawyers who are likely to appear before them if elected. The opinion is based on the wording of the Florida Code of Judicial Conduct which specifies the portions that apply to candidates. /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g21/g224 Finally, the Florida Judicial Ethics Advisory Commi ttee revisited and reiterated its support for its original opinion on March 26, 2010, with Opinion Number 2010-06 . The new opinion was prompted by several inquiries, two of which pr oposed disclaimers on judges' Facebook pages and one of which asked about an organization's Facebook p age. The committee advised, first, that a judge who is a member of a voluntary ba r association which uses a Facebook page may use that page to communicate with other mem bers, including lawyers, ab out the organization and about non-legal matters, and does not have to \"de-friend\" lawyer members who might appear before the judge. The opinion emphasized that the organization, not the judge, controlled the Facebook page and decided whic h friend requests would be accepted and rejected. One judge asked whether the concerns expressed in the original opinion could be addressed by including a disclaimer on the judge's Facebook page stating that (a) the judge would accept as a friend anyone the judge recogn ized or who shared a number of common friends; (b) the term \"friend\" does not mean a close relationship; and (c) no one listed as a friend is in a position to influence the judge. Another jud ge inquired about a similar appro ach, proposing to state on the judge's Facebook page that the judge would accept as a frie nd all lawyers who requested to be added. The Florida committee rejected both proposals a nd stuck to its original opinion. The committee majority said that the disclaimer failed to cure the impression that a lawyer listed as a Facebook friend had special influence. The majority observed that lawyers who chose not to use Facebook would not be listed as friends and that there was no assurance that someone viewing the page would see or read the disclaimer. A mi nority of the committee wrote a dissent, calling for withdrawal of the original opinion, arguing that judges are not prohibited from having lawyers as friends in the historic sense of the word and that adding a lawyer as a Facebook-defined friend creates no stronger impression of special influence than does ordinary socializing. The minority would advise that a judge may accept lawyers as Facebook friends and that any motion to require the judge to recuse because of that relationship would need to include additional specific allegations suppor ting the impression of special influence. South Carolina In October 2009 the South Carolina Advisory Committee on Standards of Judicial Conduct issued Opinion 17-2009 . With little discussion the committee said that a magistrate may join Facebook and be friends with law enforcement offic ers and court employees so long as the site is not used for discussion of judicial business. /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g21/g235 New York More extended discussions, tending toward th e same result as South Carolina but with more helpful analysis and discussion, have come from New York, Kentucky, Ohio and California. The gist of Opinion 08-176 of the New York Adviso ry Committee on Judicial Ethics, issued on January 29, 2009, is that there is nothing fund amentally different about a judge socializing through a social network and socializing in pers on, and nothing fundamentally different about communicating electronically rather than face to face. The key question for the committee was not whether a judge could join a social network but how the judge behaves on the network. The judge, said the committee, needs to be aware of the public nature of comments posted on such a site; the potential of creating the appearance that a la wyer who friends the judge will have special influence; and the lik elihood that people might use th e judge's social network page to seek legal advice. The committee observed that in some ways allowing a person to become a friend on a social network is no different tha n adding the person's co ntact information to a Rolodex, but still cautioned that when combined with other circumstances the friending can lead to the appearance of a close social re lationship requiring disclosure or recusal. Kentucky One of the most extensive opinions is Formal Judicial Ethics Opinion JE-119 issued on January 10, 2010, by the Ethics Committee of the Kent ucky Judiciary. The Kentuc ky committee does not believe that being design ated a friend on a social network by itself conveys an impression of a special relationship. The committ ee repeats the cautions of th e New York opinion, though, and notes that \"social networking si tes are fraught with peril for judg es . . . .\" Personal information, photographs and comments that might be appr opriate for someone else may not satisfy the higher standards for judges. The committee also warns of the problem of ex parte communications and cites the North Carolina reprimand. California Opinion 66 from the Judicial Ethics Committee of the California Judges Association, issued on November 23, 2010, is well writ ten and useful. The California committee concludes, with qualifications, that a judge may join a social network, even one whic h includes lawyers who may appear before the judge, bu t the judge must disclose the social network connection and must defriend the lawyer when the lawyer has a case before the judge. As to whether a judge may friend a lawyer, th e committee answers that it depends on the nature of the social network an d whether the lawyer has a c ase before the judge. If the social network is one limited to the judge's relatives an d a few close colleagues and it is used for exchanging personal information, for example, the likelihood will be greater that the lawyer appears to have special influence. There is much less risk, by comparison, when the social /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g21/g246 network involves individuals and organizations int erested in a particular subject or project, say a sports team or a charitable project, and th e exchanges are limited to that topic. Regardless of the nature of the social network, however, the Ca lifornia opinion says the judge should always disclose that the judge has a social network ti e to a lawyer and must recuse from any case in which a friend from the first kind of network, the more personal one, is participating. Even for the second kind of social network, the less persona l one, the judge should de-friend the lawyer when the lawyer appears in a case before the judge. One issue the California opinion addresses but o thers do not is the judge's obligation when others post comments on the judge's personal social network page. The committee says that the ethical obligation to avoid the appearance of bias requires the judge to monitor the judge's page frequently for such comments and to delete the comments, hide them from public view or otherwise repudiate anything ot hers say that is offensive or demeaning. Leaving comments on the page can create the impression th at the judge has adopted the comments. The California opinion also admonishes judges to no t create links to political organizations or others that would amount to impermissible political activity. And the jud ge must be careful not to lend the prestige of the office to another by posting any mat erial that would be construed as advancing that oth er person's interest. Finally, the opinion admonishes judges to be fa miliar with a social network's privacy settings and how to modify them. And the judge should be aware that other participants in the social network may not guard privacy as diligently and may thereby expose the judge's comments, photographs, etc., to others witho ut the judge's permission. Ohio The Ohio opinion is Opinion 2010-7, issued December 3, 2010, by the Ohio Supreme Court's Board of Commissioners on Grieva nces and Discipline. It is the last opinion in the list of 2010 opinions . The Ohio opinion observes that there is no prohib ition on a judge being a friend of a lawyer who appears before the jud ge, thus friending on-line cannot be an ethics violation by itself. The opinion notes the special risks associ ated with social networks fo r judges and advises that: (a) the judge must be careful to maintain the dign ity of the office in every comment, photograph, etc., posted on the site; (b) a judge should not interact on social networks with individuals or organizations whose advocacy or in terest in matters before the court would raise questions about the judge's independence; (c) the judge should not make any comments on a site about any matter pending before the jud ge; (d) the judge should not use the social network for ex parte communications; and (e) the judge should not undertake independ ent investigation of a case by visiting a party's or witness' page. Finall y, the Ohio opinion advises judges to consider /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g21/g257 whether interaction with a lawyer on a social ne twork creates any bias or prejudice concerning the lawyer or a party. Oklahoma The Oklahoma Judicial Ethics Advisory Board issued its Judicial Ethics Opinion 2011-3 on July 6, 2011. Oklahoma supports the Florida point of view , that while a judge may participate in social networking sites the judge should not be soci al network friends with lawyers, law enforcement officers, social workers or others who may appear in the judge's court. In the panel's view such a relationship can convey the impression that the person is in a special po sition to influence the judge. It is immaterial whether the person actually is in such a position, it is the possible impression that matters, and in the opinion of the Oklahoma committee, \"We believe that public trust in the impartiality and fairness of the judicial system is so important that [it] is imperative to err on the side of caution wher e the situation is 'fraught with peril.'\" Massachusetts The last opinion issued is CJE Opinion No. 2011-6 from the Committee on Judicial Ethics of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Massach usetts relies on the Florida analysis in concluding that a judge may join a social netw ork site but may not friend any lawyer who appears before the judge. \"State d another way, in term s of a bright-line test, judges may only 'friend' attorneys as to whom they would recu se themselves when thos e attorneys appeared before them.\" Friending creates the impression , Massachusetts conclude s, that the lawyer is a special position to influence the judge. The Massachusetts opinion repeats briefly the w arnings from other opinions about the posting of embarrassing photographs, the avoidance of ex parte communications, and the like, and also adds a new caution. It tells judges not to id entify themselves as judges on the social network site, nor allow others to do so. Such identifica tion would run afoul of the code provisions against using the prestige of the office to advance private interests, in addition to the problem of creating an impression that others are in a special position to influence the judge. Summary Although the number of opinions about judges and social networks is still small, there does seem to be a consensus building on several issu es. There appears to be general agreement among the ethics committee that: (1) Judges may join on-line social networks. (2) Social networks create opportunities and temptations for ex parte communication that judges must be careful to avoid. /g3 /g40/g87/g75/g76/g70/g86/g16/g51/g68/g74/g72/g3/g21/g268 (3) Judges are still judges when posting materials on their social networking pages and need to realize that the kinds of comments and photographs posted by others may not be appropriate for them. (4) Judges need to avoid on-line ties to organizations that discriminate, just as they are prohibited from joining such organizations. (5) Judges also need to avoid on-line ties to o rganizations that may be advocates before the court. (6) Judges need to avoid posting comments on social network sites or taking other actions on such sites that lend the prestige of the jud ge's office to the advancement of a private interest. The ethics committees divide most sharply on th e issue of a judge accepting a lawyer as a friend on a social network. The majority of the states opining on the issue to date conclude that friending does not by itself establish such a rela tionship as to imply that the lawyer has special influence and does not by itself require the j udge to recuse from cases with that lawyer, although they recognize that a social network friendship may create such problems when combined with other circu mstances. In the view of those states, being a friend of a judge on a social network is no different than being a friend in person and does not by itself lead to automatic recusal. On th e other hand, the ethics committee s of three states have concluded that a social network friendship is sufficiently likely to create the impression of special influence that it should be barred. Alth ough such an impression of favoritism may be mistaken, the approach of those ethics committee is to er r on the side of caution when it comes to appearances of fairness. Judges also should be aware of the security issues that come with social networking. A judge's page on Facebook or MySpace or other social network can provide lots of information to someone who is dissatisfied with the judge's decisions and wants to do harm. 8/10/12 This paper may be used for education al purposes with out permission.

The Judicial Branch is committed to removing barriers that hinder equal access to justice by individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP). The court should require an interpreter for any court proceeding involving a party in interest who speaks a language other than English as the primary language and has a limi ted ability to read, speak, or understand English. Who pays for the court interpreter? The Judicial Branch will provide a court interpreter at state exp ense and at no cost to the party in the following types of court proceedings: /g120All court proceedings heard before the magistrate /g120All court proceedings heard before the clerk of superior court /g120All court proceedings heard befo re the district court judge /g120All court proceedings heard before the superior court judge Who is considered a party in interest? Parties in interest in a court proceeding can be any of the following: a party; a victim; a witness; the parent, legal guardian or custodian of a minor party; the le gal guardian or custodian of an adult party. How do I determine whether a pers on has limited English proficien cy and needs a court interpreter? To help determine whether to require a co urt interpreter, the court should cond uct a voir dire that asks open-ended questions that cannot be answered with a simple yes or no. Visit www.NCcourts.gov to access the Language Access Bench Card for suggested voir dire questions, the interpreter's oath, jury instructions, and general tips for working with court interpreters. What types of interpreting se rvices are available? The Judicial Branch offers a number of langu age access services to meet the nee ds of LEP individuals, including staff court interpreters, contract court interpreters, telephone interpreting, remote int erpreting, translation, and transcription-translation services. Certified st aff court interpreters provide Spanish interpreting services in 9 and Wake. The court proceeding is scheduled for today, but no court interpreter has been scheduled. Is it possible to find an interpreter on such short notice? The request process set forth in th e Standards requires a completed Request for Spoken Foreign Language Court Interpreter be submitted by counsel, if applicable, or court p ersonnel to the local Language Access Coordinator at least 10 days in advance of the court date or as soon as the matter is placed on the calendar, whichever occurs first. Court Interpreter Services Page 5interpreters are often scheduled well in advance of the court date, so last minute coverage is unlikely outside of staff court interpreter districts. Attorneys shoul d be instructed to submit a request for a future court date. Court personnel should assist with submitting the request on behalf of self-represented litigants. If parties bring friends or family wi th them to interpret, may we use those friends or family as court interpreters? No. Only court interpreters approved by OL AS may provide interpreting services during a court proceeding. Friends and family may help parties communicate with court staff outside the courtroom, but they may not serve as court interpreters. May court personnel who speak other languages serve as court interpreters in court proceedings? No. Court personnel who speak other languages may help parties communicate with court staff outside the courtroom, but they may not serve as court interpreters in court proceedings. Additionally , law enforcement officers, corrections officers, and attorneys may not serve as court interpreters in court proceedings. May I use telephone interpreting to conduct a trial? The telephone interpreting services may be used for brief matters before the judici al official, such as continuances, and for first appearances. However, a telephon e interpreter should not be used for tria ls or any other types of evidentiary hearings in district court. Telephone interpreting services are not available in superior court. What if one of the partie s needs an interpreter outside of the court proceeding? The Judicial Branch will provide an interpreter for out-of-c ourt communications on behalf of the district attorney, Guardian ad Litem Program, and, pursuant to a me morandum of understanding betwe en NCAOC and the Office of Indigent Defense Services (IDS), on behalf of public defenders, assigned counsel , and guardians ad litem representing indigent parties for IDS. The Judicial Branch does not provide interp reting services to facilitate comm unications between private counsel and clients, witnesses or other parties outside of the court proceeding . Language access services required for all out-of-court communications involving private counsel , including all interviews, investigation s, and other aspects of general case preparation, are outside the scope of services provided or funded by the Judicial Branch. Will the court interpreter maintain the confiden tiality of what is said be tween attorney and client? Yes. The court interpreter is ethically bound to maintain the co nfidentiality of any information disclosed between attorney and client. Where should I direct questions about language access services?

Interpreter Services Page 8Guide to Interpreter Language Needed and Interpreter Used Indicators This document is designed to assist with th e use of the interpreter language needed and interpreter used indicators in the following indicators should be used to indicate spoken foreign language interpreting services and sign language interpreting services for the deaf and hard of hearin g. The interpreter la nguage needed and interpreter used indicators should be used for managing cases that need or use an interpreter, and should not be used so lely for scheduling interpreters. Use of Interpreter Indicators If a case is coded as i nterpreter language needed, an interpreter should not automatically be scheduled for every setting of that case. Judicial officials, attorneys, and co urt personnel alway s should check the case file to determine who needs the interpreter and if an interpreter act ually will be needed for the proceeding. For example, the victim in a criminal case who needed an interpreter during a trial may not be present during the defendant's subsequent probation violation heari ng, so the court would not schedule an interpreter for the subsequent proceeding. Courts should use interpreter resources efficiently by sharing interpreters between criminal and civil co urtroom calendars, scheduling an interpreter only for the time the interpreter is needed and not requesting interpreters \"just in case,\" as their services are often needed in ano ther courtroom or county. What is a court proceeding? A court proceeding is any hearing, trial, or other app earance before any North Ca rolina state court in an action, appeal, or other proceeding, including any matter conducted by a judicial official.

Contact For procedural questions on the use of the interpreter i ndicators, please contact t he Office of Language Access Services at 919 890-1407 or OLAS@nccourts.org . Interpreter Services Page 12Frequently Asked Questions: Interpreter Needed and Used Indicators When do I use the interpreter la nguage needed indicator? If an interpreter will be needed for any court proceedi ngs for any limited-English proficient individual, select the appropriate language fro m the interpreter needed section. For example, if the state's witness to a criminal c ase speaks Korean, indicate that a Korean interpreter will be needed by selecting Korean from the languages available under the interpreter language needed section. When do I use the interp reter used indicator? If an interpreter was used at any point during a court proceeding for any limited-English proficient individual, select Yes / Y from th e interpreter used section. For example, if a magistrate used the telephone inte rpreting service to condu ct an initial appearance, the magistrate would indicate that an interpreter was used during that proceeding. But, if a clerk used the telephone interpre ting service to answer a general question ab out a court date, the clerk would not indicate that an interpreter was used because it was not during a court proceeding. What is a court proceeding? A court proceeding is any hearing, trial, or other appearance before any North Carolina court in an action, appeal, or other proceeding, including any matter conducted by a judicial official. Who is a party in interest? A party in interest is a party to a case; a victim; a witness; the parent, legal guardian, or custodian of a minor party, or the legal guardian or custodian of an adult party. Who is a judicial official? A judicial official is a clerk, judge, magistr ate, or justice of the General Court of Justice. How do I use the indicators? The interpreter language needed and interpreter used indicators should be used for managing cases that need or use an interpreter, and should not be used solely for scheduling interpreters. Judicial officials, attorneys, and court personnel always shou ld check the case file to determine who needs the interpreter and if an interp reter actually will be needed for the proceeding. For example, the victim in a criminal case who needed an interpreter during a trial may not be present during the defendant's subsequent pr obation violation hearing, so the court would not schedule an interpreter for the subsequent proceeding. Courts should use interprete r resources efficiently by sharing Interpreter Services Page 13North Carolina Judicial Branch FAQs Interpreter Needed and Used Indicators | Office of Language Access Services Page 2 of 2interpreters between criminal and civil courtroom calendars, scheduling an interpreter only for the time the interpreter is needed and not requesting interpreters \"just in case,\" as their services are often needed in another courtroom or county. May I change the indicators? No. Once the case has been indicated as interpreter needed or interpreter used, do not change the indicators unless it was entered into the system incorrectly. For example, if a law enforcement officer inco rrectly indicates in eCITATION that a Spanish interpreter is needed, but the court determines that the defendan t speaks Portuguese, not Spanish, the language needed indicator may be changed to Portuguese. If there are multiple LEP parties in interest to a case, for whom do I i ndicate that an interpreter is needed / was used? Because our current technology only allows for indicators at the case level (not by each event or party), indicate that an interpreter is need ed based on the first request or indication that you received that an interpreter will be needed for the court proceeding for any party in interest. Indicate that an interpreter was used at the first court proceeding in which an interpreter was used for any party in interest. Who should set the in terpreter indicators? Any person with update capability to the data systems that currently have the interpreter indicators (eCITATION, NCAWARE, ACIS, CCIS-CC, CCIS-DA, VCAP, JWise) should set the interpreter language needed indicator at the time of the first request or indication received that an interpreter will be needed for the court proceeding for any party in interest. Any person with update capability to the data systems that currently have the interpreter indicators (eCITATION, NCAWARE, reter used indicator at the first court proceeding in which an i nterpreter was used for any party in interest. Do the indicators also ap ply to services for the d eaf and hard of hearing? Yes. If interpreting services will be needed for some one who is deaf or hard of hearing, indicate that by selecting American Sign Language (ASE) or by sele cting Other and indicate th e language accommodation that will be needed. If interpreting services or acc ommodations were provided to someone who is deaf or hard of hearing during a court proceeding, indicate that an interpreter was used.
