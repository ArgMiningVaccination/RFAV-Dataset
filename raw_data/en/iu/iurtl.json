What is the strength of Energy/Spiritual Healing? Energy healing allows us to tap into resources that we had ignored. That's why sometimes people refer it as miracle work. Spiritual healing re-align you to true happiness which is the prerequisite of balance and health. Many people make the mistake of associating things that doesn't make senses to things that is irrelevant. The level of relevance and your comfort level toward certain idea are two independent parameters. Of course, if you are not comfortable with an idea, you probably won't wield it very well. And here comes another misconception. When one cannot use a resource, it doesn't mean nobody else can. For example, majority of people live in a reality that time travels linearly forward. When you allow otherwise, you opened up new possibility to change the past at this moment. I have applied such technique to help people transform from past trauma that leads to current illness/symptom. If you are suffering in a condition that you see no cure, I encourage you contact me ( [here](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#91f2f9f0ffbff9f4f0fdf8fff6d1f6fcf0f8fdbff2fefcaec2e4f3fbf4f2e5acd0e2fab4a3a1f0b4a3a1e0e4f4e2e5f8feff)) to find out if there is another angle where new possibility may be beneficial. Other Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture specific FAQs What is Acupuncture therapy? Acupuncture is a centuries-old therapy. Developed as a means to restore the natural balance of body energy. It promote healing and good health. By inserting fine, slender needles and applying heat or physical stimulation at very precise \"acupoints\", the [Acupuncturist](https://thechanhealingcentre.ca/about-me-being-an-acupuncturist/) is able to adjust the body's vital energy flow (referred to as chi) within pathways known as \"meridians and channels\". By adjusting the flow of energy to areas that have been either blocked or over-stimulated, it heals your body. How does it work? There are two explanations for this question. The classical Chinese explanation and the modern scientific explanation. In the traditional model, ancient Chinese believe we are a micro-universe. The natural rhythm of the universe defined balance within us temporally and spatially. The substances/idea that connecting such two domain is called Qi. And sickness are simply the body losing its balance. Or Qi not moving the way suppose to be. Qi moves resemblance to a tornado. Its force expand outward reaching the body surface forming [acupuncture](https://thechanhealingcentre.ca/) channels and points. One can also practically define them as spots where external force can interact with this ever twirling Qi of body. When a person is sick, a skilled therapist can facilitate healing by tidy up the flow of Qi. By placing needles at the acu points, the [acupuncturist](https://thechanhealingcentre.ca/about-me-being-an-acupuncturist/) is able to accelerate or slow down the flow of energy. As a result, balance can be restored and healing happens according to our design. The modern scientific explanation is less poetic. It works great because acupuncture needles can stimulates the nervous system. It also trigger release of chemicals into the brain, spinal cord and muscles. These chemicals change our experience of pain or influence the body's own internal regulating system. The improved blood flow and biochemical balance restores equilibrium. What can Acupuncture therapy help with? The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/en/) recognizes [Acupuncture](https://thechanhealingcentre.ca/) treatment in a wide range of health concerns, including: - Muscular and neurological disorders: headaches, facial tics, neck pain, rib neuritis, frozen shoulder, tennis elbow, various forms of tendonitis, low back pain, sciatica, osteoarthritis. - Respiratory disorders: Sinusitis, sore throat, bronchitis, asthma, chest disorders: gastritis, and hyper-acidity, spastic colon, constipation, diarrhea, colitis. - Urinary, menstrual, and reproductive concerns: bladder and kidney problems, menopause, PMS, infertility.

Acupuncture needles are very thin and solid and are made from stainless steel. In contrast to hypodermic needles which are hollow with sharp edges, the point of such needle is smooth and therefore insertion through the skin is not as painful as injections or the taking of blood samples. The risk of bruising and skin irritation is also much less than when using a hollow needle. In addition, because only disposable needles are used, there is no risk of infection from needling. Will Acupuncture treatment hurt? People experience [Acupuncture](https://thechanhealingcentre.ca/) needling differently. The design of needle makes the insertion pretty much painless. However, as the needle interreacting with the body's energy flow, most people will feel sore or heavy at the needling site like its been press really hard by a masseur. How many treatments will I need? The number of treatments required to restore balance differs from person to person. For complex or long-standing conditions, one or two treatments a week for several months may be recommended. In case of acute issues, usually fewer visits are required. For health maintenance, one session a month may be all that is necessary. During your initial consultation, a recommended treatment schedule will be provided based on your individual needs.

It is also possible for you to experience changes in appetite, sleep, bowel or urination patterns, or emotional state. These should not cause concern. They are indications that your body is making adjustments. What is Auricular therapy? Auricular therapy balance the body just like regular [acupuncture](https://thechanhealingcentre.ca/).

Auricular therapy is effective treatment of a number of disorders. What is Cupping? Cupping is an ancient Chinese therapy which dates back to the fourth century herbalist Ge Hong. Traditionally, we warmed round glass cups are with a flame to create a vacuum. We quickly place this vacuum on the skin. The vacuum sucks the skin (mildly) into the jar. This gets both the Chi and blood in the area moving. Thus relieve congestion and improve circulation. Depending on the condition, cups can be left on for anywhere from 5-10 minutes. Another common technique used is sliding cupping. Oil is applied to the skin prior to cupping. The therapist will slide the cup slowly along the affected area or meridian. The massaging effect of cupping has a number of positive effects. 1. allowing tissues to release toxins; 2. activating the lymphatic system; 3, clearing colon blockages; 4. stimulating venous return, arteries and capillaries; and 5. increase circulation of the skin to improve the appearance of scars and blemishes. It is also known that cupping provide a very good deep tissue massage. What is Moxibustion? Moxibustion is a TCM therapy using moxa (mugwort).

The word Reiki (pronounced Ray-key) is a Japanese term for universal life-force energy. The practice of Reiki is a light-touch, energy based therapy that originated in Japan in 1922 whose purpose is to re-establish the normal energy flow of chi (the life-force energy) throughout the system, which in turn can enhance and accelerate the body's natural healing abilities. Through a series of hand positions either directly on or just above the body, the therapist or \"energy worker\" allows for the flow of energy through their own body so that the client's body may draw off from that the amount of energy that is required to restore balance. Many individuals report feeling cold, pulsating heat, or a tingling sensation during a Reiki session and most enter into a calm, relaxed state. Although Reiki is experienced differently by each person, many patients with chronic pain, allergies and other persistent ailments report that their symptoms are diminished or disappear altogether as a result of the therapy. Reiki works in conjunction with other medical or therapeutic techniques to promote wellbeing. What is Chinese Herbal Medicine? Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) is one of the greatest herbal systems in the world. It has an unbroken tradition going back to the 3rd Century B.C. Throughout its history, CHM has continually developed in response to changing conditions and been sustained by research into every aspect of its use. This process continues with the development of modern medical diagnostic techniques and knowledge. CHM is different from pharmaceutical drugs for three ways. Firstly, since the complexity of a plant materials is far more balanced comparing to its isolated active ingredients, it is far less likely to cause unwanted side effects. Secondly, because herbs are typically prescribed in combination, the different components of a formula balance each other and work together to increase the treatment safety and effectiveness. Thirdly, herbal medicine seeks primarily to correct internal imbalances rather than to treat symptoms alone, an approach that supports the body's self healing abilities. In China today, CHM it is not considered to be an alternative therapy, but is used in state hospitals alongside other medical treatments. Although CHM is a complete medical system that is capable of treating disease in all of its forms, the traditional view of CHM places great importance on enhancing wellness and preventing disease before it occurs. Are Chinese Herbs Safe? CHM has been used as a frontline medicine by the majority of the world's population since before recorded history and is still the most widely utilized medical system in the world today. Adverse reactions to Chinese herbs are extremely rare and are negligible when compared to those that can be produced by pharmaceutical drugs. What can I expect from my first appointment?
