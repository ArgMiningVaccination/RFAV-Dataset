ADDRESS The Honorable Doug Burgum Governor of North Dakota December 5, 201 8 Good morning. It is my honor to be here today to present the Executive Budget for the 2019- 2021 biennium. Let me begin by welcoming the members of the 66th Legislative Assembly, Justices of the Supreme Court, Lieutenant Governor Brent Sanford, elected officials, cabinet leaders, state team members, First Lady Kathryn Helgaas Burgum and fellow North Dakotans. As we speak, in Washington, D.C. , leaders and citizens are gathered to celebrate the life of P resident George H .W. Bush, a dedicated public servant , decorated World War II Navy pilot and true American statesman. In honor of his life and legacy, I ask that we join together in a moment of silence. [Pause] Thank you. We are especially grateful for, and humbled by, the front- line member s of Team North Dakota who dedicate themselves to deliver ing on our administration's purpose: to Empower People, Improve Lives and Inspire Success. Serving the citizens of North Dakota is an honor for all of us. We are grateful for our co mmitted legislat ors, who return here to the important work of creating laws and setting budgets. And we extend gratitude to the leadership and analysts in the Office of Management and Budg et, cabinet leaders and team , Governor's Office policy team and all state agencies for their efforts in preparing this budget. This budget also expresses our gratitude for those who make North Dakota a great place to live : educators, first responders and law enforcement , public servants, business lead ers, health care providers, farmers and ranchers, energy workers , our youth - and especially our veterans and active duty military service members, including those North Dakota National Guard members who are currently deployed around the world defending our freedoms. I would ask that any active or retired military personnel please stand and be recognized. [Applause] Our budget includes several proposals that reflect the gratitude we have for our military service members: First, to honor their service, promote workforce participation in North Dakota after retirement, and to improve our competitiveness for federal military investments, we propose a 100 percent state income tax exemption on military retirement pay for members of the U.S. Armed Forces, National Guard, and Reserve . Second, we recommend fully funding our National G uard Tu ition Assistance Program. Our G uard members are investing in the protection of our state and nation, an d we will invest in them. Finally, we are proposing $15 million be dedicated to expanding our National Guard training range at Camp Grafton South . This investment will create long -term savings by keep ing our troops training in -state, generate revenue by bring ing in out -of-state service members , and ensure readiness for all soldiers who stand in harm's way for us. STRUCTURALLY BALANCED, SPENDING RESPONSIBLY From 2009 to 2014, our gross domestic product outpaced the rest of the nation as we grew at an unprecedented rate of 13 percent per year. From 2014 to 2016 we saw a significant decline in GDP , but in 2017 North Dakota's GDP returned to growth . The collapse of commodity prices in both energy and agricultur e last biennium meant ma king hard choices. W orking together with the Legislature, we reduced the general fund budget by an unprecedented $1.7 billion. This did not come easily. Team members absorbed the work of others and went without pay increases. Programs ran lean. We got by, using one-t ime funding sources and transfers to balance revenues with expenditures. We recognize volatility creates challenges for our budget. Typically, over 40 percent of our general fund comes from sales taxes. When the commodity markets dropped , we found economic activity that drives sales tax revenue also dropped , reinforcing the need to budget conservatively . Thankfully, prior legislative bodies had the foresight to set aside substantial rainy- day savings t o help us through periods of extreme volatility of our tax revenues . The Budget Stabilization Fund was most recently utilized in the 2015- 2017 biennium , and it was drained at the beginning of the current biennium. This executive budget is more transparent in the use of oil revenues to fund ongoing expenses. In past budgets , oil-derived revenue has been transferred into the general fund without fully recognizing its source. Bypassing these transfers will provide a clearer picture. We propo se using $1 billion in oil tax revenues to directly support general fund expenditures. This amount represents 20 percent of general fund revenues, which is a lower amount and percentage than the 2015 -17 biennium , when over $1.1 billion in oil revenue was used. The $1 billion of general fund oil tax revenue is a conservative and sustainable amount; when price s crash ed during the 2015 -17 biennium, the state still collected $2.9 billion in oil tax revenue. For the upcoming biennium, this recommended oil tax revenue for the general fund represents approximately one -fifth of forecasted oil tax revenues. Working as one, we engaged in reinventing our budgeting approach to include a c omprehensive strategy review process. Under this new framework, strategy drove budget, v ersus budget driving strategy. Beginning last spring we conducted 57 strategy reviews with institutions and agencies , and from this foundation we have prepared a strategic budget that delivers for the people of North Dakota. Taking a critical look at prioritizing state expenditures, we called for base budget reductions of 5 to 10 percent, depending on agency size. We also asked agencies to reduce FTE levels by 5 percent. Agencies were asked to identify work they could stop doing, to free up people and financial resources that could be reinvested in priorities. These are difficult tradeoffs . But the i deas generated in these sessions identified more than $107 million in general fund savings, and $101 million was strategically prioritized for new and ongoing initiatives. This budget balances ongoing revenues and expenses and builds our reserves, while strategically investing in our economy, our workforce and the well -being of our people. The budget promotes responsible stewardship of our financial resources, encourages innovation and invests strategically - all without raising taxes. This biennium, we must return to matching ongoing spending with ongoing revenues to achieve structural balance in the general fund . By law, we must have a balanced budget . However , ongoing revenues have not always covered ongoing expenses . In this budget, we are intentional about ensuring that ongoing expenses match our ongoing revenues. The last two bienni ums had substantial general fund revenue shortfalls that were covered by transfers. This imbalance between our ongoing general fund revenues and expenses negatively affects our state 's bond rating , which can have secondary effects on the many local political subdivisions that bond. North Dakotans balance their checking accounts - so too should state government. The Executive Budget proposes $14.3 billion in overall revenues and expenditures . This includes $4.6 billion in ongoing general fund revenue and $300 million of Legacy Fund earnings . Legacy earnings by law must be deposited in the general fund. Not a single dollar of L egacy Fund principal is spent in this budget. Additionally, $3.7 billion in federal funds and $5.6 billion in special funds make up the remainder of our overall funding sources . O verall, expenditures of $3.2 billion will support Team North Dakota through salary and benefit investments , $2.6 billion will fund operating expenses, and nearly half - $7 billion - will be distributed through formulas and grants to areas such as K -12 education, Medicaid and essential infrastructure, directly benefit ing citizens and political subdivisions. The remaining $1.5 billion allows for significant and game -changing , long -term investments in capital assets. In sum, nearly 70 percent of our total budget goes to support health an d human services and education. Within the general fund, these services make up near ly 80 percent of the recommended appropriation. Most of the $330 million recommended increase in ongoing general fund expenditures is related to education and health and human services. $135 million of the increase is driven by the cost -to-continue in caring for our most vulnerable citizens. $104 million is a direct result of increased per -pupil payments and an increase in the number of K -12 students we serve . And $78 million of the increase in ongoing expenditures is the general fund portion of the overall $180 million in proposed salary and benefit increases. Our goal was to fund our priorities in a responsible way , replenish reserves and spend less than our ongoing revenues. Again, w e have done that in this budget, without raising taxes . BUILDING RESERVES AND SOLVENCY Fiscal responsibility means more than just balancing the checkbook. Given our revenues remain largely dependent on commodity prices we cannot control, we absolutely must replenish reserves . Thanks to the wisdom of prior legislative action to create a framework for savings, any amount in excess of $65 million in the general fund ending balance is automatically deposited into the Budget Stabilization Fund. The new revenue forecast projects the Budget Stabilization Fund will receive an additional $312 million at the end of this biennium. This budget transfer s $315 million from the Strategic Investment and Improvements Fund (SIIF) , filling the rainy -day fund to the maximum allowed, which is 15 percent of the proposed general fund spending. As we just saw last biennium , extreme revenue volatility consumed our entire rainy -day fund . A fully replenished rainy- day fund is essential for risk management. And it is a safeguard for our citizens who rely on us for essential services. We have made a solemn contract with every retired state team member and all future retirees who participate in our state pension. And today, we face an unfunded pension liabilit y estimated at over $1 billion. To guarantee that our pension fund can continue to cover its future obligations to retired team members who paid into it for years, we propose an infusion of $265 million from SIIF into the pension fund. This significant addition of principal now will earn returns over the coming decades , enabl ing positive progress to close our $1 b illion unfunded liability gap. With this transfer and the adoption of corresponding policies recommended by the interim E mployee B enefits Programs Committee, the pension can ach ieve solven cy and be fully funded in only 18 years. The current insolvency in our pension fund has a negative effect not only on the state's financial position, but also on the financial position of all political subdivisions that participate in the NDPE RS retirement plan. Bond ratings are negatively affected, and the cost of borrowing is increased at all levels of government. If we fail to act now , future action will cost far more . The longer we wait, the more expensive it will get. We are at an ideal moment in time, with revenue forecasts positive, and spending restrained, to make a historic investment now in shoring up the pension t o save North Dakota taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in the future. North Dakotans deserve both a structurally balanced budget and a government responsive to their needs, prioritizing innovation and reinvention . INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND REALIGNMENT Last session the Legislature set the framework for redesigning social and human services to better serve citizen s. Our proposed budget delivers on the goals of that framework and sustains the permanent pr operty tax relief it provides. We propose moving from 47 independent delivery areas to no more than 19 collaborative areas. We will make this move while preserving all access points to services . We also propose funding county social services at a level of $182 million, an increase of $22 million. This additional funding will focus on increasing access to child and family services, particularly in behavioral health. Combined with specific policy recommendations, this funding will come with greater flexibility to specialize services, thereby increasing efficiency. The state must incorporate innovative technologies to better serve our citizens. We must do a better job of safeguarding citizens' personal information and deploying new technology to enhance citizen experience and government performance. In this, we propose two changes to our information technology approaches. First, with IT unification, we recommend aligning 145 FTEs from 17 cabinet agencies into one shared IT service, while maintaining their physical presence within the agencies, reducing redundancy and streamlining operations through standardization. Cyber threats to our state's financial assets and citizens ' data are growing daily. A ttempted disruptions from hacktivists, organized criminal activity like ransomware and persistent attacks from foreign nation states are the new status quo for states, university systems and large municipalities. It is nearly impossible and full of risk for the over 400 organizations that touch our statewide network to each separately be responsible for their own cybersecurity. We will centralize our approach to cybersecurity to be more coordinated, intelligent and eff ective in managing identities and protecting data. This approach will take us from 22 percent of the executive branch managed under central cyber defense to 78 percent. Getting there will require an investment of $16.4 million . Even one breach or financial attack could cost us far more. In today's world, this is a necessary and essential investment. Across every department, we explored realigning functions and improving services. A few more examples : The Office of Management and Budget proposes a statewide litigation pool to provide efficiency and coordination and reduce duplication in funding for unforeseen legal costs. The Suicide Prevention Program , currently housed in the Health Department, will transfer to the Department of Human Services , where it w ill complement the e xisting Behavioral Health Division . To better support tribal social services, we propose $2.9 m illion of general funds to expand access to supports for caregivers of children in the care of tribal social services. This prop osal will ensure families of children on tribal lands have access to the same supports received by families with children who live in other parts of the state, creating a consistent policy statewide. INVESTING IN TEAM MEMBERS This budget authorizes 15, 673 FTEs, which includes higher education. We will spend $3.2 billion on compensation and benefits. In the current biennium, the state invested $45 million to cover the full cost of the increase in health care insurance for all team members. We are proposing a $180 million investment increase in compensation and benefits for team members for the upcoming biennium. Of the increase, $112 million is proposed for salaries. This recommended increase in compensation also authorizes performance -based increases for high -performing team members. Agency and institution salary budgets are increased by 4 percent for the first year of the biennium and an additional 2 percent for the second year. Agencies that can identify long- term salary savi ngs equal to 2 percent will be authorized to provide an additional 2 percent for salary increases in the second year, bringing the total authorized salary increase to 4 percent each year. For health insurance, the state is covering a 12.7 percent increase in health insurance premiums at a cost of $5 9 million. We also propose new health insurance options for team members . Option 1 continues the existing main plan with no changes to deductibles or coinsurance , which will require an employee contribution of $28 per month. Option 2 is a new state- paid health insurance plan that, as a non-g randfathered plan, offers expanded benefits . Option 3 is the existing high - deductible plan with new incentives for participation. Finally, we propose increasing both state and team member contribution s to the retirement fund by 1 percent, or roughly $9 million. This match increase will also contribute to the long -term solvency of our pension plan. Altogether, this represents a $180 million increase in the total compensation package, investing in Team ND. These investments are essential for us to attract and retain the talent we need to deliver the services North Dakotans expect. WORKFORCE AND EDUCATION Building workforce is the key pillar of the Main Street Initiative. We have met with 45 co mmunities across the state as part of the Main Street Initiative, and there is growing awareness that economic development is no longer just about job creation; it is about building healthy, vibrant communities that can attract and retain the families to fill their workforce needs. We revitalized the 32 -member Workforce Development Council and commissioned a statewide survey to identify obstacles to filling the estimated 30,000 jobs open across North Dakota. Workforce shortages are the number one gating factor to economic growth in North Dakota. A number of the Council 's recommendations are included in our budge t. We propose investing $30 million in a competitive grant for c areer academies , requiring a 1- to-1 match from the private sector or political subdivisions. According to the North Dakota Workforce Survey, over 70 percent of available jobs in North Dakota require an associate degree or less. Career academies can help move North Dakota youth into the workforce and lower the cost of college. With an enrollment of nearly 1,400 students, the Bismarck Career Academy is a successful example of providing quality education in high - wage, high -demand technical careers that align with post -secondary education. We need more career academies across our state. We also recommend investing an additional $2 million into workforce development initiatives, including $950,000 to refocus the Operation Intern program to support local businesses throughout the state. The budget dedicates $750,000 to address the nursing shortage by providing matching grant funds for rural heal th facilities seeking to add rural health care education in their local communities. Another $250,000 will be allocated for grants to support giving students early exposure to North Dakota careers. Finally, we propose $3 million in marketing to address t he talent attraction and retention challenges throughout the state. With around 7,500 high school graduates a year in North Dakota and more than 30,000 open jobs, we must both retain and attract workers by promoting our high quality of life. Workforce and education go hand in hand as we prepare today's students for tomorrow's economy. Forty -six percent of our general fund budget goes to K -12 education and higher education, underscoring our state's commitment to its students and our collective f uture. At the K -12 level, o ur budget increases the per -student payments by 2 percent each year, to a record $10,036 for the 2020 -21 school year . Our recommendation also begin s to transition, over the next five years, the roughly half of our districts that are not yet on the statewide funding formula . Some schools continue to receive transition subsidy payments based on the amounts they received in 2012 -2013, creating substantial disparities between districts. School aid spending increases in our budget by $115.5 million and does so more sustainably, with $103.5 million coming from the general fund. It's time to move closer to on-time funding for our K -12 schools. We recommend a blended approach, paying districts for the first half of the year using the prior year's enrollment and the remainder of the year on their certified fall enrollment. T his timing change retains more support than full year on-time funding for districts with declining enrollment, while p roviding much needed funds to th ose districts with growing enrollment sooner. In support of our strategic initiative to transform education, our budget appropriates up to $10 million to create the Teacher Incentives for Leadership in Education (TILE ). To ensure the state intentionally invests in district initiatives aligned with student -centric instruction, a targeted pool of funds will be designated to support locally driven innovation and teacher leadership . Leadership incentives should not be confused with merit pay, which is based off past performance and is often heavily reliant on standardized test results. TIL E dollars must be invested in professional development or used to provide project -based incentives for current teachers, providing career track opportunities for teacher leaders . We will fund the TILE with unspent school aid money appropriated for the current 17-19 biennium, up to $10 million. For North Dakota to remain competitive and reach its fullest potential, we need robust and innovative institutions of higher education. As we invest in higher education and research , our budget recommends an increase of over $ 94 million to support increased staff compensation, Challenge Fund investment, targeted capital projects, online course development and competitive research opportunities . With private sector support, this increased investment will infuse a total of $220 million into higher education and research in North Dakota. The North Dakota Higher Education Challenge Fund was created in 2013 to ignite a philanthropic spirit to support North Dakota's public colleges and universities, primarily with scholarships. And it worked. Keeping w ith a 2 -to-1 match, investing $40 million of Legacy Fund earnings into the Challenge Fund will enable a total influx of $120 million into our higher education system. We also propose using $20 million in Legacy Fund earnings to invest in the Research ND grant program, which requires a 1 -to-1 private sector match. The funds may be used to conduct research, commercialize new technologies, develop new products and improve existing products and processes. In this budget, we also recommend investing $29 million in the top two priority capital building projects identified by the North Dakota University System . This strategic investment will drive both renovations of existing historic facilities and create match opportunities for new construction. Finally, we propose creating a $5 million Online Curriculum Development Grant program. This money will be provided to the University System to distribute as a competitive grant program available to campuses. Now more than ever, North Dakota institutions are competing for students with institutions across the nation and around the world. To stay competitive, we need t o invest in high -quality online curriculum development along with traditional approaches. HEALTH CARE AND HUMAN SERVICES Great schools, a strong economy and vibrant communities all rely on healthy individuals to sustain them. North Dakota has challenges in access, quality and costs of health care. As part of our investment in the health care system, w e propose a 1 percent inflationary increase in provider reimbursement in each year of the biennium. Our state also has a behavioral health crisis, which carries significant human costs and tremendous negative economic impacts. By sharing her lived experience, First Lady Kathryn is helping to eliminate the shame and stigma of the disease of addi ction and she is inspiring others to celebrate the pow er and hope of recovery. Please join me in thanking her for her courage and leadership. [Applause] The Department of Human Services and Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation have been integral in working to address the behavioral health needs of North Dakotans. In this budget, we put significant resources behind evidence -based and cost- effective programs and propose additional general fund spending of $19.1 million across the entire continuum of care: We've targeted $2.6 million to ame nd our current Medicaid program to provide community -based supports for those with behavioral health conditions. This investment will provide supports for housing, employment, education and peer support - taking a c omprehensive approach to addressing the behavioral health needs in our state. Behavioral health crisis services also would receive $4.3 million, helping to eliminate regional gaps in access and improve the quality of crisis response services statewide. These services improve outcomes and create savings by avoiding expensive emergency and psychiatric inpatient care. We have made significant progress in the current biennium by moving $7 million upstream to improve access to effective, community -based behavioral health services through the Free Through Recovery program. To continue building on that progress, our budget recommends an additional $4.5 million from the general fund to expand access to th is program, extending it beyond the criminal justice system to other individuals in our communities. We also propose investing an additional $3.1 million to expand access to the substance use disorder voucher services and supports. To help move people out of the criminal justice system and into the workforce , we propose an additional $2.6 million for expanding treatment and programming in the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. At the same time, w e will continue funding for Medicaid Expansion while streamlining the administration and reducing the fee schedule to match traditional Medicaid rates. The changes to administration and reimbursement will free up over $20 million in general funds to reinvest in access to behavioral health services. We also need to invest in home and community -based services for older adults a nd persons with physical disabilities. Our budget recommends more than $6 million in additional funding for several initiatives that will promote care close to home . As we expand access to community -based services, we're also committed to improving the qu ality of our institutional services. These act as a safety net for at -risk individuals from across our state. Now is the time to build a new Behavioral Health State Hospital and Clinic in Jamestown with $35 million from Legacy Fund earnings. This will allow us to eventually repurpose the existing State Hospital as a minimum -custody correctional facility for men. In turn, we will relocate women's prison services from New England to the Missouri River Correctional Center south of Bismarck. Together, these changes will allow for consolidation of facilities and more efficient operations . INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS North Dakota is doubly blessed with abundant natural resources of our strong agriculture and energy sectors, enabling our economic growth. This budget dedicates nearly $200 million for continued research in agriculture, oil and gas, and lignite, all key drivers of our economy. We are so fortunate in North Dakota to have the capital resources to invest in the infrastructure necessary for a prosper ous future. For critical infrastructure, we have included investments totaling nearly $1.5 billion, including: $815 million for roads, $464 million for one \"bucket\" of essential water projects under the State Water Commission , and $22 million for airport infrastructure. This total also includes $174 million for technology investments, the critical infrastructure of the 21 st century. These 24 IT projects, supporting 19 agencies, will improve public safety, citizen -government interactions and voting integrity. Affordable housing availability is a challenge in many parts of our state, and we recommend investing $20 million in the Housing Incentive Fund. This will support construction of affordable, multi- family housing, aiding our ability to develop and retain our workforce and build healthy, vibrant communities. As announced last week, we've recommended $3 million for infrastructure at Grand Sky, the nation's only UAS business park. Finally, in recognition of our number one trading partner and neighbor to the north, we propose investing $5 million in the namesake of our state, the Int ernational Peace Garden . These funds are contingent on a 1-t o-1 match from other sources , including philanthropy and/or the Province of Manitoba or the Canadian government. BUILDING A LEGACY We are also extremely grateful that the voters of North Dako ta and their representatives in the Legislative Assembly had the wisdom and foresight to create the Legacy Fund, wh ose earnings will enable and catalyze large- dollar projects that have state or nationwide impact and produce lasting value for our citizens. In addition to the exciting Legacy projects already discussed, we propose three additional Legacy projects that will generate a tremendous return on investment for the people of North Dakota . First, we have announced our recommendation for $30 million to build out a statewide infrastructure network for unmanned aircraft systems, or UAS. This tracking network would serve as an air traffic control system for UAS flying beyond visual line of sight. This investment will ensure that North Dakota re tains its first -mover advantage as America's proving ground for UAS while also supporting commercial operations including automated farming and precision agriculture. Additionally, we propose $55 million for an infrastructure revolving loan fund that pol itical subdivisions can use to fund important improvements and new projects that promote smart and efficient infrastructure in our communities, plus $25 million in additional investment in the school construction revolving loan fund. Together, these invest ments can be leveraged to drive $535 million in construction. Finally, when we think about legacy, it is hard to imagine any individual who embodies the North Dakota spirit more than President Theodore Roosevelt. To honor his life and legacy , we propose investing $50 million of Legacy Fund earnings in the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum and leveraging this investment with a 2 - to-1 private match. It is truly an incredible opportunity for North Dakota that such a presidential library do es not already exist. Theodore Roosevelt is the only president to have been awarded a Medal of Honor for his military service . He wrote more books - 42 - than any other president. And his 150,000 letters and documents surpass the writings of the prolific T homas Jefferson . And what a better place for a TR Presidential Library, than in synergy with our state's only National Park . Theodore Roosevelt National Park is the only park , out of 60 National P arks, that is named after a person. And it was Theodore Roosevelt's deep love of hunting and the outdoors that shaped our nation's conservation ethic, our nation's first wildlife sanctuaries, and our National Park system. Envisioned as a state- of-the-art tourist and educational center that will serve as a diversified economic driver for western North Dakota , the library will honor a man whose legendary character, beliefs and drive were shaped by the land and people of North Dakota , and who went on to shape our nation and its role in the world. Complimenting his profile which is literally etched in stone at Mount Rushmore, the library and museum will educate and inspire students and visitors to learn more about one of this nation's most vivid, dynamic and inspiring leader s, and his rel evance to t oday's modern world. Separately, f unding for the important ongoing digitization process at the Theodore Roosevelt Center at Dickinson State University is included in DSU's budget. Built in partnership with the National Park Service and private sector philanthropy, the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum will inspire the world to dare greatly, think boldly, live passionately and care deeply. What an incredible gift this w ould be to our nation, and what an incredible gift to future generations of North Dakotan s. Thank you for giving your full consideration to each of these Legacy projects. We should strive to set the bar high in this first class of Legacy projects, and dr eam of what they can mean to the future of state. LOOKING AHEAD Together, we stand at the cusp of a new era. T he budget process in North Dakota state government from the 1930s until about 2006 was a reflection of scarcity. North Dakota was the only state in the nation to shrink in population over those 75 years, and this left an indelible mark on our psyche. F ollowing 75 years of shrinking, we had a decade of explosive levels of growth, followed by historic bust and now some growth ag ain. We have entered a world of abundance. The world is not going to run out of food or energy. Technology, combined with free markets and the irrepressible human spirit of ingenuity, continue to solve the world's biggest challenges and transform our world. With leadership everywhere, w orking as one, being citizen -focused and bringing a growth mindset to our work, we can truly make a difference in the lives of those we serve. And w ith gratitude, humility, curiosity and courage, North Dakota can play a significant role in shaping the affairs of this planet. As the 66 th Legislative Assembly takes this strategic budget proposal forward , please know that OMB, the Governor's Office and agency leaders stand ready to work together with you toward our shared purpose - to Empower People, Improve Lives and Inspire Success - in every county and every corner of our state. Thank you, and may God bless you and the Great State of North Dakota. -### - Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic AnalysisRETURNING TO POSITIVE GDP GROWTH Chart #1N.D.

Revenues are recorded when available and measurable, and expenditures are recorded when the services or goods are received and the related liabilities are incurred. The Governor's message, statewide information, and budget detail have been consolidated in this single document. Additional detail for each agency request and recommendation, by reporting level and account code, is available online. Budget documents can be found on the Office of Management and Budget's web site at https://www.nd.gov/omb/agency/financial/state-budget. How to Use the Executive Budget Document The information in this document begins with the Governor's message. This message includes an overview of his philosophies and policies used to prepare the executive budget recommendations. The statewide information includes the following divisions: State Financial Structure Financial Summary General Fund Status Special Funds Status Authorized FTE Compensation Leases Capital Assets Technology The budget detail is organized numerically, with like agencies grouped together into major categories. The numbering of the budgets follows these categories: 100s General Government 200s Education 300s Health and Human Services 400s Regulatory 500s Public Safety 600s Agriculture, Economic Development, Extension and Research 700s Natural Resources 800s Transportation Following the sections containing each agency's budget, are schedules of optional requests, requested and recommended federal and special funding sources, a glossary, and a list of analysts assigned to each agency from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Legislative Council. The optional adjustment requests are requests for additional funding or positions, prepared by agencies whose base budget request was restricted pursuant to the Governor's budget guidelines.Budget Publications OMB prepares additional publications to supplement the information available in the executive budget document. The following publications are available on the OMB website https://www.nd.gov/omb/agency/financial/state-budget: Budget Detail Continuing Appropriations Special Fund Statements Legislative Appropriations (approved state budget) The approved state budget document is published at the conclusion of the legislative session and reflects changes made by the legislature to the Governor's proposed executive budget. Budget Process The budget process in North Dakota covers a two-year period. At the beginning of each even-numbered year (2018), the Office of Management and Budget's Fiscal Management Division releases instructions and guidelines for state agencies to use in preparing budget requests for the upcoming biennium (July 1, 2019 - June 30, 2021). After budget instructions are provided to agencies, OMB budget staff visit their assigned agencies. This provides an opportunity for the budget staff to learn about the agency's programs, functions, and budgetary needs. It is also an opportunity for agencies to ask questions or clarify how budget requests should be presented. In April, preliminary information on buildings and infrastructure is due from agencies. This information is entered into the building and infrastructure formulas, then recalculated and returned to the agencies to use in budget preparation. July 15 is the statutory deadline for agencies to submit the budget request. Extensions may be available upon written request to the Office of Management and Budget. In August, the preliminary revenue forecast for the upcoming biennium is completed. From July to October, budget meetings are held on agency budget requests. After the budget meeting, the budget analyst completes the recommendation for each agency. This is done in discussion with the director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Governor and his policy advisors. In November, the executive revenue forecast is completed and recommendations are finalized. Documentation and publications are prepared and printed. During the first week of December, the Governor presents the budget recommendations to the legislature. Following the Governor, Fiscal Management 4staff present budget details for each agency and review with legislators how to use the budget publications and budget computer system. In January of each odd-numbered year (2019), the legislature convenes for a maximum of 80 days. During this time, hearings on all appropriation requests are held by the legislative appropriation committees. Prior to adjourning, the legislature passes, and the Governor signs, the appropriation measures for the state of North Dakota. Following the legislative session, the Fiscal Management staff prepares and distributes a publication summarizing the state budget for the upcoming biennium.Once passed, the budget can be amended in one of four ways: 1. The legislature can be called into special session to adopt amendments to the budget. 2. If estimated revenues in a specific fund are insufficient to meet all legislative appropriations from the fund, the Governor can cut budgets of the departments that receive monies from that fund on a uniform percentage basis. 3. The Emergency Commission is authorized by statute to allow agencies to accept additional federal and special funds not anticipated during the budget process, and transfer funds between appropriated line items. 4. The legislature can include provisions in statute to modify appropriations should certain circumstances exist.Amending the Budget 5Budget Process Timeline Prepare budget instructions and issue to agencies Visit agenciesUpdate Bldg & Infrastructure inventories due from agencies Complete initial revenue forecastExtensions for budget request due from agencies Budget requests due from agencies Budget review meetings held with agencies Analyze budgetsComplete final revenue forecastFinalize recommendationsPresent executive budget to legislature Prepare appropriation billsLegislature conducts hearings, acts on appropriation bills.

Guidance - Provide guidance to state agencies and institutions regarding the development and administration of biennial budgets. 2. Government Efficiency and Effectiveness - Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of state government through the executive budget process. 3. Consistency in Application of Fiscal Strategies - Provide assurance that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) applies a uniform, consistent approach to fiscal strategies in analy zing budget requests and preparing the executive budget. 4. Accurate and Timely Information - Ensure accurate and timely budget information is provided to the public and state policymakers. 5. State Credit Rating - Maintain or improve the state's credit rating b y providing assurance that the state adheres to conservative policies that lead to fiscally responsible budgetary decisions in both the short and long term . Financial Planning Policies 1. Balanced Ongoing Budget - B udgeted ongoing general fund expenditures will not exceed projected ongoing general fund revenues during the biennial budget period. Ongoing expenditures are defined as recurring expenditures for salaries, operating, grants, and capital replacement. Ongoing revenues are current revenues that are expected to continue in future bienniums based on current state law. 2. Balanced Overall B udget - Budgeted general fund expenditures for both ongoing and one- time expenditures will not exceed the total of general fund revenues, transfers, and the estimated unobligated general fund beginning balance for the biennial budget period. 3. Balanced One- time Budget - One- time expenditures are those of a non-recurring or discretionary nature that are not considered part of agency base budgets, although they may be continued through multiple bienniums. One- time expenditures will be funded from either one-time or recurring revenue sources. 4. Consideration of Long -Term Impacts - All policy changes, programmatic changes, and tax changes will be analyzed considering both short and long- term impacts to the state budget. 5. Reserve Balances - Reserve balances will be maintained to ensure the state has adequate resources in the event of an economic downturn. Moneys considered as reserve funds include special funds statutorily created for that purpose as well as moneys in other funds which, subject to legislative appropriation, are available to fund general government operations. Reserve funds include: Budget stabilization fund - Pursuant to North Dakota Century Code (NDCC) Section 54- 27.2- 01, the budget stabilization fund is to maintain a balance of no more than 15 percent of current general fund appropriations. Foundation aid stabilization fund - Pursuant to Article X, Section 24 of the Constitution of North Dakota, 10 percent of oil extraction taxes are deposited into the foundation aid stabilization fund. NDCC 54-44.1- 12 provides that in the case of an allotment, funding for school aid, transportation and special education can only be allotted to the extent the allotment can be offset by transfers from the foundation aid stabilization fund. Whenever the principal balance of the foundation aid stabilization fund exceeds fifteen percent of the general fund appropriation for state aid to school districts, for the most recent ly completed biennium, any excess principal balance may be used for education- related purpos es. Strategic investment and improvements fund - The strategic investment and improvements fund receives a portion of oil and gas taxes as well as income from the sale, lease, and management of certain state- owned lands. Moneys in the fund are available for improving state infrastructure and for initiatives to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of state government, as determined by the legislature, in accordance with NDCC Section 15- 08.1- 08. General fund balance - The state budget includes an estimated end of biennium balance in the general fund to allow for variances between actual and projected revenues. This end of biennium balance, considered as a one- time revenue source, is available to fund one- time expenditures of the next budget period. Revenue Policies 1. Advisory Council on Revenue Forecast ing - An Advisory Council on Revenue Forecasting, comprised of representatives of business, industry, agriculture, banking, energy and the legislative and executive branches of government, will be formed each biennium to gather input on the state's economic condition. This input will be used to interpret or suggest modification to the tax base forecasts provided to the state through its contract with an economic forecasting firm. The Council will meet at least three times each biennium, as requested by the director of the Office of Management and Budget, to coincide with economic forecasts prepared in July/August and October/November of even numbered years and February/March of odd numbered years. 7 2. Revenue Forecasting Process a. Timeline - Forecasts for the general fund and oil and gas tax revenues will be prepared as determined necessary by the Governor and the Office of Management and Budget, or as requested by the legislative branch. At a minimum, forecasts will be prepared three times per biennium, in July/August and October/November of each even numbered year and in February/March of odd numbered years. b. General Fund - The Office of Management and Budget, in cooperation with the state Tax Department, the Advisory Council on Revenue Forecasting and a contracted economic forecasting firm, will develop a general fund revenue forecast . The forecast will provide an updated forecast for the remainder of the current biennial budget period and estimates of general fund revenues for the upcoming two biennium s. The forecast will detail general fund revenues by tax type for each period. c. Oil and Gas - The Office of Management and Budget, with input from the state Tax Department and the Advisory Council on Revenue Forecasting, will develop a forecast for the current biennial budget period and for the upcoming two biennium s for oil price, production, and state oil and gas tax revenue. The forecast will include the allocation of state oil and gas tax revenues to political subdivisions and the various state funds to which the taxes are allocated pursuant to law. d. Major Special Funds - The Office of Management and Budget, with input from the state Tax Department and various state agencies will develop revenue forecasts for major special funds. Major special funds are defined as those state special funds which are included in the budget and appropriation process and from which expenditures of $100.0 million or more are authorized per biennium. Revenue forecasts for major special funds will be updated as determined necessary by the Office of Management and Budget . e. Process Improvement - The accuracy of forecast data will be analyzed and monitored to identify shortcomings in economic models or the forecasting process in order to continually improve the accuracy of forecast data. 3. Undesignated Revenues - General tax revenues will not be dedicated for specific purposes unless required by law. All non - restricted revenues will be deposited in the general fund and appropriated through the budget process. 4. General Fund Ongoing/One -time Revenue - The Office of Management and Budget will strive to accurately identify general fund revenues as either ongoing or one- time. Ongoing revenues are current revenues that are expected to continue in future bienniums based on current state law. One- time revenues include transfers and balances carried over from the prior biennium. Ongoing revenues will be used to fund either ongoing or one- time expenditures. One- time revenues will be used to fund only one- time expenditures. 5. Current Funding Basis - Budgetary practices that balance the current budget at the expense of future budget periods will be avoided. 6. Fees - Fees will be examined on a periodic basis to determine if fees charged are adequate to cover direct costs. However, administrative and operating expenses will also be examined to increase efficiency and reduce the need to increase fees . Increases in fees and service charges will be minimized or avoided to the extent possible. 7. Tax Relief - Reductions in tax rates, as well as limitations or exemptions from the base of taxation, will be considered to the extent feasible in each biennial budget . 8. Financial Stability - The executive budget will strive to maintain a diversified, stable revenue system to protect the stat e budget from short -term fluctuations in revenue. 9. Revenue Monitoring - The Office of Management and Budget will prepare monthly reports on actual v ersus estimated general fund revenues , on both a monthly and cumulative basis , noting any variations from the forecast for each major revenue source. 10. Communication of Key Assumptions - Budget documents will include information on key financial, economic, and demographic assumptions used in the revenue forecasting process so that stakeholders and policymakers understand the basis used to develop the revenue forecast. 11. Enterprise Fund Transfers - Within the limits of statutory authority, enterprise fund revenues are available for transfer to the general fund. However, unless otherwise required by law, transfers will only be proposed to the extent they do not reduce cash levels below amounts deemed necessary to fund ongoing operations, capital replacement, infrastructure improvement projects, and to maintain adequate capital structure. Budget Development Policies 1. Base Budget Limitation - For each state agency and institution, a general fund base budget amount will be calculated considering the continuation of ongoing programs, the removal of one- time appropriations, and adjustments for the continuation of legislati vely authorized pay increases for existing staff. Each base budget request submitted to the Office of Management and Budget may not exceed the base budget limitation. 2. Optional Budget Submission - Subject to budget guidelines issued by the Office of Management and Budget each biennium, state 8agencies and institutions are not limited in amounts that can be included in the budget request. However, any amounts requested in excess of the base budget limit must be submitted and prioritized as part of the optional budget submission. 3. Budget Submission - Budget requests, both base and optional, will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget no later than July 15 of each even numbered year, except as otherwise allowed pursuant to N DCC Section 54- 44.1- 04. Exceptions to the budget submission deadline will be granted on a case- by-case basis as determined necessary by the Director of OMB in order to obtain the most current and accurate data for use in the budget. 4. Budget Development - The executive budget will be developed using multi -biennium revenue forecasts based on conservative economic assumptions. The executive budget will lay out a fiscal plan for the state, balancing current ongoing expenditures with current ongoing revenues. The budget will provide adequate funding for the continuation of ongoing state programs and new priorities established by the G overnor. 5. Budget Analysis - The budget analysis process will include a review of all existing programs, including program performance and effectiveness . Additional scrutiny will be placed upon all requests for increases in funding or staffing for existing programs. New programs or initiatives included in budget requests will be considered for inclusion in the executive budget only if they will better meet a demonstrated need of the people and businesses of North Dakota, lead to long- term efficiencies or cost savings, improve service delivery, or better meet a statutory or constitutional obligation of the state. 6. Limitation of Growth - Requests for new ongoing programs or expansions of existing ongoing programs are discouraged. For each such request, agencies are encouraged to objectively review all existing programs that can be eliminated or reduced to offset the costs of the proposed new or expanded program. Requests for new or expanded programs must be accompanied by supporting information demonstrating the need for the program. 7. Review of Existing Positions - Each agency should continually review the need for existing positions and eliminate positio ns whenever possible. Any long -term vacant positions should be removed or repurposed for a higher priority use within the agency base budget. The budget analysis process used by OMB will also include a review of the continued need for each existing position and will seek to eliminate any long- term vacant positions. 8. Compensation Philosophy - The compensation program for classified state employees will be designed to recruit, retain, and motivate a quality workforce for the purpose of providing efficient and effective services to the citizens of North Dakota. \"Compensation\" is defined as base salary and related fringe benefits. The Office of Management and Budget will develop and consistently administer the compensation program for classified state employees and ensure that state agencies adhere to the components of the state's compensation philosophy. The O ffice of M anagement and B udget 's Human Resource Management Services division will regularly conduct compensation comparisons to ensure that the state's compensation levels are competitive with relevant labor markets. 9. Continuing Appropriations - During development of the executive budget, consideration will be given to all funds available to an agency , including those subject to continuing appropriation and n ot part of the biennial legislative appropriation process. 10. Budget Reductions - In the event budget reductions are necessary due to a reduction in state revenues, reductions will not be proposed across -the-board, but will be recommended based upon program effectiveness and relative value for the state. Capital Budgeting Policies 1. Definition of C apital Assets - Capital assets are expenditures exceeding $5,000 for capital projects, extraordinary repairs, equipment, information technology (IT) equipment and software, and other capital payments such as bond payments or special assessments. 2. Definition of C apital Project - Capital projects include new construction, additions, and demolitions of buildings and infrastructure. 3. Definition of E xtraordinary R epair - Extraordinary repairs are repair, improvement, or remodeling projects to existing buildings and infrastructure that exceed the threshold of $5,000. Repairs of $5,000 or less should be budgeted in the operating line. Extraordinary repairs benefit more than one operating cycle or period and may extend the useful life of the asset. 4. Definition of E quipment Over $5,000 - Equipment over $5,000 includes all non -IT equipment in excess of $5,000. Individual items of $5,000 or less should be budgeted for and paid out of the operating line. 5. Definition of IT E quipment and S oftware Over $5,000 - IT equipment and software includes IT equipment and software development costs in excess of $5,000. Individual IT equipment items and software costs of $5,000 or less should be budgeted and paid for out of the operating line. 6. Definition of O ther C apital P ayments - Other capital payments are used to enter budgeted amounts for special assessments, bond payments, and in lieu of tax payments. The Department of Transportation and State Water Commission are also allowed to use 9this category of capital assets to budget for road projects and water projects, respectively. 7. Use of D ebt Financing - The use of debt financing will be considered by the Office of Management and Budget when beneficial to the state to spread the payment for a capital project over the useful life of the facility, when the facility will generate revenues that can be dedicated to repayment of debt incurred to construct the facility, or when necessary to bala nce current revenues and current obligations of the state. 8. Debt Financing Limitations - N DCC Section 54- 17.2- 23 limits outstanding bond payments from the general fund to no more than 2 percent of the state's sales, use, and motor vehicle excise tax collect ions. 9. Long- term P lanning - Each agency or institution with capital project needs in the upcoming bienni al budget or the two subsequent bienniums will submit capital project information for each anticipated project . However, information submitted for projects planned for the two subsequent bienniums are not considered part of any budget request and are submitted for planning purposes only. 10. Estimation of O ngoing C osts - Each agency or institution requesting funding for a capital project will include an analysis of the project 's impact on future operating costs, considering both additional costs and possible efficiencies. The analysis must include estimates for the upcoming budget biennium as well as two subsequent bienniums. The analysis must include detailed estimates by line item, funding source, and FTE. 11. Justification for C apital Projects - Each a genc y and institution requesting funding for a capital project will justify the need for each project. Justification will include evidence of the need for the project; documentation that adequate planning has been done; analysis of funding options; consideration of alternatives such as renovation, remodeling, or leasing; long- term need based on demographic changes and programmatic needs; long- term operating costs; and the cost -benefit analysis required pursuant to N DCC Section 54- 44.1- 16. 12. Capital Project Evaluation - The Office of Management and Budget will evaluate and prioritize capital project requests on the basis of external mandates, program needs, state policy direction, demographic trends, return on investment, and available funding sources. 13. Extraordinary R epairs F ormula - The Office of Management and Budget will use a building and infrastructure renewal formula to calculate an estimate of the amount that should be spent to adequately maintain buildings and infrastructure. The building formula, applied to only those buildings that will be five years old or older at the mid- year of the biennium, is: building replacement value x 2% . The infrastructure formula is: infrastructure renewal % x replacement value. The infrastructure renewal percentage is the straight line depreciation percentage over the item 's estimated useful life. 14. Extraordinary R epairs as Pool - The building and infrastructure renewal formula is not meant to reflect actual repair needs, but is used to generate a pool of dollars that can be used to address planned extraordinary repairs and unplanned emergency repairs as they arise during the biennium . 15. Facility and Infrastructure Inventory - The Office of Management and Budget will maintain an inventory of all state facilities and infrastructure, which will be used in calculating extraordinary repairs formula amounts for use in the executive budget proc ess. 1011Demographics North Dakota's current population is approximately 757,000 people, which is an all- time high. In the early 2000s, North Dakota was one of only a few states with a declining and aging population. The state began to reverse that trend in 2004, with an estimated population of about 645,000 residents. Since then, North Dakota's population has grown every year, with a total increase of more than 110,000 residents. The in-migration of adults of child-bearing age is playing a major role in the state's current population trend. In just the past 10 years, the number of births in North Dakota has steadily increased from about 8,380 to last year's birth count of 11,352. Additionally, North Dakota is becoming younger, with the state's median age dropping in 2014 to 34.9 years of age--two years younger than the median age recorded just 10 years ago. North Dakota's median age is now the 4th youngest in the nation. In 2010, North Dakota's median age ranked 24th, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. North Dakotans enjoy a high quality of life. Infant mortality rates are low and the number of fatalities from motor vehicle accidents is one of the lowest in the nation. North Dakota ranks high in the percent of public high school students who graduate. North Dakota's unemployment rate is low and the number of job openings continues to be strong. Major employers in the state include Sanford Health Systems, UND, NDSU, Altru Health System, Grand Forks Air Force Base, CHI St. Alexius, Essentia Health, Wal-Mart Stores, Fargo VA Medical Center, LM Wind Power, Microsoft Business Solutions, Noridian Healthcare Solutions, U.S. Bank Service Center, Hornbacher's Foods, Shooting Star Casino/Hotel/Event Center, Bismarck State College, American Crystal Sugar, Eventide Senior Living Communities, Wanzek Construction, Inc., and MDU Resources Group, Inc. In 2015, per capita personal income was $55,950, which is higher than the national per capita income. Economic Analysis Although North Dakota ranks second in the nation in terms of oil production, it is arguably the state with the highest economic reliance on the oil industry. Texas is the nation's number one oil producer but has an economy 30 times larger than North Dakota. North Dakota's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017 was about $52.50 billion. At the same time, Texas had a state GDP of about $1.600 trillion. The mining and oil extraction category contributed about 10.0 percent to the state GDP in North Dakota. In Texas, that percentage was about 7.0 percent. Oil prices have rebounded significantly from the 2016 lows when North Dakota producers were receiving prices below $25 per barrel. The transportation discountfor North Dakota crude has been reduced due to added pipeline capacity. The result is North Dakota producers have seen significant price increases, from an average of around $40 per barrel at the start of the 2017-19 biennium to near $70 per barrel during the spring and summer of 2018. Although prices have edged down in recent weeks, the long-term outlook remains strong for oil globally as well as here in North Dakota. North Dakota transportation discounts are expected to increase over the next biennium as pipelines reach capacity. A significant constraint for the growth of the oil industry in North Dakota is the tight labor market. Unemployment is low in North Dakota, but also low in surrounding states and across the country. Thousands of jobs remain unfilled in North Dakota and it is difficult to recruit workers to move to North Dakota as they can find a job almost anywhere based on the current state of the national economic expansion. The North Dakota agricultural industry contributed about $2.90 billion to the state GDP in 2017 and remains a critically important component of the state's economy. The agricultural economy faces challenges in terms of low commodity prices and high input costs. Raising interest rates and ongoing trade disruptions add to the uncertainty facing the industry in the near term. Fiscal Policies The basis for the operating policies of the State of North Dakota are the North Dakota Century Code and Constitution. The Office of Management and Budget publishes its Fiscal and Administrative Policies as a guide for state agencies and institutions in order to achieve basic uniformity in the application of appropriation expenditures and management principles. The Fiscal and Administrative Policies manual contains detailed procedures regarding: Payroll and miscellaneous fiscal policies Expenditure and revenue policies Purchasing policies Travel policies Fixed assets policies The policy manual is available at https://www.nd.gov/omb/agency/financial/fiscal- policies. Financial Organization The budget is a financial planning document. It is organized according to the State of North Dakota's organizational, accounting and coding structures. Revenues are organized by type and source. Expenditures are organized by agency (business unit), account codes, classifications and positions. 12Fund Structure A fund is an accounting entity with assets, liabilities, equities, revenues, and expenditures, held separately in the budget for specific activities or to accomplish defined objectives. Most funds must be legislatively appropriated in order to be utilized by agencies, while certain funds are authorized on an ongoing basis. Appropriated Funds The State of North Dakota's appropriated funds are arranged by the fund's source of revenue and fall into three main categories: general, special, and federal. The state's General Fund provides for basic governmental services and receives funding from general tax dollars, such as income, sales and oil and gas production. Special funds are dedicated funds usually earmarked for specific purposes. Certain special funds can be accessed by multiple state agencies, while others are available to only one agency. More than 200 special funds exist throughout state government. Federal funds are used to account for the funding received from the federal government in the annual appropriation process.The Financial Summary section contains an analysis of projections of how each fund will be impacted during the upcoming biennium. Presentation of special fund status statements is limited to the special funds with the largest statewide impact. The \"Federal/Special Funds\" section of this publication describes in detail all the special funds expected to be received in the 2019-21 biennium. A summary, by state agency and institution, of each fund for which the legislature has provided special fund appropriation authority is available at https://www.nd.gov/omb/agency/ financial/state-budget. Non-Appropriated Funds (Continuing Appropriations) Continuing appropriations are legislatively-authorized funds within which revenues received can be expended for the purposes defined by statute on an ongoing basis. These funds are separate from the normal state budgeting and appropriation process and are not included within the executive budget. A summary, by state agency and institution, of each fund for which the legislature has provided continuing appropriation authority is available at https://www.nd.gov/omb/agency/ financial/state-budget. 13General Fund Revenues and Economic Outlook 2017-19 Original Legislative Revenue Forecast The 2017-19 biennium began with a General Fund balance of $65.0 million, after a $32.2 million transfer to the Budget Stabilization Fund. The legislative revenue forecast provided for General Fund revenues of $4.33 billion; the original biennial General Fund appropriation was $4.31 billion, including $14.6 million in one-time appropriations. Revised Forecast The November 2018 executive revenue forecast revises the original forecast for the 2017-19 biennium based on actual collections through October 2018 and new economic assumptions for the remainder of the biennium. The November 2018 executive forecast anticipates 2017-19 biennium revenues of $4.62 billion, an increase of $692.1 million. Based on the executive revenue forecast and authorized appropriation levels, the projected June 30, 2017 ending balance is $377.2 million, before any transfers to the Budget Stabilization Fund. Estimated Oil Prices and Production The first year of the 2017-19 biennium saw North Dakota oil prices increase from $39.39 per barrel in June 2017 to $67.76 in July 2018 before dropping below $65.00 in August and September. Oversupply of oil, lower global demand and deep discounting of North Dakota oil are expected to result in prices continuing to drop, ending the biennium at $50.00 per barrel. At the same time, production has continued to increase throughout the biennium from 1.04 million barrels per day in July 2017 to a new all-time high of 1.33 million barrels per day in September 2018. Oil extraction and gross production tax collections are projected to total $4.53 billion during the 2017-19 biennium, allocated as reflected on the table at the end of this section. 2019-21 Executive Revenue Forecast Comparing the 2019-21 biennium executive forecast to the 2017-19 November revised forecast: Sales and use tax collections are expected to grow by $161.7 million, a growth rate of 0.5 percent in FY 2020 and 4.6 percent in FY 2021, reflecting a positive outlook for personal income and consumer spending in North Dakota. Motor vehicle excise tax collections are expected to increase by $10.3 million, which is a growth rate of 0.3 percent and 2.3 percent in FY 2020 and FY 2021, respectively. Individual income tax collections are expected to increase by $46.4 million, or 6.0 percent, even after the effect of the Governor's proposed income tax credit for automation and tax exemptions for military retiree pay. Automation credits are expected to decrease individual income tax collections by $3.8 million and military retiree pay exemptions are expected to total $3.0 million for the 2019-21 biennium. Corporate income tax collections are anticipated to decrease by $63.1 million, a decrease of 40.5 percent. Corporations will continue to carry forward losses realized during the oil downturn. In addition, a 'sales only' apportionment factor will be fully phased in during the 2019-21 biennium. Also included in the reduction is an estimated $1.3 million for automation credits. Federal tax changes in the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act will also reduce some corporate liabilities. $182.3 million is available in the Tax Relief Fund for a transfer to the Social Services Fund in the 2019-21 biennium. Allocations from oil and gas tax revenue collections, which were $400.0 million in the 2017-19 biennium are budgeted at $1.00 billion for the 2019-21 biennium. Transfers of interest earnings from the Legacy Fund is budgeted at $300.0 million for the 2019-21 biennium, the same as the 2017-19 biennium. Based on the executive revenue forecast and recommended appropriation levels, the projected June 30, 2019 ending balance is $63.7 million. Estimated Oil Prices and Production Oil prices are anticipated to remain low but stable in the 2019-21 biennium. The forecast assumes prices starting at $46.00 in August and increase slightly to $50.00 by the end of the first year where they will stay for the remainder of the biennium. Production is anticipated to hold even at 1.34 million barrels per day for the first year and 1.35 million barrels per day for the second year of the biennium. Oil extraction and gross production tax collections are projected to total $4.63 billion during the 2019-21 biennium, allocated as shown on the table at the end of this section. Federal Funds Federal funds represent 26.0 percent of the recommended state budget. Agencies receiving significant federal funds include the Department of Transportation, Department of Human Services, Job Service North Dakota, Department of Public Instruction and the Adjutant General. Congress sets the amount of federal funds received by states in annual appropriation sessions. The amounts that appear in the 2019-21 budget recommendations are the agencies' best estimates of what they may receive in the future. If anticipated federal funds are not forthcoming, the agencies cannot use all of their appropriation authority. If actual federal funds received exceed budget estimates, the agency can request from the Emergency Commission authority to accept and expend additional funds. The \"Federal/Special Funds\" section of this publication describes in detail the funds estimated to be received from the federal government during the 2019-21 biennium. Special Funds Special funds represent 39.0 percent of the recommended state budget. Special funds are best described as dedicated funds usually earmarked for specific 14purposes. One example is the state gas tax, earmarked for Department of Transportation functions. Agencies with significant amounts of dedicated funds include the Retirement and Investment Office, Public Employees Retirement System, and the Department of Trust Lands, which operate on interest from investments. The Bank of North Dakota and the North Dakota Mill and Elevator Association operate on their own profits. Agencies like the Information Technology Department and the Central Services Division of the Office of Management and Budget charge agencies for services provided. The Game and Fish Department spends funds received from hunting and fishing license sales. These special, dedicated funds are estimated by state agencies in their individual budget requests. The \"Federal/Special Funds\" section of this publication describes in detail the special funds expected to be received during the 2017-19 biennium. In North Dakota, appropriation measures passed by the legislature do not distinguish between federal and special funds. They are totaled together and designated as \"other\" funds or estimated income. Oil Tax Allocations Oil taxes are allocated to counties, tribes, and various state funds. Estimated allocations for the 2017-19 and 2019-21 bienniums are reflected on the table below: Biennium2019-21 Biennium Counties and Cities $ Allocations 437,886,514 444,222,069 Legacy Fund 1,226,615,997 1,254,927,345 Foundation Aid Stabilization Fund 175,762,291 185,016,202 Common Schools Trust Fund 175,762,291 185,016,202 Resources Trust 365,832,404 Renewable Energy Development Fund 3,000,000 3,000,0002017-19 Biennium2019-21 Biennium Energy Conservation Fund 200,000 1,200,000 Research Fund 10,000,000 10,000,000 Oil and Gas Impact Grant Fund 28,353,446 5,000,000 ND Outdoor Heritage Fund 10,799,177 30,219,313 Well Plugging Site Reclamation Fund 8,399,588 14,806,073 General Fund 400,000,000 1,000,000,000 Tax Relief Fund 200,000,000 200,000,000 Budget Stabilization Fund 75,000,000 0 State Disaster Fund 0 0 Energy Impact Fund 4,000,000 0 Lignite Research Fund 3,000,000 3,000,000 Strategic Investment & Improvements Fund 752,958,329 271,393,654 Total Oil and Gas Taxes $4,526,606,503 $4,627,313,221 Supplemental Appropriation Supplemental appropriations have been recommended for various agencies as noted below.

There have been no premiums assessed or payments received in this fund since 1953. Pursuant to NDCC Section 26.1-21.09, premiums must be assessed if the fund balance falls below $2.0 million. The Bonding Fund was created in 1915 and is maintained for bond coverage of public employees. The Bonding Fund is managed by the Insurance Commissioner. The amount of coverage provided to each state agency, department, industry, and institution is determined by the commissioner, based upon the amount of money and property handled and the opportunity for default. Section 26.1-21-09 provides that premiums for bond coverage are to be determined by the Insurance Commissioner but can be waived if the Bonding Fund balance is in excess of $2.0 million. Claims liabilities reflect recorded liabilities for filed claims. Actual liability is determined after a review and audit of the loss. Adjustments are made to reflect claim liabilities written off and no longer carried as a potential liability.Bonding Fund Status Statement of Earnings to Balance $6,105,914 Oil and Gas Tax Allocations $75,000,000 $75,000,000 Transfer from SIIF $315,039,140 \\4 Transfer $81,121,006 $740,509,028 $740,509,028 \\1Final revenues and expenditures per state accounting system reports dated June 30, 2015. \\2 \\3 \\4 \\5 Notes:Actual July 1, 2017 balance.

The Governor's executive recommendation includes a transfer from the strategic investment and improvements fund to bring the budget stabilization fund to its statutory cap. The Budget Stabilization Fund is a statutory fund created in 1987. Section 54-27.2-02 provides that any end of biennium balance in the General Fund in excess of $65.0 million be transferred to the Budget Stabilization Fund, subject to the provisions of Section 54-27.2-01. Pursuant to Section 54-27.2-01, the fund is limited to no more than 15.0 percent of current biennium appropriations. Any deposits or interest that would otherwise be deposited or retained in the fund must instead be deposited in the General Fund once the maximum balance is reached. Section 54-27.2-03 provides that once a General Fund allotment of at least 3.0 percent has been order, the Governor may order a transfer of up to 3.0 percent from the Budget Stabilization Fund.Estimated transfer from the General Fund for the 2017-19 biennium based on appropriations recommended for the 2019-21 biennium. Because the transfers from the general fund and the strategic investment and improvements fund will result in the Budget Stabilization Fund reaching its statutory cap, all interest accruing on the budget stabilization fund will be deposited in the general fund during the 2019-21 biennium.Budget Stabilization Fund Status Governor's Residence Fundraising 500,000 Revenue $2,999,359 (12,500) (25,000) (25,000) (25,000) Facilities Management Projects (617,544) (820,563) Facilities Management Extraordinary Repairs (1,900,000) Governor's Residence (2,942,456) (1,729,437) Administrative Expenses (59,127) (80,000) (60,000) (60,000) Income Payments to Counties (6,734) (7,000) (6,400) (7,000) Total Expenditures revenues and expenditures per state accounting system reports, dated June 30, 2017. \\2Actual July 1, 2017 balance. \\3 \\4Revised EstimateExecutive BudgetActual\\1 Based on actual revenues through October 31, 2018, and estimated revenues for the remainder of the biennium using the November 2018 executive revenue forecast.

Section 24 also provides that interest from the Foundation Aid Stabilization Fund must be transferred to the General Fund; the principal can only be spent upon order of the Governor to offset foundation aid reductions made by executive action due to a revenue shortfall. North Dakota Century Code Section 54-44.1-12 provides that in the case of an allotment, all agencies that receive monies from a fund must be allotted on a uniform basis.

Additional uses of moneys have been approved in subsequent bienniums. Revenue for the fund was originally generated through nursing facilities funding pool payments to government nursing facilities based on the difference between Medicare and Medicaid rates for nursing care. This funding stream was known as the Intergovernmental Transfer Program (IGT). The federal government passed regulations phasing out the IGT program and the final pool payment was made to the state in July 2004.

Health Insurance The recommendation for health insurance continues the state's outstanding health insurance benefits package with three options available for state employees: 1.The existing high deductible health plan with state funded contributions to a Health Savings Account (H SA). For participants with a family plan, the monthly state contribution to the HSA will be $181 per month. In addition, in order to incentivize participation in the high deductible plan during the 2019-21 biennium, the state will offer a $500 annual contribution to the employee's HSA in January 2020 and January 2021. 2.A new state paid health insurance plan that, as a non-grandfathered plan, offers expanded benefits not covered under the main plan. The new plan includeshigher deductibles and coinsurance than the current main plan but provides for a fully state paid premium of $1,398 per month. 3. The existing main plan with no changes to deductibles or coinsurance. The premium for this plan will be $1,427 per month and will require an employee contribution to the premium of approximately $28 per month. Retirement Plan Ensuring the continued financial viability of the state's defined benefit retirement plan is a state commitment to retirees and current active members, but that commitment is currently underfunded to the tune of $1.00 billion. The state must take steps to make good on this commitment. The Governor supports bill drafts recommended by the interim Employee Benefits Programs Committee to reduce the unfunded liability through eliminating the retiree health insurance credit benefit and reducing the retirement benefits multiplier for newly hired state employees. The executive budget includes funding to support a third bill draft recommended by the Employee Benefits Programs Committee to increase the state and the employee retirement contributions by 1.0 percent each, beginning January 1, 2020. In addition, to ensure the state commitment to fully fund the defined benefit retirement plan, the executive budget includes a one-time $2 65.0 million transfer from the Strategic Investment and Improvements fund to the Public Employees Retirement plan fund to address the unfunded liability. The combined effect of these changes is to move the actuarial projections for the defined benefit plan from never achieving full funding under the current framework to completely eliminating the unfunded liability by 2036. 50General Federal Special 101 Office of the Governor 163,098 64,246 19,634 246,978 246,978 24,616 338,046 317,977 0 794,465 587,411 26,450 7,104 88,010 88,010 0 0 908,852

Capital projects recommendations are based on a review and analysis of each requested capital project. Agency budget requests for capital projects include: a justification of the project, project description and specifications, funding sources, and operating and staffing costs for the upcoming and two subsequent biennia. Justification During preparation of the capital project requests, agencies are asked to justify the need for each project by considering the following questions: Is there evidence of the need for this project? Has there been adequate planning? If not, should a planning appropriation be considered? Can a third party finance or share the cost of this project? Is renovating or remodeling more cost effective? Has leasing of capital assets been considered? Can this project be postponed until the following biennium? Would this project be necessary if the size of government was reduced? If population declined? If a technological breakthrough occurred? If demand for services declined? If not, what is the likelihood any of these will happen in the next ten years? What are the operating costs over the life of this project and are they reasonable? Will the state have to pay these costs? Can the state afford to do so? Is it cost effective to spend more at the outset of the project to reduce future operating costs (e.g., through redesign of a facility)? Have all the costs relating to this project been considered? Does the total cost include construction costs, architects' fees, contingency fees, construction supervision fees, equipment, insurance and bid costs, and site acquisition? What are the economies of scale? Would a bigger facility be cheaper per unit of service? If a bigger facility is built, can part of the space be rented?NOTE: Adapted from \"Capital Budgeting and Finance: The Legislative Role,\" published by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Evaluation The Office of the Governor and the Office of Management and Budget considered external mandates, program needs, state policy direction, and available funding sources in evaluating and prioritizing capital project requests. External mandates include: Court orders. Health and life safety codes. Handicap accessibility regulations. Regulations regarding the historical significance of existing facilities. Program needs include or are influenced by: Demographic shifts. Department goals. Public convenience. Program requirements. Obsolescence of existing facilities.

The Fiscal Management Division of OMB uses a building and infrastructure renewal formula, based on industry standards, to generate an estimate of total dollars that should be spent to adequately maintain buildings and infrastructure. For large agencies with numerous facilities the formula generates a pool to be used to address extraordinary repair needs. Some buildings will not have extraordinary repair needs during the biennium; other buildings may have extraordinary repair needs that differ from the formula amount. Newer buildings will normally require fewer repairs than older buildings. The pooled resources from all buildings and infrastructure in the formula will be applied by the agency to the areas of greatest need. However, many agencies have few buildings and minimal infrastructure, limiting the flexibility provided by pooling resources. The formula driven calculations may not always reflect actual repair needs. Therefore, although the formula is used to guide agencies in requesting repair dollars, actual requests may be higher or lower than formula amounts. Extraordinary Repairs - Buildings Formulas are generally used to calculate the cost to adequately maintain buildings. The formula used by the Fiscal Management Division is based on the following premises: The formula reflects current building valuation. The formula recognizes that as a general policy, fewer resources should be directed to building renewal than the cost of building replacement. The formula recognizes that older buildings require proportionally more repair funds than do newer buildings. The formula reflects the effects of building repair projects already accomplished. The formula is applied to an entire facility system in an actuarial manner, generating a pool of funds to be used on extraordinary repairs. Building Formula The annual extraordinary repairs formula for buildings is as follows: Buildings 5 years old or older at mid-year of biennium Building Replacement Value x 2.0% = Formula Amount Buildings less than 5 years old $0Building Value Factor The North Dakota Century Code requires that all state buildings built after 1939 be insured at replacement value. The building's insured value is used as the building replacement value for the formula calculation. All state owned buildings are insured through the Fire and Tornado Fund. Building Age The building age is determined by subtracting the year a building was built or extensively renovated from 2020, the mid-year in the 2019-21 biennium. For example, if a building was built or renovated in 1973, the building age is 47 (2020-1973). Extraordinary Repairs - Infrastructure Infrastructure is defined as a structure outside of and apart from a building, but necessary to the function of the building. Examples of infrastructure include water and sewer lines, electrical lines, parking lots, sidewalks and roads. Recognizing that formulas based on building value would not provide adequate funding for infrastructure needs, the Fiscal Management Division of OMB has adopted a formula for calculating costs of extraordinary repairs to infrastructure. In some cases the value and age of infrastructure are difficult to determine; therefore, the infrastructure formula is based on the replacement value of various infrastructure components. Infrastructure Formula The annual extraordinary repairs formula for infrastructure is as follows: P X R = Formula Amount P = Infrastructure renewal percentage R = Infrastructure replacement value (per unit value X number of units) Infrastructure Renewal Percentage The infrastructure renewal percentage is the straight line depreciation over the normal life of the item. For example, the infrastructure renewal percentage for an item with a 20-year normal life is 5.0 percent. Infrastructure Replacement Value Infrastructure is valued at replacement cost. Expertise from the Facility Management Division of OMB is used to determine replacement costs and parameters applicable to the valuation of the numerous types of infrastructure. The schedule on the following pages show amounts included in the executive recommendation for each state agency with extraordinary repairs for the 2019-21 biennium. 71Extraordinary % of Extraordinary % of Building Infrastructure Total Repairs Formula Repairs Formula No. Agency Name Formula Formula Formula Requested Requested Recommended Recommended 110 Office of Management and Budget 11,067,202$ 859,712 $ 11,926,914$ 1,400,000$ 12% 1,900,000 $ 16% 180 Judicial Branch - - - 960,000 - 960,000 - 227 Bismarck State College 2,907,412 2,050,048 4,957,460 417, 411,566 12% 10% 5, 720,683 46% 5, Dakota 854,813 - 854,813 - 0% - 0% 412 140,708 140,708 - 53,545 739,659 - 0% 1,033,068 102,776 1,135,844 - 0% - 0% - 161,646 - 0% - 0% 530 Dept 10,315,057 3, 775,327 37% 1, 210,000 47% 1, 050,000 929,721 Agency Project Description Recommendation General FundFederal Funds Special FundsBond Proceeds 110 Office of Management and Budget Restore Bond Payments for 2017-19 567,125 567,125 0 0 0 125 Office of the Attorney General Restore Crime Lab Building Bond Payments 647,500 647,500 0 0 0 215 ND University System Capital Bond Payments 4,959,448 4,959,448 0 0 0 227 Bismarck State College Add 19 -21 Base Special Assessments 339,391 0 0 339,391 0 229 Williston State College Add 2019-21 Capital Payments 1,064,167 0 0 1,064,167 0 240 Mayville State University Add 2019-21 Base Special Assessments 67,648 0 0 67,648 0 242 Valley City State University Special Assessment 57,520 57,520 0 0 0 243 Dakota College at Bottineau Special Assessment for Street Project 6,772 6,772 0 0 0 301 ND Department of Health Add 2019-21 Bond Payments 428,457 367,947 60,510 0 0 Add 2019-21 Special Assessments 90,000 90,000 0 0 0 Total 518,457 457,947 60,510 0 0 303 Department of Environmental QualityAdd 2019-21 Bond Payments 216,429 93,691 122,738 0 0 313 Veterans Home Bond & Interest 405,733 0 0 405,733 0 380 Job Service North Dakota Capital Payments 20,000 0 20,000 0 0 530 Department of Corrections and RehabilitationDOCR 2019-21 Bond Payments 705,479 689,299 0 16,180 0 540 Office of the Adjutant General Special Assessments & Payment in lieu 224,046 224,046 0 0 0 628 Branch Research Centers Add 2019-21 CGREC Capital Bond Payment 48,136 48,136 0 0 0 Add 2019-21 NCREC Capital Bond Payment 78,433 78,433 0 0 0 Total 126,569 126,569 0 0 0 640 NDSU Main Research Center Capital Bond Payments 19-21 356,769 356,769 0 0 0 701 Historical Society Add 19-21 Base Budget Bond Payment Amount1,144,542 1,144,542 0 0 0 73Other Capital Payments Biennuium: 2019-2021 Agency Project Description Recommendation General FundFederal Funds Special FundsBond Proceeds 720 Game and Fish Department Fisheries 268,329 0 134,165 134,164 0 In Lieu of Taxes 1,037,250 345,750 0 Total 1,651,329 0 1,171,415 479,914 0 750 Parks and Recreation Department Add 2019-21 Bond Payment 66,875 66,875 0 0 0 770 Water NAWS & SWPP 112,996,308 0 30,000,000 82,996,308 0 801 Department of Transportation Capital Bond Payments 1,013,189 0 0 1,013,189 0 Other Capital Payments 814,062,094 0 588,630,451 225,431,643 0 Total 815,075,283 941,217,390 9,398,103 620,005,114 311,814,173 0 74Financing The executive recommendation for capital assets expenditures during the 2019-21 biennium is $1.511 billion.

Debt Affordability North Dakota remains a low-debt state. The following chart compares North Dakota debt to the United States mean debt: Debt Affordability Criteria United States Mean North Dakota 2016 per capita debt $1,477 $133 2016 debt to personal income 2.9% 0.2% Debt Obligations and Limits NDCC 54-17.2-23 limits the amount of bond payments to be paid from the state's general fund. The amount \"may not exceed the amount equal to a portion of the sales, use, and motor vehicle excise tax collections equal to 10.0 percent of an amount, determined by multiplying the quotient of 1.0 percent divided by the general sales tax rate that was in effect when the taxes were collected, times the net sales, use, and motor vehicle excise tax collections.\" The general sales tax rate is currently 5.0 percent. Consequently, the state building authority lease payment limitation can be calculated as follows: 10.0% x 1.0%/5.0% x Net Sales Tax Collections = General Fund Payment LimitationCurrent debt obligations of the general fund and maximum legal debt limits are reflected below. Current debt obligations are within the legal limit.

Agency Description Dickinson Research Extension Center (DREC) The NDSU Dickinson Research Extension Center has an established record of service to the people in the 13-county region south and west of the Missouri River. The DREC operates 6,506 acres of owned land within the region as well as annual land leases needed to accommodate ongoing projects. The land base provides opportunities for a broad perspective in evaluating various agricultural systems that can serve as engines for economic development. This is a continuation of what has taken place for over 100 years. Currently, the DREC assists agricultural producers in solving production problems with agronomy, animal science and range science, while integrating new developments. Five major areas are served: agronomy, beef management, bio-security, range management, and sustainable agricultural practices. Faculty and staff are committed to engaging people of the region and to the identification of current economic opportunities, while sustaining natural resources for future generations as directed by the mission statement and Advisory Board. Research data and producer ideas are continually considered so the DREC can leverage the latest knowledge to best benefit the people of North Dakota. Central Grasslands Research Extension Center (CGREC) The CGREC conducts research for the Coteau region of North Dakota, an area bounded by the Missouri River on the west and the James River on the east and extends from Divide and Burke counties in northwestern North Dakota in a southeasterly direction through Dickey County. Research objectives must increase the range-carrying capacity of native range emphasizing conservation and preservation, stabilize grass production to compensate for the vagaries of the weather and precipitation as it influences forage production in the dryland agriculture, identify the impact of different management systems upon beef production in the central region and explore the increased use of crop residues and byproducts for the maintenance of the cow herd. CGREC's primary focus is management of grassland acreage which occupies about one-third of the agricultural land in the state and aims to improve production and increase returns to cattle producers. Hettinger Research Extension Center (HREC) The HREC is a semi-arid site located in southwest North Dakota, providing the most southerly NDSU location in the non-glaciated portion of North Dakota as a site for its agronomy research program. The HREC also is located at the center of the North Dakota sheep industry, the focus of one of its animal research programs, and in an area of rapidly growing livestock feeding ventures, another focus of animalresearch at the HREC. Additionally, the HREC is located in a region where much of the land base is in the Conservation Reserve Program, which has resulted in additional research evaluating potential changes in the CRP program and how these changes may affect upland native and game bird populations. A new research program evaluating low-cost rangeland monitoring strategies on U.S. Forest Service lands and wildlife/livestock interactions has resulted in a significant increase in the quantity of rangeland research conducted at the HREC throughout the western Dakotas. Research at HREC involves the disciplines of animal science, range science, wildlife science, agronomy, and agri-business and applied economics. Collaboration is with Main Station scientists, Branch Station scientists, U.S. Forest Service, grazing associations, university scientists from WY, SD, and MT, and USDA research entities in these research disciplines to improve productivity of livestock, grazing, and cropping systems, and to improve economic development of the region. Langdon Research Extension Center (LREC) The Langdon Research Extension Center (LREC) is located one mile east of Langdon on US highway five. The agricultural land base at the station consists of 549 owned acres and an additional 206 acres under lease agreement. The LREC serves a nine-county region located in northeast North Dakota and has North Dakota's highest precipitation rates, coolest temperatures, and richest productive soils. The climate supports diverse crop production and recurring disease problems. The LREC has a strong tradition of assisting the region's producers to meet agricultural production challenges throughout the course of its existence since 1909. In 1993, the LREC redirected much of its research programming to focus on the significant increase of disease and insect pressure associated with its climate. This redirected applied research programming has provided producers with information regarding disease minimizing cultural farming practices and trusted information regarding chemical applications and other inputs that minimize disease and insect pressures that give growers the best return on investment. Recently, the LREC has significantly enhanced its overall agricultural research programming with an increase in the foundation seed stocks program, the addition of a crop protection scientist, farm business management instructor, Extension specialist in agronomy and an Extension specialist in soil health. New infrastructure additions in the past 12 years include a full service agricultural based learning center/headquarters building constructed in 2004, agronomy/pathology laboratory in 2015 and a 25 acre field tiling project completed in 2014.
