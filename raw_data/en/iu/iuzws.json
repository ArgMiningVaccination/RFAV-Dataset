WHO identified a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in a patient's throat swab on January 7, 2020, and were no known about the treatment for the illness, on January 30, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a public health emergency. Due to the lack of a vaccine and effective treatment, the global pandemic COVID-19, which affected 189 countries and territories, is to blame for 1,204,355 fatalities and more than 46,762,710 confirmed cases as of November 1, 2020. There are three main stages to COVID- 19 disease, and they are as follows: stage I, a time of incubation during which a virus may or may not be detected; Level III is characterized by significant respiratory symptoms and a high viral load. Stage II is a stage of virus presence but without severe symptoms. Simple procedures are commonly ignored throughout therapy, even though a two-phase approach with the first immune defense-based protection phase and the second inflammation-driven harm phase can be promising. However, in order to address the pandemic issue as quickly as possible, it is necessary to use all available resources. The extraction of medicinal plants stimulates or strengthens the human immune system, which is helpful in the battle against coronavirus. But the lack of knowledge about medicinal herbs among researchers and medical professionals is aiding the growth of this illness (Wang et Role of herbal medicines in the treatment and management of corona disease Madan Mohan Malaviya University Institute of Medical Sciences, COVID-19 virus was originally identied in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. Since then, it has spread to over 210 countries and territories. A virus called COVID-19, often known as SARS-CoV-2, causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. Patients who have COVID-19 infection and are exhibiting flu-like symptoms, such as a dry cough, sore throat, high temperature, and breathing problems.Depending on the patient's conditions and symptoms, a variety of antiviral medications and their combined dose form with hydroxyl-chloroquine and azithromycin may be the best option to treat the patient. However, combining allopathic treatment with ayurvedic medicine may be benecial. It is urgently suggested and requested that everyone adhere to the precautionary measures, management procedures, and quarantine scrupulously without engaging in any religious discrimination, as failure to do so could result in the worst possible outcome. Additionally, it is crucial to educate our young people in science and technology so that they can, if necessary, avert similar catastrophes in the future. There is no need to panic, and eective care and prevention are crucial in the ght against this illness. This review paper included all public awareness of COVID-19 prevention, management, and treatment. The sickness, treatment, social impact on society, and prevention and management of SARS-CoV-2 are all covered in this article. Keywords: COVID-19, Treatment and management, Herbal Plants, Bioactive compounds. Immune systemReview Article Received: 3 June Scientic Research and Education Society. This is an open access article under the CC BY- 2004; Krawitz et al., 2011; Shulong et al., 2008; Singh et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2006; Yadav et al., 2021). At different regional levels, medicinal plants' natural constituents are used to treat ailments, with or without processing. The phytochemicals included in medicinal plants can be used to prevent and cure a number of viral and non- infectious illnesses. Medicinal plants make up a substantial portion of the supply of traditional medicines used by more than 80% of the world's population, which includes China, India, and many other growing and industrialised nations. To stop the COVID-19 pandemic, a vaccine must be created and effective medications must be used as treatments. This chapter aims to explain how these medicinal plants might be used in the future to treat coronavirus disease. The active component of licorice roots, glycyrrhizin, has been found to block SARS-CoV replication in vitro. The flavonoid baicalin from Radix Scutellaria showed in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV. Dialylheptanoids from the Alnus japonica bark have been found to inhibit the papain-like protease in SARS-CoV. In India, modern medicine coexists in harmony with Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Unani, and Siddha. Ayurvedic scientists have given the Indian government 10 guidelines that could boost COVID-19 immunity via a likely psychoneuroimmune mechanism. These include treating sore throats in COVID-19 patients with clove powder, inhaling steam, and utilising turmeric, coriander, and garlic. In general, Unani traditional medicine suggests using a few specific medications during epidemics to boost immunity. Therefore, adopting herbal treatments to increase COVID-19 immunity is a possibility (Gautret et al., 2020; Garg et al., 2016; Garg al., 2020;Dubey et al., 2021; Charde et al., 2011). COVID-19 in patients receiving immune modulating treatment The aforementioned pathways of infection, immune evasion, and dysregulation of innate and adaptive immunological responses are highly concerning for patients undergoing systemic immune modifying treatments, including those with malignant or systemic autoimmune/inflammatory illnesses. According to earlier coronavirus epidemics (SARS and MERS) and small observational studies in COVID-19 cohorts, male sex, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal disease, obesity, and chronic kidney disease are risk factors for poor outcomes. Old age and the presence of comorbidities (such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, etc.) are also risk factors. It is notable that neither China nor Italy discovered immune suppression or modulation to be a risk factor for a poor outcome. While this may be viewed as \"good news\" in general, immune suppression and associated immune function changes may increase patients' susceptibility to infection and perhaps lengthen the time that viruses are transmitted. Due to the connection between COVID-19 and lymphopenia, patients receiving immune-modulating medication may also be more susceptible to secondary infections, such as bacterial pneumonia. As was already indicated, several immune modulators might provide protection against viral infections. Antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may stop viral replication and tissue infection (Tolo et al., 2006). Furthermore, immunosuppressive therapies (such antimalarials, conventional as well as biologic DMARDs, and others) may prevent or treat cytokine storm disorders. Aside from the obvious negative effects, abruptly stopping immune modulating medication might increase the risk of viral infection by triggering sickness flare-ups in people with autoimmune or inflammatory illnesses, organ rejection in people who have had transplants, or the return of cancer National and international organizations, like the ACR and EULAR, caution against stopping treatment in the absence of symptoms and against altering current treatment plans unless the relevant clinical service agrees and is thoroughly overseen. International cooperation is necessary and is already taking place in order to safely assess individual risk in various patient groups who are vulnerable. Up till reliable data are available, strict clinical surveillance and social isolation should take precedence. Role of medicinal plants management of COVID-19 Piper nigrum L. Because its (Black Pepper, Kaali Mirch): dried unripe fruit is used in virtually every sort of cookery around the world, Piper nigrum L. is also known as the \"lord of spices.\" This plant also contains more than 600 different phytochemicals, each of which has unique biological benefits and therapeutic capabilities. These phytochemicals include lignans, alkaloids/amides, terpenes, and neolignans. Due to its effectiveness against viruses that cause respiratory tract infections, peppercorn and several secondary metabolites of Piper nigrum have biological effects that include antiviral, anti- inflammatory, antipyretic, antioxidant, anti-thyroid, anti- cancer, and The primary alkaloid components of this plant, piperine and 10 piperamides, have been demonstrated to have antiviral properties and may be useful phytochemicals in the fight against COVID-19, another respiratory infection. We give the structures of these antiviral compounds from Piper nigrum. Piper guineese, often known as West Black Pepper, contains several active ingredients that are essential for the internal medicine treatment of viral infections, rheumatoid www.apjonline.inAdvance Pharmaceutical Journal 2022; 7(4):128-135 129arthritis, bronchitis, and gastric et al., 2019). Ocimum sanctum (Holy Basil, Tulsi): Indian-born tulsi, often known as holy basil, is well-known for its healing properties in the Siddha and Ayurvedic medicinal systems. Numerous in-vitro and in-vivo studies on animals and people have shown it to have therapeutic promise as an antibacterial, antidiabetic, anti-carcinogenic, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, cardio-protective, immune system booster, etc. Due to its ability to heal and its capacity to treat a number of maladies, including bronchitis, pyrexia, rheumatism, asthma, skin diseases, parasite and microbial infections, gastric and hepatic issues, among others, tulsi is known as the \"Elixir of Life\" in Ayurveda. Tulsi already treats the common COVID-19 symptoms of discomfort, diarrhoea, coughing, and fever since controls Ocimum sanctum COVID-19 in this way. The most effective treatment for pneumonia is said to be tulsi. Tulasi has antiviral capabilities against both DNA viruses (including adenoviruses, hepatitis virus, and herpes viruses) and RNA viruses, according to solid scientific data (enterovirus 71, coxsackievirus CVB1). The immune system is strengthened by tulsi, which helps the body fight off potentially harmful viruses and germs. to look into Tulsi leaves' potential immunomodulatory effects. Because tulsi has so many therapeutic alternatives, we hypothesise that it could aid in the control and prevention of COVID-19. The binding affinity of seven photophilic Tulsii compounds, tulsinol A, B, C, D, E, F, and dihydrodieuginol B, with SARS CoV receptors was studied in an intriguing docking study abstract published on Social Science Research Network (SSRN, Elsevier). Because of its well-known ability to prevent SAR-CoV replication by having ACE II blocking properties, our simulated work further supports the use of Tulsi extract in our fight against COVID-19 (Zhang et al., 2020). Nigella sativa (Black Cumin, Black seed, Kalonji): Asthma, conjunctivitis, rheumatism, anorexia, gastrointestinal issues, internal haemorrhage, cough, bronchitis, fever, bronchitis, influenza, etc. are a few conditions Nigella sativa is reported to be useful in treating. The majority of black cumin's medicinal effects are mostly attributed to thymoquinone, one of the plant's most effective active phytochemicals. Only two of the fatal viruses that Nigella sativa oil and seeds have been demonstrated to be viricidal against are HIV and the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Within 10 days of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, N. sativa seed oil is reported to reduce the viral burden in a murine cytomegalovirus mouse model to undetectable levels. An rise in the blood levels of CD4+ T-cells, macrophages, and interferon, as well as by both of these factors, support this. The success of this herbal therapy in curing this significant HIV infection within a year was further supported by additional serological tests. The viral burden was significantly reduced by employing black cumin seed oil-based herbal therapy in a group study of HCV-infected people who were ineligible for IFN- /ribavirin therapy (around 50 percent exhibited significant reduction and 17 percent became seronegative) (de Wit et al., 2020). Astragalus propinquus (Astragalus): Astragalus roots are a component of several Chinese and Indian ayurvedic treatments that are successful in enhancing the immune system and fending off sickness. This plant is also popular as a natural supplement for alleviating chemotherapy side effects, stress reduction, and tumour cell elimination. Astragalus contains polysaccharides with mannose, D-glucose, xylose, larbinose that have been shown to have anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and antiviral properties. An in-vitro/in-vivo study on chickens infected with the H9N2 avian influenza virus in 2013 found that astragalus polysaccharides increase immunity and guard against viral infection (Habibzadeh et al., 2020). Cinchona officinalis (Cinchona, Quinine): The Cinchona bark is rich in quinine, an alkaloid molecule with potent antimalarial properties. Among other biological and therapeutic effects, it also has antiparasitic, antiarrhythmic, antispasmodic, antiprotozoal, cardio tonic (tones, balances, and strengthens the heart), and bitter digestive help to speed up digestive fluids. Malaria has long been treated with chloroquine, a synthetic quinine made from cinchona bark. During the 20th century, chloroquine, which is listed on the WHO list of essential medicines, was a vital component of mass drug distribution programmes to eradicate malaria. The antiviral effects of chloroquine are then examined against SARS-CoV-1, which structurally resembles the more current SARS-CoV-2. In cell culture models, a Belgian researcher discovered that chloroquine stopped SARS cells from proliferating. In 2006, scientists from Utah State University and Chinese University of Hong Kong investigated the effectiveness of several medications against a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection. They learned that chloroquine only functions as an anti- inflammatory. They suggested combining chloroquine with other drugs to stop viral replication. Then, a Belgian research team discovered that chloroquine can be given through breast milk to treat lethal viral infections caused by the human corona virus OC43, which is closely related to SARS. By raising the pH of the host cell's lysosomes, chloroquine www.apjonline.inAdvance Pharmaceutical Journal 2022; from trying to acidify the lysosome, which is crucial for the creation of autophagosomes, where a cell tries to consume itself. In a recent study involving 100 COVID-19 patients, it was found that the chloroquine-treated group outperformed the control group in terms of reducing the disease's duration, improving lung imaging results, exacerbating pneumonia, and boosting virus-negative seroconversion without causing any side effects. In this initial trial on humans, the medication was given twice daily at a dose of 500 mg. A multicenter collaboration group of the Department of Science and Technology and the Health Commission of Guangdong province published an expert consensus on February 20, 2020, recommending chloroquine phosphate tablets with a dosage of 500 mg twice daily for 10 days for patients diagnosed with mild, moderate, and severe cases of pneumonia related to SARS-CoV- 2. Chloroquine medication may boost its efficacy shorten hospital stays, and lower COVID-19-related mortality (Luo et al., 2012; Ahmad et al., et al., (Elderberry): Sambucus nigra, usually known as elderberry, is a rich purple fruit that is widely distributed throughout Western Asia and Europe. It has been in use for a long time because of its tremendous health benefits. Chemically, it contains significant amounts of lectins, terpenes, citric acid, malic acid, carbohydrates (mostly glucose and fructose), and other essential elements. Additionally, polyphenolic chemicals are abundant (anthocyanins, flavonols, and phenolic acid). Each cup of elderberries contains 106 calories. They do, however, also include a little amount of dietary fibre, folic acid, amino acids, and other minerals. They have the following nutritional values per 100 grammes: 870 mg of vitamin A, 34.10 mg of vitamin C, 391.33 mg of potassium, 28.06 mg of calcium, 1.86 mg of iron, and 217 mg of sodium make up this meal. Flavonoids are abundant in this fruit and have anti- inflammatory and antioxidant effects, shield healthy cells from the damage caused by risky free radicals. The body is better able to fight off respiratory infections like the flu and the common cold as a result of increased immune function and consequences for skin care. It is also reported to have anticancer potential, influenza action, uric acid reduction, and positive effects on blood pressure. The berries can also be used to make jam, pies, and sauces. Unripe elderberries, their leaves, bark, and seeds contain poisonous and lethal substances, such as cyanogening glycosides, which can cause vomiting, nausea, and diarrhoea if taken in their raw state. However, by correctly heating and consuming in the form of hot syrups, these adverse effects can be avoided. Elderberry blossoms and fruit can be consumed as jam, herbal tea, syrups, and juices. They are also effective at treating colds and fevers or guduchi, is one of the most flexible healing herbs. This plant is a common one found in Ayurvedic therapy. One of the best Rasayanas in the running, it astounds with its incredible versatility. It includes a wide range of biologically relevant have an impact on the body's immune system. tonic, and blood purifier properties, it also aids in digestion improvement and immune system stimulation, as well as reduces stress and anxiety, detoxifies the body. A methanol extract of Giloy was found to be effective in one study against a variety of bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, palmatine, and magnoflorine, are what provide it its protective properties against aflatoxin-induced nephrotoxicity. Their extensive beneficial benefits assist us fight off contagious illnesses by boosting our immune system. Giloy extract (juice) is often ingested orally. The following herbal cure is quite popular and works effectively to treat and prevent COVID-19. Giloy (size of one bhibdi), ginger (1/2 teaspoon), tulsi (6 leaves), and kali mirch (4-6 seeds) Use the obtained powder to make herbal tea or a beverage by mixing it with honey. It can increase immunity while lowering fever and cough (Grover et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2006; Chang et al., 2005). Azadirachta indica (Margosa, Neem): Azadirachta indica, also referred to as margosa neem, is widely distributed throughout India. Neem is useful in almost every way and can be used to treat or prevent illnesses brought on by parasites, germs, viruses, or other causes. This includes the leaves, roots, fruit, bark, oil, seeds, and about every part of the plant. Neem mostly contains phytochemicals called limonoids and terpenes. The neem tree effectively purifies 131cancerous characteristics. Because of its excellent characteristics, it is efficient against more than 200 microorganisms. The antibacterial and antifungal properties that they were said to have in Indian Ayurveda and Unani treatment were known to our forefathers in the past. While nimbidin, gedunin, and cyclic trisulfide are in care of neem's and antibacterial characteristics, respectively, sodium nimbidate, gallic acid, catechin, and polysachharides are in charge of the plant's anti-inflammatory effects. Bioactive components in neem seed oil antifungal, and antimalarial effects. Neem contains azadirachtin, which has strong insecticidal, antifeedant, and antimalarial effects that can stop the development of malarial parasites. Its antibacterial actions are also effective against some dangerous bacterial types. Dried neem leaf extract has been found to be quite effective in treating skin conditions like ringworm, eczema, and scabies. Aqueous neem leaf extract reportedly has remarkable antiviral activity against the measles, chikungunya, and vaccine viruses, according to research. Neem leaf extract was once widely used in baths to reduce the spread of chicken pox (causes due to varicella-zoster virus). A small amount of leaf has also been administered orally to kill the harmful worms inside the body. It also helps regulate blood sugar levels in the body. Despite the fact that neem extract benefits people in many ways, excessive use may impair sex by reducing sperm counts, which can result in infertility (Zhang et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2009). Syzygium aromaticum (Clove, Laung): Clove, known as , is one of the Syzygium aromaticum most expensive spices that has been used for millennia as a food preservative and in a variety of therapeutic purposes. Minerals, dietary fibre, vitamins (A, C, E, and K), thiamin, riboflavin, folate, and niacin are all present in significant amounts in this plant. Furthermore, it has a wealth of phenolic chemicals, including eugenol, thymol, eugenol acetate, gallic acid, and cariophyllene, which have a variety of potential applications in the domains of cosmetics, medicine, food, and agriculture. It has analgesic, antiviral, antifungal, anticancer, and anti- inflammatory effects. Porphyromonas gingivalis was resistant to the antibacterial effects of the substance augenol, and it was also inhibited from producing biofilms. Eugeniin, a phytochemical present in cloves, has been reported to have good antiviral activity against herpes virus strains, with an effective antiviral dosage of 5 g/mL. Eugeniin has antiviral properties by inhibiting the viral DNA polymerase enzyme and obstructing DNA synthesis as a result. However, the clove smell components were responsible for their antioxidant properties. It was proven that these mixtures did not hurt mice and that clove's synergic activity was greater in the brain than it was in the skin. Additionally, it has been observed that the clove flower buds' Eugeniin, Isobiflorin, and Biflorin inhibited the Protease (Xiong et al., 2011). Panax ginseng (Ginseng): Ginseng is mostly found in America and Asia, and it has long been prized for the range of beneficial chemicals it contains for health. Antibacterial, antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-cardiovascular disease, and anticancer are only a few of its beneficial properties. It promotes immunity, guards against diabetes, some cardiovascular diseases, and neurological conditions. The primary chemical components of ginseng are triterpenoid, protopanaxadiols, protopanaxatriols, and steroidal saponins, also known as ginsenoid, polysaccharides, and proteins. These substances are also responsible for ginseng's potential antibacterial or similar activity, particularly for pathogens that cause respiratory infections in people. A range of bacteria, fungus, and yeast species, including Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus have been shown to be resistant to ginseng's antibacterial properties. It has also been demonstrated to be successful in treating a variety of human viral diseases, including rotavirus, coxsackievirus respiratory syncytial virus, norovirus, enterovirus, human herpes virus, influenza, and hepatitis viruses. Additionally, ginseng inhibits the growth of mature biofilms, affects biofilm development, and lowers microbial motility. It was reported for its potential worth in enhancing central nervous system cognitive performance and treating illnesses by boosting the immune system. The results show that 150-300 mL of milk with added ginseng can provide 11.5-23 mg of ginsenosides, which boost body immunity (Zuo et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2007; Tolo et al., 2006; Tolo et al., 2010; Roner et al., 2007;Dao et al., 2011). Prospective treatments of COVID-19 using medicinal plants The swiftly spreading COVID-19 illness is currently without a cure. Infection can still be avoided at all costs, despite the best efforts of the specialists. There is currently no effective antiviral treatment for the MERS-CoV, SARS- CoV, or SARS-CoV-2 viruses; nonetheless, 23 Chinese provinces are using TCM formulae to treat this illness. Traditional herbal remedies are utilised in China to treat respiratory infections as an alternative therapy. TCM has a proven track record of successfully managing and treating a variety of epidemics. In 2003, TCM demonstrated a large www.apjonline.inAdvance Pharmaceutical Journal 2022; 7(4):128-135 132curative advantage for SARS. The evaluation of SARS and MARS treatments from prior trials is used in current drug research. A Chinese herbal concoction may be able to treat COVID-19 in a high-risk group, according to earlier research on the treatment of SARS and H1N1 influenza. Currently, TCM is being employed in China to find effective treatments for more than 85% of COVID-19 patients. Each virus differs substantially from the infection process in diverse human bodies in terms of structure and activity. The effectiveness of herbal medicines varies greatly depending on the age, sex, health, and previous medical history of the patients. TCM appeared to be useful in preventing and managing COVID- 19, according to recent clinical studies. Patients have been receiving care since December 2019 using a mix of Chinese and Western medical methods. A TCM treatment plan combining Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Shufeng Jiedu Capsule was well tolerated by three out of four patients (SFJDC). Additionally, clinical trials are being carried out to evaluate the efficiency and security of lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-2b. Chinese medicinal plants such astragalus, licorice, fangfeng, baizhu, and honeysuckle are frequently used, however the best time to take this decoction is only for one week. The bitterness of the herbs Mahuang which may impede the interaction of the S protein with ACE2 in viruses, is brought on by aromatic hydrophobic chemicals like ephedrine and amygdalin. According to and others were effective in treating COVID-19 patients with pneumonia symptoms. Out of all these treatments, QPD has been suggested as a general prescription in China, where it has a cure rate of over 90%. However, it was through the in silico screening of herbal plants that chemicals with a direct potential to block new coronaviruses were discovered. There may be a lack of information on the safety of Chinese herbs, but it is believed that these compounds have no appreciable, discernible adverse effects on the human body. Overall, TCM is capable of treating infectious disorders, but careful consideration should be given before using it as a treatment. Currently, China recommends routine COVID-19 treatment, which includes the use of antibiotics with nutritional support, artificial breathing when necessary, and TCM. Today's scientific community is mostly concerned with creating safeguards and discovering cures. Plants that can strengthen our immune systems and stop the spread of COVID-19 are highly valued by herbalists. Black cumin (Nigella sativa L.) has long been regarded as a miracle cure in both Islamic and Christian communities in North Africa. Nigella sativa has been mentioned in various studies for its many advantages, including those that are antiviral, regulating, hostile to cancer, pain relieving, etc. Due to its history of successful antiviral research, it is being examined to determine the molecules in black cumin that are superior for treating COVID-19 in comparison to drugs like chloroquine, 19, nigellidine and Hederin can be used. According to molecular docking findings and the identification of the Mpro protease structure in SARS CoV-2, there may be new potential to address the medicinal use of black cumin. Another investigation looked at the efficacy of Moroccan medical herbs to inhibit the SARS CoV-2 virus. These plants included Crocus sativus, Nerium oleander, chemicals crocin, detoxigenin, and -eudesmol. The energy of the interaction between molecules and the under investigation protein serves as the basis for molecular docking (Yimer et al., 2019; Liying et al., 2020; Aanouz et al., 2020). Future perspectives Given that many synthetic medications are failing to treat patients with SARS-CoV-2, herbal therapies are now a potential option for battling the current COVID-19 pandemic. Some Chinese plant extracts have already been tried in a therapeutic context for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, and they have shown promising outcomes for the symptom reduction (Luo et al., 2020). In India, it is customary to prescribe common herbs for viral infections so that the patient's physiological status is restored and (Kim et al., 2008). The safety and efficacy of utilising diammonium glycyrrhizinate with vitamin C for the treatment of COVID- 19 linked infections were evaluated in a randomised, controlled, and open clinical trial at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Hubei, China; however, clinical use has not yet begun. Along with the viral protease, replication, spike protein, and receptor, promising targets to stop SARS- CoV also include the virus's protein kinase C and (Hoever et al., 2005; Jang et al., 2020). Glycyrrhizin has been demonstrated to be able to inhibit the SARS CoV protein kinase C, and myricetin and scutellarein have been shown to be able to inhibit the viral helicase (Xian et al., 2020). Many Chinese herbal medicines were used to treat COVID-19-infected patients in China. China's National Health Commission (NHC) has recommended a few plant- based drugs for the treatment of SARSCoV-2 patients. Even before the SARS-CoV outbreak was officially declared in 2003, China used the same management strategy. Chinese experts claim. www.apjonline.inAdvance Pharmaceutical Journal 2022; 7(4):128-135 133Conclusion The development of a COVID-19 vaccine or therapy could take at least one to two years. Although hydroxychloroquine has been tested as a COVID-19 treatment, it hasn't been successful and has side effects. The immune systems of the body play a critical role in defending against dangerous surroundings, pathogens like viruses, bacteria, and fungi, as well as a number of other diseases. Although there are several allopathic drugs that can boost our immune systems, we are aware of their numerous side effects and expensive cost. For this, we use Ayurvedic herbs and products, which not only create a healthy environment for the body but also boost the immune system without causing any side effects. Numerous studies show that individuals with strong immune systems recovered more quickly from the COVID-19 pandemic. While ayurvedic treatments might not be able to completely cure COVID-19, they might be able to reduce the risk of viral infection and decrease mortality. The benefits of employing Ayurvedic and medicinal plant products to treat infectious diseases and other conditions have long been recognized. These botanical plants have the potential to strengthen immunity to fend off COVID-19 and other infectious diseases due to their low cost, low toxicity, and widespread availability throughout the country. Natural compounds could also play a significant role in the growth of a fit and healthy India and the rest of the world.
