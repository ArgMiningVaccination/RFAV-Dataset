The medical world has existed in a state of \"silo-ism\" for many years as there has been a lack of communication between most medical practitioners when it comes to the evaluation and treatment of clients. Numerous levels of education and specialties exist in every facet of healthcare. Allopathic, Osteopathic and Alternative/Integrative beliefs and techniques are rarely shared or discussed. Eastern and Western philosophies are as far apart as the actual distance in miles between the eastern and western parts of the world. Evidence based practice and computerization has limited personalized care. Sadly, with the current technology and techniques, the cost of \"health care\" continues to rise while people with chronic, obscure diseases continue to suffer. Utilizing an Integrative Approach in \"health care\" will allow for more efficient and effective care with a focus on teaching clients how to tap into the innate ability of the body to heal. Blending the diagnostic techniques used in multiple forms of medicine to produce an accurate diagnosis will lead to the most productive form of healing. If an emergency situation is at hand, allopathic medicine is the obvious choice. If chronic illness is present, integrative health techniques should be chosen to allow for optimal healing. Both examples can produce exorbitant health care costs in a healthcare system and for the client. The latter tends to continue driving these costs over a long period of time. The \"Knowledge Gap\" that exists in overall healthcare is very wide and deep. This course will begin long overdo discussions on how to take one step at a time in bridging and transcending this gap. | | Course Covers Balance for Wellness Academy Programs: [Transforming the Gap in Physical Therapy "}
