The Office of Spiritual Life exists as an extension of one of Averett's core institutional values, to \"embrace Averett's Judeo-Christian heritage, by honoring the search for truth and spiritual formation\". Headed by our University Chaplain, the Office of Spiritual Life serves as a resource for spiritual encouragement and challenging growth for all our students, regardless of faith background and perspective. We offer a variety of clubs and programs throughout the year for worship, study, reflection, service, and fellowship, along with providing the University Chaplain as a resource for faith counseling and support. Questions may be directed to the University Chaplain, Skyler Daniel.
