Indeed, all that comes from anthroposophic investigation regarding medicine and, for instance, physiology, can be no more than a stimulus that must then be worked out empirically. Only on the basis of this empirical study can there arise valid and convincing judgments of the matters in question\u2014and this is the kind of judgment that is needed in the domain of therapy.\" \u2014 Rudolf Steiner (Oct. 26, 1922) What is the difference between natural science and spiritual science?
