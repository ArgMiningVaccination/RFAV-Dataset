It's simply a fundamentally different approach in treatment philosophy.", "sitename": "Weld Family Clinic of Chiropractic", "date": "2013-02-26", "cleaned_text": "The primary difference between CHIROPRACTIC and ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE is philosophy: Allopathy sees the patient through MECHANISTIC glasses - believing that when the body is not working properly, it's either a deficiency of chemicals or too many parts (drugs and surgery seem to be the only answers), while chiropractic sees the patient through VITALISTIC glasses - believing that there's something more than just the parts - there's a spirit/soul/life force that animates living organisms, and it's this life force that produces healing in the human body. Is Chiropractic a Cult? Chiropractors don't have horns. We don't chant incantations. If you talk to a chiropractor, s/he won't try to hypnotize you. Once you start going to a chiropractor, you don't have to go for the rest of your life (although many chiropractic patients CHOOSE to continue care for a lifetime because they see the value of an optimally functioning nervous system). Most of the kids in chiropractic offices don't have bad backs - their parents see the value of an optimally functioning nervous system for proper growth and development. Look around you - what makes you different than your spouse, co-workers, birds, trees or spiders? We're all a little bit of energy - that's it - you're just in a little different shape than everything else. \"...and you ask, \"can chiropractic cure appendicitis or the flu?\" Do you have more faith in a spoonful of medicine than in the power that animates the living world? - B.J.
