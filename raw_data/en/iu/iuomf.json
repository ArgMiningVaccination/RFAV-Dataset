Recent studies have demonstrated how hearing loss increases risk for cognitive issues like dementia, in which up to 8% of cases exhibited hearing loss. While these studies also suggest that hearing loss impacts brain function and changes in structure, they have also addressed the possibility that because hearing loss ends up demanding so much attention and effort to decode the meaning in words and sounds, it takes up the remainder of brain capacity needed to process the meaning of the actual message. \"The cause behind this link is unclear. But one theory is that hearing loss tends to cause some people to withdraw from conversations and participate less in activities,\" said Dr. Factora. \"As a result, you become less social and less engaged.\" Isolation, especially self-isolation, is hard on older adults not only due to lack of socialization, but also due to lack of stimulation, which can trigger a decrease in growth of necessary neural pathways for carrying out numerous biological processes, memory function, and more. That is why frequent social engagement is often advised in order to protect brain health and mitigate the risk of developing dementia, especially when considering that aging typically triggers a natural decline in cognitive abilities regardless. Older people suffering from hearing loss tend to either ignore the signs or disregard the gravity, but Dr. Factora urges people to be transparent with their primary care physicians and request an audiology evaluation. \"If you do have hearing loss and your physician offers a solution like hearing aids, try them out,\" said Dr. Factora. \"If you wait too long and develop memory problems, it will be more difficult for you to learn how to use these devices. It's best to get used to them while the mind is still sharp so you can improve your quality of life.\" While causation and odds of reversibility are still yet to be determined, Dr. Factora recommends four ways his patients and other seniors can improve their brain health and reduce the severity of decline. - Keeping your mind active A good education is not just important for your social and economic health, but for your physical health as well; studies have shown a lower risk of dementia in people with a high school education or better. \"But studies also show that if you can maintain an eighth-grade level of reading or literacy throughout your life, it will help keep your mind active,\" said Dr. Factora. \"You can also engage in hobbies that help keep you learning or challenged.\" Any new hobby, like board games, playing cards, or knitting, will suffice because it forces the brain to develop new neural connections as you learn and develop that particular skillset, which in turn can be an asset in bypassing brain damage association with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. - Maintaining a social network Maintaining or creating social connections with friends and family helps support a healthy brain. \"If you're constantly engaged in a give-and-take conversation and are around a lot of people, that stimulation will have a positive effect on your brain health,\" said Dr. Factora. - Exercising regularly Especially if choosing cardiovascular exercise, a regular fitness routine of at least 30 minutes five times a week is a superb way to protect the brain, although any regimen, such as strength training, is a good option. \"Evidence suggests that cardiovascular exercise is probably the most helpful of all types of exercise in maintaining brain health,\" said Dr. Factora. - Sticking to a Mediterranean diet Perhaps one of the most difficult pieces of advice to follow, Dr. Factora recommends eating right and following a healthy diet that regularly incorporates vegetables, fruits, legumes, fish, olive oil, nuts, and seeds because these foods are beneficial for both heart and brain health.
