These candle recipes will show you how to make candles at home using all-natural ingredients. Scented candles with essential oils make the ultimate relaxation gift and the perfect use for all of those old mason jars. You just need wax, wicks and essential oils. I'm a sucker for a homemade gift. Homemade [bath salts](https://www.thehealthymaven.com/how-to-make-bath-salts/), [salt scrubs](https://www.thehealthymaven.com/how-to-make-a-salt-scrub-recipe/) or even these candles with essential oils are my go-to! I love receiving homemade gifts so I try to make a point of making them for other people. I especially love a gift that can be easily made in big batches and in advance in case you have a last minute event or get-together that requires a gift. In this tutorial I'm teaching you how to make candles at home using essential oils. These are easily customizable (I.e. you can substitute different essential oils based on your favorite scented candles) and really candle making is pretty basic. What You Need to Make Candles at Home In order to make scented candles you need just a few simple ingredients and some supplies you probably already have in your house. [Soy wax flakes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WZ6N1QW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00WZ6N1QW&linkCode=as2&tag=theheamav04-20&linkId=TKLWOW77H72WRFY7)- Candle wax made from soy burn cleaner with little soot released as the candle burns. They're also non-toxic so they won't release toxins as they burn. [Natural wicks](https://amzn.to/2RCNVn5)- Traditional candle wicks release butane gas as they burn. That's why I opt for a natural hemp-based wick instead. - Essential oils - to scent your candles you can use essential oils (I like [lavender](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DJ6J0C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001DJ6J0C&linkCode=as2&tag=theheamav04-20&linkId=EDRZB5ZNWVSDP7UQ), [grapefruit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014AWMOW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0014AWMOW&linkCode=as2&tag=theheamav04-20&linkId=3ZJVI2VA6UVXG4SM)and [eucalyptus](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001TPORE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0001TPORE&linkCode=as2&tag=theheamav04-20&linkId=AG6CQ2DQQPVD5EHG)). You'll need close to 100 drops which seems like a lot but is important for giving your homemade candles a strong scent. You'll also need: - Mason jars -or some other container or glass jars - A disposable stirring device - Candle wax sticks to everything so you'll want to use something disposable. - Chopstick or pencil - for anchoring wick in place. This is the perfect use for all those disposable chopsticks you have laying around. How to Make Candles at Home Today I'm sharing my best tips for making scented candles (or essential oil candles because that's pretty much what they are!). STEP 1: MELT WAX Melt soy wax in a pot over low-medium heat. The soy wax flakes should melt fairly easily but turn up heat slightly if taking more than a few minutes. Stir using wood stirring device (I used a chopstick). I don't use a thermometer for this - just pay attention so it doesn't burn. Note: You may want to use a double boiler if you're concerned about your pot as sometimes the wax will stick to your pot. STEP 2: ADD YOUR ESSENTIAL OILS Once melted, add 80-102 drops of your favorite essential oils directly into pot. Amount depends on type of essential oils and how potent they are.

STEP 3: ANCHOR WICKS + POUR WAX Anchor wicks to bottom of mason jars using a bit of wax (or purchased anchors). Tape wick upright to a horizontal chopstick or pen/pencil (see picture above). Pour wax into mason jar and then repeat until all jars are full. Depending on size of mason jars you may have some wax leftover. Let stand until solid (about 1 hour). Cut wick to desired length. Common Mistakes to Avoid in Candle Making This is where mistakes happen so pay attention to these final steps in making your aromatherapy candles: -Cut your wicks so they are longer in length than the vertical height of your jar. You can cut them down after they have set. -Secure your wicks with \"anchors\" by placing a bit of wax at the bottom of your empty jar and then pressing it into place using a chopstick. -Use a chopstick (a pen or pencil works too) and place it horizontally along the top of the jar. Tape your wick to it so that it's upright, ensuring that it's completely straight. If it's not straight it will burn all funky. -Pour your wax directly into the jar so that it fills to just below the lip and surrounds the wick. ALWAYS pour your candles into your jars over newspaper. Otherwise you will get wax everywhere. And cleaning wax off your stove top is not fun at all (trust me!) -Very important: DO NOT pour leftover wax down your drain <- this was not a fun lesson to learn -You can leave your candles to set in a cool location and it will take about an hour. Cut the wicks down before burning. How to Make Candles at Home Who doesn't love candles? These candle recipes will show you how to make candles at home using all-natural ingredients.
