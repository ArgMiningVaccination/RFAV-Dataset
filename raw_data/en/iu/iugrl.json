Every organism is unique in its reactions and differs in its structures of energy fields in the same way that fingerprints are totally unique. Therefore, treatment of each individual should be absolutely focused on that individual and not a mass group. The field of genetics has also recently come to the same conclusion! Homeopathy, by taking into consideration the totality of symptoms of an organism - in its triple expression in the mental, emotional, and bodily levels - divulges the underlying disturbance in a very precise way so that such a disturbance can be treated with energy medicines very effectively. Whilst homeopathy can cure a lot of chronic conditions, the reader should not get the impression that it can cure everything. It does have its limits. This book was first published in the Greek language and soon became a bestseller for a Greek public that is most conservative in these matters. This success led me to think that such a small informative book could be useful to inform an international public. "}
