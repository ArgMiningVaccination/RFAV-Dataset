Kopernik has been bridging the technology gap ever since. Our namesake, Nicolaus Copernicus, changed the way people see the world. Kopernik was founded on that same principle, seeking to challenge the status quo in the development sector and to find smarter, more effective solutions that solve persistent problems faced by those living in last mile communities. We believe that ideas and potential solutions should be tested first and that impact should be demonstrated before large investments are made. With more innovation in the development sector and experimentation of solutions to solve development problems, better programs can be developed and budgets allocated to impactful programs that have big potential to reduce poverty. We are therefore proactive in the testing of ideas that can benefit the larger development community. At our core we want to find what works and what doesn't to reduce poverty. Founded in 2007, R.O.L.E. Foundation was created to stop land-based waste from getting into the oceans, and help create sustainable jobs to protect the livelihoods of coastal communities. Indonesia produces around 64 million tons of waste per year. Approximately 50% of this reaches landfill sites, the rest is either burned or illegally dumped and flows into the ocean. This massive volume of waste is now covering Australia's northern beaches. Through R.O.L.E's campus we provide education, and skills training programs and grassroots community assistance to alleviate poverty and ensure environmental sustainability A high percentage of Indonesia's population is not aware of the damage done to the environment everyday and the resulting consequences. Due to a lack of education on these matters, sustainable behavior is not yet in the mindset of the general public. Keep Bali Beautiful is a grassroots recycling program that partners with local schools and villages to build a sustainable recycling network, as well as to change the beliefs and habits that lead to pollution. Our mission is to Keep Bali Beautiful by partnering with schools and villages to recycle plastic pollution. Keep Bali Beautiful and our volunteers operate recycling stations, storage centers, and reliable recycling pick-up in the eastern part of Bali. Most importantly, we are slowly building an environmental ethic among young people in Bali by partnering with schools to create EcoClubs, educating students on the importance of recycling and what it takes to Keep Bali Beautiful.

Many locals lost their job, just as in your home countries. To support Balinese families in need, the BaliSpirit Group staff, including The Yoga Barn and BaliSpirit Festival, has created \"Essential Care Kits\" for those families who find themselves at the brink of destitution, incapable of caring for themselves and their extended families, a beautiful aspect of this culture. We raised USD 1785 so far and were able to give 64 Care Kits to families in need. We would like to distribute more Care Kits within the Balinese villages in the upcoming months. With your support, we can make this possible. Choose between different family care kits and baby/toddler kits and get more information about the program by following the link below. From our hearts to yours, we send love and healing energy to you and your community. Scholars Of Sustenance Indonesia is a part of global movement under the SOS Global Foundation currently operating in Bali Indonesia and Bangkok Thailand, soon expanding into Phuket and Jogyakarta. Scholars of Sustenance or SOS is a Food Rescue Foundation working with hotels, commercial outlets, food suppliers, event organizers collecting surplus food and distributing it to those in need. According to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nation), one-third of the food produced in the world produced for human consumption gets lost or wasted. Indonesia alone wastes almost 13 million tonnes of food every year and yet millions of people are suffering from malnutrition and hunger. SOS's mission is to rescue that excess food destined for the landfill and distribute it to communities in need. Currently partnering with 50+ hotels in Bali, a bakery, leading catering companies and suppliers Scholars of Sustenance can support 13 orphanages, 4 charitable organizations, an elderly house and continues expanding their Kampung/village program launched earlier in the year of 2019.

The outreach program is already able to support 4 different banjars in Karangasem and Gianyar areas proving hundreds of people with nutritious meals. Yayasan Kemanusiaan Ibu Pertiwi (YKIP) or Humanitarian Foundation of Mother Earth, was established only days after the Bali Bombing in October 2002. We aim to improve the lives of marginalized communities in Bali through comprehensive educational opportunities by providing scholarships to children from disadvantaged families. YKIP scholarships are also preferred to be given for the children who are suffering from disaster, handicapped and orphans.

Born in 2009 in the corner of an established dog shelter, Villa Kitty officially began life as a refuge for Bali's destitute cats and kittens in 2011. Today, it is a busy, colourful and ordered village where the disadvantaged feline, and yes, canine residents are honoured, treated, loved and ultimately adopted. The front line of animal welfare sees many casualties and Villa Kitty has resources to assess and manage the wounded and damaged. Our vets work in a clean and safe surgery and clinic. The cats and kittens requiring quarantine whilst going through their vaccination process spend their time in neat rooms with cushions and toys and plenty of space for visitors to sit and enjoy some time with these kittens. Our hospital wing cares for the respiratory sufferers in one ward and a special 'nursery' ward for tiny patients. And then of course there is the Nursery where our skilled nursery staff care for tiny kittens, bottle feeding and giving them comfort and hope for a safe and loving future.

BaliSpirit's Karma Yoga outreach program established AYO! Kita Bicara HIV & AIDS (Hey! Let's Talk About HIV and AIDS) in 2010 in response to the critical need for HIV & AIDS education in Bali. In 2018, Bali had over 2,000 new cases of HIV & AIDS. Yet an estimated 30% of new cases go unreported each year in Bali. The AYO! program empowers teenagers to guard their own physical and emotional health and act with empathy towards others living with HIV within their community. In 8 years, AYO! has held workshops with over 6,800 students and reaches thousands more people during its weekly AYO! radio broadcasts. From 2016 to 2017, the Ministry of Education supported AYO! to hold EduSpirit workshops even beyond Bali - in West Lombok, East Java (Situbondo), West Java (Indramayu), and Riau Island Province (Batam City) Bali Regreen is a sustainable environmental project aiming to fight land degradation in the island's driest areas whilst also educating and training the people who inhabit the land. It is one of the most exciting projects in the region, with an emphasis on long term economic benefits for some of Bali's poorest people. Although Bali seems incredibly lush and vibrant, there are huge tracts of the island, especially in the East that suffers from extreme dryness and as a result, little to no vegetation. Due to these conditions, the communities inhabiting these damaged areas live in poverty. BaliSpirit Festival and Yayasan Kryasta Guna have partnered with the Environmental Bamboo Foundation (EBF) in an effort to help poor communities in Desa Songan, East Bali since 2011. Desa Songan is located in the caldera of Batur volcano and is one of the 82 poorest villages in Bali, with almost 35% of it's 8,000 people living below the poverty line. Not only do these people have to overcome the daily obstacle of a harsh environment with land degradation, but also have a lack of economic opportunity. At BaliSpirit, we believe reforestation is more than looking after and giving back to the earth; it is also about looking after its people. "}
