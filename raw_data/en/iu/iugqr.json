To inquire about a gemmotherapy that isn't listed, please contact us. We'll find it for you! | How Are Gemmos Prepared? Gemmotherapy remedies are diluted similar to homeopathic remedies. Gemmos are 1/10th strength in a base of alcohol with glycerin and water. They are prepared in an amber glass bottle with a dropper. If sensitive to alcohol, place the open bottle in 1 inch of slow boiling water for 5 minutes. Cool the bottle before screwing on stopper. The shelf life without alcohol is approximately 3 weeks, as opposed to the standard two years. Dosage Gemmotherapy remedies are easily to administer. They can be taken in a beverage, preferably water, or directly under the tongue. If you are taking more than one, ideally they should be taken separately. Children usually favor it in a beverage. The dosage for infants is 5 - 8 drops, children 3 to 8 years old, 15-20 drops, and adults and older children, 25-50 drops. The remedies can be used as often as 2-3 times per day during acute illness. Our gemmotherapy herbs are manufactured by Boiron, and the double-size by Seroyal. | | | || | | | | | | || | Subscribe to our newsletter for monthly natural health features and site updates for you and your family! | | | | | | | | Copyright \u00a9 2008 Dr. Feder - All Rights Reserved The information on this site is not intended or implied to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.
