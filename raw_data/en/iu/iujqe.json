Holistic Treatment Methods Taking a holistic approach to mental health treatment simply means that treatment options encompass an overall well-being methodology. While talk therapy and medications may be necessary in some cases and for some levels of mental illness, some people may respond very well to alternative methods of treatment in their treatment plan. Some effective, evidence-based holistic treatment options include: Recreational Therapy The goal of recreation therapy is to reduce mental health issues by lowering stress and anxiety through relaxation, recovering basic motor functioning through physical activity, enhancing reasoning abilities, building confidence, and improving communication.

Clients work with horses to develop and promote self-esteem, address fear and anxiety stemming from trauma, and practice empathy. Through equine therapy, many of those with substance use and mental health disorders may also learn to become more mindful and develop and practice patience. In equine therapy, individuals build up a more active and positive sense of self as they do work with the animals. It is a means to feel actively useful and needed increasing one's sense of responsibility and acceptance. One of the reasons this form of therapy is so effective, fostering higher rehab retention and completion rates, is how it diverges from the usual therapeutic approaches. In equine therapy, individuals aren't receiving direct treatment for their substance use disorder but rather a kind of adjunct therapy allowing them to commit more effectively to other concurrent treatments. Art Therapy Self-expression in any form is proven to be an effective treatment method as measured by [the SERATS scale](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248315).
