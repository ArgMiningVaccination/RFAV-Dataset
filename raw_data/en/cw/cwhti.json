A strong and resilient immune system resists the cold germs that are around us all the time. Using therapeutic gemstone crystals is a natural and easy way to strengthen your immune system so you can avoid catching the common cold. They can also help you recover from cold symptoms, such as fever, sore throat, cough, and sneezing, much more quickly if you do develop symptoms.

Natural Cold Remedies: An Effective and Long-Lasting Approach to Cold Relief by Dr. Ada Gonz\u00e1lez The common cold may be the most expensive health ailment in the U.S. Treating it costs us billions of dollars a year, substantially more than treating other conditions, such as asthma and heart disease. The good news is that colds respond well to natural remedies. Wearing therapeutic gemstone necklaces can improve your overall health and help you prevent and recover from colds more quickly and easily. Quicker Recovery from Illness Have you ever noticed that certain people never seem to catch a cold? A strong and resilient immune system resists the viruses that are around us all the time. You can help your immune system stay strong by making good choices with the foods you eat and getting plenty of rest. You can also wear a therapeutic [Bloodstone necklace](https://gemisphere.com/products/bloodstone). Bloodstone is both antiviral and antibacterial. It helps the immune system become more efficient at recognizing infection and more effective at recovering from illness. If you have a tendency to get colds in the winter, start using Bloodstone in the fall and get a jump on the cold and flu season. If you already have a cold, place Bloodstone directly on the affected area to accelerate its healing. For example, you can place the gems on your sinuses for a sinus infection or runny nose, on your chest for a cough, or on your throat for a sore throat. Excellent Congestion and Cough Relief Quartz is another effective remedy for a cold, because it attracts life force to the body and brings energy to an area that has low energy or is weakened. That is exactly what you need when you are feeling run down or about to get a cold. When you are sick with a cold, the congestion is similar to debris that collects in a stagnant stream, which must be flushed out before water can flow freely again. Using Quartz brings more life energy to a congested area to help clear it, encourage energy to move freely, and help you feel better quickly. Quartz can be especially supportive of the lungs. Place a [Quartz necklace](https://gemisphere.com/products/quartz) directly on your on the chest to help you recover from a cough or chest cold. Increase Energy and Vitality A [therapeutic Carnelian necklace](https://gemisphere.com/products/carnelian) is a great addition to your therapeutic gemstone \"toolbox\" for preventing and treating a cold, fever, or sore throat\u2014especially one that involves swollen glands. Carnelian vitalizes the entire body, with special focus on the lymphatic and immune systems, which play key roles in fighting infection. The optimism and energy that Carnelian brings are ideal antidotes to the tiredness and run-down feeling that come with catching a cold. Once the symptoms of a cold have resolved, keep your therapeutic necklaces on for another week, so you can continue clearing the underlying stresses or weakness that led you to catch the cold in the first place. Doing so will help your body heal and recuperate fully. Therapeutic Quality Gemstones When selecting therapeutic gems, I recommend Gemisphere as the most reliable source. Gemisphere provides only [therapeutic quality gemstones](https://gemisphere.com/collections/all-gems). In order for gems to work as therapeutic tools, they need to meet high standards of quality and purity. As an example, the majority of the Apatite gems available today have been injected with plastic glue to stabilize them. These artificial stabilizers destroy the gems' therapeutic potential. Gemisphere never allows any artificial stabilizers to be used in any of their gems. Gemisphere's high-quality, therapeutic gems are used by people in 65 countries and are recommended by physicians around the world. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Simply by wearing therapeutic gems around your neck, you can experience continual support from the gems' healing energies.
