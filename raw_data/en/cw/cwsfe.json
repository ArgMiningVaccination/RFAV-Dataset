With 40+ years of clinical experience in the field of integrative, functional natural medicine; I have noticed that in excess of 90%+ of all new patients arriving at my facility are misdiagnosed and therefore mistreated for their symptoms they present with. We look at the whole picture and treat the patient with respect and knowledge of the issues faced to the best of our ability by focusing on the root cause and not masking symptoms.

[What is Functional Medicine?](functional-medicine) Functional Medicine is an integrative, science-based approach to healthcare. The focus is on patient-centered care. Instead of looking at and treating health problems (symptoms) as isolated diseases. It treats individuals who may have bodily symptoms, imbalances, and dysfunctions and addresses the root causes of these health challenges. Using scientific principles, advanced diagnostic testing, and treatments other than drugs or surgery, Functional/Integrative Medicine restores balance in the body's primary physiological processes with assistance of Natural treatment protocols. Education is the key! Many normal looking people are nutritionally deficient, overwhelmed with toxins and full of inflammation. Everyday they contribute to their health problems by increasing the acid level of their bodies and not getting enough water and are severely nutrient deficient which leads to health issues and challenges. All sickness, diseases and premature aging and death is primarily due to imbalances of the basic products to support good health and a longer more productive life. Dr. Badanek strives to educate his patients about the vital things that they can do to improve their health on a daily basis. If you knew more about your body would treat yourself better?
