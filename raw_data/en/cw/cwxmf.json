Many natural energy drinks are made with one or two key natural ingredients. They are formulated so that a person can avoid the additives, preservatives, and sugar that are present in a typical energy drink. Natural energy drinks that contain added vitamins can be more nutritious than those using one energy-boosting ingredient, such as yerba mate or green tea. Ingredients will differ from brand to brand, so a person should check the ingredients label to understand which natural ingredients a brand has used in its product. What makes an energy drink natural? Natural energy drinks are marketed as being free from artificial colors, sweeteners, and preservatives. They contain naturally derived ingredients that reportedly boost energy due to their natural caffeine content, including green tea, yerba mate, and other plant-derived ingredients. They may have a lower caffeine content than a typical energy drink. What is the best natural ingredient for energy? Although research is limited for many ingredients used in natural energy drinks, coffee, green tea, and yerba mate may provide short-term energy benefits. Natural energy drinks can provide a similar boost in energy to standard energy drinks. However, the former tends to contain less sugar and more naturally occurring sources of caffeine. Although energy drinks may help increase alertness and concentration, an individual should also consider natural alternatives, such as staying hydrated and eating a nutrient-rich diet. "}
