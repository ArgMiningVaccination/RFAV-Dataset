A total of 36 mice, divided into two groups (control and ZJW) were implanted with HepG2 containing luciferase genes. Luciferase is an oxidative enzyme used to detect for bioluminescent signals. Three days after tumour cell implantation, the mice were subjected to image scans. \"Immunostaining with anti-luciferase antibody confirmed that HepG2/NF-B/Luc cells had been transplanted successfully in livers,\" the researchers said. The ZJW group then received alternating dosage of 200mg of ZJW solution and phosphate buffered saline (PBS), a water-based salt solution that is is non-toxic to most cells for seven, 14 and 28 days. \"At intervals of seven, 14 or 28-days after daily treatment with ZJW or PBS, mice were sacrificed to examine the therapeutic effects of ZJW,\" the study said. They found that tumour-to-liver ratios were decreased in ZJW treatment group at seven days after treatment. Oral administration While the control group showed tumour mass and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the livers, those from the ZJW mice livers had several hollows inside the tumour, and the inflammatory cells were located at the margin of tumour mass. Also, \"the number of luciferase-positive cells was decreased in ZJW treatment group, compared to control group,\" the study revealed. \"These findings suggested that oral administration of ZJW exhibited anti-cancer effects by decreasing the weight of tumour mass and the accumulation of ascites in an orthotopic intrahepatic xenograft model.\" Researchers added that while the ZJW combination showed obvious 'anti-hepatoma' effects on the tumour-implanted mice livers, more clinical trials involving ZJW are needed to explore the TCM drugs' potential therapeutic effects on liver cancer.
