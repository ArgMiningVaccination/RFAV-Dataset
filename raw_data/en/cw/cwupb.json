The human body does not seem to have enzymes that can break down this protein like it could any other natural protein and have us get rid of it.\" Why? \"It's because this protein is not natural,\" answered [McCullough](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post). \"It was engineered in a Chinese biosecurity lab using blueprints that came from US researchers fully-funded and supported by the National Institutes of Health and the National Allergy Immunology branch run by Dr. Anthony Fauci.\" The effects of the unnatural spike protein have been devastating. \"The vaccines have left about 15% of those who've taken them with some form of a medical problem,\" added [McCullough](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post). \"That is a huge number.\" \"Now, fortunately, about a third of people who took the vaccine, they've had no side effects whatsoever, and they appear to be exhibiting no side effects emerging. So, if one took the shot and they're perfectly fine, didn't even have a sore arm, they're extremely unlikely now to develop a problem,\" explained [McCullough.](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post) \"But it's people who developed an initial reaction and were sick for a few days or weeks afterwards \u2014 I really worry about them because we are seeing the late development of myocarditis and cardiac arrest even two years after the vaccine. Blood clots developing even two years after the vaccine. In fact, another episode of COVID could provoke these,\" [McCullough](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post) warned. So, what can we do to help prevent such medical disasters? Three words: \" [Base Spike Detoxification](https://www.jpands.org/vol28no3/mccullough.pdf),\" [McCullough](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post) announced historic day\" because \"the [very first detoxification protocol](https://www.jpands.org/vol28no3/mccullough.pdf) was published in the US medical literature.\" Specifically, the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons. [McCullough](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post) explained that this [detoxification protocol](https://www.jpands.org/vol28no3/mccullough.pdf) allows individuals to proactively address the issue head-on by using three natural substances, nattokinase, bromelain, and curcumin, which are available over-the-counter, \"to help the body clear this very dangerous protein from [their] cells and tissues.\" Although the protocol has not yet been scientifically validated through double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, [McCullough](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post) argued that clinical observations indicate a positive impact. What Are Nattokinase, Bromelain, and Curcumin? Nattokinase: An enzyme derived from the fermentation of soy. It has been traditionally used in Japan for its supposed cardiovascular benefits. Preclinical trials show it degrades the spike protein. Bromelain: A set of enzymes derived from pineapple stems, approved by the FDA as a topical treatment for wounds. Like nattokinase, it has also been shown to accelerate the clearance of spike proteins. Curcumin: The active compound in turmeric, widely used for its anti-inflammatory properties. It also mitigates further damage from the spike protein. The Protocol The recommended doses in the protocol are as follows, per [McCullough's Substack](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post): Nattokinase: 2,000 fibrin units (100 milligrams) orally twice a day without food Bromelain: 500 milligrams orally once a day without food Curcumin: 500 milligrams orally twice a day (nano, liposomal, or with piperine additive suggested) [McCullough](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post) recommended taking this treatment triad for at least three months for anyone suffering from or worried about post-COVID or vaccine syndromes, but he also suggested that those who have received multiple injections may need to take it for twelve months or longer. Clinical Observations and Limitations [In McCullough's clinical observations,](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post) \"patients indeed are getting better on this approach.\" He said he has observed people experience relief from symptoms such as numbness, tingling, heart racing, headaches, and loss of senses under this protocol. However, these observations have not yet been supported by large-scale scientific trials. Despite a billion-dollar investment in long COVID research by the Biden administration, not a single dollar of funding has been directed toward researching vaccine injuries. So, it won't be the government but dissenting doctors, such as [McCullough](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/breaking-clinical-rationale-for-sars?r=14jb45&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post), who will be leading the way in discovering optimal treatments and management for vaccine injuries. Safety Concerns \"The main safety caveats are bleeding and allergic reactions, both of which are manageable. It is our experience that both nattokinase and bromelain can be used in addition to antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs with physician monitoring,\" \"The [Wellness Company](https://twccanada.health/?ref=kX_h9WIICV30Gm) has brought the best news to those who suffer from long COVID or regret COVID-19 vaccination.
