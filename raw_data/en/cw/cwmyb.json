How long after using the devices any impact would last is also uncertain. This had a sizeable influence on cost-effectiveness estimates ( [see section 3.10](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/dg51/chapter/committee-discussion#because-of-the-uncertainty-about-the-devices-impact-on-health-related-quality-of-life-their-cost)). Data on this came from studies that did not represent likely NHS practice ( [see section 3.6](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/dg51/chapter/committee-discussion#there-is-limited-evidence-on-how-much-the-technologies-can-improve-symptoms-or-health-related)), which is itself uncertain ( [see section 3.3](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/dg51/chapter/committee-discussion#the-technologies-could-be-used-in-many-different-ways-in-the-nhs-and-how-they-would-fit-into-the)), and from assumptions made by the EAG because of lack of data. For its model, the EAG used a published algorithm from Chandler et al. (2020) to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) domain scores. The clinical experts said that health-related quality of life questionnaires like the PDQ39 are increasingly used in trials to assess health-related quality of life for people with Parkinson's disease. The committee also recognised that the effect of the devices on the health-related quality of life of carers had not been included in the EAG's model because of a lack of data ( [see section 3.13](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/dg51/chapter/committee-discussion#the-eags-model-did-not-capture-the-potential-impact-of-remote-monitoring-on-carers)). |DG51/03 | | How frequently the remote monitoring devices were modelled as being used substantially affected the cost-effectiveness estimates in the EAG's model ( [see section 3.9](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/dg51/chapter/committee-discussion#device-cost-is-a-major-driver-of-cost-effectiveness)). There are many ways the devices could be used in the NHS ( [see section 3.3](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/dg51/chapter/committee-discussion#the-technologies-could-be-used-in-many-different-ways-in-the-nhs-and-how-they-would-fit-into-the)) and no data was available to compare different approaches. So, it is currently not possible to highlight particular approaches that are likely to be more clinically and cost effective. Centres using the devices should therefore collect data on how often they are used and under what circumstances. For example, regularly in advance of scheduled review appointments, to indicate when such appointments are needed, or targeted to people having issues with symptoms. This will help assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of the different uses of the devices in NHS practice. |DG51/03 || |[ ](/about/what-we-do/research-and-development/research-recommendations/dg51/03) How frequently the remote monitoring devices were modelled as being used substantially affected the cost-effectiveness estimates in the EAG's model ( [see section 3.9](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/dg51/chapter/committee-discussion#device-cost-is-a-major-driver-of-cost-effectiveness)).

However, there is not enough good-quality evidence to support the case for routine adoption in the NHS. Further evidence in the form of real-world data collection is recommended to address uncertainties about selection criteria, patient-reported outcome measures, stoma reversal and bowel function recovery compared with other treatments.

Although the committee acknowledged that the Game et al. (2018) RCT was well conducted, it felt that additional research could help resolve some uncertainties around the cost and clinical case for 3C Patch. Specifically, research identifying the most appropriate stopping rule, and the associated clinical outcomes of implementing the rule, would help address key uncertainties within the cost case. Additional collection of resource use data on unhealed hard-to-heal ulcers could also reduce uncertainty in the cost case. Further to this, evidence could be collected on an UrgoStart-experienced population, as this would be reflective of current NHS care. Clinical experts thought a trial on this population would be feasible. The committee concluded that although further research could be done, on balance it was unlikely to result in a cost-saving case for 3C Patch based on the decision problem evaluated in this guidance |MTG66/01 || |[ ](/about/what-we-do/research-and-development/research-recommendations/mtg66/01) Additional research could help address uncertainties in the evidence, although the case for cost savings remains unlikely.

The committee concluded that further research is needed to address the uncertainties about the clinical effectiveness of Prontosan compared with saline or water. It recommended that randomised controlled trials should be done in the NHS. These should compare Prontosan with saline or water in different types of chronic wounds. The randomised controlled trial needs to be well designed to detect clinically meaningful results in subgroups (for example, pressure ulcers or venous leg ulcers). The committee agreed that a key outcome should be time to complete wound healing. The number of dressing changes should also be recorded for each wound included in the study. Other important outcomes should include pain and wound odour, measured using patient reported outcome measures (PROMs). |MTG67/01 ](/about/what-we-do/research-and-development/research-recommendations/mtg67/01) Randomised controlled saline or water in the NHS are needed.

The committee considered that comparative evidence is needed to show the clinical benefits of using myCOPD in 2 populations: - people using it to self-manage COPD - people referred to pulmonary rehabilitation For self-management, a randomised controlled trial is preferred to show the clinical benefits of myCOPD. This could be powered based on the encouraging results in the RESCUE study. However, a high-quality comparative observational study designed to minimise bias in the results may provide acceptable evidence. Outcomes such as rates of exacerbations, hospital readmissions and unscheduled care appointments should be considered alongside patient-reported outcomes such as health-related quality of life. For pulmonary rehabilitation, further evidence is needed to show the clinical benefits of myCOPD. This could be a randomised controlled trial which is powered based on the encouraging results in the TROOPER study or a well-designed comparative observational study. Key outcomes will be the CAT score and 6-minute walk test, ideally supported by additional longer-term outcomes such as rates of exacerbations and hospital admissions. Real-world data could be used to inform the uptake rates in the economic modelling.

The committee for this guidance update considered it important to further emphasise the need for collecting data using a national database or clinical registry on ureteric stent procedures. The prospective data collection should cover information about patient selection, choice of stent placement procedure and stent used, and adverse events such as stent migration and encrustation rates.
