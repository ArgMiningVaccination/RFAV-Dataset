Read about the side effects and safety of all the COVID-19 vaccines used in Ireland.", "sitename": "HSE.ie", "date": "2023-05-30", "cleaned_text": "Like all medicines, COVID-19 vaccines can cause side effects. Most of these are mild to moderate and short-term. Not everyone gets side effects. If you are concerned about side effects, phone your GP for advice. Serious side effects, like a severe allergic reaction, are extremely rare. Your vaccinator is trained to treat allergic reactions. Fever after COVID-19 vaccines It's common to develop a fever (temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or above) after COVID-19 vaccination. This usually happens within 48 hours of getting a vaccine. If you feel uncomfortable, take paracetamol or ibuprofen following the instructions on the box or leaflet. Booster doses Many countries have given multiple doses of COVID-19 vaccines. There have not been any unexpected side effects for people who have had multiple boosters. Adapted mRNA vaccines We expect that the side effects of the adapted (bivalent) mRNA vaccines will be similar to the previous Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. The safety of the vaccines will continue to be monitored by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). If you have had anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) to Trometamol, you should not get the adapted mRNA vaccines. Side effects of COVID-19 vaccines The side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines used in Ireland are listed below. Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine side effects The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is called Comirnaty. Pfizer/BioNTech - very common side effects Very common side effects may affect more than 1 in 10 people. These include: - tenderness or swelling in your arm where you had the vaccine - feeling tired - headache - muscle pain - joint pain - diarrhoea - fever (temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or above) - chills For children age 6 months to 23 months, these include: - irritability - drowsiness - redness in the arm where they had the vaccine For children age 6 months to under 2 years, this includes: - decreased appetite Pfizer/BioNTech - common side effects Common side effects may affect up to 1 in 10 people. These include: - nausea - vomiting - redness in your arm where you had the vaccine For children age 6 months to under 2 years, this includes: - a rash Pfizer/BioNTech - uncommon side effects Uncommon side effects may affect up to 1 in 100 people. These include: - itchiness where the vaccine was given - itchiness in general - a rash - swelling of the lymph glands - more often seen after a booster dose - sleeplessness - excessive sweating - night sweats - decreased appetite - lethargy, asthenia (lack of energy) and malaise (feeling unwell) - pain in the arm where you had the vaccine - dizziness Pfizer/BioNTech - rare side effects Rare side effects may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people. These include: - an allergic reaction that can cause hives or swelling of the face - weakness in the muscles on one side of your face (that may cause it to droop temporarily) Pfizer/BioNTech - very rare side effects Very rare side effects may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people. These include: - myocarditis - pericarditis Myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory heart conditions. These conditions are more likely to happen after the second dose. They have mostly been seen within 14 days of getting the vaccine. The risk of these very rare conditions is higher in young men. 2 European studies have estimated the risk of myocarditis in men, after the second dose of the vaccine as: - 1 additional case for every 38,000 men aged 12 to 29 (within 7 days) - 1 additional case for every 17,500 men aged 16 to 24 (within 28 days) We do not know the risk of myocarditis or other rare side effects after a booster dose yet. Symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis Get urgent medical help if you get any of these symptoms in the weeks after the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine: - breathlessness - palpitations (a forceful heartbeat that may be irregular) - chest pain Signs of myocarditis in younger children may be more general including: - irritability - vomiting - difficulty feeding - rapid and shallow breathing - fatigue Pfizer/BioNTech - extremely rare side effects We do not know yet how many people are affected by extremely rare side effects. There is not enough data available at this time. These include: - extensive swelling of the limb where you got your vaccine - tingling or prickling sensation, or loss of sensation in some part of the body - people who have had facial fillers may develop swelling of their face - a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) - erythema multiforme - a skin reaction that causes red spots or patches on the skin. It may look like a target or 'bulls-eye' with a dark red centre surrounded by paler red ring - heavy menstrual bleeding (periods) Who should not get the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine Most people can safely get the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.

These include: - myocarditis - pericarditis Myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory heart conditions. The risk of these very rare conditions is higher in younger men. These conditions are more likely to occur after the second dose and mostly happen within 14 days of getting the vaccine. 2 European studies have estimated the risk of myocarditis, after the second dose of the vaccine as: - 1 additional case for every 7,600 men aged 12 to 29 (within 7 days) - 1 additional case for every 5,320 men aged 16 to 24 (within 28 days) First and second booster doses of mRNA vaccines have not shown any unexpected short-term safety concerns. The risk appears to be comparatively lower following a first booster dose. Data on second booster doses is more limited, but preliminary experience from Israel has not shown any new safety concerns. Symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis Get urgent medical help if you get any of these symptoms in the weeks after the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine: - breathlessness - palpitations (a forceful heartbeat that may be irregular) - chest pain Extremely rare side effects We do not know yet how many people are affected by extremely rare side effects.

It may look like a target or 'bulls-eye' with a dark red centre surrounded by paler red ring - hypersensitivity reactions (unwanted increased response from the immune system) - severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) - flare-ups of capillary leak syndrome - extensive swelling of the vaccinated limb Symptoms of capillary leak syndrome Capillary leak syndrome causes fluid to leak from small blood vessels. There is a possible risk of flare-ups in people with a history of capillary leak syndrome. Even though the risk of the condition is extremely low, you should know the signs to watch for. Get urgent medical help if you get any of these symptoms after the Moderna vaccine: - rapid swelling of the limbs (arms and legs) - sudden weight gain You may also feel faint due to low blood pressure. People usually reported capillary leak syndrome within the first few days of getting this vaccine. Watch out for these symptoms in the days after your vaccination.

This vaccine is not currently available in Ireland. Find a [list of side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine Vaxzevria on the European Medicines Agency website - ema.europa.eu](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/vaxzevria) Reporting side effects of COVID-19 vaccines As with all vaccines, you can report suspected side effects to the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA). If you are reporting a side effect to the HPRA Give as much information as possible. Include the vaccine batch number if you have it. You'll find this on your vaccine record card. You can also ask your doctor or a family member to report side effects for you. The HPRA cannot provide clinical advice on individual cases. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about any medical concerns you may have. Safety of COVID-19 vaccines All vaccines are tested to make sure they are safe and work before they can be used. The HSE only uses a vaccine if it meets the required standards of safety and effectiveness. Most people can have any of the COVID-19 vaccines, but some people are only offered certain vaccines. For example, the Moderna vaccine is only used in adults aged 30 and older. You will be offered the vaccine that is most suitable for you. Mpox vaccine If you recently had the [Mpox vaccine](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/monkeypox/), wait 4 weeks before you get vaccinated with a Pfizer, Moderna or Novavax COVID-19 vaccine. This is a precaution because of the unknown risk of myocarditis. Read more about: This content was fact checked by vaccine experts working in Ireland. "}
