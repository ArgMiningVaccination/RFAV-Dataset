Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 19.5 DHS notes the commentor's concern. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents,, including external events such as a terrorist attack. Risks to human populations at each alternative site were evaluated and discussed in Section 3.14 (Health and Safety) and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS.

Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, The chances of an accidental release are low. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release based on human error are low in large part due to the design and implementation of biocontainment safeguards in conjunction with rigorous personnel training. For example, as described in Section 2.2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS, all laboratory staff would receive thorough pre- operational training, as well as ongoing training, in the handling of hazardous infectious agents, understanding biocontainment functions of standard and special practices for each biosafety level, and understanding biocontainment equipment and laboratory characteristics. Appendix B to the EIS describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large. As set out in Section 3.14.3.4 of the NBAF EIS, employees and contractors will be screened prior to employment or engagement and monitored while working, among other security measures. In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHISChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-779 Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Chapter 1, Section 1.1 of the NBAF EIS identifies DHS's mission as the study of foreign animal and zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) diseases that threaten our agricultural livestock and agricultural economy. The goal or benefit of NBAF is to prevent these animal diseases from spreading in the United States through research into the transmission of these animal diseases and the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and antiviral therapies. DHS believes that experience shows that facilities utilizing modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF, would enable NBAF to be safely operated with a minimal degree of risk, regardless of the site chosen. Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 5.0 DHS notes the commentor's preference for upgrading the existing Plum Island facility. The proposed NBAF requires BSL-4 capability to meet mission requirements (DHS and USDA). PIADC does not have BSL-4 laboratory or animal space, and the existing PIADC facilities are inadequate to support a BSL-4 laboratory. Upgrading the existing facilities to allow PIADC to meet the current mission would be more costly than building the NBAF on Plum Island, as discussed in Section 2.4.1 of the NBAF EIS. However, the NBAF EIS fully analyzes the Plum Island Site Alternative. Comment No: 7 Issue Code: 5.0 As described in 2.4.3 of the NBAF EIS, DHS considered other potential locations to construct the NBAF including a desert. However, the evaluation criteria called for proximity to research programs that could be linked to the NBAF mission and proximity to a technical workforce. Comment No: 8 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's preference for siting the NBAF in a remote location.

DHS has conducted public meetings in excess of the minimum required by NEPA regulations; to date, 23 public meetings have been held in the vicinity of NBAF site alternatives and in Washington D.C. to solicit public input on the EIS, allow the public to voice their concerns, and to get their questions answered DHS has also provided fact sheets, reports, exhibits, and a Web page (http://www.dhs.gov/nbaf). Additionally, various means of communication (mail, toll-free telephone and fax lines, and NBAF Web site) have been provided to facilitate public comment. It is DHS policy to encourage public input on matters of national and international importance.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-787 Czarzasty, Nancy Page 2 of 3 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-788 Dear Senator Lieberman, I am writing to you regarding my concerns over the proposed construction of the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBADF) on the grounds of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC). On 11 August, my wife and I attended the forum to discuss the Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed facility that was held in Old Saybrook. What deeply concerns me is the lack of information that was made available to the citizens of Old Saybrook and the surrounding municipalities regarding the public forum and the overall proposal for the NBAF. DHS did a very poor job in advertising the forum and chose outlets for information that are not typically used by the residents of Old Saybrook. I have polled residents of my neighborhood and several citizens of our town and have consistently found that NO ONE is aware of the plans for PIADC and NBAF. I have seen no mention of this in local broadcast media and a small announcement that was printed in a local paper that is rarely read by the average citizen. I happened to come across the ad by chance, thankfully. DHS seems to have focused on New York for the information campaign; however, Connecticut is a major stakeholder in this proposal due to geography and the fact that PIADC employees use the marina at Saybrook Point as a transit point for travel to and from the facility by a federally-run ferry. My experience has been that Old Saybrook citizens are generally very civically-aware and, had they known about this proposal, would have attended last night's forum in significant numbers. I would like to request your intervention in moving the closing date for public comment, currently set for 25 August, to a later date and that DHS make a concerted effort to inform Connecticut's citizens of this colossal project and the potential environmental and security concerns that come with it. Thank you in advance for your intervention. James P. Czarzasty WD0334 Czarzasty, Nancy Page 3 of 3 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-789 D, Jess Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.0 DHS notes the commentor's 2 Issue Code: 15.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but DHS acknowledges that the possible economic effect would be significant for all sites. Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF DEIS presents estimates of the possible economic effect of an accidental release. Specifically, a virus released to the environment could become established and result in significant economic harm through damage to the livestock industry (culling and export bans) from FMD or through increased public health costs associated with the treatment of humans infected with the causal agent of RVF or Nipah. It should be noted that a primary objective of the NBAF is to combat the spread of viruses that could enter the US inadvertently or as the result of a terrorism act. Hence, the risk of operating the NBAF must be balanced against the potential benefits of the research that would be conducted at the facility. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 1.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding NBAF. As described in Chapter 1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS's mission is to study foreign animal, zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) and emerging diseases that threaten our agricultural livestock and agricultural economy. NBAF will research the transmission of these animal diseases and develop diagnostic tests, vaccines, and antiviral therapies for foreign animal, zoonotic and emerging diseases. By proposing to construct the NBAF, DHS is following policy direction established by the Congress and the President.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-790 Dallmeyer, Dorinda Page 1 of 2 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 13.2 Section 3.8.9 provides a detailed analysis of the potential effects of an accidental release on wildlife. Although the Draft EIS acknowledges the potential for significant impacts on other species of wildlife in the event of an accidental release, the risk of such a release is extremely low (see Section 3.14). It has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas and in areas with abundant wildlife. State-of-the-art biocontainment facilities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF. Furthermore, the purpose of NBAF is to combat diseases that could have significant effects on wildlife. Research at the NBAF would include the development of vaccines for wildlife that could prevent adverse impacts from a foreign introduction. Suitable habitat for white- tailed deer is abundant in the vicinity of the proposed NBAF site, and the Draft EIS states that deer are abundant and widespread in the vicinity of the site. White-tailed deer generally occur as solitary individuals or in small groups, and small group size and limited interaction among groups may potentially limit the spread of a disease such as FMD. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 15.2 DHS notes the commentor's reference to more recent statistics and has updated Section 3.10 of the NBAF FEIS sections appropriately. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 21.2 The DHS notes the commentor's concern with the risks to wildlife associated with a pathogen release. The NBAF would provide state-of-the-art biocontainment features and operating procedures to minimize the potential for laboratory-acquired infections and accidental releases. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Sections 3.8.9, 3.10.9, and 3.14 (Health and Safety), and Appendices B, D, and E of the NBAF EIS, provide a detailed analysis of the consequences from a accidental or deliberate pathogen release. Pathogen release scenarios include for example, an analysis of the potential consequences of Rift Vally Fever (RVF) virus becoming established in native mosquito populations. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF then site specific protocols and emergency response plans would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies that would consider the diversity and density of human, livestock, and wildlife populations residing within the area. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. RVF and FMD standard operating procedures and response plans would likely include strategies that are similar. However, the RVF response plan would also include a mosquito control action plan.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-791 Dallmeyer, Dorinda Page 2 of 2 Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 5.0 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the five mainland site alternatives. The conclusions expressed in Section 3.14 of the NBAF EIS show that even though Plum Island has a lower potential impact in case of a release, the probability of a release is low at all sites. The lower potential effect is due both to the water barrier around the island and the lack of livestock and suseptible wildlife species. In addition, security concerns will be considered in the selection of the preferred alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-792 From: Heaton, Sarah (CDC/CCEHIP/NCEH) NBAF Program Manager, Attached are the official comments sent on behalf of DHHS and the US Public Health Service.

As described in Section 2.2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS, all laboratory staff would receive thorough pre-operational training, as well as ongoing training in the handling of hazardous infectious agents, understanding biocontainment functions of standard and special practices for each biosafety level, and understanding biocontainment equipment and laboratory characteristics. While human errors are possible, training and inherent biocontainment safeguards reduce the likelihood of a release. Procedures and plans to operate the NBAF will include the Institutional Biosafety Committee, which will include community representatives as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS. Should a decision be made to build NBAF and the site selected, DHS would begin transition and operational planning which would include consideration of policies and procedures for public participation, education, and also public advisory initiatives. After DHS determines the viability and nature of such a public advisory and oversight function, appropriate roles and responsibilities would be defined. Chapter 3, Section 3.14 investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. A site-specific emergency response plan would be developed and coordinated with the local emergency management plan and individual facility plans regarding evacuations and other emergency response measures for all potential emergency events including accidents at the NBAF, and which would include stipulations for all special-needs populations. Specifically, DHS would offer coordination and training to local medical personnel regarding the effects of pathogens to be studied at the NBAF. Emergency management plans would also include training for local law enforcement, health care, and fire and rescue personnel. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 19.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern. A discussion of human health and safety is included in Section 3.14 of the NBAF EIS. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. Section 2.2.2 of the NBAF EIS identifies the need to develop basic safety protocols and guidelines prior to construction and operation of the NBAF. These protocols would include plans for medical emergencies, facility malfunctions, fires, animals escaping within the laboratory, and other potential emergencies. Training in emergency response procedures would be provided to emergency response personnel and other responsible staff according to institutional policies. Many of the training and testing requirements are to maintain certification and licensure to operate a laboratory, which generally take up to a year beyond the construction phase to complete. The BMBL is the primary guidance source to ensure a safe and effective testing and training program for successful state-of- the-art biocontainment laboratory facilities. Section 2.2.1.2 of the NBAF EIS identifies the need for safety protocols during construction.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-794 4 No: 3 Issue Code: 23.0 DHS notes the commentor's statement. No: 4 Issue Code: 21.0 DHS appreciates the commentor's data and information. The references addressed in the EIS are intended to provide information and considerations tailored to a release event within the United States. The NBAF would provide state-of-the-art operating procedures and biocontainment features to minimize the potential for laboratory-acquired infections and accidental releases. Nevertheless, should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF, then site specific protocols and emergency response plans would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies, that would consider all appropriate and relevant plans that have been developed in response to a natural or accidental animal disease outbreak. The Australia Hendra virus infection occurred at the Redlands Veterinary Clinic, which is not a BSL containment facility, so no update is necessary to the appendix. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 4.0 DHS notes commentor's request and will comply. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-795 WD0887 Dannenberg, Andrew Page 4 of 4 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 1.0 DHS notes the commentor's statement.

Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.2 DHS acknowledges commentor's statement that safety at the NBAF is not guaranteed. DHS also notes that the risk of an accidental release of a pathogen from the NBAF is extreemly low. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release based on human error are low in large part due to the design and implementation of biocontainment safeguards in conjunction with rigorous personnel training. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. For example, as described in Section 2.2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS, all laboratory staff would receive thorough pre-operational training, as well as ongoing training, in the handling of hazardous infectious agents, understanding biocontainment functions of standard and special practices for each biosafety level, and understanding biocontainment equipment and laboratory characteristics. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Oversite of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 5.0 As described in Section 2.3.1, DHS's site selection process including site selection criteria that included, but were not limited to, such factors as proximity to research capabilities and workforce.

This thoroughness on their part is muchappreciated. I also strongly urged that those local regulatory provisions be adhered to in the construction of this facility should Athens be chosen, which I hope it will. Since that time, the Executive Order noted here has come to my attention.Executive Order: Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070124 -2.html # In reviewing this document it is clear to me that the President has sent a strong message to all federal departments regarding the importance of managing projects in ways that address long term environmental sustainability, which mirrors the goals of the ordinances within our Athens-Clarke County code. CDC's new LEED certified building is the example of this executive order in practice, on the ground. In my comments, I also strongly urged DHS to use LEED standards for NBAF suggesting that if such a building could be constructed at the CDC then there seemed little reason why one couldn't be built elsewhere. Our strong, local environmental ordinances should work in concert with President Bush's executive order to ensure a building that truly is 'green' and enhances versus degrades the site upon which it rests, its surroundings, and the overall quality of the community. I would like to have this email with the noted executive order considered as an amendment to my statement of August 14th. Thank you very much for your consideration.1| 4.2 2| 24.2 3| 3.0 4| 23.2 4 cont.| 23.2WD0493 0 0 Davison, Heidi Page 1 of 7 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 4.2 DHS notes the commentor's statement.

DHS is committed to providing public access to pertinent information and encouraging public input on matters of national and international importance.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-808 NCD008 1|2.0 Dayton, Susan Page 1 of 2 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes commentor's concern that NBAF not become involved in bioweapons research. Chapter 1, Section 1.1 of the NBAF EIS clearly identifies NBAF's mission as defensive which would preclude involvement in offensive bioweapons research or development. The international treaty known as the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, to which the United States is a signatory, prohibits the development, production, stockpiling and acquisition of such weapons. DHS's mission is to study foreign animal and zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) diseases that threaten our agricultural livestock and agricultural economy. The goal of NBAF is to prevent these animal diseases from spreading in the United States through research into the transmission of these animal diseases and the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and antiviral therapies.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-809 NCD008 1 cont.| 2.0 Dayton, Susan Page 2 of 2 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-810 De Jong, Nellie Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.0 DHS notes the commentor's opposition the NBAF. No: 2 Issue Code: 21.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern about the risk to health and safety from the NBAF operation. DHS believes that experience shows that facilities utilizing modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF, would enable NBAF to be safely operated with a minimal degree of risk, regardless of the site chosen. The NBAF would provide state-of-the-art biocontainment features and operating procedures to minimize the potential for laboratory-acquired infections and accidental releases. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Sections 3.8.9, 3.10.9, 3.14, and Appendices B, D, and E of the NBAF EIS, provide a detailed analysis of the consequences from a accidental or deliberate pathogen release. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF then site specific protocols and emergency response plans would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies that would consider the diversity and density of human, livestock, and wildlife populations residing within the area. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. It has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. An example is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, where such facilities employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-811 Dean, Justin Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.2 DHS notes the commentor's support for the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 15.2 DHS notes the commentor's support for the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. The economic effects of the NBAF at the are included in Section 3.10.3. Labor income during construction is projected at approximately $150 million while operation of the NBAF would generate approximately $28 million in wages annually.

DHS held a competitive process to select potential sites for the proposed NBAF as described in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS. A team of federal employees representing multi-department component offices and multi-governmental agencies (i.e., DHS, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and Department of Health and Human Services) reviewed the submissions based primarily on environmental suitability and proximity to research capabilities, proximity to workforce, acquisition/construction/operations, and community acceptance. Ultimately, DHS identified five site alternatives that surpassed others in meeting the evaluation criteria and DHS preferences, and determined that they, in addition to the Plum Island Site, would be evaluated in the EIS as alternatives for the proposed NBAF. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 13.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the proximity of the site to the State Botanical Garden/Whitehall Forest Important Bird Area (IBA). As indicated in Sections 3.8.3.2 and 3.8.3.3 of the NBAF EIS, construction and normal operations of the NBAF would have no direct impact on the State Botanical Garden/Whitehall Forest IBA. Terrestrial, aquatic, and rare and endangered species that occur in the vicinity of the proposed NBAF are addressed in Sections 3.8.3.1.3, 3.8.3.1.4, and 3.8.3.1.5 of the NBAF EIS. The NBAF would affect primarily pasture areas that have low wildlife habitat value due to their disturbed condition, lack of native vegetation, and lack of wildlife food and cover. The forested portion of the NBAF site along the Oconee River is a high value riparian wildlife corridor that connects the State Botanical Garden/Whitehall Forest IBA. However, impacts to the forested riparian area would be minor (0.2 acre), and these impacts would occur within the existing pasture fence-line in areas that have been disturbed by grazing. The high value forested riparian corridor would be preserved; and therefore, the proposed NBAF would not have significant direct impacts on wildlife dispersal between the Botanical Garden and the Whitehall Forest IBA. Mitigation measures would include the use of low impact development (LID) techniques, which would minimize the potential for adverse impacts associated with stormwater runoff. The potential impacts of an accidental release on wildlife are addressed in Section 3.8.9. Although the NBAF EIS acknowledges the potential for significant impacts on other species of wildlife in the event of an accidental release, the risk of such a release is extremely low (see Section 3.14). It has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas and in areas with abundant wildlife. State-of-the-art biocontainment facilities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF. Furthermore, the purpose of NBAF is to combat diseases that could have significant effects on wildlife. Research at the NBAF would include the development of vaccines for wildlife that could prevent adverse impacts from a foreign introduction. Construction would occur primarily on pasture areas that lack trees. The project would impact a small portion (0.2 acre) of the forested area, and would impact a minimal number of trees.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-815 Trees would not be removed from the remaining forested areas. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 6.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding development of the South Milledge Avenue Site which is described in Section 3.2.3. A change in land use and loss of open space would occur; however, current zoning regulations allow for this type of development. The South Milledge Avenue Site is currently zoned as \"Governmental\", and construction and operation of the NBAF is consistent with this designation. However, the Clarke County Comprehensive Plan designates the South Milledge Avenue Site as \"rural\", so an amendment to the comprehensive plan may be required. This information has been added to the NBAF EIS in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.3. DHS and USDA would ensure that the NBAF operation at the South Milledge Avenue Site will comply with all applicable local, state, and Federal regulations and policies. The specific design of the NBAF including its physical configuration will be determined during the final design phase.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-816 a strip commercial corridor that could be revitalized into a more attractive village development pattern); or Requires special attention due to unique development issues (rapid change of development patterns, economic decline, etc.).

The Oconee County Government should have been taking steps to make sure their community is protected according to the plan, which was just released last summer. For a project of this magnitude, A site selection study should have been performed prior to \"requests for expressions of interest \". An environmental impact study should have been drafted as one of the first steps in the process, to identify the safest and best possible site for the world's largest BSL-4 lab. \"Interest\" in a project should have little weight in this endeavor and should be weighed accordingly. (I may be interested in constructing a rocket launch pad in my backyard, but that doesn't make it the best or safest place) Also, at a February 18 th \"Town Hall\" meeting, the DHS informed the community that there would \"no human quarantine \" in the case of an accidental or intentional release of a pathogen from NBAF.

DHS held a competitive process to select potential sites for the proposed NBAF as described in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS. A team of Federal employees representing multi- department component offices and multi-governmental agencies (DHS, U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA], and Department of Health and Human Services [HHS]) reviewed the submissions based primarily on environmental suitability and proximity to research capabilities, proximity to workforce, acquisition/construction/operations, and community acceptance. Ultimately, DHS identified five site alternatives that surpassed others in meeting the evaluation criteria and DHS preferences, and determined that they, in addition to the Plum Island Site, would be evaluated in the EIS as alternatives for the proposed NBAF. DHS prepared the NBAF EIS in accordance with the of NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and CEQ's regulations for implementing NEPA (40 CFR 1500 et seq.). The primary objective of the EIS is to evaluate the environmental impacts of a range of reasonable alternatives for locating, constructing and operating the NBAF and the No Action Alternative. As summarized in Section 3.1, DHS analyzed each environmental resource area in a consistent manner across all the alternatives to allow for a fair comparison among the alternatives. DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding the extent of public participation in the site selection process, which is described in Section 2.3.1. Since the inception of the NBAF project, DHS has supported a vigorous public outreach program. DHS has conducted public meetings in excess of the minimum required by NEPA regulations; to date, 23 public meetings have been held in the vicinity of NBAF site alternatives and in Washington D.C. to solicit public input on the EIS, allow the public to voice their concerns, and to get their questions answered DHS has also provided fact sheets, reports, exhibits, and a Web page (http://www.dhs.gov/nbaf). Additionally, various means of communication (mail, toll-free telephone and fax lines, and NBAF Web site) have been provided to facilitate public comment. It is DHS policy to encourage public input on matters of national and international importance.All comments received during the 60-day comment period on the NBAF Draft EIS, both oral and written, were given equal consideration in finalizing the NBAF EIS, regardless of how they were submitted. DHS's responses to those comments are included in this Comment Response Document. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 19.2 DHS notes the commentor's request for information on the provisions of the USDA emergency response plan for FMD. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site, site specific protocols would then be developed in coordination with local emergency response agencies and would consider the diversity and density of populations residing within the local area, to include agricultural livestock. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. Emergency response plans will include the current USDA emergency response plan for foot and mouth disease (FMD) which does not includeChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-818 provisions for human quarantine. Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 26.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern. A site-specific emergency response plan would be developed and coordinated with the local emergency management plan regarding evacuations and other emergency response measures for all potential emergency events including accidents at the NBAF. The type of, duration, and geographical extent of quarantine would be determined by the appropriate authorities depending on the pathogen released and contamination level. Section 3.2 discusses land use and visual. DHS held a competitive process to select potential sites for the proposed NBAF as described in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS. A team of federal employees representing multi-department component offices and multi-governmental agencies (i.e., DHS, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and Department of Health and Human Services) reviewed the submissions based primarily on environmental suitability and proximity to research capabilities, proximity to workforce, acquisition/construction/operations, and community acceptance. Ultimately, DHS identified five site alternatives that surpassed others in meeting the evaluation criteria and DHS preferences, and determined that they, in addition to the Plum Island Site, would be evaluated in the EIS as alternatives for the proposed NBAF.

I strongly feel it is your obligation to inform local citizens of just what exactly happens at a Biodefense Lab. Thanks, Matt Below is an Editorial from the October 17th New York Times.Island Fever By MICHAEL CHRISTOPHER CARROLL Published: October 17, 2004 Bellmore \u2014 This summer, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center off the east end of Long Island suffered two outbreaks of the foot-and-mouth virus, one of many microbes researched and stored there. Despite letters from federal, county and town officials, researchers from the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Agriculture failed to disclose the outbreaks, which took place in June and July, until nearly a month after the second occurrence. The public learned of them only after an anonymous tip reached the ears of a reporter. While the virus can cause illness in humans, it is not fatal. But these latest accidents raise the specter of a future outbreak of other germs with lethal consequences. They also represent another instance in a long history of failed and belated disclosures at Plum Island. Unless changes are made, the government should close the lab. Plum Island has a long and checkered history. It began as the brainchild of a German biological warfare scientist, Erich Traub, who was secretly smuggled into the United States in 1949 to perform biological weapons research for the Central Intelligence Agency, the Army and the Navy. The laboratory was established in 1954 by the Army to research exotic germs for use against enemy food supplies. In the mid-1950's, the Army turned over control of Plum Island to the Department of Agriculture, which in turn relinquished much of it to the Department of Homeland Security last year. A number of the germs researched on Plum Island are dangerous to humans and animals and some are lethal, including the mosquito-borne Rift Valley fever virus, which causes hemorrhagic fever akin to the Ebola virus and killed 600 people in Egypt in 1977 and 1978. During the 1980's and early 1990's, Plum Island was charged with more than 260 violations of workplace safety law violations by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, including improper disposal of virus syringes and radioactive cobalt-60, unlabeled and mislabeled hazardous chemical containers and workers bitten and trampled by test animals. In addition, 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 5 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-820 according to the Environmental Protection Agency, from the mid-1990's to 2002 there were violations of state and federal environmental laws, including illegal animal sewage discharges into local waters under the Clean Water Act. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation described the environmental pollution as troubling, and in December 2002, the island made the National Resources Defense Council's \"Dirty Dozen\" list of the 12 worst polluters in New York and New Jersey. After the Sept. 11 attacks, a file with information on Plum Island was found by American forces in Afghanistan in the Kabul residence of Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood, a former nuclear scientist from Pakistan whom American officials have identified as an associate of Osama bin Laden. Last year, the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, found that laboratory officials \"have not adequately controlled access to the pathogens.\" Ostensibly in response to this and concerns raised by elected officials, in July Plum Island bolstered the small 24-hour detail provided by a private security firm with part-time federally trained armed guards. Plum Island administrators claim that the laboratories are as safe \"as a federal courthouse.\" They stress that the scientists work only on animal pathogens, particularly diseases that affect farm animals. They say that Plum Island is well protected, and that they meticulously detail biological safety and security practices to reporters with whom they've pledged to be forthright about problems that arise. They boast on their Web site that they are \"proud\" of their safety record. But the foot-and-mouth outbreaks that occurred this summer raise important questions: How did it happen? Were proper safety measures followed? What is being done to prevent it from happening again? To address some of these problems, several security measures should be taken. First, armed couriers should be employed to transport the foreign germs that arrive at nearby international airports and are carried along Connecticut and New York roads. Moreover, emergency first responders like county fire and police officials should be notified of each trip and be properly equipped and prepared to respond to a biological accident or terrorist attack. Second, the Department of Homeland Security must enforce a no-flight zone over Plum Island. And third, the department must re-establish full federal control of the island. Plum Island's biological containment, security, sewage and water systems are now run by a private contractor, but the work being done there is too dangerous to be in private hands. By contrast, Plum Island's sister laboratory in Ames, Iowa, holds less dangerous germs and it is not privatized. In fact, in 2003, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa blocked an effort to install private contractors there. The Ames laboratory, he said, is \"a vital function of the federal government, and it should remain the responsibility of federal employees.\" New York's elected officials should follow Mr. Harkin's lead. Until these steps are taken, Plum Island will remain a threat to its neighbors and a soft target for terrorism. The scientists at Plum Island need to recognize that their laboratory needs an overhaul, and our elected leaders need to force real change there, before we all have to pay the price.7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 6 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-821 Michael Christopher Carroll is the author of \"Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Plum Island Germ Laboratory.\" http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/opinion/opinionspecial/17LIcarroll.html?ei=5070&en=606 159e78c95ac23&ex=1184385600&pagewanted=print&position =\" I received the following response from Rebecca Quigley on 7/16/07 : \"Thanks for writing, Matt.

I sincerely hope you will do far more than keep my \"concern\" \"in mind\". This is not about me or my concerns.All the coverage thus far on the NBAF - a facility that will house the world's most deadly diseases and is a potential terrorist target - has been basically centered on the opinions of the University, local economic organizations, and two political hopefuls. I would call this coverage \"reporting\", but the recording of a person's quotations is better defined as stenography. There has been no reporting on what impact the NBAF will have on the community. The community has no way to judge whether this is \"good\" or \"bad\" because they have zero information about just what a bio safety level 4 lab is, or its history at Plum Island. Beside these extremely relevant safety concerns, it may be of interest to the community to look at just how many of these much ballyhooed jobs are being offered by this proposal.

The University there was offered NO contract to run the facility. Will the Athens- Banner Herald be reporting on this? And is it the same deal here? There was once a law that required that foot and mouth disease could only be studied at Plum Island, due to it being located offshore. That law was changed in the 1990s, but why? The Department of Agriculture's website claims that \"Today, modern biocontainment facility construction and rigorous biosafety operational standards allow such work to be safely done without fear of virus escape to the environment or harm to animal and/or pubic health.\", but provides no specifics - especially with regard to the NBAF. Will the Athens Banner Herald be reporting on this? Has there been a risk analysis done by UGA? What about the safety record of Plum Island? How often will these diseases be transported, and what will they be transported in? Are animal rights activists going to target the facility? Is it a good idea to put this right on the Oconee River? Homeland Security in the next year will be looking to see what happens with studies of environmental impacts and community acceptance in its final five locations. The Banner-Herald yesterday endorsed the lab as a dream come true, without any apparent investigation of this project. How is the community to act with informed intelligence about this issue if journalists are turned into cheerleaders? I am forwarding this e-mail to The Oconee Enterprise, The Flagpole and The AJC in the hope that this might be covered elsewhere, as the Athens Banner Herald's obvious bias has affected the reporting of this issue. You have done an outstanding job of recording the ecstatic responses of a select few, but that is neither journalism nor the news. That's marketing. The DHS and UGA all have public relations people assigned to task of promoting the NBAF. Since The Herald has so far not done any real reporting, the community is left with nothing. Thanks, Matt DeGennaro\" To which she responded on the same day: \"I have reported on what the lab would involve when it first was in the news. We have written about what BSL level 4 means and also have related it to the Animal Health Research Center and the troubles it has gone through to get built, and what members of the community thought about that. It is very difficult proposition to write stories that weigh heavily on the scare factor, esp. Plum Island, without being biased in the other direction, especially before it was known whether Athens was to be a finalist. Now that the South Milledge site is a finalist, I have been planning a community response story for Thursday's paper.

I have been trying in vain to use the search function on the Athens Banner Herald's website to find the article you are referring to. I've been typing in \"NBAF\" and have been getting no articles that mention what a BSL 4 is or how it's been related to the troubles over getting the Animal Research Center built. I don't know if it's me or the search engine that's at fault. Can you please provide me with a link to the story or stories you are referring to? I am in no way insinuating that this story be covered with a slant towards a \"scare factor\". I am just simply asking why it is not being fully covered. There are the people who want the NBAF built here, who we have heard from. There is the community, which we will hear from in Thursday's paper. And then there are the cold objective facts of just what is being proposed. All the questions I posed in the earlier e-mails were asked in an effort to get at these facts. At least two other communities have opposed the NBAF. That's not something to be reported on in an effort to scare people - that's a fact. I do not personally know anyone who lives right near the proposed site. I would imagine their opinion would be indifferent at best, as they have had no easy access to an objective source of information over what the NBAF is. I would suggest that you extend your focus a little further that people in a 5 mile radius, as something of this magnitude affects the entire community of both Athens and Oconee County . (You might want to talk to the gentleman who run Peppino's Pizza. His business is literally right across the street on Whitehall Road.) Again, this should not be about any \"scare factor\", it should just be about what is going on. This whole NBAF issue seems to be an example of people in power spinning the facts, before the facts were even reported. Again, how can anyone in the community judge when they have not been informed? I look forward to your coverage. 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 9 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-824 Thanks, Matt\" To which she responded (7/16/07): \"I'm sorry Matt.

Only moments after Athens ended up on the shortlist for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility, my inbox was flooded with the usual suspects begging us to \"do our homework\" and \"tell the truth\" about the proposed facility. Thanks for the heads up, folks\" For some reason, one was not allowed to comment on the blog. I informed Winders of this in an e-mail on 7/18/07. The exchange is as follows: \"Mr. Winders, The comments on your blog seem to be broken. I was wondering if you might post the following. Thanks, Matt DeGennaro 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 12 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-827 First off, under the \"Find Out More\" page on the UGA \"valuable site for reference\" there is an e-mail address( nbaf@uga.edu )which bounces back your e-mail. Want to \"find out more?\" You'll get your mail returned with the message \"No Such Mailbox\" Secondly, I am not one of the \"usual suspects\" you refer to. I moved to Oconee County almost 3 years ago, and this is the first time I have written to you or any other local newspaper. Regarding safety concerns, I think you are confusing what you call \"fear-mongering\" with the simple reporting of facts. So far, The ABH has only reported on people's reactions to the proposal - but very little about just what the NBAF is. To glibly accuse the community of playing a \"fear card\" when all they ask of their local paper is an objective report on what is being p roposed is shameful. People are looking to your paper for information about the NBAF, only to find ecstatic reactions, pie in the sky predictions and unsubstantiated promises. The hype generated about the NBAF has become the story. So what is the NBAF?The NBAF that is being proposed for the corner of South Milledge and Whitehall is actually a relocation of the Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center (PIADC). Diseases studied there are foot-and-mouth disease, classical swine fever, and vesicular stomatitis virus. The PIADC was a Bio Level 3 Lab, The NBAF will be a Bio Level 4 and will provide a place for scientists to research zoonotic diseases such as the West Nile Virus, avian influenza and anthrax. According to UGA's site, \" BSL-4 labs are used to study agents that pose a high risk of life-threatening disease for which no vaccine or therapy is available. Lab personnel are required to wear full-body, air-supplied suits and to shower when exiting the facility.\" Once upon a time, there was a law that prohibited studying foot-and-mouth disease on the United States mainland in order to prevent an outbreak. The PIADC was the only laboratory in the U.S. to do this, as they were located offshore. But \"In 1990, the original 1884 statute was amended, 21 U.S.C. 113a, to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to issue a permit for FMD live virus work on the U.S. mainland when necessary and in the public interest.\" And I guess that permit is about to be issued for the NBAF. According to this USDA document, \"Today, modern biocontainment facility construction and rigorous biosafety operational standards allow such work to be safely done without fear of virus escape to the environment or harm to animal and/or pubic health.\"(http://www.usda.gov/documents/07title7.doc ) As a side note, it's interesting to see the Department of Homeland Security say this in a June 6, 2003 Fact Sheet regarding the transition of Plum Island: \"The island setting and biocontainment facilities of PIADC permit safe and secure research. PIADC biocontainment facilities operate at a Biosafety Level 3. DHS has no plans in the near or long term for a Biosafety Level 4 facility\" http://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/press_release_0176.shtm7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 13 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-828 Plum Island did not have the best of safety records. This is not an opinion, this is a fact. From a 2003 article from The Scientist: \"The probe revealed that USDA officials once allowed eight foreign scientists free rein in the biocontainment area where diseases are stored, even though they had never undergone mandatory federal background checks. Foreign students attending classes at the facility never underwent such checks either. Because guards carried unauthorized firearms, local police departments refused to agree to provide assistance during potential bioterrorist attacks.\" It's not fear-mongering to report that the previous home of the NBAF was a potential terrorist target, it is a fact: \"After the Sept. 11 attacks, a file with information on Plum Island was found by American forces in Afghanistan in the Kabul residence of Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood, a former nuclear scientist from Pakistan whom American officials have identified as an associate of Osama bin Laden. Last year, the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, found that laboratory officials \"have not adequately controlled access to the pathogens.\"\" http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/opinion/opinionspecial/17LIcarroll.html?ex=1184558400& en=750afc1e19fa66f0&ei=5070 And regarding all those 250-300 \"high paying\" jobs we keep hearing being ballyhooed about? Well, that's what I was writing the UGA NBAF site about. After my e-mail was bounced back, I contacted a Ms. Hastings, who is listed on the site as a media contact and was kind enough to write me back. I wanted to find out where the 250-300 number originated, and if what other towns were saying was true - that having the NBAF here wouldn't actually create any jobs, as they would all be filled by the current staff of Plum Island.

Has there been a risk analysis done by UGA? What about the safety record of Plum Island? How often will these diseases be transported, and what will they be transported in?

Quigley | rebecca.quigley@onlineathens.com | Story updated at 11:55 PM on Wednesday, April 25, 2007 A team of Homeland Security officials inspected two sites in Athens on Tuesday as they consider 17 proposals from 11 states for a new National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility. In March 2006, Gov. Sonny Perdue's office, the University of Georgia and the state Department of Economic Development submitted two proposals to homeland security to build the facility on UGA-owned properties off College Station Road and South Milledge Avenue. The center will provide research and development space to combat bio- and agro-terrorism threats and emerging disease pandemics, especially those, such as avian flu, that can transfer from animals to humans. Tuesday's visitors, led by James Johnson, head of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's office of national laboratories, met with representatives of the Georgia Consortium for Health and Agro-Security, led by David Lee, UGA vice president for research. Sometime next week, the Homeland Security undersecretary will visit the sites, Lee said. UGA's main proposal offers up a $13.3 million, 72-acre natural area between the North Oconee River, a federal poultry research laboratory and the Richard B. Russell Research Center off College Station Road. The team is expected to announce three to five finalists at the end of June and a final site in October 2008. Construction is expected to begin in 2010 and open in 2013. 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 18 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-833 Members of the team refused to comment about Tuesday's visit and their meetings at UGA were conducted behind closed doors because the law allows government officials to discuss real estate acquisition in private, said Homeland Security spokesman Chris Kelly. The team heard presentations from UGA scientists and President Michael Adams, Gov. Sonny Perdue, University System Chancellor Erroll Davis, Athens Technical College President Flora Tydings, Athens-Clarke Mayor Heidi Davison, and representatives from Emory University, the state Department of Economic Development, the Georgia Research Alliance, the Georgia Poultry Federation, Georgia Power Co. and Athens-based animal vaccine company Merial. \"What I wanted to convey to them was that this is a good community to live in,\" Davison said. Davison told the visitors that UGA leaders have done a good job keeping people informed about the proposal and because Athens has a very educated and engaged citizenry, the public has kept a close eye on the proposal and what it will mean for the community, she said. In Perdue's prepared statement to the visitors, he touted Georgia's fast-growing population, the proposed site's proximity to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and the plethora of innovations Georgia researchers have made in bio-technology, agriculture and animal and human disease prevention. \"I don't think our story was dramatically different\" from the materials the consortium submitted so far, Lee said. \"(But) I think they wanted to hear it first hand.\" The visit gave consortium members the chance to demonstrate, in person, how they and other health and agricultural organizations in Georgia have a history of working together on many projects, Lee said. Homeland Security officials briefed the Georgia group about the site selection process and then allowed them to present selling points, including the proposed sites' proximity to a trained workforce and research facilities. The Homeland Security visitors didn't indicate whether they liked Georgia's proposal, but Lee said he wasn't expecting any feedback. The University System of Georgia Board of Regents last week agreed to deed either of the two proposed UGA sites to Homeland Security should federal officials choose a site at UGA. UGA officials have said they plan to partner with Athens Technical College to train some of the workers the facility will need. UGA leaders must incorporate feedback from residents within a 60-mile radius of the site and show that they have either received community input or have a specific plan to draw feedback from area residents, Kelly said.7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 19 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-834 Published in the Athens Banner-Herald on 042507 http://onlineathens.com/stories/042507/news_20070425061.shtml \" \"Matt, the same response from DHS indicated that each situation is different, hence they were not going to set artificial requirements but rather leave it to the better judgement of each consortium.

I'm interested in what information has been presented to the community so far by UGA with regards to the NBAF. Below is an excerpt from a letter I just sent to The Flagpole. Thanks, Matt DeGennaro \"It's interesting to compare the coverage of The Columbia Daily Tribune - the local paper of Columbia, Missouri, a town that was formerly in the running for the NBAF - with that of The Athens Banner-Herald. When Columbia was first discussing the NBAF proposal, residents of the town were informed of a public meeting by their newspaper. On March 21, 2006 - more than a year ago - The Columbia Daily Tribune ran a story titled \"Biomedical Facilites to Be Discussed\", printing the date and time of the meeting. Two days later they ran a follow-up story \"Defense Lab Plan Spooks Neighborhood, \" which described the community's reaction and included an e-mail address for \"Anyone interested in commenting to university officials about proposed research facilities\" The Athens Banner-Herald has covered none of the four meetings listed on the UGA website set up for NBAF information. In June, 2007, The Department of Homeland Security released a list of eight \"diseases of interest\" that could be studied at a National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility. The Columbia Daily Tribune ran them with the headline \"List of Diseases Shows Possible Contents of Lab. \" They talked to an animal disease researcher at the University of Missouri, (who said he wasn't even familiar with some of the more unusual diseases on the list) and printed detailed descriptions of the diseases, devoting a paragraph to each. The Athens Banner-Herald did not report the list of diseases. During the course of reporting about the NBAF, its headlines read \"Senators Hoping Georgia's 'Assets' Will Win Fed Lab\" and \"UGA Chief Likes Biodefense Chances\". On the editorial pages of The Columbia Tribune, you find columns with titles such as \" Proposed Lab Puts Residents At Risk\", \"Lab's Safety Rests on Too Many Unknowns\" , and \"'Death Lab' Isn't the Growth We Need\". On the editorial pages of the Banner-Herald you'll read columns titled \" Leaders Should Come Together to Gain 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 21 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-836 Facility\" \"Defense Facility Seems a Natural Fit for University\" and\"Biotechnology Dreams Could Become Reality\" The residents of Columbia were well informed of The Department of Homeland Security visiting potential NBAF sites through their local paper. The visit was mentioned in 4 separate stories in the 13 days before the inspection team arrived on May 10th and 11th, 2007. A headline in the May 11th Tribune read \"Protests Greet Visitors \". One of the criteria the DHS uses in evaluating proposals is that of \"Community Acceptance\". The Athens Banner-Herald only reported on the inspection team after it left. The newspaper in Columbia printed 8 letters to the editor regarding the NBAF. They were mostly against the site with titles like \"If Laboratory is Unsafe in New York, it's Unsafe Here\" ,\" 'Probably' Safe Doesn't Justify Disease Lab Plan\" and \"Short-Term Rewards Not Worth Lab's Risks, \" but they published proponent's views also. To date (July 25), The Athens-Banner Herald has not published one letter to the editor concerning the NBAF. Jason Winders complains of his inbox being \"flooded\" with reader's comments.

I was out of town on vacation last week. There are no minutes or transcripts of the meeting - it was an informational session and designed as a 2- way conversation. However, I'll be glad to give you my recollections of the conversations. The meeting began with an overview by VP of Research David Lee. This same information (and much more than what was covered that evening) is on the NBAF website, www.uga.edu/NBAF . After a rather lengthy Q/A time the group toured the Animal Health Research Center, the Vet School's new BSL3 lab. During the Q/A time there was very little concern expressed over the safety of the facility. The majority of the conversation focused on two areas: (1) The orientation of the building on the property. Neighbors were concerned that the building would be visible from the neighborhood and cited their disappointment with the placement of the EPA building (adjacent to the proposed site.) (2) Traffic. Neighbors were concerned with the volume of new traffic on College Station Road.I'm sure you are aware of a community meeting being organized by the Department of Homeland Security for September 20, 7:00 PM at the GA Center.

I'll be out of the office all of next week, but will be checking my e-mail occasionally, and hopefully at least daily. As soon as I hear anything, I'll send the information your way. The date for the UGA public information meeting hasn't been finalized yet, but the DHS has just announced the details of its scoping meet ing.

I'll be in touch, Sam Sam Fahmy Science writerUGA Public Affairs/News Service\" Hello Matt, I've heard back from the Vinson Institute, and have written a summary: The analysis of the economic impact of the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) conducted by the UGA Carl Vinson Institute of Government used inputs including the investment required for construction, purchase of equipment, and infrastructure improvements, as well as information on the workforce the facility will require (number and types of jobs, and payroll). Those data were used to model the economic impacts to Athens-Clarke County, the surrounding area, and the state as a whole. 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 26 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-841 The analysis was completed using the Georgia Economic Modeling System (GEMS), a county- based economic model of the entire United States created by the CVIOG and Regional Dynamics, Inc. that measures the impact of investments such as the NBAF. In doing so, the GEMS takes into account existing businesses and their locations, population demographics, and transportation infrastructure to forecast the effects the new facility will have on suppliers to that industry and increased demand for services (e.g. dry cleaning, restaurants, retail outlets, etc). The model utilizes population and workforce data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau, and county-level economic data on nearly 800 industry categories from the U.S. Department of Commerce. In one sense, the forecast can be seen as a conservative estimate of the impact of the proposed facility since it does not model the impact that would result from related bioscience businesses that might locate or expand in the Athens area. Just as the addition of an auto manufacturing plant to a region, for example, tends to attract auto parts suppliers and other related businesses, NBAF would likely add to the region's reputation as a hub of infectious disease research and attract more bioscience businesses to the region. Hope this helps, Sam\" \"Sam, Thanks for taking the time to look into this. I really do appreciate it. Unfortunately, these are not the answers I have been looking for. In your summary it reads that the CVIOG analysis used \"information on the workforce the facility will require (number and types of jobs, and payroll).\" I have been told that no exact number or type of jobs have been provided by the DHS. Therefore, I was asking how CVIOG arrived at \"$1.5 billion to $2.5 billion in wages/salaries, and an estimated $3.5 billion to $6 billion in overall economic impact.\" Simply put, if no number or type of jobs have been provided by the DHS, what data was CVIOG using in coming up with this estimate? If you have any information on the data used by CVIOG, I would appreciate if you would pass it along. I thank you once again for taking the time to look into this. Matt\" \"Hello Matt, This has taken a little longer than I had hoped, but I wanted to double check to make sure I was right. DHS hasn't given the exact number of people to be employed at the facility, but they have said the facility will likely create between 250 and 350 permanent jobs. Using the conservative estimate of 250 full-time employees, the CVIOG analysis arrived at an estimated economic impact of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion in wages/salaries and an estimated $3.5 billion to $6 billion in overall economic impact. Like weather forecasts, economic forecasts always have some degree of uncertainty.

I hope this helps.Best, Sam Sam Fahmy Science writer\" _______________________________________________________________________On August 13. 2007 I sent the following to Athens Banner-Herald editorial page editor Jim Thompson, who was heading up a search for new columnists for the newspaper. \"Mr. Thompson, I would like to submit the following for consideration in the new local columnists search. I am working on another column that details my experience in finding about \"all those jobs\" NBAF is supposed to bring to the area, but wanted to see if you would be interested in posting columns like the one below for readers to vote on. Please let me know. Thanks, Matt DeGennaro It's not easy for someone to \"find out more\" about the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility that is being proposed for Athens, GA.

If you wanted to \"find out more\", you'd get your e-mail returned with the message \"No Such Mailbox\". Jason Winders, executive editor of The Athens Banner- Herald, doesn't seem too interested in providing his readership with any real information either. After an editorial entitled \"Biotechnology dreams could become reality\" appeared in the July 15th Banner-Herald, Winders mocked his critical readers (\"the usual suspects\") the next day on his blog for filling his inbox with objections and concerns. Readers who were interested in basic information about the facility were basically told to calm down, and that's its all going to be O.K....\"The site will be announced in October 2008, enough time to \"have plenty of oppo rtunity to dig in and start asking the tough question s about what this facility means - both pro and con - to our community.\" Well, since the whole playing field has been narrowed from 18 sites to 5, and the next event listed on The Department of Homeland Security website's Selection Process is \"Complete EIS/Announce site selection\" for October 2008, perhaps we should start asking questions now. 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 28 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-843 It's interesting to compare the coverage of The Columbia Daily Tribune - the local paper of Columbia, Missouri, a town that was formerly in the running for the NBAF - with that of The Athens Banner-Herald.

The DHS and UGA both have public relations people assigned to task of promoting the NBAF. Since The Banner-Herald has not yet done any real reporting, the people of the community are left with nothing. On August 14. 2007 - I had the following exchange with Athens Banner-Herald editorial page editor Jim Thompson: \"Mr. Thompson, This question is in regards to the column entry I sent you yesterday. For the local columnists search, will columns dealing with The National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility be considered? I just wanted to know before I submitted another one. 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 29 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-844 Thanks, Matt DeGennaro\" \"Sure. We'll consider anything on any topic - with the exception of abortion, since the arguments on both sides of that issue have been made repeatedly, and no one's mind is likely to change on the subject. Jim Thompson\" \"Mr. Thompson, Below is the my second entry in the call for new local columnists. (I was going to write about the potential NBAF jobs, but have not heard back yet from the NBAF programmer.) Can you tell me if both columns will be posted online for reader feedback? Thanks, Matt DeGennaro You know something's up when you look at their website. Google up UGA's website on The National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility. You'll be treated to enough sugary pastoral scenes to be thrown into diabetic shock. Three children holding hands in a green field walking towards a herd of cows. An elderly man petting a dog in a green field. More children - this time two young girls, one white and one black - hold hands while flying a kite... in a green field. Lots of smiles, livestock and green. Whatever could be wrong with a proposal that would bring so much joy and interracial harmony to the area? But if you look a little closer, you may have some questions. First among them might be, just what the hell is a National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility? Well, the idea for such a project comes from the mind that brought you such hits as the Iraq war, Abu Ghraib, The Patriot Act, and the days long response to Hurricane Katrina. In a 2002, George W. Bush decided that \"Bioterrorism is a real threat to our country. It's a threat to every nation that loves freedom. Terrorist groups seek biological weapons; we know some rogue states already have them....It's important that we confront these real threats to our country and prepare for future emergencies.\" This conclusion was probably driven by the anthrax attacks of the previous year. Though the strain of nthrax used was identical to that of one at a Ft. Detrick Army biolab, the crime has remained unsolved. (The FBI file on the case is dubbed \"Amerithrax\") So in 2004, the former head cheerleader of the Phillips Academy stickball team signed Homeland Security Presidential Directive 9, which paved the way for the construction of a brand spanking new facility to replace another government germ lab. According to the Department of 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 30 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-845 Homeland Security website, the old joint - The Plum Island Animal Disease Center - \"is nearing the end of its lifecycle, and is too small to meet the research needs of the nation.\" They also say that Plum Island, N.Y., does not have Bio Safety Level 4 capabilities. The PIADC is a Bio Level 3 Lab, and some of the diseases housed there are foot-and-mouth disease, classical swine fever, and vesicular stomatitis virus. The new NBAF will be a Bio Level 4 and will provide a place for The Department of Homeland Security to research zoonotic (animal- to- human) diseases such as the West Nile Virus, avian influenza and anthrax. So the The National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility that is being proposed for the corner of South Milledge and Whitehall in Athens - on pastureland bordering the Oconee River - right across the street from Peppino's Pizza, is actually a relocation of the Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center . But wait, why were they studying all this nasty stuff on an island to begin with? Well, once upon a time, there was a law that prohibited studying foot-and-mouth disease on the United States mainland in order to prevent an outbreak. (The law reads that \" no live virus of foot-and-mouth disease may be introduced for any purpose into any part of the mainland of the United States (\"except coastal islands separated therefrom by water navigable for deep-water navigation and which shall not be connected with the mainland by any tunnel.\") The PIADC was the only laboratory in the U.S. to do this, as it was located on an otherwise uninhabited island, with the employees ferried in and out on a daily basis. But \"In 1990, the original 1884 statute was amended, 21 U.S.C. 113a, to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to issue a permit for FMD live virus work on the U.S. mainland when necessary and in the public interest.\" And I guess that permit is about to be issued for the NBAF. According to a USDA document (Title VII Research - under \"Foreign Animal Disease Research\"), \"Today, modern biocontainment facility construction and rigorous biosafety operational standards allow such work to be safely done without fear of virus escape to the environment or harm to animal and/or pubic health.\" Yes, foot and mouth disease could never escape such a strongly contained lab in this day and age. At least not in America . Last week the dreaded FMD hit two farms in England, resulting in the culling of more than 500 farm animals. Those silly limeys got all in a huff because the last time Foot and Mouth Disease broke out it cost the country around 16 billon dollars. The cause? According to The UK Telegraph, it was most likely \"A major lapse in security at a Government research laboratory complex\" located three miles from the farms. Maybe we should tell the kids in the green field to bring in the kite. \" \"Mr. DeGennaro, I imagine we will publish both columns. However, to be perfectly candid, we're looking for columnists with more than a single-issue interest. I'd much prefer seeing something from you on a subject other than NBAF.7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 31 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-846 Jim Thompson\" \"Mr. Thompson, Thanks for writing me back. I have many other interests besides the NBAF, but the reason I choose to write about it is because it seems to be the story that no one is really talking about. There are many issues about the proposed facility that have not been addressed: Jobs - We hear 250-300 jobs. We used to hear 500. When you contact the people at UGA they tell you that no exact number or types have been provided by the DHS. When you ask for a copy of the CVIOG study we always see in press releases (\"20-year impact at $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion in wages/salaries, and an estimated $3.5 billion to $6 billion in overall economic impact\") they tell you no formal study has been done, so no copy exists. When you press them on what numbers they used to come up with their figures, they can only tell you what the DHS told them - which is 250-300 jobs and that's it. But when you read the a DHS FAQ where someone asked if the Plum Island people would be transferred over, they answer that the Plum Island programs will be transferred, but never answer the question. \"Big Bio\" - A billion dollar industry that once was concerned with the promotion of genetic foods changed direction after 9/11 and now are in the business of subcontracting out the running of bio labs like the NBACC in Maryland. The University will not be running NBAF, so who are these people? Transparency - how much will the community will told over just what the NBAF will study, and how much will not be withheld due to concerns over National Security? This thing is being proposed with no specifics - how will these diseases be transported, what the design is of the building that we are told is safe, who is responsible for safety security. How can the community make an informed decision if we don't have these facts? Does this create more of a problem rather than solve it? - A few years ago, 700 scientists signed a letter where they said the DHS is creating more of a threat by introducing all these Biolabs. They also said a lot of money is being spent the research of potential minor threats rather than the stuff that is already here. Plus, does having more bioreasearch in Athens make it a terrorist target? The difference between \"offensive\" and \"defensive\" research - The former director of Plum Island said that there really is no difference. How close is the United Sates coming to violating the Biological Weapons Conventions, if it hasn't already? Upcoming Meetings - The DHS scoping one is scheduled for September 20th, the UGA one that was supposed to be in mid August has not been announced yet. 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 32 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-847 Sure, I have other interests.

I'd like to do a piece over why people seem to cheer Mike Gravel and Dennis Kucinich so loudly at the debates, but why that enthusiasm never transfers to the voting booth. (Hell, I agree with everything they say but would be hard pressed to actually vote for them.) I'd like to do a column on \"townie bars\" versus \"college bars\" in Athens. I'd like to get to the bottom of why Oconee County will never have a bar. I'd like to ask Paul Broun just what he talks about with Jesus every day. It's just that I think that right now - and until October 2008 when the NBAF site is announced - that a DHS biolab is far more important than those other things. Thanks, Matt\" (Although my two sample columns generated a tremendous amount of comments pro and con online, and was a top vote getter among readers, I was not hired as a columnist for the Banner-Herald, and received no explanation why not.) ________________________________________________________________________On 9/05/07 the first letter to the editor regarding NBAF was published in The Athens Banner-Herald: \"Chuck Murphy: Serious questions remain on planned biodefense lab | | Story updated at 7:25 PM on Wednesday, September 5, 2007 The headline on Friday's front-page story on the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility, \"Biodefense lab pitched as no threat,\" is correct: The Thursday presentation at the University of Georgia's Center for Continuing Education portrayed the facility as being safe, with nothing to worry about from the standpoint of biohazards. However, the presentation was a \"pitch.\" It clearly was a presentation in favor of the facility, with no mention of any possible negative effects. And there's always another side to the story. Regarding the question mentioned in the first paragraph of the story, \"What's the worst that could happen?,\" I don't feel we ever really got a clear answer Thursday. As a resident of metro Athens, I think there are still questions that need to be answered before we can feel safe about this facility being constructed in Athens-Clarke County, if this is the location eventually chosen for the facility. The NBAF will replace an aging facility on Plum Island, New York. Not mentioned at Thursday's meeting was the fact the Department of Homeland Security, which will operate NBAF, recently decided to consider locating the new facility on Plum Island. This potential location is in addition to Athens and the four other sites on the short list. However, as one indication of local sentiment about this proposal, both of New York's senators and the local congressman have opposed it. Sen. Hillary Clinton said it's too close to New York City. If the 85 miles from Plum Island to Manhattan are too close, shouldn't we be taking a closer look at whether we want this facility five miles from the center of Athens-Clarke County? 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 33 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-848 Chuck Murphy\" ________________________________________________________________________ On 9/12/07 I had the following exchange with Athens Clarke County Commisoner Doug Lowry, (after writing the entire commissioner and mayor) \"To all Athens and Oconee County elected officials: Last month's Foot and Mouth disease outbreak in the UK has not been contained. There was a new case reported this morning: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/09/12/nfoot312.xml Please consider all the facts when weighing your support for NBAF. Thanks, Matt DeGennaro\" \"Mr. DeGennaro: What specific points do you see as relevant between the proposed NBAF and last month's Foot and Mouth disease outbreak in the UK? What exactly are the facts that you believe we are not considering in our determinations? Thank you, Doug Lowry\" Mr. Lowry, Thanks for writing me back. My specific concerns regarding FMD being studied at NBAF are as follows: 1. The public is not being informed of just how contagious FMD is at public meetings, nor are they told of the implications of an outbreak. Dr.Brown, who spoke at the last meeting, had no trouble illustrating the disease for the Atlanta Journal Constitution. ( \"..she has her students imagine that she is a pig with foot-and-mouth, and that they are cloven-hoofed animals. In the five minutes it takes her to describe the virus, they will have the disease.\"It is the most contagious virus known to man,\" Brown says. \"Period.\") But, at the meeting, this vital information was not presented. How can the public make an informed decision when answers are not forthcoming ? (This is just FMD - it looks like the DHS will never provide UGA with an actual specific list of what else will be studied there)7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 34 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-849 2. At the meeting, when the UK outbreak was discussed, we were basically told \"Don't worry - that facility was old\". Yet I read this in an English paper, which talks about the offical report - \"Floodwater from persistent rain in July is suspected of having surged up through sewers at the laboratories and then been carried off of the site by the builders' vehicles.\" http://www.surreyad.co.uk/news/2014/2014749/foot__mouth_blamed_on_lack_of_lab_checks The public has not been presented with any specifics as to building plans, what will be studied there, and why it's being studied. I just don't see how anyone can support NBAF on the vauge promises of the DHS. Thanks, Matt DeGennaro\" On 9/13/07 Commissioner Lowry responded: \"Mr. DeGennaro: It took me some time to put this together, but I believe it answers your questions. Let me know if I can help you with another issue. I welcome you to attend the NBAF session at 6pm on Sept. 20 at the Georgia Center. Here you will be able to direct questions to the DHS representative and other officials who are knowledgeable about these diseases. UGA infectious disease experts, including Dr. Brown, will also be on hand and available to those in attendance to discuss these issues in more detail and with a level of expertise that I am not qualified to provide. Doug Lowry A-CC Commissioner, District 1 1.) At the meeting for environmental groups, in response to the question, \"What's the worst case scenario?\", Dr. Brown said FMD would be the worst case -- for animals. A pathogen that is extremely contagious is not necessarily a threat to humans. FMD is extremely contagious -- the most contagious virus known -- to cloven-hoofed animals. FMD does not represent a threat to humans. While humans might unwittingly carry the virus on their clothing or perhaps in their nasal passages for a short period of time and so infect another herd. There is no infection of humans due to this eventuality. The virus does not get into the human system to cause disease. It is important to note that agricultural associations throughout Georgia support the NBAF because they understand that it will help to protect agriculture in the state. Dr. Brown also said that NBAF will study other diseases that may infect humans; this conclusion is based on the list of diseases that DHS has said would potentially be studied. Dr. Lee showed this list in his presentation. In addition, information about the diseases that may be studied at the NBAF has been made available in other ways. In the materials for the scoping meetings (on its web site), DHS lists the diseases that may be studied at the NBAF and briefly describes the animals they infect, and whether or not humans are infected. The www.uga.edu/nbaf web site also lists the diseases and includes links to information about the diseases from authoritative sources. DHS has provided a list of possible diseases for study; Dr. Lee explained in his presentation that the NBAF must be flexible if it is to respond to the latest threats. Just as the CDC, the human equivalent of NBAF, must be ready to respond to an outbreak of a new or re-emerging threat of human disease -- whether it is anthrax or SARS or mad cow disease or tuberculosis or the next new disease -- NBAF must also be able to respond to emerging foreign animal disease threats as they arise. The facility will not be operational until 2013; new or different diseases may present greater threats by then.7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 35 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-850 2.) This is correct, the reports indicate that heavy rains did contribute to the FMD outbreak in UK. It is also true that the Pirbright facility is old. Aging infrastructure (including drainage) was a major factor contributing to the outbreak. A direct comparison to what happened at Pirbright and what COULD happen at NBAF is difficult to make. Here's why: Three laboratories share the Pirbright facility: a government research laboratory, a small biotech company that works on stabilizing vaccines, and a large vaccine manufacturing facility. The research lab, which is wha t NBAF would be, has been cleared of contributing to the outbreak in the FMD investigation. The final reports conclude that the release was most likely due to escape of live virus from the drainage system that connects the vaccine production plant to the sodium hydroxide treatment tanks on another part of the Pirbright site. From there, it is believed that trucks carried the virus outside of the facility. The differences in the operations, including disinfection procedures, equipment and, as Dr. Lee pointed out in his presentation, the quantities of FMD virus used, are very different in the types of facilities. For example, the research facility and biotech company handle orders of magnitude -- greater than one million -- less live virus than the vaccine production plant. The fact that huge quantities of live virus were being grown in the commercial facility amplified any weaknesses in the old and apparently poorly maintained drainage system used at Pirbright. There is no reason for this to happen at NBAF. To address your last questions: Building plans: There are none, yet. Dr. Lee explained at the meeting that DHS has hired a design firm for a conceptual design, but the architectural design is not possible until the site is selected; what will work at the site in Mississippi might not work in Athens. A question for DHS might be whether they can share at this point what some of the elements of the conceptual design might be. What will be studied there: I think this is answered above. Why it's being studied: These diseases represent threats to U.S. agriculture and public health, whether they occur naturally or are deliberately introduced. If introduced to this country, they have the potential to severely disrupt our food supply, cause long-term economic damage in the billions of dollars, and as well as threaten the public's health.\" _____________________________________________________________________________ On 9/24/07 I had a letter printed in The Athens Banner-Herald Matt DeGennaro: Local media dismissive of opposition to NBAF At the Department of Homeland Security hearing in Athens last week on the proposed National Bio- and Agro-Defense facility, local resident Pat Priest equated the proliferation of labs housing the world's most infectious agents with the nuclear arms race. The more labs, the more vulnerable to terrorists or human error we might become. Was she one of those \"idiots\" the mayor of Flora, Miss., which is also in the running as a potential site, couldn't NBAF-educate? The \"pitchfork- and torch-carrying\" type WGAU-AM's Bryant? A \"fear-monger\" from Banner-Herald Executive Editor Jason Winders' blog or a clown in Banner-Herald reporter Blake Aued's blog reference to an anticipated NBAF hearing \"circus?\" Perhaps just Banner-Herald Editorial Page Editor Jim Thompson's gauzy dreamer, offering \"words without an echo?\" During the local NBAF hearing, hundreds of protesters were meeting in Boston to support a lawsuit to halt construction of a Biosafety Level 4 lab at Boston University. On Oct. 4, the U.S. 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 36 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-851 House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce will hold a hearing: \"Germs, Viruses, and Secrets: The Silent Proliferation of Bio-Laboratories in the United States.\" (Proliferation? Is there an \"echo\" in here?) Subcommittee chair Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., asks, \"Is there a point at which there are so many labs doing this research that you actually increase the chances of a catastrophic release of a deadly disease? We want to know the answer or whether anyone in the administration has even seriously considered the question.\" Idiots, clowns, and usual suspects have until Friday to submit NBAF Environmental Impact Statement input to nbafprogrammanager@dhs.gov. It could become the tipping point for selection of the NBAF site. Or, you could be one of the \"educated\" ones and not say anything at all. Matt DeGennaro Watkinsville ________________________________________________________________________ On 9/26/07 The Athens Banner-Herald Grady Thrasher: Real concerns on NBAF trivialized in column In his Sunday column, \"Words won't change course of development,\" Banner-Herald Editorial Page Editor Jim Thompson seems to have missed the entire point of the Thursday public meeting held by the Department of Homeland Security regarding the proposed location for the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility. As explained by DHS on its Web site, www.dhs.gov, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires preparation of an environmental impact statement by DHS regarding the proposed site for NBAF. The DHS site further informs us, \"Congress enacted NEPA to ensure that, before any action is taken, federal agencies consider the potential environmental impacts of their proposed actions and alternatives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects upon the quality of the environment.\" The meeting was held to give the public an opportunity to give their comments directly to DHS to \"aid the agency in determining alternatives, issues and potential environmental impacts to be analyzed.\" These were the matters concerned citizens spoke to with passion at the meeting. There are real environmental issues associated with NBAF, a massive project the size of several Wal-Marts, being located near the Oconee River next to the State Botanical Garden. Athens Area Chamber of Commerce President Doc Eldridge's quote at the meeting that seems to echo repeatedly in Thompson's head \"If not this, then what?\" was not even relevant to the 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 37 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-852 purposes of the meeting, nor - as Thompson suggests - was an answer to that irrelevant question required of those in attendance to validate their expressed concerns. Thompson is wrong in attempting to trivialize residents' involvement in governmental decision- making processes affecting our fragile environment. We are not, as he says, \"an ad hoc nuisance to be laughed off and rolled over.\" But, then, if Thompson were a serious journalist rather than just a laughable ad hoc mouthpiece for this newspaper's point of view, he already would have known that. Grady Thrasher Kathy Prescott Published in the Athens Banner-Herald on 092607\" letter: \"Pat Priest: NBAF opponents are taking rational stance | | Story updated at 7:35 PM on Wednesday, September 26, 2007 The mesmerizing pull of the repeated refrain of \"jobs terrorism jobs terrorism jobs terrorism\" is hard to resist when considering whether it's in our community's best interest to bring highly infectious agents for which there is no cure to our town. Proponents keep calling for opponents to rationally seek out the facts about the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility rather than responding with the knee-jerk reaction they characterize us as having as \"activists.\" It's true; digging up all the facts has taken a little time, as they aren't readily available in our local paper or at the public hearings. With a little research, we find that there have been scores of problems at Level 3 and 4 labs around the country. And away from the pull of \"jobs terrorism,\" we have more time to think about the wider dangers of proliferating infectious agents and of cinching our community in to the military-industrial (and increasingly educational) complex that diverts funds from other important social initiatives and is opaque in its operation. I'm reminded of the wonderful ending of \"A Wrinkle in Time,\" where the girl could only resist the pulsing forces of seemingly rational groupthink by fiercely remembering the things she loved.7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 38 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-853 If we speak out, our concern for our families and our environment - portrayed as irrational - might protect us from the purportedly rational stance taken by the activists working to bring a Level 4 facility to Athens and claiming that it will make us safer. Pat Priest Published in the Athens Banner-Herald on 092707\" ________________________________________________________________________ On October 18th, 2007 I tried to get a forum piece in The Athens Banner-Herald in response to Chamber of Commerce president Doc Eldridge's question of \"If not this, then what?\" The ABH did not respond, so in late November I sent the following document to my friends in hopes of receiving a reply: ________________________________________________________________________ HELP MATT GET AN ANSWER FROM THE ATHENS-BANNER HERALD - (me) vs. / (them) Me- -On October 18th, in trying to publicize a lecture by Dr. Steven Stice, I sent the following to Athens Banner Herald Executive Editor Jason Winders: Jason,7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 39 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-854 I would like to submit the following as a forum piece. (It started as a letter to the editor, but then got out of hand) Thanks, Matt \"If not this, then what?\" Doc Eldridge, Athens Area Chamber of Commerce president, threw down the gauntlet at the September 20 th Department of Homeland Security NBAF meeting. An Associated Press story described his words as \"an almost frustrated plea\" to the proposed facility's detractors. Athens Banner- Herald's Jim Thompson chimed in a few days later, calling for alternate ideas from otherwise \"ad hoc nuisances to be laughed at and rolled over.\" All right, then. Eldridge's question may have been answered on a Sunday afternoon in a Watkinsville library a few weeks back. Dr. Steven Stice, one of the world's leading researchers in cell therapeutics gave a lecture to about twenty people that afternoon. He explained that embryonic stem cell research has the potential to cure or ameliorate hundreds of serious diseases - everything from Parkinson's and Alzheimer's to spinal cord injury and heart disease. It was like hearing about the potential of some faraway scientific miracle, except the work is already being done right in our own backyard in a UGA lab. Stice is especially valuable because he combines an entrepreneurial focus with leading-edge scientific research. His lab is one of only a handful that teaches people how to grow embryonic stem cells, and his fledgling business will provide other scientists with a product to be put to work in exciting research projects around the world. But this preeminence is endangered because of restrictions on funding and limitations on stem cell sources in America, where our President has twice vetoed needed stem cell legislation. Meanwhile, the British government funnels funds to researchers and has set up a stem cell ''bank'' providing scientists with easy access to stem-cells, and Cambridge University is home to a multi- million dollar research center. In 2001, Singapore opened a 287 million dollar government biotech lab called \"Biopolis\" which focuses chiefly on stem cell research. We have a world-class researcher in our midst who desperately needs funding and support. But the Georgia state legislature will see in 2008 a continuing attack on so-called \"pro-life\" issues.Reading about this, I learned of a new term - \"personhood\". At first I thought it may have been a new phrase coined by Stephen Colbert, but is actually a word invented by proponents of something called the \"paramount human life amendment\". A resolution proposed last Spring in the Georgia legislature aims at amending the state constitution to establish the \"personhood\" of each of its citizens \"including unborn children at every state of their development, including fertilization.\" This type of amendment could possibly impact everything from embryonic stem cell research to living wills. 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 40 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-855 With this kind of \"support,\" how long will it be before Dr. Stice decides to pack up and take his research and business elsewhere? Instead of using old tired labels like \"pro-choice\" and \"pro-life\" to define each other, perhaps some new ones are in order. Maybe we should start characterizing those who blindly oppose embryonic stem-cell research as \"pro-heart disease\", \"pro- Parkinson's\" and \"pro-Alzheimer's.\" We need to intelligently address the ethics and morality of embryonic stem-cell use if we are going to play a leading role in helping mankind with eradicating diseases. Stice explained that stem cells that could be used for research are removed from human embryos that are unsuitable for fertility treatments because of improper development, and earmarked for disposal. He pointed to a recent poll in which 67% of participating Georgians support research with embryonic cells that would otherwise be discarded. The more people learn about the process, the clearer its moral basis becomes. Even National Institutes of Health (NIH) director Elias Zerhouni,--breaking with President Bush-- says, \"All avenues of research need to be pursued.\" If we attract yet more biolabs like NBAF to Athens, might we soon be known as \"The germ capital of world - the most dangerous place on earth\"? There is already the genesis of a cutting-edge biotech industry here. Why not focus on being the capital of stem cell research? Let's support bringing life-affirming companies like Stice's to Athens. We would not have to ask some Homeland Security guy about the \" worst-case release scenario\" if a discarded embryo were to escape, and perhaps we would all feel a sense of pride in the knowledge that our town is doing something to help mankind. We can put fear on the back burner. America can be number one in world respect again, and Athens can lead the way. And that would do wonders for all our \"personhoods.\" Anyone in interested in hearing Dr. Steven Stice speak can do so this Monday, October 22, at 5:30 in the Animal and Dairy Science Complex auditorium (Room 101) River Rd., on the UGA campus, near the Ramsey Center. Them/ -Later that day Jason responded (The mention of \"comix\" is in reference to some comic books I sent him the previous week.): Thanks, Matt. I'll pass along to JT. Got the comix Thursday.

Dr. Stice will be speaking tomorrow night. Thanks, Matt October 22nd the paper comes out. No me in it. Worst yet - less publicity for that night's lecture. Hating to see it go to waste,(and equally hating being called \"an ad-hoc nuisance to be laughed at and rolled over\")I send the forum piece to all local elected officials I could think of and my anti-NBAF friends. I send the following to Jim Thompson: Jim, I was wondering if you might share with me the reasons why you decided not to publish my forum piece. Thanks, Matt I receive no response. The next Sunday I notice Jim Thompson is starting a \"What's your beef\" type column (called \"What the Problem Is\") and encourages readers to send in their suggestions. On October 28 th I send him the following : What the Problem Is... Jim, The Editorial Page Editor of my local paper wrote a column last month where he said: \"..what came from opponents of NBAF Thursday was their absolute shock - shock, they said - that something like NBAF was considered a proper fit for this community. What didn't come from them was an answer to Eldridge's question. And that's what they need to come up with, if they want to be considered a force to be reckoned with rather than an ad hoc nuisance to be laughed off and rolled over.\"I thought this was a interesting point. I wrote a response and submitted it as a forum piece. It was not published, and when I e-mail him to ask why, he does not respond. Can you help? (I can give you the gentleman's contact information if necessary.) Thanks,7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 42 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-857 Matt / Them - On October 31st , Jim writes me back: Matt, Sorry to be so late in getting back to you. I've been trying since I received your e-mail to find a few minutes to respond. There are a couple of reasons I've opted not to use your Forum submission. The first is related to your suggestion of Steve Stice's research as an alternative to NBAF. I'm just uncomfortable with putting Stice in the forefront of this argument without knowing his position on NBAF, which, for all I know, he might support. Did you talk with him to discern his position on NBAF? Also, how do we know, as you contend, that Stice \"desperately needs funding and support.\" Hasn't he received assistance from the University of Georgia in incubating a couple of businesses related to his research? The second reason is related to a single sentence in your submission, which reads, \"Instead of using old tired labels like \"pro-choice\" and pro-life\" to define each other, perhaps some new ones are in order.\" As a matter of policy, the Banner-Herald doesn't publish letters, forums or editorials that mention the abortion issue. Obviously, abortion isn't the focus of your Forum, but your reference to the subject would certainly prompt responses that would focus on that issue. As a point of information, the reason we don't publish opinion pieces on abortion is our view that it's an issue on which most people have made up their minds, and nothing is going to persuade people to take a different position. All that said, I'd be more than willing to publish a Forum piece from you that makes the point that alternative biotech pursuits, like embryonic stem cell research, represent a sensible alternative to NBAF. As I've noted, I'd just be more comfortable with a piece that didn't specifically push Stice to the forefront, and that avoided language like \"pro-choice\" and \"pro-life.\" I hope this is responsive to your concerns. If you have additional questions or comments, please fell free to e-mail me, or give me a call at (706) 208-2222. JIm - Me -To which I reply to on November 3rd at 8:05 A.M.: Jim, 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 43 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-858 Thanks for explaining why you didn't run my Forum piece before Dr. Stice's speech at UGA. Luckily, it is still relevant. To respond to the points you raise: I've been trying to remain blissfully ignorant regarding Dr. Stice's support for NBAF. The previously submitted forum piece makes no mention as to whether he is for or against the facility - and in writing it I took great caution in presenting it as MY opinion (as befits a Forum piece)and not the opinion of Dr. Stice. As you know, it was written in response to the question of \"If not this, then what\"? - A question addressed to opponents of NBAF and not to Dr. Stice. I would guess that as an employee of UGA, Dr. Stice is \"for\" NBAF. But I would not ask him his opinion on NBAF. It would be besides the point (why should I ask him if my own opinion is valid?) And there is such strong support for the lab by the University's administration that I would never want to put him in any sticky political mess. Once again, the forum piece is MY opinion about the direction in which Athens should be headed with regard to NBAF, not Dr. Stice's endorsement or opposition to the lab. It would have never been written unless Doc Eldridge's question was amplified by your own column. I thought I would try to provide one answer. Responding to your concern about Dr. Stice, I added the following paragraph to clarify: \"I have no idea of what Dr. Stice thinks of the proposal to bring NBAF to Athens; this Forum is just one person's thoughts as I weigh the relative merits of supporting two very different types of commerce in our town. Obviously, one won't cancel out the other in the equation, \"If not this, what?\" My contention that Dr. Stice \"desperately needs funding and support\" is supported by attending two lectures in which he talked at length about the lack of federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. Yes, he has received some UGA support, but nowhere near all the hoopla and hundreds of millions of dollars that surround NBAF. But, responding to your criticism, I did change the line to read \"We have a world-class scientist in our midst who needs funding and support.\" Regarding the use of the sentence \"Instead of using old tired labels like \"pro-choice\" and pro- life\" to define each other, perhaps some new ones are in order.\" - I am attempting to reframe the discussion over stem-cell research. When people think of stem cells, they automatically have a knee-jerk reaction to that and think \"abortion\" \"cloning\" or life being somehow sinisterly created to be destroyed for scientific purposes. I was trying to pre-empt this by commenting on the labels we always use to define each other and to call attention to the fact that what Stice talked about in both lectures was using discarded embryos for research. I didn't know this fact, and am trying to share it with others. But when you say \"As a matter of policy, the Banner-Herald doesn't publish letters, forums or editorials that mention the abortion issue,\" I'm confused. Using the Banner-Herald's website's search engine, I found many letters, forums and editorials that do mention the abortion issue over the past few years (see below.) 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 44 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-859 If this is the paper's policy, where exactly is it printed to warn any potential writer that a piece will not be considered due to the subject of abortion? I failed to see it. Are there any other issues that will not be given consideration for publication in the Banner-Herald? Why should the abortion discussion have ended anyway? I personally believe that so many people are against stem-cell research precisely because they tie it up with the abortion issue and are not informed of what it actually entails. Once again, I did not mention the word \"abortion\", I just mentioned the labels people use to define each other. I'm commenting on the debate itself and the language we use when enter such a discussion. When you say my \"reference to the subject would certainly prompt responses that would focus on that issue,\" what would be wrong with that? I thought that was what a Forum was supposed to be about - an exchange of ideas. I say one thing, and then someone can write in and say \"What Matt fails to realize is...\" and give their view.

Some people question the need to bring the facility here. Whether or not we need NBAF offers a good, and healthy, debate. On one hand, Athens has survived without the facility so far, so likely could continue without it. On the other hand, NBAF promises a bounty of high-paying jobs and the potential for creating many small businesses. In addition, NBAF could provide the key to paving Georgia Highway 316 with biotech industry between Athens and Atlanta. Then, of course, there is the burning question about whether or not NBAF would put Athens residents in danger from the strains of animal diseases that will be studied there. Despite the assurances of officials that the high-level security facility would provide more than ample safeguards, even the slightest risk of releasing a dangerous pathogen convinces some to oppose the facility. Regardless of the NBAF question, however, there is a private research firm much closer to home that needs the attention of Athens and Georgia officials. University of Georgia stem cell researcher Steven Stice started up his Aruna Biomedical company in 2003 through a licensing agreement with UGA Research Foundation, allowing the university to benefit from Aruna's sales. Stice's company has developed a way to quickly grow billions of embryonic stem cells into nerve, brain and spine cells using neural progenitor cells from lines registered with the National Institutes of Health. The small company Stice runs sells a kit containing a vial of cells and a lab manual on how to grow the cells to other research facilities. The potential for revenues exceeds hundreds of millions of dollars. Aruna's process shortens the time and expense other researchers need to grow their own stem cells to work on cures for diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and spinal cord injuries. It also could speed up the discovery of those cures. 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 46 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-861 The company also has found a way to use the neural cells to serve as a portable chemical weapons detection system to be used in the field and detect the presence of chemical agents, similar to the way canaries were used in mines to detect toxic gas. Stice recently gave a PowerPoint presentation that covered Aruna and stem cells. About 50 people, including several business and elected officials from Athens-Clarke and Oconee counties attended. It was an impressive and enlightening talk that also covered the political and ethical dynamics of stem-cell research. Stice pointed out that despite a study that 67 percent of people polled approved of research use of embryonic stem cells from fertility clinics, some state politicians still want to ban them. We're talking about nonviable stem cells normally discarded by the fertility clinics. Aruna now employs eight people, and Stice needs to hire a senior manager to run the company and help with the marketing and production of the cell products. Continued growth means hiring more people for good pay. \"It's strange to be involved in a company that's selling a product,\" the researcher said. What would be strange is if we let this company get away from us. Already there are economic enticements from Wisconsin to lure Stice away. Existing companies like Stice's need the economic and political capital of our state and local officials to help them grow and in turn help our communities grow with safe and promising research. Let's hope moralistic politicians don't run Stice off and ruin a potential golden goose. Published in the Athens Banner-Herald on 110407 Now, I am not saying they ripped off my idea. My idea wasn't even that original. Lisa Majersky had this letter published in the ABH way back on September 26th, 2007: Maybe Editorial Page Editor Jim Thompson, who paraphrased some of my comments at last week's hearing on the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility in his Sunday column, didn't hang around to hear my later comments, where I answered to the question, \"If not this, then what?\" I suggested that instead of NBAF, perhaps eventually a larger-scale stem-cell research industry could be developed locally, instead of working with dangerous pathogens. Friday's Atlanta Journal-Constitution included an article about pioneering University of Georgia stem-cell researcher Steve Stice, who is working with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory to develop a portable chemical detection device for protection of troops on the battlefield, using neural progenitor cells derived from the few lines of embryonic stem cells permitted for research by the government. It's a shame that with so many of our young soldiers coming back from the war with nerve damage, paralysis, brain damage and burns, and so many people suffering from Alzheimer's and 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 47 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-862 other degenerative diseases, that so much time and human brainpower is not being used to concentrate on looking for cures, now that the possibilities of stem cells are widely suspected. There are many other branches of biotechnology that could come to Athens. The big drug companies that have opted against locating on the local \"Orkin tract\" must have their own reasons for not wanting to do so. I suspect it's our water supply, more than anything, at this point. How about a synthetic water factory? Good luck with that one! ...so they do publish stuff about NBAF and Stice. - Me - So I took one more shot at this a few days ago (November 12th): Jim, Just a quick note to ask if you ever intend to publish my forum piece. I noticed last Sunday the business columnist wrote about stem cells, NBAF, and Dr. Stice - which seems strange to me because one of the reasons you rejected my original piece was : \"I'm just uncomfortable with putting Stice in the forefront of this argument without knowing his position on NBAF\" Remember that I added to my revised piece that I did not know if Dr. Stice supported NBAF, and removed the words \"pro-choice\" and \"pro-life\" to fit your stated criteria for having a forum published. This was well in advance of last Sunday's business column. When you said: \"All that said, I'd be more than willing to publish a Forum piece from you that makes the point that alternative biotech pursuits, like embryonic stem cell research, represent a sensible alternative to NBAF. As I've noted, I'd just be more comfortable with a piece that didn't specifically push Stice to the forefront, and that avoided language like \"pro-choice\" and \"pro-life.\"\" I took you at your word. Matt (\"I took you at your word\" - how cryptically grim of me.) So,7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 48 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-863 If you would be so kind as to e-mail Mr. Thompson to ask him just why he will not publish my forum piece, that would be quite cool of you. I'm out of gas. You can even tell him that I asked you to do so - there's no reason to be sneaky. I would just really like to know why. Contact: / Jim Thompson - jim.thompson@onlineathens.com - me - mattdegennaro@gmail.com ________________________________________________________________________ On 9/27/07, I submitted the following 43 questions as scoping comments to The NBAF Program Manager through email and the Postal Service. I am resubmitting them in the hopes of getting direct and concise replies to each question in the FEIS: 1. In the DEIS and FEIS, the assessment of likely impacts upon the environment must be as free from bias as possible. Describe the formal mechanism for assessing the adequacy and objectivity of information and analysis provided in the document. 2. Explain the methodology of prediction and evaluation of cumulative, short and long term environmental impacts, and in the discussion of each, whether /how each impact will be avoided or ameliorated. Identify any experts used in the EIS process to analyze the environmental impacts and documentation submitted by DHS. 3. Alternatives, mitigation and monitoring plans for each type of impact should be included. Explain how the five (or six) site finalists will be compared, and how much weight various factors will receive in choosing the final site, including what factors would contribute to a No Action option for any or all of the sites. 4. The Athens community should have the ability and opportunity to submit exhibits from its own experts in the fields of wildlife, engineering and hydrology, architecture, biolab safety, etc.However, in order for the general public and experts to evaluate the information provided by the DHS in the DEIS, UGA should make available to the public and its experts a number of opportunities for guided or unguided tours of the site. These \"open house\" dates should be scheduled as soon as possible (in time for comments in the FEIS) in order for the public and experts to be able to access the same \" level playing field\" as the DHS, whose representatives have previously been presented with a visit to the site. No such opportunity has existed for the public, and yet the Athens community is being asked to weigh information and formulate 7 cont.| 27.0 8| 4.0 4 cont.| 4.2WD0858 DeGennaro, Issue Code: 4.0 DHS prepared the NBAF EIS accordance of NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and CEQ's regulations for implementing NEPA (40 CFR 1500 et seq.). The list of preparers and experts used in the EIS process to analyze the environmental impacts are included in Chapter 6.0 of the EIS. The primary objective of the EIS is to evaluate the environmental impacts of a range of reasonable alternatives for locating, constructing and operating the NBAF and the No Action Alternative. As summarized in Section 3.1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS analyzed each environmental resource area in a consistent manner across all the alternatives to allow for a fair comparison among the alternatives. For each resource area analyzed, a description of the methodology used for evaluating affected environment information and for assessing potential environmental impacts on the resource is included at the front of the respective resource subsection in the NBAF EIS and/or in supporting appendices. Potential mitigation measures for avoiding or minimizing potential environmental impacts are discussed throughout the resource subsections of the NBAF EIS, with a more detailed discussion of mitigation measures included in Section 3.15. Several factors will affect the decision on whether or not the NBAF is built, and, if so, where. The EIS itself will not be the sole deciding factor. The decision will be made based on the following factors: 1) analyses from the EIS and support documents; 2) the four evaluation criteria discussed in Section 2.3.1; 3) applicable Federal, state, and local laws and regulatory requirements; 4) consultation requirements among the Federal, state, and local agencies, as well as federally recognized American Indian Nations; 5) policy considerations; and 6) public comment. A Record of Decision that explains the final decisions will be made available no sooner than 30 days after the NBAF Final EIS is published.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-864 relevant questions for examination in the environmental impact document. DEIS and FEIS comment period deadlines should be extended until there has been an adequate opportunity for these site visits and development of expert opinion to be transmitted to DHS. 5. Please publish all expenditures by the federal government in regards to DHS site selection process, scoping process and Environmental Impact Statement process for Athens, GA. for the period from the original \"Notice of Request for Expression of Interest for Potential Sites for the NBAF\" published January 19, 2006 until the end of the public comments on the scoping document, September 28, 2007. Since the DHS site selection process, scoping process and Environmental Impact Statement process were paid for by taxpayers, are there any federal monies available to the community in order to hire independent experts in the fields of wildlife, engineering and hydrology, architecture, biolab safety, etc? Please provide any information that would guide the community in obtaining federal funds to hire its own experts. 6. Based on recent build-out activity of bio-labs in the past several years, present a REALISTIC detailed calendar of construction plans for the community's consideration. 7. In order to fully establish the environmental impact that NBAF will have on the surrounding community, please provide a complete list of every virus, disease and pathogen or any agent that will be studied or considered for study at the NBAF. Please describe each virus, disease, pathogen or infectious agent and the reason for study. 8. Please define what a \"select agent\" is and if such agents be studied at NBAF. 9. What is the worst case release scenario if a virus, disease, pathogen or infectious agent escapes from NBAF? What is the worst case release scenario for humans? What is the worst case scenario for animals? 10. In regards to a worst case release scenario, please describe in detail the differences of disease transmission in relation to NBAF. What viruses, diseases, pathogens or infectious agents can be spread through direct or indirect contact? Please include all possible methods of transmission (direct, indirect, droplet contact, airborne transmission, fecal-oral transmission, vector-borne transmission) in relation to each virus, disease, pathogen or infectious agent. 11. Will the scientific work performed at NBAF be published or will it be classified? Since the facility falls under the purview of DHS, will research be kept from the public in the interest of national security? How transparent will NBAF be? 12. Please specifically define the relationship that NBAF will have the University of Georgia. Will students be guaranteed educational opportunities at the lab? Will University students and professors have access to the lab to utilize NBAF for research purposes? How open will NBAF's door be to UGA in terms of a partnership? 60 Comment No: 9 Issue Code: 23.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern that a detailed construction schedule is not included in the NBAF EIS. DHS prepared the NBAF EIS in accordance of NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and CEQ's regulations NEPA (40 CFR 1500 et seq.). The anaysis conducted in the NBAF EIS was based on conceptual design plans posted on the DHS website. More detailed design plans would be developed as the project moves into the final design phase. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF then site specific protocols, including detailed construction plans, would be developed that would consider the diversity and density of populations residing within the local area. DHS would have site- specific standard operating procedures and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. DHS notes the commentor's concern that all possible pathogens to be studied at the NBAF are not listed in the NBAF EIS. The pathogens to be studied at the NBAF as provided in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS include Foot and Mouth Disease virus, Classical Swine Fever virus, Vesicular Stomatitis virus, Rift Valley Fever virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and African Swine Fever virus. Should the NBAF be directed to study any pathogens not included in the list of pathogens included in the NBAF EIS, DHS and USDA would conduct an evaluate of the new pathogen(s) to determine if the potential challenges and consequences were bounded by the current study. If not, a new risk assessment would be prepared and a separate NEPA evaluation may be required.\" The analysis conducted in the NBAF EIS was based on conceptual design plans posted on the DHS website. More detailed design plans would be developed as the project moves into the final design phase. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF then site specific operational, safety, security and emergency protocols and plans. DHS notes commentor's concern that the NBAF will be staffed with the appropriate personnel to safely and efficiently operate the NBAF. DHS and USDA have minimum standard qualifications for technical personnel and require stringent training in laboratory safety. In addition to the scientific and administrative staff of the laboratory, the proposed NBAF facility would employ technicians, veterinary staff, building engineers and security. All laboratory staff would have thorough training in handling hazardous infectious agents, understanding primary and secondary biocontainment functions of standard and special practices, and an understanding of biocontainment equipment and laboratory characteristics. Laboratory staff would be supervised by trained and experienced scientists. The NBAF safety and biosafety staff would review and approve of proposed protocols and SOPs for the laboratory prior to use. Laboratory staff working in the proposed NBAF would use the standards and procedures recommended for all institutions engaged in biological research. DHS notes the commentor's concern. Section 3.13 of the NBAF EIS describes the processes thatChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-865 would be used to control and dispose of liquid and solid waste from the NBAF, with Sections 3.3 and 3.7 of the NBAF EIS describing the standard methods used to prevent and mitigate potential effects of spills and runoff. Since the method of carcass disposal has not yet been determined, the effects of alkaline hydrolysis, incineration, and rendering were included in the analysis presented in Section 3.13 of the NBAF EIS. Incineration has the potential to affect air quality, so the evaluation in Section 3.4 (Air Quality) of the NBAF EIS assumed only incineration would be used to assess the greatest adverse effect . Alkaline hydrolysis would have the greatest effect on sanitary sewage capacity, Section 3.3, so the sanitary sewage effects were determined using this method. A discussion of select agents is included in Appendix E. DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the five mainland site alternatives. It has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. An example is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, where such facilities employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF. No-fly zones would be considered along with other security measures for the proposed NBAF regardless of the site selected. DHS acknowledges and agrees with the commentor's statement that no mention of a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) conference room is in the . 10 Issue Code: 19.0 DHS the commentor's concerns regarding the impact of an pathogen release on the local population, livestock industry, businesses and infrastructure. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, The chances of an accidental release are low. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release based on human error are low in large part due to the design and implementation of biocontainment safeguards in conjunction with rigorous personnel training. For example, as described in Section 2.2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS, all laboratory staff would receive thorough pre- operational training, as well as ongoing training, in the handling of hazardous infectious agents, understanding biocontainment functions of standard and special practices for each biosafety level, and understanding biocontainment equipment and laboratory characteristics. Appendix B to the EIS describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large. As set out in Section 3.14.3.4 of theChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-866 NBAF EIS, employees and contractors will be screened prior to employment or engagement and monitored while working, among other security measures. In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF, site specific protocols would then be developed in coordination with local emergency response agencies and would consider the diversity and density of populations residing within the local area. The need for an evacuation under an accident conditions is considered to be a very low probability event. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. Comment No: 11 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's questions regarding the public availability and transparency of NBAF research. There would no classifed research at the NBAF, however there may occasionally be classified FBI forensics cases. Currently, the PIADC facility publishes research in publicly available research journals; NBAF would publish its research in publicly available research journals as well. Section 3.13 of the NBAF EIS addresses waste management at the proposed NBAF. Comment No: 12 Issue Code: 8.2 DHS notes the commentor's question regarding the possible association between local area businesses and the NBAF, if located at the South Milledge Avenue Site. The primary objective of the EIS is to evaluate the environmental impacts of the no action and site alternatives for locating, constructing and operating the NBAF, and a discussion of any potential associations between local area businesses and DHS relative to the NBAF is beyond the scope of the NBAF EIS. DHS notes the commentor's concerns about long-term funding for the NBAF to ensure safe operations. The U.S. Congress and the President are responsible for determining funding priorities for government programs. DHS spends funds in accordance with congressional intent. DHS would maintain the NBAF and ancillary facilities in compliance with applicable environmental, safety, and health requirements and provide for safe operation and maintenanceChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-867 13. The Merial vaccine plant is eight miles away from the proposed NBAF site and is being heavily pitched as a major selling point to have the facility located in Athens, GA. Why? Please describe in detail the relationship that NBAF would likely have with Merial if the facility is located in Athens, GA. 14. How many gallons of Foot and Mouth disease live virus are required to manufacture a vaccine? Please describe in detail the process for manufacturing a Foot and Mouth disease vaccine, and what new safety and security measures would be taken if the Athens Merial plant were to produce vaccines in conjunction with NBAF research. 15. Plum Island currently houses The North American Foot and Mouth Disease Bank which keeps vaccine for the United States, Canada and Mexico. Will the Vaccine Bank be moved here? Please describe in detail the contents of the Vaccine Bank and the potential hazard to the environment if its contents are released. 16. The scoping materials read: \"Athens-Clarke County (ACC) has ample water and sewer capacity to serve the NBAF. ACC can withdraw 35 million gallons per day (MGD) from Bear Creek reservoir and another 28 MGD from the North and Middle Oconee Rivers.\" Yet, currently the area is experiencing a severe drought. Athens Clarke-County, Barrow, Jackson and Oconee counties, draw water from Bear Creek Reservoir. They enacted total outdoor water bans after the Upper Oconee Watershed Authority declared a Level 4 drought in September, 2007. The reservoir has enough water to last about six weeks under current conditions, and the Middle and North Oconee rivers are too low to draw water from regularly or refill the reservoir. Include a detailed analysis of the NBAF water requirements, and justify locating it in Athens, GA in the face of extreme extended drought conditions. 17. If an outbreak of foot and mouth disease were to occur in Athens or Watkinsville, would the Department of Homeland Security handle the situation? Who are the first responders in case of an outbreak? Is it Federal or Local? How would quarantine zones be determined? How large a quarantine area would be needed? How many animals would be destroyed? What would be the restrictions on movement into and out of the quarantine area? How would those restrictions economically affect local business and farmers? Would human beings also be quarantined? 18. James Johnson, the NBAF program manager, said at the Manhattan Kansas Scoping Meeting that upwards of 50 armed guards will be assigned to the facility. Would this be true if the lab were located in Athens? Will these be Federal Protective Service agents or hired from a private security firm like Blackwater? 19. Describe the job requirements and screening procedures for these guards, and what type and capabilities of weapons they will be issued. How far from the facility will guards be stationed, 12 cont.| 8.2 7 cont.| 27.0 9 cont.| 23.0WD0858 7 cont.|27.0 DeGennaro, Matt Page 51 of 60 Comment No: 13 Issue Code: 12.2 DHS notes the commentor's water supply and quality concerns and DHS acknowledges current regional drought conditions. As described in Section 3.7.3.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, the South Milledge Avenue Site alternative would use approximately 118,000 gallons per day of potable water an amount that is approximately 0.76% of Athens' current annual average of 15.5 million gallons per day usage. The NBAF annual potable water usage is expected to be approximately equivalent to, an amount consumed by 228 residential homes. The NBAF would be required to comply with numerous regulations that address the risk of pollutants or hazardous substances getting into local surface waters. Section 3.13.8 describes the Waste Management processes that would be used to control and dispose of NBAF's liquid and solid waste. Sections 3.3.3 and 3.7.3 describe standard methods used to prevent and mitigate potential spills and runoff affects. Comment No: 14 Issue Code: 15.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern. A site-specific emergency response plan will be developed and coordinated with the local Emergency Management Plan regarding evacuations and other emergency response measures for all potential emergency events including accidents at the NBAF. Emergency response plans will include the current USDA emergency response plan for foot and mouth disease (FMD) which does not include provisions for human quarantine. The potential costs for building additional infrastructure would vary with the location and would depend on the capacity of the existing infrastructure to supply the proposed NBAF. How a jurisdiction would choose to finance the construction of the new infrastructure would depend on the current financial health of the jurisdiction and the laws and regulations that govern the financing of capital projects. While the potential costs of proposed actions are not a factor in the environmental impact analysis presented in the NBAF EIS, cost information and the scope of the cost analysis performed is summarized in Section 2.5 of the NBAF EIS to provide pertinent information to the DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology so that he may make a more informed decision with respect to the alternatives presented in the NBAF EIS.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-868 and how will they handle innocent intrusions by walkers, hikers, bikers or others-- for example, along the river? 20. The potential NBAF is being compared to another lab in Athens that already has BSL-3 capabilities, and also to the CDC in Atlanta. Do these facilities also require 50 armed guards? If not, why does NBAF? 21. Along the perimeter of another biodefense facility at the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, there are signs that read \"Warning Restricted Area. Use of Deadly Force Authorized.\" Will these signs be posted around NBAF and if so, please define the perimeter around the facility where citizens should be concerned with their safety. What are the indications for the use of deadly force? 22. Where there be a no-fly zone around the facilty? 23. We've been told that no animals used for research at NBAF will come out alive. What breeds of animals will be involved in research, where will they be procured, and how many will be killed per month? What will be the medical impacts to the lab animals including their method of destruction and disposal? 24. One of the criteria the DHS uses in evaluating proposals is that of \"Community Acceptance.\" Earlier this year, according to an April 25th story in the Athens Banner-Herald linked from the UGA NBAF web site, DHS spokesman Chris Kelly is quoted as saying \"UGA leaders must incorporate feedback from residents within a 60-mile radius of the site and show that they have either received community input or have a specific plan to draw feedback from area residents\" Apart from letters and statements from those with either a financial or political interest in NBAF, how is \"community acceptance\" defined now? Why was the original plan changed, and why was a distance of 60 miles picked? How was information made available to and feedback drawn from ordinary residents as compared to the Consortium members, who apparently had much earlier detailed knowledge of the proposed facility? 25. Construction jobs and employment are major selling points of NBAF. So far, no exact number or type of jobs has been provided but the DHS to the community. When will we know exactly how many jobs NBAF will provide for local people, and how many workers will transfer from Plum Island? What construction jobs might be handled by federal contractors like Haliburton? What is the likely staffing plan for the facility, listed with pay grades and pay scales? How many positions at the NBAF are expected to be filled by managers, scientific staff (by area of interest; i.e., microbiologists, chemists, etc), clerical staff, building maintenance staff? 26. The Animal Health Research Center for the Veterinary school at UGA is a BSL-3ag facility that was originally proposed in 1978. \"The building - designed for the study of infectious diseases in animals and diseases that can spread from animals to humans - took more than a decade to complete while workers rebuilt poorly designed facilities, attorneys battled over who was at fault, and UGA officials looked for money to cover rising costs.\" (\"Beleaguered Animal Facility Awaits University Approval to Open\" - Athens Banner Herald, 8/20/07).9 cont.| 23.0 7 4.2 15| 15.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 52 of 60 No: 15 Issue Code: 15.0 The number of short-term and permanent jobs are discussed in Chapter 3, Section 3.10 of the NBAF EIS. It is expected that approximately 2,700 direct temporary jobs (2,100 for the Plum Island Site) would result from construction of the NBAF, with many of the jobs being filled locally. Between 250- 350 permanent jobs would result from operation of the NBAF, with much of the scientific work force relocating to the region.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-869 According to The Animal Health Research Center's website: \"The Center's Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) and Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories on the second floor were fully operational in the summer of 2006. The BSL-3 laboratories and BSL-3-Agricutural animal rooms on the first floor are undergoing commissioning and we expect them to be operational by the fall of 2007.\" During the construction of NBAF, will there be phased checks of completed sections - (\"commissioning\") - testing of completed sections rather than just having the facility checked after the whole thing is built? 27. In the Athens, GA EIS proposal on page 20, under the section \"Favorable Building Costs and Experienced Builders, it says, \"Building NBAF in Georgia will result in more facility for the $451M budgeted due to a low installation cost\" and lists several factors, one of them being \"successful completion of multiple BSL-3, BSL-3AG and BSL-4 facilities in Georgia, reducing the \"fear factor\" that escalates costs elsewhere in the country\" Please define what is meant by a \"fear factor\" and why it would escalate building costs elsewhere in the country? 28. Will all the trouble with the construction and completion of The Animal Health Research Center be a factor in the DHS's consideration of Athens for NBAF? How can the consortium promise \"low installation cost\" when The Animal Health Research Center went $43 million dollars over budget and is still not fully operational? 29. UGA's State Botanical Garden and Whitehall Forest were designated Georgia's 47th Important Bird Area (IBA) in 2006. The Audubon Society's IBA program is a global effort to identify and protect areas important for maintaining bird populations. IBAs are critical to birds during some part of their life cycle. Since UGA sought this designation, how will it protect the IBA ? The NBAF site area is between the Botanical Garden and Whitehall Forest. Are there any federal, state or local regulations that would prohibit destruction of IBA habitat or wildlife habitat? 30. All onsite bird and wildlife corridors should be identified. How will displaced species be dealt with? EIS should provide a detailed accounting of wildlife species affected by the development of this property, including any which are rare or endangered, and explain how it will avoid or mitigate destructive impacts to wildlife. 31. The Plum Island lab has \"its own drinking wells, oil storage tanks and sewer treatment plant.\" Under a state permit, it can dump 60,000 gallons of effluent into Long Island Sound each day.\" Where will the NBAF, a 500,000 square foot facility, dump its waste? What new utilities or upgrades will be necessary, and how will these be financed? 32. One of the aesthetic considerations for the Athens community is the viewscape from the adjoining roads, homes and businesses.

Section 3.13 of the NBAF EIS addresses waste management at the proposed NBAF. Waste management impacts common to all of the alternative sites are addressed in Section 3.13.2, waste management impacts under the No Action Alternative (i.e., at the existing Plum Island Animal Disease Center) are discussed in Section 3.13.3, and waste management impacts at the South Milledge Avenue Site are discussed in Section 3.13.4. Operation of the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site would generate wastewater; waste solids; and medical, hazardous, and industrial solid wastes. Impacts related to these wastes are similar under all action alternatives and are described in Section 3.13.2.2 along with proposed treatment methods for animal carcasses and pathological wastes. Specific information regarding disposal of sanitary wastewater and disposal of waste solids at the South Milledge Avenue Site is presented in Section 3.13.4.2. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-870 clearing lines and construction to scale, including all surrounding walls or security fences. It should present several alternatives for construction design of the structures and parking facilities--one of which should be an underground option for the research buildings and for parking. 33. Will there be 24 hour lighting? Show proposed lighting alternatives on detailed maps, including the light pollution aspects of lighting on nearby businesses, roads and residences. 34. Athens-Clarke County is designated a Tree City by the Arbor Day Foundation. How many trees will be removed from the site? Detail any regulations concerning the size and species of any specimen trees that must be left onsite Provide a detailed landscaping plan and lists of the size and species of replacement trees and shrubbery, and lists of screening materials to be used on border areas. 35. A mitigation plan for impacted cultural resources should be provided. An archaeological survey should be performed and found historical resources should be excavated and safeguarded. Historic and cultural sites should be identified and construction in these areas avoided. 36. Justify why this piece of land contain less--even up to half the acreage-- of other sites under consideration, including one that is an island. Why was Whitehall Farm, a pristine agricultural area bordering a river proposed for the project, instead of an industrial or business park? Please explain in detail why this is the safest and most appropriate place in the Athens area in which to locate this facility. 37. In exchange for environmental destruction of property bordering the State Botanical Garden, show on any remaining project site land any area that will be devoted to greenspace / passive outdoor recreation for employees and/or the public, should NBAF be built in Athens. 38. What will become of the equine facility and classrooms just constructed a few years ago on this site? In an extended drought, using the pastureland for grazing for UGA's stable of horses would appear to be the \"highest and best use\" of this property, which actually is its current use.Explain why the 500,000 sq ft NBAF facility, with all the attendant environmental destruction, would instead be the \"highest and best use\" of this property. 39. Since this site was chosen instead of an industrial park or site many miles away from public view, the surrounding neighborhood must be taken into consideration when designing the facility, from an aesthetic viewpoint. Since it adjoins the equine facility, please present as one alternative a plan that would complement that building in color, materials and exteriors. (Think \"red barn\" instead of industrial metal box) 40. What changes will be made to the already dangerous triangle at the intersection of Whitehall, South Milledge and Simonton Bridge? What traffic studies will be done, and how will downtown Watkinsville be impacted during and after construction? 6 cont.| 26.0 17| 7.22 cont.| 6.2 3 cont.| 6.2 20| 17.2WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 54 of 60 Comment No: 17 Issue Code: 7.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the visual effects of the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site, which are described in Section 3.2.3 of the NBAF EIS. DHS recognizes that the NBAF would be a distinctive visible feature including at night due to lighting and would alter the viewshed of the area. The NBAF would employ the minimum intensity of lighting that is necessary to provide adequate security. Mitigative measures, such as shielded lighting, will be considered in the final design of the NBAF. Comment No: 18 Issue Code: 22.2 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding cultural resources. Section 3.9 discusses cultural resources. Coordination letters with the State Historic Preservation Officers are included in Appendix G. DHS notes the commentor's concerns. Section 3.6 describes the potential impacts to surface water. Comment No: 19 Issue Code: 6.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern and acknowledges the proximity of the South Milledge Avenue Site to the State Botanical Garden. As described in Section 3.8.3.1.1 of the NBAF EIS, 80% of the site consists of pasture, and the adjacent lands consist of forested lands and small, perennial headwater streams. Approximately 30 acres of open pasture, 0.2 acres of forested habitat, and less than 0.1 acres of wetlands would be affected by the NBAF. However, construction and normal operations of the NBAF would have no direct impact on the State Botanical Garden as indicated in Sections 3.8.3.2 and 3.8.3.3. Comment No: 20 Issue Code: 17.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern about the traffic congestion in the area of the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative and the future impact of the NBAF operation on the area's transportation infrastructure. A discussion of the planned improvements to the area's primary transportation corridors of South Milledge Avenue and Whitehall Road to alleviate current and future traffc congestion resulting from the NBAF operation at the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative is located in Section 3.11.3.3.1 of the NBAF EIS. All planned improvements are per the recommendations of the Department of Transporation and the Public Works Department. DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding the handling and transport of packages containing pathogens. The general regulations governing the required NBAF transport of packages containing pathogens, and a discussion of the low risk associated with the shipment of infectious materials is provided in Section 3.11.9 of the NBAF EIS. More detailed information on the regulatory requirements, packaging / handling procedures, documentation / labeling procedures, and notification requirements for the transport of pathogens is provided in Section 2.2.2.3 of the NBAF EIS. Additionally, an analysis of accidental releases during transportation is provided in Section 3.14,Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-871 Health and Safety and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS. In terms of notification, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the recipent of the package will be the only ones notified when pathogens are shipped. Information regarding the existing road conditions and potential effects to traffic and transportation from the South Milledge Avenue Site is provided in Section 3.11.3 of the NBAF EIS.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-872 41. Calculate the amount of impervious surface that will be created onsite, and detail the hydrological impacts of the subsequent runoff as well as consequences to the Oconee River and its inhabitants for the pollution and soil erosion created by construction. Detail the short, long-term and cumulative impacts upon the river and its inhabitants, and present a mitigation plan. 42. What provisions will be made for the importation of pathogens from Plum Island or elsewhere? How will these be transported, and will the process be made public? How will the community's right to know be balanced with security against terrorism concerns during transporting processes? Explain why the proposed lab would not present an attractive terrorist target, and/or how such attacks could be avoided or mitigated short of a No Action option in Athens. 43. Discuss how the local taxpayer will be financially impacted by the pre-construction area upgrades, construction and operation of the NBAF lab, and present a detailed justification for the claims of short- and long- term economic benefits of this project to the Athens metropolitan area. _______________________________________________________________________ I submitted the following commentary to our local alternative newspaper Flagpole on 7/18/08. It was not published: Last week, government watchdog/author Russ Kick posted the NBAF feasibility study on his blog \"The Memory Hole.\" The 366-page document was prepared for the Department of Homeland Security by the NBAF Design Partnership - an ad-hoc Atlanta-based group of architectural engineers that was awarded 2.4 million dollars to do conceptual design work for the proposed facility. Kick obtained the document though a Freedom of Information Act request. I'm kind of envious because a few months ago I filed a FOIA to try to get hold of a letter the DHS sent out in March asking NBAF finalists to sweeten the pot. Word had leaked out that DHS was asking all the candidates for their best final offers of - additional requirements they would need to bring the 525,000 square foot germ lab to a town near you - and they had until the end of the month to reply. The answer I received from DHS was not as forthcoming as Kick's. It contained three exemptions explaining why the feds were not obligated to release the list of requirements (it would mess up the bidding process, don't 'cha know). They did release a cover letter - informing UGA's Dr. David Lee that since March 30 th fell on a Sunday, the postmarked due date was officially extended to the 31st. In short, I got squat.So it was with great interest that I perused the document which Kick says he was \"surprised and delighted\" to receive in completely uncensored form. There's lots of stuff here that's included in the nearly impenetrable behemoth of the recently released Draft Environmental Impact Study, and some stuff that's not (mention of Avian Influenza, Newcastle Disease and White Tailed Deer being studied at NBAF is all new to me) but there's one thing that grabbed my attention right off the bat. 13 cont.| 12.2 18 cont.| 22.220 cont.| 17.2 14 cont.| 15.2 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 55 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-873 In the table of acronyms, there was something called a \"SCIF\". Later on, under the section for Engineering, the feasibility study says that \" Security for the National Bio and Agro Defense Facility (NBAF), as outlined below, will be based on the following standards and guidelines: Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID) 6/9, Physical Security Standards for Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIFs), effective 11/18/2002, with administrative corrections dated 12/23/2002.\" It goes on to say: \" NBAF will have one central SCIF conference room.\" So what the hell is a SCIF?A SCIF (pronounced \"skiff\") is a \"Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility\" which would house SCI (I don't know how this is pronounced. \"Sigh\"?) - \"Sensitive Compartmented Information\". The government defines Sensitive Compartmented Information as \"Classified information concerning or derived from intelligence sources, methods, or analytical processes, which is required to be handled exclusively within formal control systems established by the Director of Central Intelligence.\" Newbold's Biometric Dictionary for Military and Industry tells us \" Moreover, programs handled under the SCI paradigm are normally not acknowledged by the US government .\" I remember when Ed Hammond of The Sunshine Project was here in Athens and said the new NBACC (pronounced \"En-Back\" -the soon-to- be-opened National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center at Fort Detrick in Fredrick, Maryland ) would be a SCIF. According to the Washington Post in 2006: Homeland Security officials plan to operate all 160,000 square feet of NBACC as a SCIF. \"Because of the building's physical security features -- intended to prevent the accidental release of dangerous pathogens -- it was logical to operate it as a SCIF,\" said Maureen McCarthy, Homeland Security's director of research and development. During the past year, transparency has been a big selling point to quell any fears the community may have about the Department of Homeland Security bringing NBAF to Athens. At the DHS hosted February 19 th Town Meeting, a slide in the presentation by The Department of Homeland Security read: \"Would the NBAF research be conducted in secret? There would be no classified research, but occasionally the NBAF could support classified FBI forensic investigations. Just as at PIADC, (Plum Island) research at the NBAF would be published in publicly available scientific journals.\" Commissioner Elton Dodson has told us \"All the work will be transparent. The results of these studies will be peer- reviewed and published in research journals. The public will have full 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 56 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-874 knowledge of the activities. If the feds suggest that this will not happen, my support will likely change.\" The UGA website reads: \"There will be no classified work at the NBAF.\"So despite assurances from The DHS, our local officials and UGA that NBAF will be transparent and that all research will not be classified, it turns out this may not be the case after all. What will go on in the SCIF conference room? If the proposed SCIF is intended for forensic FBI investigations and we don't know the scope of such activities, couldn't any kind of stuff that suits the needs of both agencies - the DHS and the FBI - be researched at NBAF in secret? And in the end, is any agency \"transparent\" when it doesn't disclose programs which it can not even admit exist in the first place? Is not the ultimate secret not even admitting you have one? I could find no mention of the SCIF conference room in the DEIS. Lots of things have changed since we first learned of NBAF: xFirst they told us teaspoons of live virus would be used there; now it's liters. xThe billons of economic development shrank to millions, while the water usage grew to an additional 10 to 20 million gallons per year. xWe were told all questions submitted during the scoping period would be answered in the DEIS, but many weren't. The DEIS doesn't even tell us what method will be used for infected animal disposal. xTheRed and Black reported details of a lawsuit filed against the University by a visiting scientist, alleging that UGA used \"fabricated data from published research resulting in more than $1 million in federal grants for the University,\" and allegedly casting an air of distrust around the entire NBAF process. xAnother DHS slide at the February Town Meeting read \"A total of about 250 to 350 employees would be employed at the NBAF, many from the local community.\" But DEIS figures show that those \"many\" jobs are now estimated at 69 positions. xAnd though no one saw fit to bring it up, we really should have know that to study deadly viruses carried by mosquitoes, you're going to need lots of mosquitoes to infects with deadly viruses. And ticks. And black biting flies and other vectors. All of which will be housed in NBAF's insectary. So with all these changes, who's to say whether the SCIF mentioned in the feasibility study for NBAF will just remain one conference room, or at some point expand to include the entire facility, just like NBACC? We'll all have one more chance to have our questions heard by DHS come the August 14 th meeting. From what we've learned so far, it's highly unlikely those questions will actually be answered . But perhaps we should take a shot anyway by asking DHS just what they mean by \"transparent\" this time around. 9 cont.| 23.0WD0858 7 cont.|27.0 DeGennaro, Matt Page 57 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-875 Matt DeGennaro is a freelance writer who lives within the dreaded \"Infected Zone.\" To see if you do too, go to the DEIS and check out Figure 3.14.4.1-2 \u2014 Far Field Distribution of Viral Pathogens Based On Time-Integrated Atmospheric Transport. I submitted the following oral comments at the August 14th, 2008 DEIS meeting. I would like to submit them as written comments as well: You were misled by the consortium on one of the criteria for selecting a site for NBAF. There was - and continues to be - no community acceptance of this project. On January 16, 2006 The Department of Homeland Security published a request for Expressions of Interest in The Federal Register. It called for proposals from \"Federal agencies, State and Local governments, industry, academia, interested parties and organizations for potential locations that would accommodate the construction and operation of the NBAF\" The Federal Register said \"DHS will evaluate each EOI submission using 4 site criteria categories (research capabilities, workforce, acquisition/construction/ operating and community acceptance ) to determine if it should be further evaluated as part of the site planning process.\" NBAF was described in the Federal Register as \"an integrated human, foreign animal, and zoonotic disease research, development and testing facility\" Interested parties had until March 31, 2006 to submit their Expression of Interest to the DHS. Governments across the country scrambled to establish groups to lure NBAF to their towns. They had only three months to come up with their best pitch. In Georgia, The Georgia Consortium for Health- and agro-security was thrown together. They pitched two sites in Athens - College Station Rd. as their \"primary site\" with south Miledege as their secondary site. In the Executive Summary for Georgia's expression of interest it states \"Importantly, Georgia also has an appropriate local work force and broad-based community support to guarantee the success of NBAF\" Later on, under the heading \"Community Acceptance\" we read \"Georgia wants NBAF\" In letters of support attached to the expression of Interest, addressed to Homeland Security director Michael Chertoff, our local officials from our governor to our mayor welcomed NBAF. As our representatives, all used to word \"we\" in their support and welcome. Mayor Davison wrote \"we stand ready to accept this facility and are prepared to assist in anyway we can\" Well, in March 2006 Georgia not only didn't want NBAF, we had no idea what the hell NBAF was. The first meeting that was open to the entire community was held almost a year and a half later on August 30, 2007.1 cont.| 5.2WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 58 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-876 Despite lack of community knowledge or acceptance, when the DHS came to inspect the sites six months earlier (April 24, 2007) Mayor Davison told the DHS \"that UGA leaders have done a good job keeping people informed about the proposal and because Athens has a very educated and engaged citizenry, the public has kept a close eye on the proposal and what it will mean for the community, she said.\" (ABH) Informing the community did seem to be part of the plan at one point. That same ABH article says Homeland Security spokesman Chris Kelly saying that \"UGA leaders must incorporate feedback from residents within a 60-mile radius of the site and show that they have either received community input or have a specific plan to draw feedback from area residents,\" When I asked David Lee about this in an email exchange and at the August 30 th meeting, he called this \"misinformation\" And factual information was hard to come by. Jeff Wilson publisher of our local paper The Athens Banner is on the board of The Athens-Clarke County Economic Development Foundation - which itself is a member of the Georgia consortium. With news headlines like \"UGA touts sites for defense lab as Chambliss visits\" chief likes will win fed lab\" and editorials tilted \"Defense facility seems a natural fit for university\" and \"Biotechnology dreams could become reality\" The community was never presented with a clear picture of what NBAF was or what potential risks it might have. We were just told what a great thing it would be, even up to this morning's paper. With the discovery yesterday of a captured terrorist possessing maps of Plum Island - The news this morning might read \"NBAF a possible terrorist target\" instead it reads \"NBAF Salaries at top end of local scale\" But make no mistake - you have been grossly misinformed - when the consortium told the DHS there was \"broad based community support\" there wasn't even community knowledge. And if Athens is selected as the site to build the world's largest bsl-4 lab, this community will do whatever it takes to prevent this from happening. ________________________________________________________________________ In closing I would like to submit the following internet link as a comment: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJB_QS93KBY It is an AP Video from April 11.2008 entitled \"Plum Island: Deadly Diseases on the Move?\" where former Plum Island director Roger Breeze is quoted as saying \"It goes against the main aspect of the safety program for the past 50 years\" and \"it seems a little bit odd to be relocating the lab in an agricultural area where there are lots of animals\" 21| 25.2 7 cont.| 27.0WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 59 of 60 Comment No: 21 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the information submitted by the commentor.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-877 Respectfully submitted, Matt DeGennaro WD0858 DeGennaro, Matt Page 60 of 60 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-878 DeLong, Janet Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.4 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the Manhattan Campus Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.4 DHS notes the commentor's concern. Chapter 1, Section 1.1 of the NBAF EIS identifies DHS's mission as the study of foreign animal and zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) diseases that threaten our agricultural livestock and agricultural economy. The goal or benefit of NBAF is to prevent these animal diseases from spreading in the United States through research into the transmission of these animal diseases and the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and antiviral therapies. DHS also notes the commentor's concerns regarding the risks associated with the proposed NBAF operation at the Manhattan Campus Site. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, The chances of an accidental release are low. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release based on human error are low in large part due to the design and implementation of biocontainment safeguards in conjunction with rigorous personnel training. For example, as described in Section 2.2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS, all laboratory staff would receive thorough pre- operational training, as well as ongoing training, in the handling of hazardous infectious agents, understanding biocontainment functions of standard and special practices for each biosafety level, and understanding biocontainment equipment and laboratory characteristics. Appendix B to the EIS describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large. As set out in Section 3.14.3.4 of the NBAF EIS, employees and contractors will be screened prior to employment or engagement and monitored while working, among other security measures. In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF, site specific protocols would then be developed in coordination with local emergency response agencies and would consider the diversity and density of populations residing within the local area. The need for an evacuation under an accident conditions is considered to be a very low probability event. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-879 DePaola, Brett Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.4 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the Manhattan Campus Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.4 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the potential consequences from a NBAF accident or pathogen release as the result of human error. As described in Section 2.2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS, all laboratory staff would receive thorough pre-operational training, as well as ongoing training, in the handling of hazardous infectious agents, understanding biocontainment functions of standard and special practices for each biosafety level, and understanding biocontainment equipment and laboratory characteristics. Appendix B of the NBAF EIS provides a comprehensive list of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratoryaccidents results, and consequences of theaccidents Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, including external events such as a terrorist attack. Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. As set out in Section 3.14.3.4 of the NBAF EIS, employees and contractors will be screened prior to employment or engagement and monitored while working, among other security measures. In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF, site specific protocols would then be developed in coordination with local emergency response agencies and would consider the diversity and density of populations residing within the local area. The need for an evacuation under an accident conditions is considered to be a very low probability event. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. DHS notes the commenter's concern regarding potential tornado impacts to the NBAF. The NBAF would be designed and built to withstand the normal meteorological conditions that are present within the geographic area of the selected site (hurricanes, tornados, etc.). Given the nature of the facility, more stringent building codes are applied to the NBAF than are used for homes and most businesses, regardless of which NBAF site is chosen. The building would be built to withstand wind pressures up to 170% of the winds which are expected to occur locally within a period of 50 years.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-880 This means the building's structural system could resist a wind speed that is expected to occur, on the average, only once in a 500 year period. In the unlikely event that a 500-year wind storm strikes the facility, the interior BSL-3Ag and BSL-4 spaces would be expected to withstand a 200 mph wind load (commonly determined to be an F3 tornado). If the NBAF took a direct hit from an F3 tornado, the exterior walls and roofing of the building would likely fail first. This breach in the exterior skin would cause a dramatic increase in internal pressures leading to further failure of the building's interior and exterior walls. However, the loss of these architectural wall components should actually decrease the overall wind loading applied to the building, and diminish the possibility of damage to the building's primary structural system. Since the walls of the BSL-3Ag and BSL-4 spaces would be reinforced cast-in-place concrete, those inner walls would be expected to withstand the tornado.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-881 Derry, Jeff Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.3 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Umstead Research Farm Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-882 Diaz, Ane Page 1 of 1 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 15.2 DHS notes the commentor's statement. A discussion of socioeconomics is presented in Section 3.10 of the NBAF EIS. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's lack of confidence in the DHS. DHS has made every effort to explain the operational aspects and potential impacts of NBAF and has conducted a thorough and open public outreach program in support of the NBAF EIS that exceeded NEPA requirements. DHS prepared the NBAF EIS in accordance with the provisions of NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and CEQ's regulations for implementing NEPA (40 CFR 1500 et seq.). Since the inception of the NBAF project and beginning with the release of DHS's request for Expressions of Interest (EOI) on January 19, 2006, DHS has supported a vigorous public outreach program and has been as forthcoming as possible in disseminating information about NBAF as program planning has matured over time. The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety were evaluated in Section 3.14 of the NBAF EIS. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low.
