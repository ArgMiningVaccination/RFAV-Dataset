(2007, JRSS-B ), Ju JRSS-B ), VanderWeele (2013, Biometrics ) 21Prentice (1989) Criteria for Checking the Definition of a Valid Surrogate Main Prentice criteria : 1. Vaccination impacts the immunological marker E[S|Z=1] > E[S|Z=0] 2. The immunological marker is associated with the clinical outcome in each of the vaccine and placebo groups E [ Y | S > s, Z=z] < E[Y|S s, Z=z] for some s and both z=0,1 3. The relationship between the immunological marker and the clinical outcome is the same in the vaccine and placebo groups E[Y|S = s, Z = 1] = E[Y|S = s, Z = 0] for all s 22Endpoint Y = Hospitalization with Weiss Strain A influenza during the winter flu season Incidence of Y Placebo group: 75 of 888 (8.45%) Vaccine group: 20 of 888 Estimated VE= (1 - 2.25/8.45) \u00d7100% = 73% Goal: Check the Prentice criteria for assessing Weiss Strain A antibody titer measured one week after vaccination as a valid replacement surrogate for Y Example: 1943 Influenza Vaccine Field Trial (Salk, Menke, and Francis, 1945) 23Criterion 1 Holds Criterion 1: Weiss strain A Ab titers are higher in the vaccine than placebo group Criterion 1 holds Placebo Group Vaccine Group Ab TiterPercent Percent 24Criteria 2 and 3 Hold* *Based on logistic regression and on empirical fitsCriterion 2: Check for an association of the marker with outcome in each treatment group Criterion 3: Check for consistency between the association models in the vaccine and placebo groups 25Prentice Criteria: 3 Challenges 1. For validity must include all dual predictors of the biomarker and the clinical outcome* 2. For validity must include all dual predictors of clinical risk before and after the biomarker is measured** 3. Cannot evaluate the Prentice operational criteria for vaccine trials for which there is ~no variability of the biomarker in the placebo group*** *E.g., Frangakis and Rubin (2002, Biometrics ), Gilbert et al. (2009, Stat Med ) **E.g., Wolfson and Gilbert (2010, Biometrics ) ***E.g., Chan et al. (2002, Stat Med ) 26Challenge 1 with the Prentice Criteria: Post- Randomization Selection Bias Checking criterion 3 entails checking, for each immune response level s, equal clinical risk between the groups {Vaccinees w/ marker level s} vs. {Placebos w/ marker level s} However, S is measured after randomization Therefore this comparison may reflect selection bias, potentially misleading about the markers' value as a surrogate endpoint* *This phenomenon has been discussed broadly including in Rosenbaum (1984, JRRSB), Robins (1986, Math Modeling ), Pearl (2000, 2009, Causality textbook), Frangakis and Rubin (2002, Biometrics ), Joffe and Greene (2008, Biometrics ) 27Illustration of Post-Randomization Selection Bias B i n a r y immunologic measurement (positive or negative) C o n s i d e r an unmeasured covariate reflecting strength of immune system (strong or weak) 2000 PlaceboN = 4000 2000 Vaccine 1000 Weak 10% w/ w/ pos between the groups Placebo Negative Response WeakStrongNegative Response WeakVaccine Strong Compares a group with 90% weak immune systems to one with 50% weak immune systems: Incomparable 29Challenge 2 with the Prentice Criteria: Unmeasured Dual Predictors of Early and Later Clinical Risk Y= Indicator of infection before the biomarker is measured For validity the statistical surrogate approach assumes no unmeasured simultaneous predictors V of Yand Y That is, for validity there cannot be any unaccounted for subject characteristics that predict both early and later clinical risk Practically speaking, this means that one must control for all clinical prognostic factors 30Practical Implications of Unmeasured Dual Predictors of S and Y Update the third Prentice criterion to E[Y|S = s, Z = 1, W] = E[Y|S = s, Z = 0, W] for all s with W measured baseline covariates, and W is assumed to include all dual predictors and all prognostic factors for Y I n checking the criteria through regression models, always include all baseline covariates W that may predict both S and Y or predict both Yand Y Acknowledge there may be residual confounding -C o n s i d e r a sensitivity analysis to assess the sensitivity of inferences to unmeasured confounding -C o n s i d e r making inference using estimated uncertainty intervals* that account for uncertainty due to partial nonidentifiability as well as due to sampling variability *E.g., Vansteelandt et al. (2006, Statistica Sinica ); Richardson et al. (2015, Stat Science ) 31Challenge 3 with the Prentice Criteria: Cannot be Checked if No Variability of the Marker in the Control Arm* The immunologic measurement is a response to a pathogen specific protein or proteins If trial participants have never been infected with the pathogen, the immune response will be \"non response\"/zero for (almost) all placebo recipients E.g., HIV vaccines The Prentice framework does not apply, because criterion 3 cannot be checked and it cannot hold *E.g., this challenge discussed by Chan et al. (2002, Stat Med ), Gilbert and Hudgens (2008, Biometrics ) 32Surrogate Failure Can Happen in Many Ways 1. The biomarker is not in the pathway of the intervention's effect, or is insensitive to its effect (e.g., stemming from measurement error) 2. The biomarker is not in the causal pathway of the disease process 3. The intervention has mechanisms of action independent of the surrogate mediated disease process 33 Encainide and flecainide in patients after a heart attack had a promising effect on the putative surrogate Arrhythmia suppression However, in a Phase 3 trial these drugs both increased the rate of mortality compared to placebo Classic example of the surrogate paradoxExample 1: CAST Trial* *Echt et al. (1991, New Engl J Med) 34Example 2: Acellular Pertussis Vaccines with Mechanisms of Action Independent of the Surrogate-Mediated Disease Process * (Sweden I Trial with DT control: 10,000 subjects) Other relevant immune responses not captured by the assay (incomplete measurement of Ab responses) *Example from Tom FlemingBiomarkers: Filamentous Haemagglutinin (FHA) and Pertussis Toxoid (PT) antibody responses were superior with the SKB with Mechanisms of Action Independent of the Surrogate-Mediated Disease Process AP Vaccine DiseaseFHA & PT AntibodiesConfirmed Pertussis Other immune responses, including those resulting from additional antigens in the vaccines: P e r t a c t i n Fimbriae (types 2 and 3) 363 Causes of the Surrogate Paradox* 1. [Confounding] Confounding of the association between the potential surrogate and the clinical endpoint (failure reason 1)** 2. [NonTransitivity] The vaccine positively affects both the surrogate and the clinical endpoint, but for different sets of participants (failure reason 2) 3. [OffTarget Effects] The vaccine may have a negative clinical effect in ways not involving the potential surrogate (failure reason 3) *VanderWeele (2013, Biometrics ) **Add to this confounding of the association between occurrence of the clinical endpoint before and after the surrogate is measured 37\"There is a plague on Man, the opinion that he knows something.\" Michel de Montaigne (1580, Essays ) 38\"Medicine is something a doctor prescribes while waiting for nature to cure the disease.\" Voltaire (mid-18thCentury) 39Inference to Assess the Prentice Criteria in the General Setting of Variability of S in Placebo Recipients Specify a regression model - E.g., logit(E[Y|Z=z,S=s]) = b0+ b1z + b2s + b3z\u00d7s First examine the interaction of Z \u00d7 S (b3) -I n t e r a c t i o n ( b3 0) implies Prentice criteria violated If no interaction ((b3= 0), examine the main effects of Z and S - Z main effect (b1 0) implies Prentice criteria violated - No S main effect (b2= 0) implies Prentice criteria violated -b1= 0 and b2 0 implies Prentice criteria The regression models must ma rginalize over potential baseline confounders W and must account for the marker sampling design (e.g., Breslow and Holubkov, 1997, JRSS-B for nested case-control studies) Example summary measure: Kobayashi and Kuroki (2014, Stat Med ) 402.

Meta-Analysis Framework Goal : Develop models such that vaccine effects on the immune response biomarker S can be used to reliably predict VE in different settings (e.g., across vaccine lots, vaccine formulations, human populations, viral populations) Approach to Evaluation: MetaAnalysis N pairs of immunologic and clinical endpoint assessments among vaccine and placebo recipients Pairs chosen to reflect specific target of prediction Example: Predict efficacy of new vaccine formulation: N vaccine efficacy trials of comparable vaccines but with different formulations Evaluation: Study the relationship between the estimated VEsand the estimated vaccine effects on the immune response 60Surrogate Endpoint Evaluation from Multiple Trials: Meta-Analysis (N = 25)* Treatment Effect on AIDs vs Treatment Effect on VL *HIV Surrogate Marker Collaborative Group (2000, AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses )Treatment Effect on AIDs vs Treatment Effect on CD4 61Simulated Meta- Analysis* Based on 29 Influenza Vaccine Trials (Villari et al., 2004, Vaccine) Selected all placebocontrolled influenza vaccine trials of parainfluenza virus vaccines with 3p l a c e b o cases The N = 29 studies span different flu seasons over 3040 years Objective: Predict VE for next year's flu season Clinical endpoint = clinically Confirmed influenza infection Marker endpoint = log Ab titer to the dominant strain circulating in the trial regionEstimated VE vs Average difference in log Ab titer (Vaccine Placebo) *Qin et al.

Meta-analysis of a series of vaccine efficacy trialsAssociate causal effects on the immune response with causal effects on the clinical outcome, for predicting VE in new settings Trial level; Trial level + individual level [Literature led by Geert Molenberghs, Marc Buyse, et al.] 67Outline Session 3 I n t r o d u c t i o n to immune correlates P r e d i c t i o n paradigm vs. mechanism of protection paradigm Frameworks for statistical assessment of immune response biomarkers as correlates of protection (CoPs)/surrogate endpoints 1. Surrogate endpoint for the clinical endpoint providing reliable inferences about VE [valid replacement endpoint] 2. Policy/predictors of VE [controlled effects] and mediators of VE [natural direct and indirect effects] 3. Effect modifiers of VE [one or a few efficacy trials] 4. Effect modifiers of VE [metaanalysis of a series of efficacy trials] Summary and conclusions 68Conclusions and Discussion (1) What about 'modern data?' 1. Microarrays, proteomics, microbiomics, etc. The concepts and principles are the same 2. Promise of modern data: May yield more comprehensive understanding of vaccine effects and of the infection and disease process, yielding mechanistic correlates that could not be uncovered with lowerdimensional techniques May yield earlier predictive correlates (closer to randomization), greatly aiding surrogate assessment methods and improving their practical utility E.g., 24 subgroups may be defined based on highdimensional expression array or cell subpopulation frequency profiles, and the categorical subgroup variable may be assessed as a correlate of protection 69Conclusions and Discussion (2) All of the surrogate endpoint frameworks are useful, with distinct applications Settings where diseaseexperienced individuals are vaccinated -A l l frameworks apply and may bear fruit in a complementary way Settings where vaccine is given to diseasena\u00efve persons 1. Prentice criteria do not apply; the Prentice definition can be checked by other means 2. Controlled and natural effects frameworks arguably do not apply 3. Effect modification/VE curve framework appealing because identifiability easier 4. Meta analysis applies 70Conclusions and Discussion (3) Understanding surrogate endpoint validity is highly inter disciplinary and requires synthesis of many experimental and data sources Basic science, preclinical research, clinical research work iteratively and in parallel to generate and test hypotheses Knowledge of mechanism is particularly important for building credibility of valid surrogate endpoints, especially for bridging efficacy to new settings 71Descartes vs. Pascal: Complexity of the Surrogate Endpoint Problem Cartesian scientific method for discovering scientific truth: Accepting as \"truth\" only clear, distinct ideas that could not be doubted Breaking a problem down into parts Deducing one conclusion from another Conducting a systematic synthesis of all things Limited success for biology: overlyoptimistic about what 'reductionist science' could deducePascal was skeptical about what Descartes' method could deliver: \"But the parts of the world are all so related and linked together that I think it is impossible to know one without the other and without the whole\" Blaise Pascal (1670, The Pensees , Lafuma Edition, No. 199) Correctly anticipated that complexity is too great to understand via reductionist methods 72 "}
