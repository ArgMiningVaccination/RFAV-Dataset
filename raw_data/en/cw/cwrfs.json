Without adequate alkaline minerals, which are necessary to offset increases in acidity, your body struggles to maintain its internal acid/alkaline levels. This impacts your general health and energy levels, leading to many common health niggles such as heartburn, headaches and gout. Multiforce Alkaline Powder contains readily absorbable forms of calcium, magnesium and potassium. These minerals support the organs involved in maintaining and correcting the acid/alkaline balances in the body. - Helps support the body's pH regulating mechanisms - Helps neutralize stomach acid - Treats acid reflux, heartburn - Treats indigestion, gas and bloating - Has a bowel cleansing effect - Helps prevent the formation of kidney stones - Helps build bones and helps prevent bone loss - Reduces blood pressure and cardiac ailments - Has antioxidant properties Multiforce\u00ae Alkaline Powder can be used daily as part of a health management programme by adults and children over the age of 6 years. Adults: Add a heaped teaspoon or medicine measure (7.5g) or the contents of one 7,5g sachet of the powder to a large glass of water, stir well and drink once a day on an empty stomach.

In the presence of reduced renal function, hyperkalaemia, hypercalcaemia and alkalosis may be produced. The typical Western-type diet, deficient in fruits and vegetables and containing large quantities of sugar, animal and dairy products, generates acid-forming chemicals in the body. While the body has its own pH buffering systems to counteract a high dietary acid load, over time this diet may leave the body struggling to maintain the correct pH balances throughout. Long-term high dietary acid load is associated with increased risk for numerous lifestyle-related diseases, including osteoporosis. Multiforce\u00ae Alkaline Powder is a multi-mineral dietary supplement that is proven to increase urinary pH. An increase in urinary pH is associated with a more alkaline body pH meaning there is less acidity in the body. The maintenance of optimal mineral and acid-base balance is linked to an increase in general well being. As with most things in life, good health is also about finding the right balance. "}
