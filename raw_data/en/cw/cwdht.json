Well-noted and deeply effective, it is a means to treat a wide range of physical and emotional symptoms. The system of Homeopathy originated in 1796 with the innovative work of German physician and chemist, Samuel Hahnemann, M.D. His pioneering work showed a deep understanding of the mind-body connection, strongly influenced by the concepts of alchemy. The founding homeopathic principle \"like cures like,\" evolved from the early teachings of Hippocrates, the father of Western medicine. Both Hippocrates and Hahnemann observed that a similarity exists between the symptoms caused by an active substance in high doses, and the symptoms relieved by the same substance in ultra-low doses. The process stimulates the body's inborn healing capacity. Homeopathic remedies are recognized to have a therapeutic effect; they are non-allergenic, non-toxic, and free of side effects. They are manufactured and controlled by the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the U.S. and the F.D.A. The laws that govern their manufacturing are outlined in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. An initial homeopathic consultation encompasses a comprehensive history and exam, wherein the practitioner obtains information about the physical, mental, and emotional nature of a person's archetype. Constitutional homeopathic treatment is based on the totality of symptom patterns arising from our vital force, reflecting our inner strength and resiliency. "}
