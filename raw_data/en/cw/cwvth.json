Risks Of Using Chinese Herbs For Weight Loss Despite its positive effects, traditional Chinese medicine along with Chinese herbs is not completely risk-free. Numerous researches show that some components may be toxic, and some Chinese herbal products are contaminated with incorrect herbs, undeclared plant or animal material, some of which resulted in organ damage, drugs (blood-thinner warfarin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, and others), heavy metals, pesticides, and sulfites, which could cause severe allergic reactions or asthma ( [13](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/traditional-chinese-medicine-what-you-need-to-know), [11](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21077025/), [5](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/04/dangers-chinese-medicine-brought-light-dna-studies)). In other words, when you buy Chinese herbs for weight loss, you never know what exactly is there. Some formulas may contain components, which were not mentioned on the label. If you think that it's not a big deal and can't be that dangerous, think about it as medications, which it often presents itself as. Imagine that you are buying vitamin supplements at a drug-store, and they contain particles of other medicine, that induce diarrhea, nausea, or increase your blood pressure. And now imagine your body's reaction to a consistent intake of those vitamin supplements, especially if you already suffer from high blood pressure. So, you can never be sure whether those formulas are what they should be, or whether they pose a threat to your health and wellness.
