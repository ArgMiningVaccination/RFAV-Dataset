It involves a variety of pseudoscientific procedures marketed as \"natural,\" \"non-invasive,\" or \"self-healing.\" Naturopaths', or practitioners of naturopathic medicine's, practises vary greatly and are difficult to generalise. Treatments range from quackery, such as homoeopathy, to well acknowledged treatments, such as psychotherapy. The medical profession regards naturopathy as ineffectual and hazardous, creating ethical concerns about its practise. Naturopaths have been regularly vilified as and accused of being charlatans and practising quackery, in addition to condemnations and criticism from the medical establishment, such as the American Cancer Society. The name \"naturopathy\" is derived from the Latin words \"natura\" (birth) and \"pathos\" (suffering) to mean \"natural healing.\" Naturopaths consider Hippocrates, the ancient Greek \"Father of Medicine,\" to be the earliest champion of naturopathic medicine, even before the phrase was coined. John Scheel invented the term \"naturopathy\" in 1895, and it was purchased by Benedict Lust, whom naturopaths regard as the \"Father of U.S. Naturopathy.\" Naturopathy is founded on the notion that the body has the power to heal itself via the use of a specific vital energy or force that guides bodily processes within. Diagnosis and treatment are primarily concerned with alternative therapies and \"natural\" procedures that naturopaths believe boost the body's natural ability to recover. A consultation usually begins with a thorough patient interview that includes questions about lifestyle, medical history, emotional tone, and physical attributes, as well as a physical examination. Many naturopaths position themselves as primary care doctors, and some naturopathic physicians may prescribe medicines, conduct minor surgery, and integrate other conventional medical procedures into their naturopathic practise, such as nutrition and lifestyle counselling. Traditional naturopaths only deal with lifestyle modifications and do not diagnose or treat disease. Naturopaths often do not advocate vaccines or antibiotics, owing to early beliefs that defined the field, and they may provide alternative cures even when evidence-based therapy has been demonstrated to be beneficial. The specific techniques employed by a naturopath differ depending on their training and scope of practise. Herbalism, homoeopathy, acupuncture, nature cures, physical medicine, applied kinesiology, colonic enemas, chelation therapy, colour therapy, cranial osteopathy, hair analysis, iridology, live blood analysis, ozone therapy, psychotherapy, public health measures and hygiene, reflexology, rolfing, massage therapy, and traditional Chinese medicine are examples of such treatments. Nature treatments include a variety of therapies based on natural elements such as sunlight, fresh air, or heat or cold, as well as nutrition advice such as adopting a vegetarian and whole food diet, fasting, or abstaining from alcohol and sugar. The medical establishment rejects naturopathy as a whole because it lacks an adequate scientific foundation. Although it incorporates solid lifestyle recommendations from mainstream medicine (such as getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, and exercising regularly), it also includes a variety of pseudoscientific beliefs. Some approaches rely on immaterial \"vital energy fields\" whose existence has not been demonstrated, and there is fear that naturopathy as a field is becoming isolated from broader scientific debate. Naturopathy is chastised for its reliance on and association with unproven, disproven, and other contentious alternative medical treatments, as well as its vitalistic basis. Natural chemicals known as nutraceuticals show little promise in the treatment of diseases, particularly cancer, because laboratory research have revealed a limited therapeutic effect on biochemical pathways, while clinical trials show inadequate bioavailability. Naturopathic doctors now claim to be primary care physicians who are skilled in both \"conventional\" and \"natural\" medicine. Their education, on the other hand, is a mere fraction of that of primary care physicians. Furthermore, an analysis of their literature exposes a plethora of pseudoscientific, useless, immoral, and potentially deadly methods. Naturopaths frequently prescribe exposure to naturally occurring substances such as sunlight, herbs, and particular meals, as well as natural activities such as exercise, meditation, and relaxation. Naturopaths argue that these natural remedies assist restore the body's natural ability to heal itself without the side effects associated with conventional therapy. However, \"natural\" procedures and chemicals are not always safer or more successful than \"artificial\" or \"synthetic\" methods and chemicals, and any treatment capable of eliciting a benefit may also have negative side effects. The American Naturopathic Association (ANA), which represents over 1,800 practitioners, and the American Naturopathic Medical Association are the two organisations that represent traditional naturopaths in the United States (ANMA) [1-5]. Traditional naturopaths in the United States have varying levels of naturopathic training. Traditional naturopaths may complete non-degree certificate programmes or undergraduate degree programmes, and they are sometimes referred to as naturopathic consultants. These programmes frequently provide unaccredited online degrees but do not provide substantial biomedical education or clinical training. References 1.
