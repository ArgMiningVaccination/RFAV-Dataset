Not that Professor Maskell is going far; after nine years leading the Department he has been promoted to become the Head of the School of Biological Sciences here at the University of Cambridge. The School of Biological Sciences encompasses nine Departments (including Veterinary Medicine) alongside five externally funded institutes. Duncan's new role will be strategic; aiming to ensure that biological science in Cambridge continues to innovate through world-leading research while offering excellent teaching.During the past few months, in preparation for the transition, Professor Wood has increasingly been contributing to the Department's future plans. But don't expect anything too radical - James is keen to emphasise that he is inheriting a healthy, forward-thinking Department and that he wants to maintain the momentum. James will increase the emphasis on promotional activities though as he is keen to spread the word about all the great work going on at Cambridge Veterinary School.Building work has recently begun on the Hospital's \u00a33m refurbishment (see page 4) which will predominantly house a state-of-the-art Clinical Skills Teaching Laboratory, invaluable for delivering an increasingly demanding syllabus. James commented that the new teaching facility will keep Cambridge at the forefront; \"It is imperative to be responsive to a changing world whilst ensuring that our course continues to offer the best possible scientific and clinical education\".For James, time in the field to continue his specific interest in infectious diseases will doubtless be more limited but he has a strong group that will keep him involved with the research. Duncan's new role will offer a welcome opportunity to return to the lab one day a week as there will be clearer delineation between his two roles and he will have protected time to spend on his research interests.As Higher Education continues to face increasing budgetary restrictions and the requirements of veterinary education become more demanding, there will continue to be many and varied challenges. James seems undaunted by the task ahead paying tribute to Duncan's leadership which, he feels, has contributed to the Cambridge Veterinary School being transformed over the last decade to meet changing commercial, educational and research needs.Avete!http://camvet.vet.cam.ac.uk/ Department of Veterinary Medicine ALUMNI NEWSLETTER Academic Year 2013-14 vol.11 Inside this issue >A New Chapter for Cambridge New Head of the Department of Veterinary Medicine James Wood Thank you Royal CaninClare BryantDr Joy ArcherSeizures in dogsBOAS-affected dogs The sheepImmune Mediated Haemolytic Anaemia50th Anniversary celebrationRoland MinorEmergency large animal rescue 3 7 4 67 682 2 2 3 2 Avete! Recruitment is currently underway to appoint a brand new Senior Training Scholarship in partnership with sponsors Royal Canin. The post, specialising in companion animal medicine, will be for three years and will offer an exceptional opportunity to gain a specialist qualification through a structured training programme. In addition, the postholder will work alongside Royal Canin to gain a full understanding of small animal nutrition and teach students about clinical diets and assist them with nutritional assessments. Dr Pauline Devline, Royal Canin's Director of Scientific Communications and Corporate Affairs who has worked alongside Professor Michael Herrtage and the Trust Office to establish the post, commented \"We are delighted to have this fantastic opportunity to work with such a prestigious learning establishment, particularly as we both share a common direction in serving pets. We're very much looking forward to further building our relationship with the Vet School through the scholarship to achieve some very positive outputs in our goal to serve more pets through making their lives happier and healthier for longer\". Professor Herrtage added that he is immensely grateful to Royal Canin for their support as it will provide a budding, young veterinarian with a unique opportunity to specialise in small animal medicine and clinical nutrition.Congratulations to Clare Bryant, the first ever woman to become a Professor at the Cambridge Department of Veterinary Medicine. Clare who has become Professor of Innate Immunology is delighted by the appointment adding \"It is the result of a large amount of hard work; not least by the many PhD students and postdoctoral researchers with whom I have had the privilege to work with during my time at the Cambridge Veterinary School. \"Cambridge is an amazing place to work and being surrounded by so many talented people makes life incredibly interesting. My research involves travelling a lot, particularly in North America and I am now lucky to have a strong cohort of international friends and colleagues. \"It is a little odd to realise that I am the first female professor in a department where the staff are predominantly women. I hope I am the first of many similar appointments here and that my new position here will, in some way, enable me to help the many talented colleagues with whom I work in the Cambridge Veterinary School to achieve their goals.\"The Bryant Laboratory studies how specialised receptors on cells recognise pathogens. Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Nod-like receptors (NLRs), in different mammalian species detect purified bacterial ligands and infecting bacteria such as Salmonella entericia serovar Typhimurium.Thank you Royal Canin!A long-awaited first! On Friday 5 July 2013 Dr Joy Archer was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in recognition of her contribution to the profession at the Annual General Meeting of the RCVS in London.Joy has been at the forefront of the discipline of veterinary clinical pathology for many years and has rightly been recognised for her selfless hard work and achievements. She is a dedicated and popular educator and scientist working both within the Vet School and more widely. She is already a Fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists and a Founder Diplomat of the European College of Veterinary Clinical Pathology. She has worked hard for the increased recognition of veterinary clinical pathology and used her acceptance speech to indicate her hope that the RCVS can develop stronger links with the other Royal Colleges.

Diazepam and midazolam are two benzodiazepines commonly used as a first line medication to cease seizure activity either at hospital or home. The rectal use of diazepam is considered a classical route of administration. The main aim of our study is to improve the management of seizures at home by the owners. We will therefore be evaluating the effectiveness and easiness of an alternative route (intranasal) compared to classical rectal one. In humans, many trials have been performed using intranasal midazolam for controlling acute seizures in numerous clinical studies - in the hospital, before arrival at the hospital, and in extended care and home settings. The results have shown that intranasal midazolam appeared to have faster action compared to rectal diazepam in the treatment of seizure exacerbations and proved easier to administer with an overall satisfaction. The nasal route is an easy access way of administering the drug into an animal or person. The mucosal surfaces are a good site since they offer a large surface area for drugs to be absorbed across, adjacent to the brain. Midazolam can cross the blood-brain barrier and enters the central nervous system, with a rapid clinical effect. In addition to this, it has been shown that intranasal administration may also enter the cerebrospinal fluid and brain directly (avoiding blood brain barrier) via the olfactory mucosa. This is especially advantageous in refractory cases. All these pharmacological advantages of intranasal administration of midazolam make it reach the systemic circulation more rapidly and also more effective in controlling acute childhood seizures. In dogs, pharmacokinetics of intranasal midazolam have been investigated and showed to be superior to the rectal solution with respect to peak plasma concentration and bioavailability. However, effectiveness of intranasal midazolam for controlling acute seizures has not yet been evaluated in dogs. Therefore, a multi-centre randomized clinical controlled trial was designed to provide this evidence. Dogs presented with status epilepticus (de fined as tonic-clonic generalized or prolonged focal convulsions lasting longer than 5 minutes or with no regain of full consciousness in between) will be recruited (with owner consent). The diagnosis for each dog will be recorded and will be based on neurological examination and recent blood work regardless of the MRI scan of the brain and/or CSF analysis. Cases will be recruited from The Queen's Veterinary School Hospital, Cambridge RSPCA Clinic and other UK and non-UK referral neurological hospitals. We would also be pleased if veterinary practitioners could help us by referring such cases to QVSH to try the protocol. If you are interested in referring cases or knowing more details about the trial you could contact the QVSH small animal reception (01223 337621 or 01223 337669) and ask to speak with the Neurologist. Marios Charalambous Dr VetMed, MRCVS, Junior Clinical Training Scholar Nai-Chieh Liu DVM, Clinical PhD Student Brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS) is a common cause of distress, morbidity and mortality in short skulled (brachycephalic) dog breeds such as the Bulldog, Pug and Pekingese. Signs of BOAS include increased respiratory noise, exercise intolerance, regurgitation, heat stroke, cyanosis and collapse, and can lead to premature deaths of these dogs. Over the past few years, a prospective study looking at non-invasive assessment of respiratory function in brachycephalic dogs before and after upper airway corrective surgery has been carried out, led by Jane Ladlow. The initial objectives of the study are to explore the practicality of a non-invasive technique for respiratory monitoring in dogs and to understand the characteristics of the respiratory cycle in brachycephalic dogs that show clinical signs caused by BOAS. Whole body barometric plethysmography (WBBP) is a clinical technique that allows measurement of the respiratory cycle in dogs with minimal bodily restraint. The dog stays in a large transparent chamber for 30 minutes and breathes naturally without any invasive intervention such as air-tight masks or sedation. These tests have been performed on over 140 dogs with no obvious signs of distress. This non-invasive respiratory function assessment not only provides quantitative data of respiratory parameters, but also generates tidal flow waveforms that give detailed information about breathing disorders.At present we are running a breed study of the French Bulldog. In addition to the BOAS-affected French Bulldogs that we have seen in our clinic, we are recruiting non-affected dogs from the breed clubs. Our preliminary results suggested the WBBP technique is sensitive enough to show statistical differences in respiratory parameters between clinical cases and normal groups. We have found that the respiratory traces of BOAS-affected dogs display fluctuating waveforms with disordered flow peaks over both inspiratory and expiratory phases in comparison with the traces displayed by controls. Interestingly, although the BOAS-free brachycephalic group shows slightly different respiratory patterns to that of longer skulled controls of other breeds, these dogs seem to be able to maintain ventilation levels comparable to the non-brachycephalic dogs.Based on our initial work using the WBBP technique and with statistical assistance from a veterinary epidemiologist, Vicki Adams, we are beginning a number of additional studies to better understand the disease: to find out in greater detail the associations between skull and soft tissue dimensions and respiratory function; to compare the effectiveness of turbinectomy with conventional BOAS surgery; to look at the effect of different sedatives on brachycephalic breeds; and with Dr Sargan, a veterinary geneticist, we are developing experiments to define the genetic basis of BOAS. Although the issue of BOAS has been widely discussed in veterinary medicine, there is little detailed understanding of pathogenesis of the disease. The technique of WBBP will help us to better understand the disease and the respiratory physiology of brachycephalic breeds. We would like to call for cases, both BOAS-affected and non-affected Pugs, French Bulldogs, and Bulldogs are required. If you require any further information regarding this study, please do not hesitate to contact us.Non-invasive respiratory function test in Brachycephalic dogs - Whole Body Barometric Plethysmography (WBBP)Evaluation of the effectiveness of Intranasal Midazolam compared to Rectal Diazepam for the treatment of acute seizures in dogs Skull of a Pug4 Avete! As you may have seen from recent veterinary related press, following a review of the Hospital facilities in 2011, work has commenced on a \u00a33m building project to create even better on-site facilities for student training and the treatment of animals in our care. Two incredibly generous bequests will cover the cost of the new building and refurbishment work to provide: a clinical skills teaching laboratory; new accommodation for clinicians and veterinary interns; relocation of consultation rooms and an upgrade to include a student teaching consultation room; relocation of the clinical pathology laboratory; a new pharmacy; and relocation of the Trust's office to within the Hospital.With the majority of the costs covered, the Trust has launched the Camvet Campaign to raise the \u00a3330,000 needed to equip the clinical skills teaching laboratory and new consultation rooms. The clinical skills teaching laboratory will be a dedicated instructional room with dozens of interactive models and simulators for training and self-study. As such, it will play a crucial role in the students' learning experience by allowing them to practise essential technical skills over a wide range of disciplines in a low-stress environment, and enable them to become proficient with procedures and equipment before using them on animal patients. Modern clinical skills teaching laboratories have a very positive effect on veterinary students' clinical performance - including, on graduation, increasedconfidence and competence during their first few weeks and months in their new jobs.

The team is working in collaboration with a number of other European institutes within the programme including SRUC (formerly SAC) in Edinburgh, the University of Milan in Italy, the Technical University of Lisbon in Portugal and Havelland Equine Hospital in Germany. The project at Cambridge aims to ascertain reliable valid indicators of pain to enable effective assessment of welfare in sheep when suffering from footrot, mastitis or pregnancy toxaemia. It is hoped that such indicators will be used in future by both practitioners and stock people alike and so a multidimensional approach has been taken. Combining clinical assessment of the disease, with behavioural and physical responses will enable an in-depth assessment of the welfare status of the sheep. The work includes the development of a facial expression pain scale for sheep as well as looking for distinct behavioural cues suggestive of pain. The development of biomarkers such as cytokines within serum of sheep as well as cortisol levels in the wool will be used to support the behavioural results. Together these will be used to create a composite pain scale that can be used with future cases. Footrot has been the main disease observed in recent months with affected sheep being treated with the parenteral antibiotics tulathromycin (Draxxin, Zoetis), plus in half the cases NSAID meloxicam (Metacam, Boehringer). Their behaviour and physiological parameters will be compared to control animals with no evidence of the disease in future analysis. Tulathromycin and meloxicam are not licensed for use in sheep, but are being used 'off label' under the dispensing Cascade. Tulathromycin is a long lasting antibiotic with a narrower spectrum making it more suitable than shorter acting broad spectrum antibiotics for treating this chronic disease, with reduced risk of antibiotic resistance. Initial reports from the farmers appear to suggest that those sheep treated with Draxxin have experienced little or no footrot again in the next 6 months after initial treatment. However analysis to confirm this anecdotal evidence is still required. The use of NSAID's during painful disease suffering may aid the recovery of animals as well as improving their welfare, and we are interested to see if meloxicam can provide benefits in the treatment of footrot.The project has been running since October 2012 and runs until March 2015. If you are currently looking after a flock of sheep in the Cambridge area and we have not yet contacted you, and you would like to know more about being involved with the project, please contact Krista McLennan at kmm55@cam.ac.uk for more information. Cambridge Scientists Investigate Pain in Sheep Blood tests taken at her own vet had shown that she was severely anaemic, with a packed cell volume of 9% (normal is 37-55%) and so she was referred to us with a suspicion of immune mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA). Further tests undertaken here showed that she had a positive slide agglutination test and a positive Coomb's test with spherocytosis supportive of IMHA. Unusually, there were minimal signs of regeneration of red blood cells suggesting immune mediated destruction of the red cell precursors in the bone marrow.In light of the severe anaemia Tia was given a transfusion of packed red blood cells and she was started on immunosuppressive doses of prednisolone and cyclosporine to halt the disease process. Screening was also undertaken for any underlying diseases which was negative.Initially the transfusion worked, raising the PCV to 20% however within 24 hours Tia had become lethargic again and her PCV was found to have dropped to 11%. It was evident that Tia's disease was very aggressive and so we felt that rapid intervention was required. With this in mind she was given an infusion of human intravenous immunoglobulin as well as a second blood transfusion.The response to this was excellent, with a PCV of 25% after the transfusion and a much brighter Tia. Within a few days a strong regenerative response was also seen indicating the disease was in remission. She was discharged after 5 days with a PCV of 29% and climbing each day.Over the following months the immunosuppressive medication has been gradually tapered down and Tia has continued to do well.Tia was given blood provided by Pet Blood Bank UK, an organisation that relies on donations from a network or volunteer donors across the country. The QVSH always keeps stocks of blood for use in our patients and for the benefit of local practices. We are very grateful to the owners of the blood donors who allow this service to run as it has clearly saved countless lives. The QVSH are happy to take referrals in any area of haematology and transfusion medicine, please contact us if you would like to discuss any case in more detail (01223 337621).

What must be a unique event took place in Cambridge on Saturday 8 th June this year - a reunion of veterinary graduates who qualified fifty years ago from Cambridge in 1963. Prompted by a letter from the Veterinary School Trust and initiated by David Stubbings, one of the graduates, a major round up started - firstly to find everyone, and then coerce and cajole them into coming! Out of a total of 17 graduates that year, 13 of us made it to the event. Apart from the opportunity to meet up again and see if we were still identifiable to each other, it was felt that we had had such an enormous range of veterinary careers that we would have something to offer the current students too in terms of guidance and scope - many of us having experienced alternative careers beyond practice. Looking briefly at the year's achievements, we included two (now Emeritus) Professors, a former President of the RCVS, a Fellow of the Royal Society, two Fellows of the RCVS, and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in the world of academia. Four of us had worked for part of our lives overseas in developing countries, one of whom had worked all his life in Africa (see below ). Most of us had worked at some time in practice and some had gone on to work in the Ministry of Agriculture either in the State Veterinary Service or the Veterinary Investigation Service. Ex- presidents of at least two veterinary species societies were represented. The one time Head of the RSPCA was also one of the group and two had been awarded honours for services to veterinary and medical science. How then could we pass on the benefit of our experience to the current generation? After an initial meet up for coffee and mutual recognition we adjourned to one of the lecture theatres (there was only one in our day!) where we were joined by a group of students from the 4th, 5th and 6th years where five of us briefly talked about our varying experiences.Together with the students we adjourned to the senior common room. This provided a great opportunity for them to quiz us and equally for us to appreciate the rigours of veterinary training today. One thing for instance that I was unaware of was the fact that they all did electives in their final year on the lines of the medical profession. From my own brief experience of teaching at Liverpool University, it was wonderful to see again the tremendous enthusiasm that the young have and the broad width of their knowledge.To conclude the daytime event, we had a conducted tour of the Vet School. Although we could easily recognise the old structure of the buildings, the range of equipment and the new buildings to house it was unbelievably staggering. From the nature of the many operating theatres, the extensive radiology department, to the enormous linear accelerator in the oncology department most of us were left speechless. It was increasingly obvious why there was a need for the Trust, as a charity, to raise the funds to maintain and expand the facilities, in order that students graduating today can enter the veterinary profession with the benefit of a completely up to date educational experience and qualifications. Finally in the evening we sat down with our partners to a formal dinner in St. John's College, which also gave us the opportunity to entertain Professor Maskell and Professor Herrtage, who so kindly allowed us to hold the Reunion at the Vet School. Roland Minor knew early on that he wanted to become a vet and, after graduating from Cambridge in 1963, he left the UK for his first post in Uganda. He has since spent most of his life in Africa, holding senior government posts and practising independently in Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan and Botswana, with a brief return to the UK in 2001 to help manage the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. In 2010 the OIE and the Food & Agriculture Organisation announced the eradication of rinderpest, otherwise known as cattle plague; the second disease to have been eradicated globally, the first being smallpox. I was one of the first vets in 1965 to use the new vaccine and remained involved in the programme until my visits to Sudan in the last decade when I assisted in defining the eradication of the disease.Early on in the 1960s I was involved with large scale livestock disease control programmes amongst barely-dressed-cattle-rustling-pastoralists in north-eastern Uganda and better-dressed-cattle-rustling-pastoralists in southern Ethiopia. In Uganda I was also dragged into the investigation of a completely new disease which later became known as Marburg haemorrhagic fever or green monkey disease; a terrifyingly contagious disease which killed laboratory technicians working with monkey kidneys, their families and the medical staff treating them. The epidemiological evidence indicated the disease was of viral origin whereas my interests then were in protozoal diseases but, as I found later, this had little to do with my selection - I was chosen for the role because I was unmarried!During the '70s I set up a practice in Mombasa on Kenya's tropical coast providing services to large scale cattle ranchers, small animal owners and others. Here I found a number of diseases which had not been identified in that area previously. Most unpleasant of all was an outbreak of rabies which the government sought to conceal because of the adverse effects on tourism. To make matters worse there was evidence that the government issued a vaccine which was the actual cause of some reported cases. Subsequently I published a paper describing the clinical aspects of the disease in dogs which included more case reports than the sum of all the other reports in western journals in the previous half-century. As a consequence I was offered a post as a senior research fellow at the Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine in Edinburgh. I didn't find academia half as exciting as field work and after a short period there I moved on to southern Sudan which was experiencing a short-lived break in a prolonged and devastating civil war.My book concludes with an account of my experiences in Cumbria in northern England during the horrific foot and mouth disease outbreak of 2001 and the woeful attempts to bring the outbreak under control. The Blair government, then facing an imminent general election, sidelined the Chief Veterinary Officer and instituted what one colleague described as a \"post code slaughter policy\" in which between six and ten million animals were slaughtered unnecessarily in the hope of bringing the outbreak under control before the election took place. It didn't.Scattered throughout the text are the names of a number of historical characters including the Emperor Hail\u00e9 Selassi\u00e9 of Ethiopia with whom I exchanged words when my dog chewed up his favourite Chihuahua. Roland's memoirs are widely available either in paperback (ISBN-10: 1909304727) or Kindle editions. Meeting the students1963 Graduates Roland Minor, 1963 Graduate 50th Anniversary Celebration! Michael Prettejohn, 1963 Graduate A lot of loose endsThe Vet School's Equine Hospital is involved in two kinds of training with the Fire and Rescue Service. Members of the local Fire Service recently visited to learn some basic animal handling techniques using the Hospital's teaching horses and cows; invaluable for the rescuers at an emergency prior to the vet's arrival. In addition, two of Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service's (CFRS) top qualified Animal Rescue Specialists spent a day with the sixth-year students to provide an insight into how the Fire Service rescues large animals. Watch Commanders Scott Feveyear and Farsh Raou fi were joined for the day by Jim Green, Animal Rescue Specialist from Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service, who runs the annual session at the Vet School. The students got hands on experience with CFRS's life-size articulated horse model by learning the basics about the specialist equipment and rescue methods. Scott Feveyear said: \"We thoroughly enjoy working in partnership with the University's Vet School, providing soon-to-be-qualified vets with an insight into large animal rescue and the role and capabilities of the Fire Service at these types of incidents. \"These training days enable vet students to have an understanding of incident command from the Fire Service's point of view and also develop an appreciation of our expectations from them as a vet.\" Department of Veterinary Medicine Fire and Rescue Service, large animal rescue training EditorialCalendar Dates for your diaries Publication Check at www.camvet.vet.cam.ac.uk for events for updates!
