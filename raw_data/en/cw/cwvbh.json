This plant contains menthol, which is thought to have a calming effect on the digestive system muscles. This might help relieve cramps, bloating, and gas ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7923432/)). Reducing Inflammation Mint water may also help to reduce inflammation throughout the body.
