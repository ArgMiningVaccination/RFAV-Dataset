It is important to talk to your doctor before trying any supplements or alternative therapies. Overview. Many patients ask about alternative treatments including supplements such as CBD oil, milk thistle, turmeric, as well as vitamins, and diets. In fact, [published data from AIHA members](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/34160734) suggests that a number of AIH patients have tried these approaches with variable success. Some patients have tried [alpha lipoic acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6446120/) (ALA) and low dose naltrexone. Importantly, no peer-reviewed scientific data supports their use in AIH. Some research suggests agents such as these could potentially [modify the immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6375629), yet no large, well-conducted clinical trials exist. Please be sure to talk to your health care provider before using supplements or alternative treatments as serious side effects from [ALA](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33821530) and [supplements](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5502701) can occur. One supplement that is important for patients with AIH is [Vitamin D](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs10620-018-5351-6&data=04%7C01%7Cclammert%40iu.edu%7C83a2aefbe10e409b454c08da0b790f6c%7C1113be34aed14d00ab4bcdd02510be91%7C0%7C0%7C637834911819814858%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=6h5KpZozYAYsK1xnIQNOw3iaGUjU%2BJaVt4EJpueQejw%3D&reserved=0). If you take an immunosuppressant like azathioprine, you have a slightly increased risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancer. But the Vitamin D the sun provides is important for long-term health, especially for patients with AIH. Learn more about safe ways to obtain Vitamin D in the video below. "}
