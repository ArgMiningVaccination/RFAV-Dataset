These children encounter problems related to oral health maintenance, thus further leading to dental problems. Even though Pediatric dentists treat visually impaired children for their oral problems, they emphasize mainly on the prevention of dental caries. Dental caries has a multifactorial etiology, and dentists are unable to find a complete solution for its prevention. However, reducing Streptococcus mutans has been seen to reduce the caries rate in the past. The use of the herbal product Emblica officinalis to reduce Streptococcus mutans levels has been documented. An affordable delivery system is required to use Emblica officinalis for its anticaries action. Thus, a unique delivery system of herbal sugar-free lollipops containing Emblica officinalis extract was made and can effectively deliver antimicrobial action in visually impaired children. Aim To evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of Emblica officinalis lollipop on Streptococcus mutans counts and pH levels in institutionalized visually impaired children. Method A total of 60 institutionalized visually impaired children (age: 4 to 14 years) were selected. The study consisted of two groups (experimental \"Emblica officinalis lollipop\" and control \"placebo lollipop\"), and the children were divided equally into both groups. Children from the study and control groups were subjected to the respective lollipops twice daily for seven days. Streptococcus mutans count and pH count were evaluated at baseline and after seven days post-intervention of the respective lollipop. Results The results showed that in both groups, Streptococcus mutans count was reduced post-intervention. However, the efficacy of the study group (Emblica officinalis lollipop) in inhibiting the Streptococcus mutans count was better than the control group (placebo lollipop). An increase in the pH level was seen post-intervention for both the study and control groups. And on the intergroup comparison, no statistical significance was found. Conclusion The use of Emblica officinalis lollipop is effective in inhibiting the Streptococcus mutans count when compared with the placebo lollipop. While marginal pH change was seen in both groups. Thus, the herbal modality most acceptable without any pharmaceutical concerns should be chosen. Emblica officinalis lollipops can be used in institutionalized visually impaired children to reduce the oral Streptococcus mutans count and maintain a healthy oral cavity.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2022-08-20", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
