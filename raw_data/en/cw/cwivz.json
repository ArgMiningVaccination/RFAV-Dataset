The words of the Commissioner for Health, Vytenis Andriukaitis, who said that 'it is a fact' that vaccines are effective, 'like saying that the Earth revolves around the sun and not the other way round', are to be commended. This strong stance against anti-vaccination movements and in favour of reason and science is lacking when it comes to homeopathy. Directive 2001/83/EC defines homeopathy as a product which cannot have a 'therapeutic indication' and has a sufficient degree of dilution to guarantee its 'safety'. By definition, homeopathy cannot have any effect on diseases, and therefore is anything but medicine, even though the directive describes homeopathic products as such. No homeopathic product has ever been scientifically proven to be of use for anything. Is the fact that the directive treats homeopathic products as if they were medicines not confusing \u2014 or even misleading \u2014 to the public? What steps will be taken to address the evident lack of consistency in dealing with issues such as vaccines "}
