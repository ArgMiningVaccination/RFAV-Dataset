As I paced with pre-presentation jitters at a Nolita boutique, where I had come to speak on relationships after parenthood (an unlikely specialty of mine following a book on the subject), my face blazed like a space heater. Just a few days earlier, a livid red rash had spread across my cheeks and chin. I'm firmly 53 and well past those years of skin unpredictability, so the inflammation took me by surprise. Now, broken capillaries had surfaced on my cheeks, too\u2014and no amount of Armani foundation could disguise them. I was going for \"coolly composed self-assurance,\" but my complexion betrayed me. \"It's rosacea,\" Joshua Zeichner, M.D., director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai, confirmed when I showed up at his Upper East Side office the next morning. Known in rosacea circles for working miracles, Zeichner gives me the bad news first. \"No one knows exactly why some patients develop it,\" he says of the chronic, inflammatory skin condition that is thought to be the result of an immune-system overreaction to a certain bacteria called Bacillus oleronius, or the outsized presence of skin microorganisms called Demodex mites. Often flaring up without warning, it afflicts 16 million people, strikes women three times as often as men, and is diagnosed most commonly between the ages of 30 and 50. A list of rosacea triggers reads like everything that's good in the world: spicy food, a hard workout, facials, sunshine, red wine (and now, according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, white wine, too). Stress, however, is the leading offender, which might explain why my face went up in flames just as I was about to address a roomful of people. I have erythematotelangiectatic rosacea (ETR), Zeichner tells me as he peers at my skin, which presents as redness, flushing, and visible capillaries. Much like papulopustular rosacea (PPR)\u2014which results in redness, swelling, and acne-like breakouts\u2014it cannot be cured. \"But the good news is we can keep it under control,\" Zeichner says, laying out a two-pronged attack plan with proven results. \"First we repair, then we treat.\" The repair part comes easy. When I get back to my apartment, I clear out my medicine cabinet of culprits that could be responsible for impairing my skin barrier\u2014scrubs, glycolic acids, anything heavily fragranced\u2014and replace them with products \"designated for redness and sensitivity,\" at Zeichner's suggestion. Dr. Barbara Sturm's Calming Serum with purslane, her signature anti-inflammatory ingredient, is a quick favorite, and Dr. Jart's Cicapair line, which contains chlorophyll-rich Tiger Grass, an anti-redness hero ingredient, immediately soothes my skin. Treatment is more involved\u2014and is usually ongoing, warns Hilary Baldwin, M.D., clinical associate professor of dermatology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center. \"Typically, you'll use a combination of at least two drugs, oral or topical, and modalities such as light therapy or lasers for visible capillaries,\" she says. And as rosacea is progressive, she notes, \"the earlier you can get treatment, the better.\" Baldwin is \"pretty darn happy\" with ivermectin, the Demodex mite-killing drug once available only in oral form and now recently approved as a topical gel. She has also had good results with Oracea, she tells me\u2014a low-dose antibiotic that doesn't kill bacteria but reduces inflammation from the inside out. Zeichner prefers Rhofade, an FDA-approved cream with the same active ingredient as Visine that dramatically reduces redness by constricting blood vessels, while doctors such as Ellen Marmur, M.D., a leading New York City dermatologist, are increasingly prescribing beta-blockers\u2014those epinephrine- and adrenaline- controlling friends to anxious public speakers. \"A low dose prevents flushing,\" she reveals of the effective way to subdue rosacea's redness by lowering blood pressure. \"And it's great for brides before their walk down the aisle!\" \"What you eat can also play a big role in managing your symptoms,\" adds Rajani Katta, M.D., a Houston-based dermatologist who has studied the effects of diet on rosacea and suggests I try an eight-week elimination diet to home in on ingredients with capsaicin, a chemical that affects the receptors in skin that feel warmth (goodbye, peppers), and those containing cinnamaldehyde, a vasodilator (farewell, chocolate, citrus, cinnamon, and tomatoes). A month into my own Rhofade prescription\u2014and with a few zaps of Zeichner's Vbeam Perfecta laser\u2014my visible blood vessels have vanished, and while my skin is still slightly rosy, it's notably not ruddy. I'm also becoming aware of my triggers (peppers are now verboten in my kitchen). If I do have a flare-up, I reach for La Roche-Posay's Rosaliac CC Cream with ambophenol, a calming African plant extract, and try to embrace the fact that my flush can be mistaken for a recent workout\u2014not necessarily a bad development. \"I see we both went for a run this morning,\" a friend tells me when I join her for brunch. I have done no such thing. But I pick up the menu and announce that I'll be having the crepes anyway. "}
