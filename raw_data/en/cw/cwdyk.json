The small puncture causes the skin to respond with collagen production and the growth of new skin cells. This stimulates and invigorates the acupuncture channels on the face triggering the skin to regenerate cells, decrease inflammation, increase circulation and vent heat. Microneedling Microneedling utilizes an electronic device with a multi needle tip and is used with nutritive and herbal serums, whereas cosmetic acupuncture uses acupuncture needles. There are two types of microneedling: medical and cosmetic. Medical microneedling is done by a licensed practitioner, whereas cosmetic microneedling can be done at home. Medical microneedling increases keratinocytes and stem cells which produce collagen and elastin in the face. It is able to get into the deeper layers of dermis making it possible to treat acne and other scars by breaking up scar tissue and inducing skin remodeling. It is also better for treating wrinkles, age spots, scars, skin tone, acne and other blemishes. Cosmetic Acupuncture Cosmetic acupuncture focuses more on lifting, firming and tightening skin, as well as reducing inflammation and increasing collagen production. Both methods are based on Chinese Medicine principles of moving Qi and blood and stimulating facial meridians. When combined, these treatments are very complementary and give a natural face lift as well as brighter, healthier skin. As an acupuncturist, I use nutritive and herbal serums with my microneedling treatments. Because I am able to get into the deeper layers of the skin, absorption is increased by up to 3,000%. I also add body acupuncture points during the microneedling session in order to address full body circulation and stress reduction. Some of the Chinese herbal serums I use include Gotu Kola (Ji Xue Cao), Shiitake Mushroom (Xiang Gu) as well as herbal, seaweed and algae extracts. These are diluted with vegan stem cells derived from apples and hyaluronic acid. Your skin continues to improve Lasting results are seen after 3-4 sessions of microneedling or 6-10 treatments of cosmetic acupuncture. Both invigorate your natural healing processes to naturally reduce signs of aging. Whereas botox and other fillers have a negative effect on the body's natural ability to regenerate, and require repetitive treatments in order to maintain results. When botox wears off, your facial muscles have lost tone and often results in looser skin with deeper wrinkles. At Home Care If you do get botox and fillers, you need to wait one month before and afterwards to get a microneedling or cosmetic acupuncture treatment. This is because these treatments are so invigorating to the cells and tissue that they can actually reverse the effects of botox. In between treatments and at home, facial gua sha and self massage can help to maintain muscle tone and tighten skin. It also increases circulation which reduces inflammation, dark circles around eyes and puffiness. By addressing the health of the whole body, we can slow the aging process. Chinese medicine focuses on the root cause and whole body wellness. We can address these aspects with herbal medicine, clean food and drinking water, reducing exposure to chemicals and other healthy lifestyle choices. In order to get the most out of your treatment, it is important to recognize the body as a whole. Nutritional therapies and stress reduction, along with other lifestyle choices can lengthen treatment results as well as combat new signs of aging. "}
