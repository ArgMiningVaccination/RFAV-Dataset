Your Covid-19 questions answered French people who are living abroad, travelling or returning from abroad, as well as visitors from abroad, will find answers below to frequently asked questions on COVID-19 measures. This FAQ supplements the information on the [Conseils aux voyageurs](fr/conseils-aux-voyageurs/) (Travel advice, in French only) section. \u2014 Last updated on 26 August 2022 \u2014 [What are the rules relating to the vaccine pass?] Since 14 March 2022, the \"vaccine pass\" has been lifted in France in all areas where it was previously required (cultural and leisure venues, commercial catering, professional trade shows, etc.). Similarly, the COVID certificate is no longer required as of 1 August 2022. [What are the current rules applied at national borders?] Since the outset of the crisis, the health check system at borders has protected our healthcare system and delayed the arrival into France of worrying variants. This system was removed on 1 August 2022. Therefore, the rules previously in place for travellers to France no longer apply: - Travellers no longer have any formalities to complete before arriving into mainland or overseas France, and the COVID certificate can no longer be required, irrespective of the country or area of origin; - Proof of a compelling reason for travel can no longer be required; - Travellers no longer need to present a sworn declaration that they are not infected with COVID-19 and pledge to take an antigen test or biological exam upon arrival in France. This also applies to travel between mainland France and each of the overseas territories. However, in the event of a dangerous variant, a system requiring a negative virological test upon entering France may be reinstated for travellers arriving from countries believed to be at risk. The government will thus maintain the option to use \"emergency brake\" measures for a maximum period of two months, following a recommendation from the Haute autorit\u00e9 de sant\u00e9 (French National Authority for Health) in the event of the emergence and circulation of a new COVID-19 variant which can be a serious health risk, or in overseas territories, if the health system is at risk of saturation. Furthermore, for foreign travel, a vaccination certificate, a negative test certificate or proof of recovery in EU format may be required by the destination country. It is also recommended to store all relevant documents on the TousAntiCovid application or print them out. For the health rules in force for entering other countries, travellers should visit the \" [Conseils aux voyageurs](fr/conseils-aux-voyageurs/)\" section on the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs website (in French only). [What are the rules concerning mask-wearing in France?] - Mask-wearing is no longer mandatory in establishments open to the public, nor on board maritime, river, land and air transport; - Mask-wearing continues to be recommended in enclosed and small spaces, and at large gatherings for vulnerable persons due to their age; - It is also highly recommended in hospitals and retirement homes.
