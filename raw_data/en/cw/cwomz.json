In the other words, diabetes patients with earlier meal timing had a stable glycemic control compared with those with late meal timing. This is a new concept to switch the meal timing earlier than later in diabetes self -monitoring management. However, t here is insufficient evidence from Southeast Asia to determine the optimal -meal -timing and its association with glycemic measures in prediabetes individuals. Hence, this study carried out to understand the correlation of meal timing between glycemic control and to determine the associations of chrononutrition with lifestyle habits and anthropometric measurements among prediabetes individuals. Optimal -meal -timin g for blood sugar control could tailor education and intervention in diabetes management , especially incorporate in medical nutrition guideline in diabetes management . 1. INTRODUCTION AND JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY Diabetes Mellitus is the chronic non -communication diseases which elevated blood glucose level and human body unable to utilize it effectively, hence cause rise of complications to microvascular and macrovascular damage (IPH, NIH and MOH, 2019) . There are about 463 million of patients aged 20 until 79 years old diagnosed diabetes in worldwide (IDF, 2019) . It showed an increasing trend adults living with diabetes from 108 million in year 1980 until 422 million in year 2014 (IDF, 2019) . International Diabetes Federation, (2019) estimated diabetes will affected in 578 million of adul ts globally in year 2030 and it reach up to 700 million of worldwide adults in year 2045. 373.90 million western pacific people had i mpair blood glucose commonly among adults aged 20 years old until 79 years old and it is the highest in global (IDF, 2019) . 8% of western pacific adults had impaired glucose tolerance and 55.8% of them are undiagnosed diabetes (IDF, 2019) . Malaysia is one of the countries in Western Pacific region and have Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia which separated by South China Sea (Hus sein et al. , 2015) . In the latest Malaysia National Health and Morbidity Survey, the total diabetes incidence among adults ages 18 years old and above in Malaysia is about 3.9 million (18.3%), which indicated that 1 in 5 Malaysian adults have diabetes (IPH, NIH and MOH, 2019) . The highest prevalence of diabetes found in state Negeri Sembilan (33.2%), followed by Perlis NIH and MOH, 2019) . The rise of diabetes, hypertension and cholesterol increase the risk to develop cardiovascular disease and it leading to death (IPH, NIH and MOH, 2019) . There are 1.7 million Malaysian adults stay with these three major risk factors of cardiovascular disease (IPH, NIH and MOH, 2019) . Besides, 1 in 4 adults in Malaysia are physically not active and 95% of adults did not consume recommended both fruits and vegetables (IPH, NIH and MOH, 2019) . Sugar are the preferable substitute in self - Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page4 of 58 prepared drinks (coffee, tea, chocolate and malt beverages), and 4.2% adults in Malaysia drink carbonated drinks and non -carbonated drinks daily. Instant drink products contained sugar also another choice of adults Malays ian daily (IPH, NIH and MOH, 2019) . The development of diabetes related module by Ministry of Health and Malaysia Diabetes Educators Society emphasize 7 section diabetes management (MDES, 2020) , included assessment, healthy eating, physical activity, medication, self-monitoring , disease complications and behavior. Despite the numerous strategies have been implemented by Malaysian government, however, it has failed to substantially reduce the pr evalent of T2DM from prediabetes in Malaysia. Perhaps, there is a missing ingredient in diabetes guidelines today. Management of excessive caloric intake and promote on exercise are both core lifestyle modification for T2DM which have been recommended in several diabetes management guidelines (MDES, 2020; MOH et al. , 2020; WHO, 2020) . However, other factors such as dysregulation of circadian rhythms may also contribute to disease development (Onaolapo and Onaolapo, 2018) . The growth of chronobiology and evidence on disturbed circadian rhythm contributed to dysfunction of carbohydrate and macronutrients metabolism and it related to hormone melatonin (Onaolapo and Onaolapo, 2018) . From a chronobiological point, glucose metabolism in humans follow a circadian rhythm through diurnal variation of glucose tolerance that typically peaks during day -light hours, when food consumption usually happens and reduces when it comes to night -dark hours when fasting usually occurs (Henry, Kaur and Quek, 2020) . Unusual meal timings can cause glucose intolerance by affecting the phase relationship between the central circadian pacemaker and peripheral oscillators in cells of the liver and pancreas in rodents (Bandin et al. 2015 ). Similarly in humans, timed meal intake is also driven by the suprachiasmatic nucleus, play a role in synchronization of circadian rhythms in peripheral tissues, thereby affecting glucose metabolism (Henry, Kaur and Quek, 2020) . The effects of diet on circadian rhythmicity clearly involves a relationship between factors such as meal timings and nutrients (chrononutritio n), that can contribute to circadian perturbance and influence the manifestation of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes; by extension, circadian timing may also be important in prevention of T2DM development from prediabetes. A new concept is born: perhaps it is not what you eat but when you choose to eat it. In Malaysia, there are no specific guideline for prediabetes individual and they are managed according to the latest Clinical Practice Guideline in Malaysia (MOH et al. , 2020) . For prevention prediabetes to further develop to diabetes , lifestyle intervention such as weight loss (5 -10% of init ial body weight), regular physical activity (150 min/week), with dietary strategies including reduced calories and behavior modification are recommended in Clinical Practice Guideline in Malaysia (MOH et al. , 2020) . A high fibre diet (20 -30g/day with 5 to 7 servings/day) consisting of vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains is encouraged too (MDES, 2020) . All the prediabetic individuals will be referred to dietitian and nurse educators for 6 months routine treatment, prior to T2DM diagnosis, determined by second -round of oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in 6 -month period (MOH et al. , 2020) . To the puzzlement of many diabetes researchers and clinicians, some of the prediabetes cases showed Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page5 of 58 tremendous improvement in their blood sugar result, ye t some of the prediabetes individuals developed full -blown of T2DM with their blood sugar result higher than the normal range; despite all of them followed the same routine treatment from healthcare clinics. Perhaps, besides the usual routine treatment fro m Clinical Practice Guideline (MOH et al. , 2020) (weight management, physical activity advices and dietary modification); prediabetic individuals who able to improve their blood sugar result in 6 - month period has particular meal -timing, compared to those has uncontrolled blood sugar result in 6 -month per iod. Although clinical practice guideline applied in the routine treatment does not include meal -timing advices , but the importance of circadian rhythms in regulating mammalian physiological responses has been recognized (Mezitis and Bhatnagar, 2018) . Mezitis and Bhatnagar, (2018) from United States of America (US) has emphasized the importance of circadian timing in people with diabetes because insulin sensitivity has been shown to exhibit circadian rhythmicity. Glycemic responses to meals are exaggerated in prediabetes and diabete s patients, more so when the meal is timed to be consumed out of sync with the metabolic pacemaker. Accordingly, Mezitis and Bhatnagar, (2018) have recognized optimal hormonal and hepatic function beginning in the ea rly morning (4:00 a.m.) and fading in the early evening (4:00 p.m.). However, the times proposed by Mezitis and Bhatnagar, (2018) suitable for diabetes patients in US, and might not be able to apply in Malaysia diabe tes management . This is because circadian timing system is affected by factors consisting of cosmic events related to the universe and earth, environmental factors (light, night and day duration, seasons) and lifestyles. To the best of our understanding , neither have there been any studies that have exploring the new concept of circadian timing in Malaysia prediabetes individuals, nor in Southeast Asia. The outcome of the present study will be able to recognize the optimal -meal -timing (chrono -nutrition) and activity/ sleeping (chrono - among Malaysian prediabetic individuals, in order to prevent prediabetes individuals from developing T2DM. Figure 1 shows the theoretical framework of the present study, adapted from Henry, Kaur and Quek, (2020) . The theoretical framework shows that a schematic represen tation outlining the factors affecting the circadian clock system. Meal timing and dietary components (chrono -nutrition) play an important role in regulating circadian clocks, to enhance metabolic health and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. These recomm endations could be considered as strategies to improve glycemic control, rather than focusing on the nutritional value of a meal alone, to optimize dietary patterns of diabetics. It is necessary to further elucidate this fascinating area of research to und erstand the circadian system and its implications on nutrition that may ultimately reduce the burden of type 2 diabetes. Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page6 of 58 Figure 1 Theoretical framework showed factors affecting circadian rhythm . We propose that the individual is nested within their environment which includes the influences of social demands e.g. social timing resulting from demands such as school or work schedules, social activities, family obligations and routines, parenting prac tices, community involvement, time zone, etc., the modern lighting and climate controlled environment, as well as the effect of the earth's natural environment. Within the individual, there is an interdependence of the circadian clocks, behavior, and healt h. The major contribution of this model is that the circannual clock interacts with the circadian clocks to promote optimal glucose tolerance of individual's circannual influences may have health consequences. We propose interactions within the individual and across levels of this model. For example, social demands influence an individual's behavior which affects alignment of the clocks either by direct entrainment of the peripheral clocks (i.e., meal timing and consistency) or by affecting exposure to the light-dark cycle via sleep timing and consistency, physical activity, and exposure to artificial light at night. It is also proposed that circadian disruption caused by the environmental factors may contribute to disruption of circannual rhythms of growth, resulting in accelerated blood sugar and contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page7 of 58 Figure 2 Conceptual framework Identifying novel, potentially modifiable, life -style factors associated with increased blood sugar level, can lead to innovative strategies for improving health status and preventing T2DM in prediabetes individuals. The proposed study presents a novel approach as a paradigm shift in Malaysia diabetes management. We anticipate that this study will not only reveal the optimal -meal timing (chrono -nutrition) for prediabetic individuals, it will also disclose the associations of chrono -nutrition with glycemic measures and anthropometric measurements in prediabetic individuals. The findings may act as guidance to government bodies to develop policies at national level. For non-governmental agencies, the outcome may be applied to plan public campaigns to improve b lood sugar outcome in prediabetic and diabetic individuals. Besides, optimal - meal timing and factors associated with chrono -nutrition would be identified and management of these factors can be delivered to diabetic individuals. For example, improvement of the dietary pattern and timing coupled with physical activity to ensure good blood sugar control. Understanding the optimal -meal -timing for blood sugar control could tailor education and intervention in diabetes management. This research has potential to b e converted into a larger cohort study and intervention whereby prediabetic individuals could be follow -up for longer duration to study health outcomes and blood sugar control to manage the diabetes 2. LITERATURE REVIEWS 1.0 Diabetes mellitus Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page8 of 58 The path ophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is complex and involves insulin resistance, pancreatic -cell dysfunction and visceral adiposity. T2DM is now a disease of major concern both globally and regionally; and is a leading cause of death in most co untries (WHO 2017). In 2017, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated that 382 million people had diabetes worldwide, and by 2035, this was predicted to rise to 592 million. Almost all developing countries in the Western Pacific region and als o in Southeast Asia have shown escalating diabetes rates. Eighty percent live in low - and middle income countries, and of the total, more than 60% live in Asia, with almost one -third in China (IDF 2017). An estimated 82 million adults aged 20-79 years were living with diabetes in the Southeast Asia region in 2017, representing a regional prevalence of 8.5% . About 45.8% of these diabetes case were undiagnosed (IDF 2017). In Malaysia, prevalence of diabetes has drastically increased from 6.3% (IPH 1986) to 1 8.3% (IPH 2019). Major increase in the prevalence of diabetes have occurred in developing countries due to rapid and ongoing socioeconomic transition and will likely lead to further rises (Nanditha et al. 2016). 1.1 Prediabetes Prediabetes is defined a s a condition in which people have higher than normal blood glucose levels but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. Prediabetes prevalence is higher than that of diabetes in China and many of the Western Pacific region countries, this is true of ma ny countries in Asia (IDF 2017). South Asian population also have a high prevalence of prediabetes and a more rapid progression to diabetes (IDF 2017). In Malaysia, National Health and Morbidity Survey (IPH 2019) found the prevalence of prediabetes was 8.9 %. These prevalence were likely to be underestimates because diagnosis relied only on a single fasting blood sugar, history of physician diagnosis and information on medication (Nanditha et al. 2016). Globally, an estimated 318 million people had prediabet es in 2015, with a projected alarming increase to 482 million in 2040 (IDF 2015). Prediabetes is high -risk condition for diabetes and cardiovascular disease (Nanditha et al. 2016). Without appropriate interventions, 5.8% -18.3% of people with prediabetes de velop diabetes yearly (Anothaisintawee et al. 2017). How to prevent the development of diabetes from prediabetes? 2.0 Preventing diabetes development from prediabetes Identifying additional modifiable risk factors may lead to a research to develop nove l lifestyle interventions to reduce incident diabetes from prediabetes. While there are many factors that influence the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), it is evident that the most influential are the behaviors commonly associated with urbanization a nd a modern lifestyle (Early & Stanley 2018). Randomized controlled trials from different parts of the world including United States, China, India and elsewhere have established the proof of principle that lifestyle modification with physical activity and/ or healthy diet can delay or prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes (Anothaisintawee et al. 2017; Early & Stanley 2018). Dietary recommendations of World Health Organization (WHO) for the prevention of T2DM include limiting saturated fatty acid Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page9 of 58 intake to le ss than 10% of total energy intake (and for high risk groups, less than 7%); and achieving adequate intake of dietary fiber (minimum daily intake of 20 grams) through consumption of wholegrain cereals, legumes, fruits and vegetables (WHO 2017). WHO strongl y recommends reducing the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake (WHO 2017), IDF fully supports these recommendations and in response published the IDF framework for Action of on Sugar (IDF 2017) Modern lifestyle are characterized by physical inactivity and long sedentary periods. Community -based interventions can reach individuals and families through campaigns, education, social marketing and encourage physical activity both inside and outside workplace (Early & Stanley 2018). IDF r ecommends physical activity at least between three to five days a week for a minimum of 30 -45 minutes (IDF 2017). WHO has also developed recommendations on physical activity among different age groups, similar to IDF (WHO 2017), to prevent T2DM. Taking a l ife course perspective is essential for preventing type 2 diabetes and its complications. Early in life, when eating and physical activity habits are established and when the long -term regulation of energy balance may be programmed, there is an especially critical window to obtained a normal weight and mitigate the risk of T2DM (Zarrinpar et al. 2016). Despite recommendations from WHO and IDF have been adopted in Clinical Practice Guideline of T2DM in Malaysia (MOH 2015); to the befuddlement of many diabete s researchers and clinicians, it has failed to substantially reduce the prevalent of T2DM from prediabetes in Malaysia. Perhaps, there is a missing ingredient in diabetes guidelines today. Numerous studies suggested that the main risk factors for T2DM are excessive caloric intake and a lack of exercise; however, other factors such as disturbed sleep/wake rhythms may also contribute to disease development (Onaolapo & Onaolapo 2018). In recent years, several lines of evidence have increasingly demonstrated th e role of the biological circadian clock and multiple clock genes in contributing to T2DM pathogenesis. There is a growing body of knowledge associating alterations in circadian rhythms and circadian genes with the development of T2DM (Onaolapo & Onaolapo 2018). While the implication of this advance in knowledge for the prevention and therapeutic management of diabetes mellitus is evolving, there are strong indications that circadian misalignment is relevant for the regulation of blood sugar level in chroni c shift workers (Morris et al. 2017) and insulin resistance (Hashinaga et al. 2013) in rodents' model; by extension, may also be important in prevention of T2DM development from prediabetes. Human and animal studies from Western countries suggested that de synchronize between components of the circadian timing symptom and the behavioral rhythms of feeding/ fasting and activity/ sleep, or the external rhythm of light/ darkness may contribute to the pathophysiology of obesity and T2DM (Onaolapo & Onaolapo 2018 ). However, such relevant advices/ information are not included in pathophysiology of obesity and T2DM (Onaolapo & Onaolapo 2018). However, such relevant advices/ information are not included in any diabetes guidelines, particularly in Malaysia. Therefore, the need to drastically reduce the global prevalence of T2DM necessitates a widening of the search for etiological factors. 3.0 Circadian timing system Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page10 of 58 To everything there is a rhythms. In most organisms, each day is organized into two phases: (1) activity and feeding and, (2) rest and fasting. The circadian system, controlled by the master circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, plays a major role in regulating daily rhythms of sleep/ wake and various metabo lic outputs, such as peripheral tissue metabolism, feeding behavior and hormone secretions, generate a rhythm of approximately 24 -h (hence 'circadian') (Johnson et al. 2017). As a discipline, the study of these rhythms has grown in leaps in bounds during t he past quarter century. The pursuit of understanding in chronobiology has taken us from the flowering plant and the fruit fly to the mammalian nervous system and back. Within this endeavor, study of the intersection between the circadian timing system and metabolism has experienced an almost herculean pace of advancement (Perelis et al. 2016). Although interest in the topic of clock function and metabolism has percolated across the years, curiosity seems to have boomed in the early 21st century thanks to t he cloning of the mammalian clock genes, the availability of various rodent genetic models, and the advances made by a number of excellent clinical sleep research labs (King et al. 1997). In 2005, a group of researchers published a brief but highly impactf ul paper, wherein they revealed that mice with a dominant negative mutation of the Clock locus became obese on a standard diet (Turek et al. 2005). Turek et al. (2005) suggested a new paradigm, one in which disrupting or altering the clock at the biochemic al level could itself produce metabolic dysfunction. In the years that followed, it was determined that obesity in the Clock mutant mouse was likely due, in part, to a disturbance in the balance of food intake across the 24 -hour day (Arble et al. 2010). Th at is, food intake out of phase with the bodies internal clock (eg, late night snacking) leads to considerable weight gain in otherwise healthy animals (Astiz et al. 2019). A new concept was born: perhaps it is not what you eat as much as when you choose t o eat it. Although the importance of circadian rhythms in regulating mammalian physiological responses has been recognized for a long time, its impact on nutrition and metabolism is relatively new and is an area of evolving interest (Mezitis & Bhatnagar 20 18). 3.1 Chrono -nutrition and blood glucose homeostasis It has been recognized for nearly five decades that, in rodents' model, there was a diurnal rhythm in glucose tolerance. Oral glucose, intravenous glucose infusions, and identical meals all result s in a significantly higher elevation of plasma glucose (i.e., lower glucose tolerance) in the evening than in the morning. Because they are nocturnal (i.e., active at night), they have lower glucose tolerance during the daytime (resting phase) than nightt ime (active phase) (la Fleur 2001). There are multiple factors that could contribute to the reduced glucose tolerance, including decreased insulin sensitivity, excessive hepatic glucose production (HGP), and decreased betacell function. Study has shown tha t in healthy humans, both insulin sensitivity and beta-cell responsivity to glucose are lower at dinner than at breakfast (Astiz et al. 2019). The role of HGP in the diurnal regulation of glucose homeostasis in normoglycemic humans is still not clear. Whil e some studies showed a sleep -associated fall in HGP (Shigiyama et al. 2018) and an increased HGP at dawn (Wu et al. 2017), other studies found no diurnal rhythm in 24 -hr fasting HGP (Jamshed et al. 2019) or a lower pre - Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page11 of 58 meal HGP at breakfast comparing to l unch and dinner (Ferrer -Cascales et al. 2018). Different meal schedule on the test day in these studies may contribute to the different observation. However, convincing evidence has demonstrated a clear diurnal rhythm of HGP in patients with T2DM that cont ributes to the dawn phenomenon (hyperglycemia in the morning) often observed in the diabetic patients (Wu et al. 2017). The elevated morning HGP before breakfast could be due to a prolonged overnight fast and the resultant surge of counter regulatory hormo nes (e.g., cortisol, growth hormones and norepinephrine) and/or due to a circadian modulation of HGP as suggested by rodent studies (la Fleur 2001). It is well recognized that food intake, appetite, digestion and metabolism each exhibit circadian patterns (Almoosawi et al. 2016). Nutrients ingested during the active period provide substrates such as glucose, lipids and amino acids, which fuel the metabolic pathways in our cells, whereas during the resting period energy and substrates stored in our body are mobilized to sustain metabolic homeostasis (Bhadra et al. 2017). Food intake itself serves as a regulator of the circadian clock, particularly the peripheral circadian clock in tissues such as the liver and the intestine (Astiz et al. 2019). Conversely, th e central circadian clock, entrained by the darklight cycle, is known to extend its effect on food absorption. More specifically, small peptides cleaved in the intestine from dietary carbohydrate have been shown to be transported in a circadian driven proc ess (Almoosawi et al. 2016). Blood glucose homeostasis can be seen as a paradigm of the circadian control of energy metabolism. Indeed, whereas during the activity/feeding period blood glucose is mainly of dietary origin, during the resting/starvation peri od glucose is progressively recruited from endogenous glucose production in the liver to maintain blood glucose levels within a relatively narrow range. In this process liver glycogen content undergoes large daily fluctuations to sustain blood glucose leve ls, as glycogen synthesis and degradation are specifically recruited during the activity/feeding and resting/starvation periods, respectively (Karthikeyan et al. 2018). In modern societies, individuals often consume food at different time points during the day, away from home and therefore at what may be considered, from an evolutionary perspective, physiologically inappropriate times of the day (Almoosawi et al. 2016). This irregularity in eating patterns is often enforced by external pressures to conform to social schedules. Increasingly, individuals often engage in activities that are misaligned with their circadian clock system and the natural rhythm of the light -dark cycle. The resulting misalignment between the sleep -awake, fasting -feeding cycles and t he light - dark cycle subsequently disrupts the natural oscillations of physiologic processes such as lipid metabolism and blood pressure, eventually manifesting itself as heightened risk of developing T2DM (St -Onge et al. 2017). Therefore, besides time -of-the-day dietary intake; prediabetes individuals may also look at the time -ofthe -day activities e.g. sleep or awake to prevent T2DM development. 3.1.1 Meal intakes timing of ingestion: morning versus dinner Evidence suggests that meal ingestion in the mo rning and late evening (time of day) influence glucose metabolism in humans. Earlier studies, using mixed meals or glucose infusion, have reported circadian responses of reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in healthy participants for the even ing rather than in the morning Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page12 of 58 (Almoosawi et al. 2016). An acute study which examined the effects of a late evening meal on diurnal variation of blood glucose in healthy individuals, assessed by continuous glucose monitoring (CGMS). There was an increase in blood glucose after the late evening meal which shifted towards later at night, with peaking of blood glucose observed during sleep (Astiz et al. 2019). Late evening meals may cause postprandial hyperglycaemia with this decrease in glucose tolerance fro m morning towards the night. A cohort study was the first to show the relationship between late - night dinner consumption and glycaemic control in type 2 diabetics, whereby having a late dinner meal after 8 pm was independently associated with an increase i n HbA1c (Sakai et al. 2018). In some acute trials, both healthy individuals (Kajiyama et al. 2018) and type 2 diabetics (Imai et al. 2017) showed significantly higher blood glucose and insulin values after night -time meals. These studies deduce that the di sruption of the circadian rhythm led to the exacerbation of the physiological nocturnal decrease of glucose tolerance. Peter et al. showed that type 2 diabetic subjects who ate three identical meals had glucose excursions that were higher in the morning th an in the evening (Sakai et al. 2018). There was increased glucose tolerance in response to the first and third meals of the day, irrespective of glycaemic control. There was also a change in circadian variation in insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetics ( Sakai et al. 2018). Type 2 diabetics exhibit a different daily circadian pattern from healthy individuals, with increased insulin sensitivity towards the night, and higher glucose excursions in the morning than in the evening. Methods to improve glycaemic control at dinner has been reported by some authors. Dinner that was divided into two smaller meals reduced post-meal glycaemic excursions, due to the \"second -meal effect\" phenomenon, by enhancing -cell responsiveness (Karthikeyan et al. 2018) at the seco nd dinner meal induced by the first meal (Imai et al. 2017). It was also suggested that if meal size and carbohydrate quantities were smaller, postprandial glucose can be ameliorated in both healthy and type 2 diabetics. In summary, time of day is indicati ve of having an influence on the postprandial glucose response to a meal. There is a defined circadian pattern for postprandial glycaemia for similar meals consumed either in the evening or morning. Glucose metabolism is not only affected by what and how m uch you eat alone, but also when the meal is consumed. However, more data from well -designed epidemiological studies is necessary to prove causality. Mezitis & Bhatnagar (2018) emphasize the importance of chrononutrition in people with diabetes because eve n insulin sensitivity has been shown to exhibit circadian rhythmicity. Glycemic responses to meals are exaggerated in these individuals, more so when the meal is timed to be consumed out of sync with the metabolic pacemaker (Almoosawi et al. 2016). Accordi ngly, Mezitis & Bhatnagar (2018) recognize optimal hormonal and hepatic function beginning in the early morning (4:00 a.m.) and fading in the early evening (4:00 p.m.). Review of glucose records \u2014increasingly more abundant in the era of continuous glucose m onitoring (CGM), which permits review of several months of detailed glucose profiling and follow -up care \u2014confirms that evening lifestyle defines morning glycaemia, thus setting the stage for the day's profile. Late -night feeding and night -shift work introd uce a \"jet -lag\" experience, which, when sustained, virtually guarantees metabolic dysregulation. 3.2 Chrono -type and blood glucose homeostasis Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page13 of 58 Individual differences in the time at which people refer to do particular behaviors, most notably sleep, are referred to as chrono -type (Anothaisintawee et al. 2017). It is a behavioral manifestation of an individual's internal circadian clock system, whic h can be assessed with the use of multiple methodologies that classify individuals as having, e.g., a morning or an evening type (Gottlieb et al. 2015). Chrono -type is also used to describe personality traits associated with the preferred times -of-the-day for activities such as sleep or awake (Anothaisintawee et al. 2017). Generally, in the absence of environmental stimuli such as light, endogenous circadian clocks oscillate in a manner approximating a 24 cycle (Astiz et al. 2019). An individual's chro no-type is likely created by an interaction between the endogenous circadian pacemaker and its responses to light (Astiz et al. 2019) and can be modulated by factors such as age (Fischer et al. 2017) and life circumstance (e.g., needing to get to work earl y over years may shift preference towards earlier hours). In our modern society, night -shift work, which requires workers to eat and be active during their circadian night and sleep during their circadian day, represents and extreme form of circadian misal ignment. A recent meta -analysis of 10 cohort studies (262294 participants) revealed that shift work was associated with a 40% increase in the risk of developing T2DM (Anothaisintawee et al. 2015). Recently, epidemiological and experimental studies have dem onstrated that sleep quality and quantity are important determinants of whole -body metabolism. It has been suggested that impaired sleep might causally contribute to the T2DM (Sakamoto et al. 2018). Despite the clear association between short sleep and met abolic impairments, the underlying endocrine and molecular mechanisms remain only partially elucidated. Among the suggested mechanisms, the causal role of the hypothalamus -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic activation are supported by the largest body of literature. Circulating cortisol, assessed either by 24 h profiles or by single measurements of evening cortisol levels, were elevated together with markers of sympathetic activation and circulating catecholamine after total or partial sleep depri vation as well as in short sleepers (Reynolds et al. 2012). In contrast, some studies reported impairments in glucose homeostasis in sleep restricted individuals along with unchanged cortisol and catecholamine levels (Buxtone et al. 2012). The complexity o f associated endocrine mechanisms can be further demonstrated by observations of elevated levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines, lower circulating testosterone, decreased thyroid stimulating hormone levels and changes in adipokines secreted from adipose tis sue in sleep deprivation (Froy & Garaulet 2018). Evening types (or late chrono -types) typically have later bedtime than those who are morning types (or early chrono -types). Those with later chrono -type usually experience a mild form of circadian misalignme nt due to a greater degree of misalignment between social rhythms and the circadian clock, a phenomenon called \"social jetlag\" (Fischer et al. 2017). In an individual presenting with an extreme evening chrono -type, the circadian phase of biological rhythms could be shifted by as much as much as 2 -3 hours compared with that of an extreme morning chrono -type (Kantermann et al. 2015). This shift can result in a desynchronization between the period of biological night, as regulated by the intrinsic circadian cl ock system, and the environmental night governed by the light -dark cycle (Kantermann et al. 2015). Patients with T2DM, later chrono -types and evening preferences have been Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page14 of 58 found to be associated with poorer glycemic control (Brady et al. 2019). A recent st udy revealed that evening type was associated with an increased risk of having type 2 diabetes in prediabetes individuals (Anothaisintawee et al. 2017). These data may demonstrate the contribution of circadian regulation on reversing prediabetes from devel oping T2DM in the future. 4.0 In summary As shown above, evidence that provides new insight into clock function and the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes is accumulating rapidly. Disruption of circadian rhythms, such as that due to shift work, affects not only body weight and adiposity, but glucose metabolism itself. Since the magnitude of these effects in the present increase seen in the development of type 2 diabetes is obscure, more precise mechanisms and the relative importance of these factors in the development of type 2 diabetes should be investigated. To achieve this goal, it will be necessary to establish methodologies to measure parameters of circadian systems in feeding and glucose and lipid metabolism. In addition, it is also necessary to an alyse the contribution of circadian gene variations in the development of type 2 diabetes. Clinical studies related to the development of type 2 diabetes are also needed to evaluate the health -compromising behaviours that affect circadian disruption with d efinitions that include chrono -type or circadian typology. According to the currently available data, medical nutrition therapy for Malaysian diabetes should include meal timing as one of the strategy, to manage glycaemic control. Study should be conducted to determine the optimal -meal -timing to manage blood sugar level. Although it is very difficult to control meal timing for every individual patient with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, a socioeconomical approach such as recommendations regarding the work environment may also be important. Although there is now insufficient evidence to evaluate the impact of these chrono - physiological disruptions on the progression or pathophysiology of diabetes precisely, future focused research on these issues can answer these questions. Identifying novel, potentially modifiable, meal -timing, chrononutrition, life -style factors associated with glycemic measures; can lead to innovative strategies for improving health status and preventing T2DM in prediabetic individuals. T he proposed study presents a novel approach as a paradigm shift in Malaysia diabetes management. We anticipate that this study will not only reveal the optimal meal -feeding for Malaysia prediabetic individuals to improve their blood glucose level, it will also provide greater insight of the associations of chrononutrition, lifestyle factors and anthropometric measurements with glycemic measures. The findings will also set the directions to adopt optimal -meal -timing approach in Clinical Practice Guideline fo r diabetes. We anticipate that our proposed study which incorporate the circadian timing, as a novel approach, may provide the fundamental information that could be adopted by the government and policy makers. The outcome can be included in the future clin ical practice guideline or to develop innovative and effective lifestyle interventions to improve the T2DM prevalent in Malaysia.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY Hypothesis: The morning chronotype and early meal -timing are associated with low glycemic outcome among prediabetic individuals. Research Questions: Is the morning chronotype and early meal -timing are associated with better glucose tolerance among prediabetic individuals? General objective: To determine the associations of chronotype and chrononutrition with glucose tolerance among prediabetic individuals in Malaysia. Specific objectives: 1. To examine the associations among chronotype, chrononutrition and glucose outcomes. 2. To investigate the association between lifestyle factors (p hysical activity level, light exposure, diet timing, sleep pattern) and chrononutrition. 3. To investigate the association between anthropometry measurements and glycemic outcomes. Description of Methodology: Participants will be recruited using the con venience sampling method. The proposed study will be conducted in community clinics in Malacca, Malaysia. Malacca is the capital of the coastal stage, located in southwestern Malaysia, with an estimated total population of 0.93 million in the year 2019 (Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia, 2021) . In 2019, National Health and Morbidity Survey reported that 17% of Malaccan adults had hyperglycemia and 13.7% of them had known diabetes. Malacca is 1 out of the top five states showing the highest prevalence of diabetes in Malaysia (IPH, NIH and MOH, 2019) . Permission to carry out data collection has been granted by the Medi cal Research and Ethics Committee (MREC) ( RSCH ID -21-00114 -IVI). The study protocol has been reviewed and approved by the Tunku Abdul Rahman University College (TARUC) research ethics committee (TAR UC/EC/2021/02 -3). During the process of recruitment, a t rained research assistant (one of the co - researcher), clinical dietitian (one of the co -researcher) or family medicine specialist (one of the co -researcher) will inform potential prediabetic individuals research protocol verbally and written information wi ll be provided. Newly diagnosed prediabetic individuals who are agreeable to participate will provide written informed consent. Baseline and follow up appointments will be determined based on the community clinic appointment schedules. Those who decline to participate will continue to receive their Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page16 of 58 routine treatment as usual, and care provided to each prediabetic individual will not be affected by the decision to either participate or not participate in the study. Those who meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in this study. Eligible participants shall meet all the following inclusion criteria. 1) Newly diagnosed prediabetic individuals who have been first seen by clinical dietician registered under the Ministry of Health Malaysia. 2) Malaysian 18 years old. 3) Those who plan to continue prediabetes care at a community clinic in Melaka. 4) Those who can read, write and understand the Malay Language.

They are excluded as current research lack of evidence to support the accuracy of using 24 -hour continuous g lucose monitoring system (CGMS) (Freestyle Libre Pro, Abbott, Germany). Prediabetes and diabetes will be defined according to the latest Clinical Practice Guideline in Malaysia (WHO & IDF, 2006; ADA, 2020; MOH et al. , 2020) . Diagnosis must be confirmed by measurement of venous plasma glucose (FBG and OGTT) or HbA1c level. Table 1 shows the diagnostic value for diabetes on plasma glucose. Table 2 shows the diagnostic values for prediabetes and diabetes based on OGTT. Table 3 s hows the diagnostic values for prediabetes and diabetes based on HbA1c. All the tables are adapted from the Clinical Practice Guideline in Malaysia (WHO & IDF, 2006; ADA, 2020; MOH et al. , 2020) .

During the process of recruitment, a trained research assistant, clinical dietitian (one of the co-researchers ) or family medicine specialist (one of the co-researchers ) will inform potential prediabetic individuals of the study both verbally and will be provided written information (Appendix A). Newly diagnosed prediabetic individuals who are agreeable to participate will be provide written informed consent (Appendix A). Study visits (recruitment and follow -up visits) of this study will be determined based on the healthcare clinic appointment schedules. Those who decline to participate continue to receive their routine treatment as us ual, and care provided to each prediabetic individual is not affected nor affected by each individual's decision to either participate or not participate in the study. An overview of the study procedure is illustrated in Figure 3. All the newly diagnosed p rediabetic individuals who fulfill the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the present study. They will be recruited when they visit the diet clinic for for the first time for their initial appointment scheduling. This would be considered the baseline visit. OGTT, HbA1c and FBS results will be traced from medical records. Data regarding sociodemographic information and anthropometric measurements will be collected in the baseline visit. Enrolled participants will be interviewed by a train ed research assistant using the following questionnaire including (1) Munich Chronotype Questionnaires (MCTQ) (Appendix D), (2) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Questionnaire (PSQI) (Appendix H), (3) Harvard Light Exposure Questionnaire (HLEQ) (Appendix G), (4) International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) (Appendix C) and (5) Chrononutrition Profile Questionnaire (CPQ) (Appendix I). Anthropometry measurements including body fat, height, body fat percentage, visceral fat, waist circumferen ce and hip circumference will be measured. Participants are requested to fill up 3 -days dietary record (3DDR) (2 weekdays and one weekend day) and the data Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page18 of 58 will be collected in the next visit. Baseline reading of fasting plasma glucose (FPG, OGTT , liver fu nction , and HbA1c) will be retrieved from medical records in the community clinic. Routine treatment will be provided as usual. To minimize the loss of follow -up, phone conversations will be made to ensure the 3 -days dietary data is completed. At the se cond visit (three month s from the baseline) , all participants are required to wear a CGM S sensor at the back of their upper arms to measure the 24 hours glucose fluctuation over 14 consecutive days. 3DDR will be given to participants to record their consec utive 3 days dietary record and will be returned after 14 days. After 14 days, participants will return the CGMS sensor at the community clinic . Or alternative way of CGMS sensor collection by an assistant at the participant's home. All questionnaires will be interviewed by a trained research assistant again. Anthropometry measurements including body fat, height, body fat percentage, visceral fat, waist circumference and hip circumference will be measured repeatedly. At the third visit (six months from the first visit), for FBG, OGTT and HbA1c test , all the readings will be retrieved by the research assistant from the medical record to document the glycemic outcome. The participants will be interviewed by the trained research assistant during all clinic visits using similar questionnaires. All anthropometry measurements (body fat, height, body fat percentage, visceral fat, waist circumference and hip circumference) will be conducted again. 3DDR will be given to record t heir 3 days dietary intake again and the record progress will be followed up through phone. The original 3 DDR will be collected at the routine appointment. Sample size Calculation: The sample size is estimated using G*Power software version 3.1.9.4 (Erdfelder, Faul and Buchner, 1996) . To determination of association between chrononutrition and glycemic control, the -coefficient of 0.13 adopted from Sakai et al. , (2018) , the power was set to 0. 9 with 2 sided significance level and alpha error given 0.05, a total of 83 prediabet ic adults expected in this study.

Freestyle Libre Pro is not a usual/ normal Freestyle Libre. The normal version of CGMS can be easily purchased in the market, but CGMS Pro version can only be purchased direct from Abbott Germany. For the usual/normal Freestyle Libre, reading must be read by reader every 8 hourly and participants m ay easily check their blood glucose , resulting the unnecessary bias, where participants might change their diet and lifestyle habit to control the blood sugar. Whereas, pro version can only be used for clinical trial purpose, cannot be commercialized out o f clinical trial use. Readings from the 24 -hour CGMS Pro version will not be made available to participants in real time, hence, it will prevent the bias that may arise from unmasked real-time glucose reading. Besides, blood sugar can be kept record for up to 14 days for pro version, easier for researcher to collect the data and save the cost of reader. Figure 5 shows the example of the daily glucose summary from 24 -hour CGMS. 24 - hour CGMS aids in understanding the person glucose profile and detecting episo des of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Figure 6 shows the example of the daily pattern outcome from 24 -hour CGMS. The FreeStyle Libre Pro CGM system consists of a disposable sensor, an applicator, and a reader; that is used to start the sensor on the part icipant and gather the glucose data at the end of the CGMS period. The Sensor can be worn for up to 14 days, on the back of their upper arm (Figure 7). Once applied, a sensor will measure and store glucose readings every 15 minutes. The 24 -hour CGMS does n ot require any participant action as calibration for the sensor is not needed. Readings from the 24 - hour CGMS will not be made available to participants in real time, hence, it will prevent the bias that may arise from unmasked real -time glucose readings. The data from all the 24 -hour CGMS (Freestyle Libre Pro, Abbott, Germany ) sensors is easily accessible through the FreeStyle Libre Pro Software or The LibreView Cloud. In the present study, the 24 -hour CGMS reading will be taken 14 -day prior to second visit/ second -round OGTT reading. All the data from 24 -hour CGMS will be analyzed to Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page22 of 58 investigate to obtain the optimal -meal -timing. The 24 -hour CGMS data will be match with 3 -day food diary too. Exposure measures Meal -timing and chrononutrition At the baseli ne visit, the researcher will guide the participants to fill out the 3 -day food diary covering two weekdays and one weekend day (consecutive Sunday -Tuesday or Thursday -Saturday). Three -day food diary will be taken twice in the entire study. At the baseline visit, 3 -day food diary will be interviewed by researcher to the participants. This food diary data will be served as baseline meal -timing data. Subsequently, participant will be given another 3 -days daily dietar y at second visit , 14-day prior to third vi sit. Participants are required to record the time, type, description and number of foods and beverages consumed throughout the day. Brand information, ingredients and cooking method will be recorded where applicable, particularly for home -cooked food. Pictures of household measuring utensils and various food portion sizes are printed in the food diary to assist participants in quantifying their food intake. For 14 day return the CGMS , researcher will be interviewed participants on the completeness of 3 days daily dietary intake . Energy and macronutrients analysis of dietary record w ill be performed using Nutritionist ProTM (Axxya Systems, Stafford, TX, USA), based principally on the Nutrient Composition of Malaysian Food and the food product labels. Energy intake will be compared with estimated basal metabolic rate (BMR) to exclude p articipants who are under -reporting or overreporting their energy intake in their 3 -day food diary. BMR is calculated using standard equations based on sex and age provided by FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) (FAO/WHO/UNU 1985). For participants in a non -dieting populat ion, Torun et al. (1996) proposed that a ratio between energy intake and BMR of less than 1.39 and more than 2.24 be considered as under -reporting and over - reporting respectively. These cut -off points will be applied in the present trial. From the 3-day fo od diary data, we will investigate the dietary intake as reported on the second day of recording. The second day will be selected over the first one to ensure that participants have also include night -time eating in the records. Compare to the later days, which may have been burdened by increasing exhaustion related to the record - keeping, the second day better represents the habitual dietary intake (Ahola et al. 2019). To investigate the energy and macronutrient intakes over the course of the day, five peri ods will be performed as follows: night (from 00:00 to 04:49), morning (from 05:00 to 09:59), midday (from 10:00 to 13:59), afternoon (from 14:00 to 16:59) and evening (from 17:00 to 23:59), adapted from Ahola et al. (2019). As these periods differed in th eir duration, energy intake per hour will also be calculated for each of the five periods. In addition, energy and macronutrient intakes per hour (e.g. intakes reported between 10:00 and 10:59 contributed towards the hour \"10:00\"). Diet quality will be der ived from a 177 food items FFQ at second visit, where the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) will be calculated. This FFQ is adapted from the FFQ used by the Malaysian Adults Nutrition Survey (MANS) 2014 (IPH 2014) (Appendix C). Participants will be required to in dicate frequency of foods consumed in the last 1 month. Individual portion size will be asked for each food, and pictures of the various portion size will be Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page23 of 58 provided for more accurate quantification. A validated Malaysian HEI will be applied to determine the HEI scoring (Lee et al. 2011; Goh & Norimah 2012). The instrument consists of nine components, which is make up of seven food groups and two nutrient groups, as shown in Table 5. The scoring of these components will be calculated based on the recommend ed serving size and nutrient intake in the Malaysian Dietary Guideline (MDG) (NCCFN 2010). The score of each food group will be calculated using the formula: (actual serving consumed based on participant's diet record /recommended serving size based on MDG ) \u00d7 10. The score of each nutrient ranged from 0 to 10, which will be calculated proportionately for the in -between whole number responses, as shown in Table 6. The total score of HEI is obtained by summing up the score of each component. The composite sco re in percentage is calculated using the formula: (total score obtained from 9 components/maximum score of 90) \u00d7 100%. Therefore, the total score is 100%, in which less than 51% indicated poor diet, 51 to 80% indicated diet requiring improvement, and more than 80% indicated good diet (Lee et al. 2011). Physical activity, sedentary behaviours, sleep and light exposure questionnaire on physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep and light exposure are also administered at the first visit. Participants ar e interviewed using the modified International Physical Activity Questionnaire -Short Form (IPAQ -SF)(Appendix C) to self -report their physical activity in the last 7 days (IPAQ 2005). The modified questionnaire evaluates the vigorous physical activity, the moderate physical activity and the walking time. Loy et Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page24 of 58 al. (2019) removed question asking about the sitting time from the original IPAQ -SF and included it in the questionnaire used to assess sedentary behavior. The data will be computed in metabolic equiv alents (MET -min/ week) scores. Questionnaire on sedentary behavior which is modified from the Adult Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire is performed (Chu et al. 2018). The questionnaire evaluates time spent sedentary in the last 7 days, including sitting time at work, sitting/ lying down time to watch television, to use electronic devices at mealtime , while driving or reading. Participants also self-administer the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire to assess their sleep habits in the last month (Buys se et al. 1989)(Appendix H), and the Harvest Light Exposure Assessment questionnaire (Appendix G) to assess their main light sources exposure in hourly basis on a typical weekday and weekend day (Bajaj et al. 2011). Anthropometric measurements (Appendix J) will be measured at the first, second and third visit. Body weight, body fat percentage and visceral fat of each participant will be measured twice using a body fat analyzer (HBF -375, Karada) and recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg, 0.1 % and 1 unit, respect ively. Participants will be weighted with their minimal cloths on, barefoot, without belt and emptied pockets. They will be asked to stand still with the body weight equally distributed on both feet. Participants have to be in the Frankfurt plane, where th e body is upright, upper limbs are at the body's sides with the palms facing forward, feet flat and directed forward, directly facing the researcher assistant. The height of each participant will be measured twice using a SECA portable stadiometer Model 21 7 (SECA GmbH & Co., Hamburg, Germany) attached to a smooth wall and recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm. Participants will be asked to stand erect, in their bare feet, with their heels, buttocks, head and shoulder blades in a vertical line against the wall. Hei ght will be measured in the upright position against a vertical scare and with the head positioned so that the top of the external auditory meatus is in the level with the inferior margin of the bone orbit. Waist and hip circumferences of the respondents w ill be measured twice, according to the standardized protocol by the WHO (2008). Waist circumference will be measured at the approximate midpoint between the lower margin of the last palpable rib and the top of the iliac crest. Hip circumference will be me asured around the widest portion of the buttocks, with the tape parallel to the floor. For both measurements, the participants should stand with feet close together, arms at the side and body weight evenly distributed, and should wear little clothing. Both waist and hip circumferences will be measured to the nearest 0.1 cm by using a Lufkin tape model W606PM (Apex Tool Group, Sparks, MD, USA). The reported measurements are the average values from both readings. Study Outcomes The main outcome of the stud y is the glycemic outcome including FPG HbA1c (%), variability from CGMS. The secondary outcomes are chronotype from the validated questionnaire MCTQ , and chrononutrition from the validated questionnaire CPQ , 3 days di etary record, anthropometry measurements, physical activity level from the validated questionnaire IPAQ , sleep Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page25 of 58 pattern from the validated questionnaires PSIQ and light exposure from the validated questionnaire HLEQ. Statistical Analysis All data will be performed statistical analysis using the SPSS software version 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The socio -demographic will be presented as mean , standard deviations, median, interquartile range, frequency, and percentage . Data cleaning wi ll be performed to exclude the outlier data before the normality is checked using Kolmogorov -Smirnov Test. We considered p<0.05 to be statistically significant. Chronotype, sleep quality, and light exposure will be analyzed as categorical variables whereas dietary intake, chrononutrition, anthropometry, glycemic measure, and physical activity will be analyzed as continuous variables . We will perform a multivariable generalized linear model to examine the association between night meal pattern (last night mealtime either dinner or supper with calories intake, frequency of night snacking, and the total number of the night snacking) lycemic outcome (HbA1c, FPG, 2hPPG, by adjusting for the potential covariates . Specifically, nighttime will be characterized by the time range from 1900 and 0659 hours based on Malaysia solar time. We will explore the late -night meal timing in 2000, 2100, and 2200 to examine its association with glycemic outcomes. The potential confounders include sociodemographic characteristics, physical activity, sleep pattern , sedentary behavior, diet quality, and light exposure will be controlled . ANCOVA t est will be performed to understand the association between chrononutrition (breakfast skipping, meal frequency, eating window, sleep timing, chronotype, and fasting pattern) with glycemic variables, controlling for potential covariates (sociodemographic c haracteristics, light exposure, diet quality, physical activity and sleep pattern). To investigate the association of physical activity (MET score and steps count), sedentary behaviors (MET score), sleep pattern (sleep duration), diet quality (distributio n of total energy, carbohydrate, protein, and fat), and light exposure (timing responded to a different type of light) with glycemic outcome, the multivariable generalized linear model will be conducted. Meanwhile, anthropometric measures (body mass index, body fat, and waist circumference) will be categorized as either normal or overweight and obesity group, followed by using logistic regression to examine the association between anthropometry status and glycemic outcome (non - diabetes or diabetes). In addi tion, t he glycemic outcome will be categorized into diabetes incidence (diabetes and non -diabetes) to determine the participants who had been diagnosed with diabetes at 6 months. A logistic regression test will be used to examine the association between early and late -night mealtime and diabetes incidence. Quality control To ensure that the database accurately reflects the data reported in the questionnaires, a pre -test will be carried out. The research assistant trained to conduct the study procedures included interviewing administrative questionnaires, CGMS device, 3 days dietary record, and pedometer. Monthly meetings are held with the principal Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page26 of 58 investigator to review study procedures and progression. A monthly report will be documented after the meeting. Data monitoring and management Participants are anonymized and as signed with a specific ID at study entry. To ensure accuracy and completeness of data entry, data are checked by identifying if there is any outlier or missing value. The data checking process is performed in the first, third and sixth month of the data co llection, such that the experience gained can be used to train the research assistant for improvement. Paper documents are kept in a locked cabinet and electronic data are stored on password -protected computers which can only be accessed by research team m embers. All records will be kept for at least 5 years after completing the study . After 5 years, all papers will be shredded using an office shredder. Extra care should be taken with sensitive or confidential information and a secure paper destruction serv ice bin used. Digital data will be destroyed by deleting or overwriting information and destroying the physical media, such as CD rom. 4.

Version Dated 4 December 2021 Page34 of 58 APPENDIX A: INFORMATION SHEET AND CONSENT FORM Research Title Chronotype, Chrononutrition and Glucose Tolerance Among Prediabetic Individuals: Research Protocol for Chrono -DMTM. Introduction There is a growing body of knowledge associating alterations in biological clock with the development of T2DM. Perhaps, it is not what you eat but when you choose to eat it. Although the importance of biology clock in diabetes prevention had been recognize d; however, such relevant information are not included in any diabetes guidelines, particularly in Malaysia. Objective This study aimed to determine the associations of chronotype and chrononutrition with glucose tolerance among prediabetic individuals in Malaysia. What should I do? This study that targets to recruit 166 prediabetes individuals who have received conventional medical nutrition therapy, from all the healthcare clinics in Malacca. Parti cipants will be followed -up up to 6 -month times: Table 1 The overall study flow Timeline Services Measurements Baseline (first diagnosed prediabetes) Routine Appointment in Community Service: Fasting Plasma Glucose, Oral Glucose Tolerance Test, Liver function test, HbA1c test, Medical Officer consultation and dietitian consultation. Research Protocol: 1) Information data: Social -demographic Questionnaire 2) Anthropometry Measurement: Weight, Height, Body Fat Percentage, Visceral Fat, Waist Circumference 3) Pedometer Counting 4) Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) 5) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) 6) Harvard Light Exposure Assessment Questionnaire(H -LEA) 7) 3 days Daily Diet Record (2 weekdays and one weekend day; consecutive Sunday to Tuesday or Thursday to Saturday, within CGMS wearing period) 8) International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) Second visit (at 3rd month) Routine Appointment in Community Service: Fasting Plasma Glucose, Oral Glucose Tolerance Test, HbA1c test, Dietitian consultation Research Protocol: 1) Anthropometry Measurement: Weight, Height, Body Fat Percentage, Visceral Fat, Waist Circumference 2) Pedometer Counting 3) Munich Ch ronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) 4) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) 5) Harvard Light Exposure Assessment Questionnaire(H -LEA) 6) 3 days Daily Diet Record (2 weekdays and one weekend day; consecutive Sunday to Tuesday or Thursday to Saturday, within CGMS wearing period) 7) International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) 8) Chrononutrition Profile - Questionnaire (CPQ) 9) Continuous Gluco se Monitoring Service (CGMS) Third visit (at 6th month) Routine Appointment in Community Service: Fasting Plasma Glucose, Oral Glucose Tolerance Test, HbA1c test, Medical Officer consultation and Dietitian consultation. Research Protocol: 1) Anthropometry Measurement: Weight, Height, Body Fat Percentage, Visceral Fat, Waist Circumference 2) Pedometer Counting 3) Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) Version 2.0, Dated 4 December 2021 Page35 of 58 4) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) 5) Harvard Light Exposure Assessment Questionnaire(H -LEA) 6) 3 days Daily Diet Record (2 weekdays and one weekend day; consecutive Sunday to Tuesday or Thursday to Saturday, within CGMS wearing period) 7) International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) 8) Chrononutrition Profile - Questionnaire (CPQ) The interview will b e like a conversation, and you can decide to stop the interview at any time. There are no right or wrong answers. We are interested in learning from your personal experiences. You will not know the reading in real time because the CGMS pro system is desig ned research observation and the reading will not made available to participants in real time. FDA Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Data (PMA P150021) indicated that Freestyle Libre CGMS pro version may inaccurately indicate hypoglycemia at a greater ra te than other approved CGMs. The results of the clinical study conducted for this device showed that 40 percent of the time when the device indicated that user sensor glucose values were at or below 60 mg/dL(3.3 mmol/L), user glucose values were actually i n the range of 81 - 160 mg/dL (4.5 -8.9 mmol/L). A glucometer shall be performed if you are suspect you have abnormal glucose level anytime. You will get your personal glucose result according to routine appointment with medical officer upon your request. Yo ur personal CGMS and all measurement results will be given after 6 months measurements through email upon your request. Benefits of Research There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this study. However, your input will provide the vital information regarding to meal timing and glucose control in pre -diabetes patients. Confidentiality Your answer and information will be kept confidential by the investigators and will not made public unless disclosure is required by law. All information will be kept confidentially in Tunku Abdul Rahman University College for 3 years and then safely dispo sed of after 3 years. You will inform the study finding through email if there are any new publications using your information. Risk to participants CGMS pro system is continuous glucose monitoring system approved by US Food Drug and Administration. We u sed this system fully to observe glucose variability personality but not the purpose to diagnose hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. The FreeStyle Libre Pro System must be removed prior to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, or high -frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment. Potential device -related, non -serious events related to continuous glucose monitor use include: local infection, skin irritation or redness, skin inflammation, pain or discomfort, bleeding, bruising, skin e dema, skin rash, itching, scarring or skin discoloration, allergic reactions to the sensor needle or adhesives, sensor or needle fracture during insertion, wear or removal. Sensor breakage with fragments retained under the skin is a potential procedure -related complication. However, based on post - market experience with this and similar devices, and the results observed in the clinical study, this event is rare and its severity does not raise major concerns. We believe participation in this study is of mini mal risk . However, if you ever feel uncomfortable during the study, you are free to stop at any time. As with any study that collects information about you, there is possible risk of loss of confidentiality. However, as described below, we have taken sever al measures to help prevent this.
