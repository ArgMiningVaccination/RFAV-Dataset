It thus focuses on ensuring that the conditions for health are present in a person; combating illness is often necessary but is insufficient alone. The approach was founded in the 1920s by [Rudolf Steiner](/wiki/Rudolf_Steiner) in conjunction with Ita Wegman, who carried the impulse forward after Steiner's death in [1925](/wiki/1925). This approach to medicine begins from the proposition that true healing takes place when the body is stimulated to overcome the influences that are causing illness, whether these arise from its own constitution or the surroundings \u2014 whether they be poisonous substances, antagonistic organisms ( [bacterial](/wiki/Bacteria) or [viral](/wiki/Virus)), or psychological states. Under circumstances where it is not possible to support the body's own resistance, it may be necessary to overcome symptoms by purely external means such as [surgery](/wiki/Surgery) and [allopathic medicine](/wiki/Allopathic_medicine) offer. As conventional medicines and therapies may also be employed, anthroposophical medicine provides an extension of conventional medical approaches rather than an alternative to these. As a variety of influences may be causing illness, a corresponding range of treatment possibilities are employed. Therapeutic approaches presently used by anthroposophical doctors include anthroposophic remedies based upon [homeopathic](/wiki/Homeopathy) principles, oil dispersion baths, [massage therapy](/wiki/Massage_therapy), [artistic](/wiki/Art_therapy) therapies to heal the psychological causes of illness, and biographical therapy to establish or re-establish a sense of purpose in the ill person. There are specialized trainings in each of these therapeutic professions, as well as in anthroposophical nursing and medicine. An anthroposophic doctor must also have a medical degree from an established and certified medical school. Origins[ ] The first steps towards an anthroposophical approach to medicine were made before [1920](/wiki/1920), when homeopathic physicians and pharmacists began working with Rudolf Steiner, who recommended new medicinal substances as well as specific methods for preparing these. In [1921](/wiki/1921), Dr. Ita Wegman opened the first anthroposophic medical clinic, now known as the Ita Wegman Clinic, in Arlesheim, [Switzerland](/wiki/Switzerland). Wegman was soon joined by a number of other doctors. They began to train the first anthroposophic nurses for the clinic. At Wegman's request, Steiner regularly visited the clinic and suggested treatment regimes for particular patients. Between 1921 and 1925, he also gave several series of lectures on medicine. In 1925, Wegman and Steiner wrote the first book on the anthroposophic approach to medicine, Fundamentals of Therapy. The clinic expanded and soon opened a branch in Ascona. Wegman lectured widely, visiting Holland and England particularly frequently, and an increasing number of doctors began to include the anthroposophic approach in their practices. A cancer clinic, the Lukas Clinic [[1]](http://www.lukasklinik.ch/cms.asp?IDN=133&H='106'&T=0&Sprache=en), opened in Arlesheim in 1963. Mistletoe treatment for cancer[ ] One of the most prominent and well-researched anthroposophical treatments is a range of mistletoe extracts used to treat patients with cancer. The treatment is well established in Europe and is being explored for use in the USA. Journal articles reviewing the effects of mistletoe on cancerous conditions include: [The story behind mistletoe: a European remedy from anthroposophical medicine.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=10550903&query_hl=8&itool=pubmed_docsum) [Isolation and identification of a tumour reducing component from mistletoe extract (Iscador).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=3409209&dopt=Citation) [Increased secretion of tumor necrosis factors alpha, interleukin 1, and interleukin 6 by human mononuclear cells exposed to beta-galactoside-specific lectin from clinically applied galactoside-specific lectin and on immunocompetent in [Immunoprotective activity of the after the clinics and doctors[ ] There are currently anthroposophical medical practices in more than 60 countries.
