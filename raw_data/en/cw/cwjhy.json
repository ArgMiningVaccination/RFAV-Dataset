This video from TriHealth addresses the Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine, the most recent vaccine to be approved for use in the U.S., and a one which utilizes different technology than the previous versions from the mRNA Pfizer and Moderna. Topics include: - A reminder of how the previous vaccines use mRNA technology to help your body build immunity to the disease - How an Ad Vector vaccine mimics a natural infection to stimulate an immune response so your body can identify and destroy the COVID-19 Coronavirus - Background on the development and trials for Ad Vector technology - Differences between the Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine including stability and dosing and how those are beneficial - A list of ingredients in the new vaccine - Data on efficacy based on trials for the vaccine and why comparisons to the other vaccines aren't necessarily valid due to timing and the emergence of COVID-19 variants, which impacted trials for the new vaccine - Positive data on the frequency and severity of symptoms for vaccinated participants in the study versus those who received a placebo - Common side effects and symptoms following the vaccine - A look at the diversity of the Johnson & Johnson Janssen study sample - Why you should take whichever vaccine you are able to get first "}
