That ignorance has given rise to a vast industry selling advice that has little evidence to support it. The 2016 Conference of the so-called \"College of Medicine\" had the title \"Food, the Forgotten Medicine\". This post gives some background information about some of the speakers at this event. I'm sorry it appears to be too ad hominem, but the only way to judge the meeting is via the track record of the speakers. Quite a lot has been written here about the \"College of Medicine\". It is the direct successor of the Prince of Wales' late, unlamented, Foundation for Integrated Health. But unlike the latter, its name is disguises its promotion of quackery. [Originally](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/07/25/buckinghamgate-the-new-college-of-medicine-arising-from-the-ashes-of-the-princes-foundation-for-integrated-health/) it was going to be called the \"College of Integrated Health\", but that wasn't sufficently deceptive so the name was dropped. For the history of the organisation, see [The new \"College of Medicine\" arising from the ashes of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/07/25/buckinghamgate-the-new-college-of-medicine-arising-from-the-ashes-of-the-princes-foundation-for-integrated-health/) [Don't be deceived.

Is Graeme Catto selling out?](http://www.dcscience.net/2012/05/03/the-college-of-medicine-is-in-the-pocket-of-crapita-capita-is-graeme-catto-selling-out/) The conference programme ( [download pdf](http://www.dcscience.net/College-of-Medicine-Food-conf-programme-2016.pdf)) is a masterpiece of [bait and switch](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Bait+and+switch). It is a mixture of very respectable people, and outright quacks. The former are invited to give legitimacy to the latter. The names may not be familiar to those who don't follow the antics of the magic medicine community, so here is a bit of information about some of them. The introduction to the meeting was by [Michael Dixon](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Michael+Dixon) and [Catherine Zollman](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Zollman), both veterans of the Prince of Wales Foundation, and both devoted enthusiasts for magic medicne. [Zollman even believes](http://www.bmj.com/content/319/7217/1115.1) in the battiest of all forms of magic medicine, homeopathy ( [download pdf](Vickers-Zollman-homeopathy-1999.pdf)), for which she totally misrepresents the evidence. Zollman works now at the [Penny Brohn centre](http://www.pennybrohn.org.uk/) in Bristol. She's [also linked to](http://portlandcentrehealthcare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Portland-Centre-4pp-A5-Programme-68048-FINAL-4.pdf) the \" [Portland Centre for integrative medicine](http://portlandcentrehealthcare.co.uk/)\" which is run by [Elizabeth Thompson](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/07/27/dr-elizabeth-thompson-of-bristol-homeopathic-hospital-finds-that-pills-that-contain-nothing-have-no-effect-not-even-placebo-effect/), another advocate of homeopathy. It came into being after NHS Bristol shut down the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital, on the very good grounds that it doesn't work. Now, like most magic medicine it is privatised. The [Penny Brohn shop](http://www.shopatpennybrohn.com/) will sell you a wide range of expensive and useless \"supplements\". For example, [Biocare Antioxidant capsules](http://www.shopatpennybrohn.com/collections/supplements-1/products/biocare-antioxidant-complex-90-vegecaps) at \u00a337 for 90. Biocare make [several unjustified claims](https://www.biocare.co.uk/default.aspx?GroupGuid=1053) for their benefits. Among other unnecessary ingredients, they contain a very small amount of green tea. That's a favourite of \"health food addicts\", and it was the subject of a [recent paper](http://www.dcscience.net/delaTorre-green-tea-2016.pdf) that contains one of the daftest statistical solecisms I've ever encountered \"To protect against type II errors, no corrections were applied for multiple comparisons\". If you don't understand that, try [this paper](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/3/140216). The results are almost certainly false positives, despite the fact that it appeared in Lancet Neurology. It's yet another example of broken peer review. It's been know for decades now that [ \"antioxidant\" is no more than a marketing term](http://www.dcscience.net/2007/03/03/anti-oxidant-supplements-dangerous-garlic-useless-update/), There is no evidence of benefit and large doses can be harmful. This obviously doesn't worry the College of Medicine. Margaret Rayman was the next speaker. She's a real nutritionist. Mixing the real with the crackpots is a standard bait and switch tactic. Eleni Tsiompanou, came next. She runs yet another [private \"wellness\" clinic](http://healthbeing.co.uk/), which makes all the usual exaggerated claims. She seems to have an [obsession with Hippocrates](http://healthbeing.co.uk/hippocrates/) (hint: medicine has moved on since then). [Dr Eleni's Joy Biscuits](http://healthbeing.co.uk/recipes/dr-elenis-joy-biscuits/) may or may not taste good, but their health-giving properties are make-believe. Andrew Weil, from the University of Arizona gave the keynote address. He's described as \"one of the world's leading authorities on Nutrition and Health\". That description alone is sufficient to show the fantasy land in which the College of Medicine exists. He's a typical supplement salesman, presumably very rich. There is no excuse for not knowing about him. It was 1988 when [Arnold Relman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_S._Relman) (who was editor of the New England Journal of Medicine) wrote [A Trip to Stonesville: Some Notes on Andrew Weil, M.D.](http://www.quackwatch.com/11Ind/weil.html). \"Like so many of the other gurus of alternative medicine, Weil is not bothered by logical contradictions in his argument, or encumbered by a need to search for objective evidence.\" This blog has mentioned his more [recent activities](http://www.dcscience.net/2008/02/17/quackademics-in-usa-and-canada/#arizona), many times. [Alex Richardson](http://www.fabresearch.org/viewItem.php?id=7412), of Oxford Food and Behaviour Research (a charity, not part of the university) is an enthusiast for omega-3, a favourite of the supplement industry, She has published several papers that show little evidence of effectiveness. That looks entirely honest. On the other hand, [ their News section](http://www.fabresearch.org/viewItem.php?id=342) contains many links to the notorious supplement industry lobby site, Nutraingredients, one of the least reliable sources of information on the web (I get their newsletter, a constant source of hilarity and raised eyebrows). I find this worrying for someone who claims to be evidence-based. I'm told that her charity is funded largely by the supplement industry (though I can't find any mention of that on the web site). Stephen Devries was a new name to me. You can infer what he's like from the fact that he has been endorsed byt Andrew Weil, and that his address is \"Institute for Integrative Cardiology\" (\"Integrative\" is the latest euphemism for quackery). Never trust any talk with a title that contains \"The truth about\". His was called \"The scientific truth about fats and sugars,\" In [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24PC0zYKLkk), he claims that diet has been shown to reduce heart disease by 70%. which gives you a good idea of his ability to assess evidence. But the claim doubtless helps to sell his books. Prof Tim Spector, of Kings College London, was next. As far as I know he's a perfectly respectable scientist, albeit one with [books to sell](http://www.tim-spector.co.uk/), But his talk [ is now online](https://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/food-medicine-diet-myths-microbes/?dm_i=PC7,4DPC1,3PB5TI,G3CAO,1), and it was a bit like a born-again microbiome enthusiast. He seemed to be too impressed by the PREDIMED study, despite it's statistical unsoundness, which was [pointed out by Ioannidis](http://www.dcscience.net/Ioannidis-2013-nutrition-bmj.pdf). Little evidence was presented, though at least he was more sensible than the audience about the uselessness of multivitamin tablets. Simon Mills talked on \"Herbs and spices. Using Mother Nature's pharmacy to maintain health and cure illness\". He's a herbalist who has featured here [many times](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Simon+Mills%22). I can recommend especially his video about [Hot and Cold herbs](http://www.dcscience.net/2012/06/10/bait-and-switch-by-herbalists-chinese-and-western/) as a superb example of fantasy science. Annie Anderson, is [Professor of Public Health Nutrition](http://medicine.dundee.ac.uk/staff-member/professor-annie-s-anderson) and Founder of the Scottish Cancer Prevention Network. She's a respectable nutritionist and public health person, albeit with their customary disregard of [problems of causality](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/11/18/we-know-little-about-the-effect-of-diet-on-health-thats-why-so-much-is-written-about-it/). Patrick Holden is chair of the [Sustainable Food Trust](http://www.ciwf.org.uk/about-us/high-profile-supporters/visionaries/civil-society/patrick-holden-cbe/). He promotes \"organic farming\". Much though I dislike the cruelty of factory farms, the \"organic\" industry is largely a way of making food more expensive with no health benefits. The Michael Pittilo 2016 Student Essay Prize was awarded after lunch. Pittilo has [featured frequently](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=pittilo) on this blog as a result of his execrable promotion of quackery -see, in particular, [A very bad report: gamma minus for the vice-chancellor](http://www.dcscience.net/2008/06/18/a-very-bad-report-gamma-minus-for-the-vice-chancellor/). Nutritional advice for patients with cancer. This discussion involved three people. Professor Robert Thomas, Consultant Oncologist, Addenbrookes and Bedford Hospitals, Dr Clare Shaw, Consultant Dietitian, Royal Marsden Hospital and Dr Catherine Zollman, GP and Clinical Lead, Penny Brohn UK. Robert Thomas came to my attention when I noticed that he, as a regular cancer consultant had spoken at a meeting of the quack charity, \"YestoLife\". When I saw he was scheduled tp speak at another quack conference. After I'd written to him to point out the track records of some of the people at the meeting, he withdrew from one of them. See [The exploitation of cancer patients is wicked. Carrot juice for lunch, then die destitute](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/03/25/the-exploitation-of-cancer-patients-is-wicked-carrot-juice-for-lunch-then-die-destitute/). The influence seems to have been temporary though. He continues to lend respectability to many dodgy meetings. He edits the [Cancernet web site](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/index.html). This site lends credence to bizarre treatments like [homeopathy](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/comp-homeopathy.htm) and [crystal healing](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/comp-crystal.htm). It used to sell [hair mineral analysis](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/nutritional-reports.htm), a well-known phony diagnostic method the main purpose of which is to sell you expensive \"supplements\". They still sell the \"Cancer Risk Nutritional Profile\". for \u00a3295.00, despite the fact that it provides no proven benefits. Robert Thomas designed a food \"supplement\", Pomi-T: capsules that contain Pomegranate, Green tea, Broccoli and Curcumin. Oddly, he seems still to subscribe to the antioxidant myth. Even the supplement industry [admits that that's a lost cause](http://www.nutraingredients.com/Regulation-Policy/Why-antioxidant-claims-have-been-killed-off-in-the-EU/?utm_source=newsletter_daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=22-Jun-2016&c=Spm99iS8YwD3CuvOLnW9pQ%3D%3D&p2=), but that doesn't stop its use in marketing. The one [randomised trial](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/pp-pomi-t.pdf) of these pills for prostate cancer was inconclusive. [Prostate Cancer UK says](http://prostatecanceruk.org/about-us/news-and-views/2013/6/superfoods) \"We would not encourage any man with prostate cancer to start taking Pomi-T food supplements on the basis of this research\". Nevertheless it's promoted on Cancernet.co.uk and widely sold. The [Pomi-T site boasts](https://www.pomi-t.co.uk/) about the (inconclusive) trial, but says \"Pomi-T\u00ae is not a medicinal product\". There was a cookery demonstration by Dale Pinnock \"The medicinal chef\" The programme does not tell us whether he made is signature dish \"the [ Famous Flu Fighting Soup](http://www.dalepinnock.com/flu-fighting-soup-itvs-this-morning/)\". Needless to say, there isn't the slightest reason to believe that his soup has the slightest effect on flu. In summary, the whole meeting was devoted to exaggerating vastly the effect of particular foods. It also acted as advertising for people with something to sell. Much of it was outright quackery, with a leavening of more respectable people, a standard part of the bait-and-switch methods used by all quacks in their attempts to make themselves sound respectable. I find it impossible to tell how much the participants actually believe what they say, and how much it's a simple commercial drive. The thing that really worries me is why someone like Phil Hammond supports this sort of thing by chairing their meetings (as he did for the \"College of Medicine's\" direct predecessor, the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. His defence of the NHS has made him something of a hero to me. He assured me that he'd asked people to stick to evidence. In that he clearly failed. I guess they must pay well. Follow-up This article has appeared, in nearly identical form, [on the UK Conversation](https://theconversation.com/quacktitioner-royal-is-a-menace-to-the-constitution-and-public-health-16448) . You can leave comments there or here. A constitutional monarch is purely ceremonial and plays no part in politics. Well actually in the UK it isn't quite as simple as that. The first problem is that we have no constitution. Things haven't changed much since the 19th century when Walter Bagehot said \"the Sovereign has, under a constitutional monarchy... three rights\u2014the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.\" These are not inconsiderable powers in a country which is meant to be run by elected representatives. But nobody knows how these powers are used: it is all done in secret. Well, almost all. Charles, Prince of Wales, has been unusually public in expressing his views. [He told a conference](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/7147870/Prince-of-Wales-I-was-accused-of-being-enemy-of-the-Enlightenment.html) at St James's Palace \"I was accused once of being the enemy of the Enlightenment\" \"I felt proud of that.\" That's a remarkable point of view for someone who, if he succeeds, will become the patron of that product of the age of enlightenment, the Royal Society. I have no doubt that Prince Charles means well. He can't be blamed for his lack of education. But his views on medicine date from a few centuries ago, and he has lost no opportunity to exploit his privileged position to proclaim them. Euphemisms for quackery He set up the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health (PFIH) to promote his views. ( \"Integrated\", in this context, is, of course, just the latest euphemism for \"alternative\" or \"quack\".) When the Foundation collapsed because of a financial scandal in 2010, it was replaced by the \"College of Medicine\". The name changed, but [not the people](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632) behind it. Initially this phoenix was to be named the \" [College of Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263)\", but by this time the prince's views on medicine had become sufficiently discredited that the word \"integrated\" was quickly dropped. This might be thought less than frank, but it is just employment of the classic [bait and switch](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-bait-and-switch-of-unscientific-medicine/) technique, beloved by used car salesmen. His views were well publicised in a PFIH publication, \"Complementary Healthcare: a Guide for Patients\". That volume either omitted or misrepresented the evidence about the one question that matters most to patients - does the treatment work or not? It caused me to write a much shorter, but more accurate, version, the [Patients' Guide to Magic Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733). The PFIH guide was arguably a danger to public health. When, very properly, it was criticised by Edzard Ernst, [a letter was sent](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/mar/11/health.monarchy) from from the prince's private secretary to Ernst's vice-chancellor, Steve Smith. Instead of defending Ernst's public spirited action, Smith [instituted disciplinary proceedings](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=89) against Ernst that lasted for a year. The prince had intervened directly in the affairs of the university. Steve Smith was rewarded with a knighthood in 2011. None of this criticism has dimmed the prince's enthusiasm for barmy medical ideas. He is well known to write many letters to government ministers to try to persuade them to adopt his ideas in a whole range of areas. In July 2013, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, visited the prince at Clarence House. The visit was reported to be to persuade the minister to defend homeopathy, though it was more likely to have been to press the case to confer a government stamp of [approval on herbalists](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4117) and traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners by giving them statutory regulation. This is a matter that was recently raised again [in parliament](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#130709h0001.htm_spnew0) by Charles' greatest ally, [David Tredinnick MP](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=6007) (Con, Bosworth) who got into trouble for charging astrology software to expenses. We shall never know what pressure was applied. A ruling of the Information Commissioner judged, reasonably enough, that there was public interest in knowing what influences were being brought to bear on public policy. But the Attorney General [overruled the judgement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/written-ministerial-statement-freedom-of-information-act-veto-of-release-of-prince-charles-letters) on the grounds that \"Disclosure of the correspondence could damage The Prince of Wales' ability to perform his duties when he becomes King.\" That, of course, is exactly what we are worried about. Influence on politics The prince's influence seems to be big in the Department of Health (DH). He was given \u00a337,000 of taxpayers' money to produce his guide, and an astonishing \u00a3900,000 to prepare the ground for the setting up of the hapless self-regulator, the [Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3311) (CNHC, also known as Ofquack). When NHS Choices (itself set up by DH to assess evidence) tried to rewrite its web page about that most discredited of all forms of quackery, homeopathy, officials in DH [referred the new advice to Michael Dixon](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5778), the medical director of the Prince's Foundation and, were it not for the Freedom of Information act, the DH would have caused inaccurate information to be provided. The DH has a chief medical officer and two scientific advisors, but prefers to take the advice of the Prince of Wales. The Prince of Wales' business, Duchy Originals, [has been condemned](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-440103/Duchy-original-sins--Charles-range-spotlight.html) by the Daily Mail, (of all places) for selling unhealthy foods. And when his business branched into selling quack \"detox\" and herbal nonsense he found himself censured by both [the MHRA](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/03/duchy-originals-pork-pies.html) and the [Advertising Standards Authority](http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2009/5/Duchy-Originals-Ltd/TF_ADJ_46199.aspx) (ASA) for making unjustifiable medical claims for these products. Ainsworth's homeopathic pharmacy is endorsed by both Prince Charles and the Queen: it has two Royal Warrants. They sell \"homeopathic vaccines\" for meningitis, measles, rubella and whooping cough. These \"vaccines\" contain nothing whatsoever so they are obviously a real danger to public health. Despite the fact that Ainsworth's had already been [censured by the ASA](http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2011/7/Ainsworths-(London)-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_148070.aspx) in 2011 for selling similar products, Ainsworth's continued to recommend them with a \" [casual disregard for the law](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/07/ainsworths-pharmacy.html)\". The regulator (the MHRA) failed to step in to stop them until it was eventually stirred into action by a young BBC reporter, Sam Smith, made a [programme for BBC South West](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZf9mUzI4RI&feature=c4-overview&list=UUei35H3nu7bduw-6DBJFGrQ). Then, at last, the somnolent regulator was stirred into action. The MHRA \"told Ainsworths to stop advertising a number of products\" (but apparently not to stop making them or selling them). They still sell Polonium metal 30C and Swine Meningitis 36C, and a booklet that recommends homeopathic \"vaccination\". Ainsworth's sales are no doubt helped by the Royal Warrants. The consequence is that people may die of meningitis. In 2011, the MHRA Chief Executive Professor Kent Woods, was knighted. It runs in the family The Prince of Wales is not the only member of the royal family to be obsessed with bizarre forms of medicine. The first homeopath to the British royal family, Frederick Quin, was a son of the Duchess of Devonshire (1765-1824). Queen Mary (1865-1953), wife of King George V, headed the fundraising efforts to move and expand the London Homeopathic Hospital. King George VI was so enthusiastic that in 1948 conferred the royal title on the London Homeopathic Hospital. The Queen Mother loved homeopathy too (there is no way to tell whether this contributed to her need for a colostomy in the 1960s). The present Queen's homeopathic physician is Peter Fisher, who is medical director of what, until recently was called the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital (RLHH). In 2010 that hospital was rebranded as the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine (RLHIM) in another unsubtle bait and switch move. | | The RLHIM is a The patron of the RLHIM is the Queen, not the Prince of Wales. It is hard to imagine that this anachronistic institution would still exist if it were not for the influence, spoken or unspoken, of the Queen. Needless to say we will never be told. | | The Queen and Peter Fisher Observer 8 April 2007 The attorney general, while trying to justify the secrecy of Charles' letters, said \"It is a matter of the highest importance within our constitutional framework that the Monarch is a politically neutral figure\". Questions about health policy are undoubtedly political, and the highly partisan interventions of the prince in the political process make his behaviour unconstitutional. They endanger the monarchy itself. Whether that matters depends on how much you value tradition and how much you value the tourist business generated by the Gilbert & Sullivan flummery at which royals excel. The least that one can ask of the royal family is that they should not endanger the health of the nation. If I wanted to know the winner of the 2.30 at Ascot, I'd ask a royal. For any question concerning science or medicine I'd ask someone with more education. Here is some more interesting reading Michael Baum's \" [An open letter to the Prince of Wales](http://dcscience.net/?p=645#baum): with respect, your highness, you've got it wrong\" Gerald Weissman's essay [Homeopathy: Holmes, Hogwarts, and the Prince of Wales](http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/full/20/11/1755).

But there is one exception: the information they provide about alternative medicine is poor. A Freedom of Information Act request has revealed that the attempt of NHS Choices to rewrite their pages more accurately was censored by the Department of Health in conjunction with the late Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. The Department of Health (DH) has misled the public. The earliest version of the homeopathy information page recorded by the Wayback Machine was [November 12 2007](http://web.archive.org/web/20071112004009/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Homeopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx?url=Pages/What-is-it.aspx).

The \"useful links\" still has six links to flat-earth organisations like the Society of Homeopaths, and only one to a sensible source, the [excellent pamphlet](http://www.senseaboutscience.org/data/files/resources/54/Homeopathy.pdf) from Sense about Science. They do link at the end to the [2010 Science and Technology Committee Report: Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy (PDF, 1.61Mb)](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/45/45.pdf), and to the [Government Response to the Science and Technology Committee Report, Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy (PDF, 69kb)](http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/@ps/documents/digitalasset/dh_117811.pdf) but no comment is made on the findings. Policy-based evidence I wondered why the NHS Choices page, after an absence of almost two years, had returned in such an unsatisfactory form. So I asked them. After a reminder, I was told that my queries were being dealt with not by NHS Choices, but had been referred to Dr Sunjai Gupta \"the DH official with responsibility for this area\". [Dr Sunjai Gupta OBE](http://sites.idea.gov.uk/localinsight/2011/03/09/dr-sunjai-gupta-obe/) is Deputy Director of Public Health Strategy and Social Marketing, Department of Health. Dr Gupta is not obviously sympathetic to woo. It's hard to tell since he doesn't seem to have published much. But one is not reassured by an article that he wrote for the [Journal of Holistic Healthcare](http://www.bhma.org/pages/journal/6.2-detail.php?searchresult=1&sstring=Gupta#inline1). It appears straight after an article by fantasy herbalist, [Simon Mills](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5360). Despite assurances that I'd hear from Dr Gupta shortly, nothing happened. So I sent a request for the correspondence under the Freedom of Information Act (2000). Although the request was addressed to NHS Choices, a public body, strenuous efforts were made to divert it to the Department of Health. These were resisted. Nevertheless when, after a long delay, the material arrived, it came not from NHS Choices, but from DH, who had evidently vetted it,. The emails were rather shocking [ [download all](/NHS-choices-emails-AppendixA-(redacted).pdf)]. A mail dated 1 December 2009 said This is the most direct statement I've seen that, in the Department of Health, policy dictates evidence. NHS Choices is meant to provide evidence, but what they say has to be checked by DH to make sure they \"don't clash with any policy messages\". The re-written page The original version of the re-written page was sent to me by David Mattin, who worked for NHS Choices until September 2012. You can [download the whole draft](/Homeopathy-first-draft-for-upload-a.pdf) here. It is an enormous improvement on the original page. For example, it says | | \"Does it work? Many independent experts would respond to this question 'no, homeopathy does not work' There is no good quality clinical evidence to show that homeopathy is more successful than placebo in the treatment of any type of condition. Furthermore, if the principles of homeopath were true it would violate all the existing theories of science that we make use of today; not just our theory of medicine, but also chemistry, biology and physics. This original draft was sent to Mattin on 29 January 2010. After editing it for length Mattin sent it to DH for approval. Over the next two years, DH removed much of the accurate content. Mattin's own comments on this evisceration are reproduced [below](#mattin). The DH emails All the names have been redacted. Needless to say, nobody is willing to take responsibility. But the number of people who support magic medicine is really quite small so the main players were easy to identify. During the nearly 2 year absence of the homeopathy page, dozens of changes were made by DH. It seems that the policy message with which the NHS Choices draft failed to comply were those of the [Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Prince%27s+Foundation+for+Integrated+Health%22), and its [successor](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3023) (after April 2010), the [College of Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), now known as the [ College of Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632). NHS Choices sought advice about their redrafted pages from the right person, [Sir Iain Chalmers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Chalmers), one of the founders of the [Cochrane Collaboration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration). On 3 Nov 2009, Chalmers advised | | The most reliable source in the country - and one of the most reliable in the world - is Professor Edzard Ernst, professor of Complementary Medicine at the Peninsular Medical School, Ernst returned his suggestions in July 2010, but it seems that few of them survived the subsequent 18 months of revisions by DH. On 2 December 2009, a mail from the NHS headquarters (Quarry House, Leeds) was sent to NHS Choices This makes it perfectly clear that DH regards the Prince's Foundation, and the equally flaky [Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC: known on the web as Ofquack)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3311) as appropriate guides for public health policy. The fact of the matter is that regulation of magic medicine by the government has [been a total disaster](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5562), because, it seems, DH regards the Prince of Wales as a reliable source. On 29 December 2009, the Prince's Foundation went on the attack. On 10th January 2010, two more letters were sent to DH by the Prince's Foundation. At 13.48 they wrote And at 22.14 on the same day, it was followed up with The references to Devon and to Thought Field Therapy, make it very obvious that these letters were written by [Dr Michael Dixon OBE](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466#dixon), who was medical director of the Prince's Foundation, and who is now a director of the \"College of Medicine\". And the object of Dixon's bile is obviously Edzard Ernst (the quotation is from his book, [Trick or Treatment](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#singh)). I find it fascinating to see just how venomous quacks become when the evidence contradicts their views. The cuddly \"holistic\" veneer quickly vanishes. It gets worse. On 21 January 2010, a mail from NHS Choices to DH said The only person in the country who fits this description is the (in)famous [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22George+Lewith%22). It is simply mind-boggling that DH regards him as an appropriate person to advise on anything. After that, NHS Choices kept asking DH to sign off the documents, and changes continued to be made. Almost two years later, DH were still stalling. The admission that \"We are a bit short of doctors within DH these days\" is interesting. A bit short of anyone capable of critical thinking would be more accurate. The most interesting document that I got from DH was an intermediate draft of the rewritten page on homeopathy (undated). [Download the document](/NHS-Choices-hoemopathy-draft.pdf). Here are a couple of extracts. It's a story of two years of meddling and procrastination. The end result misinforms the public. Right at the start, the NHS Choices draft says, reasonably enough A House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report said that homeopathic remedies perform no better than placebos and that the principles on which homeopathv is based are \"scientifically implausible\". But a comment, added apparently by DH, says Can we remove this statement? This report is really quite contentious and we may well be subject to quite a lot of challenge from the Homeopathic community if published. What on earth? The DH seems to think that that its job is not to present the evidence, but to avoid challenges from the homeopathic community! And true enough, this piece is missing from the final version. A bit later, the NHS Choices draft was censored again \"A 2010 Science and Technology Committee report said that scientific tests had shown that homeopathic treatments don't work\" But again this doesn't appear in the final version. The comment, apparently from DH, says \"The DH response to this report (point 24) doesn't support this statement though\" That's a gross distortion of [point 24](http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/@ps/documents/digitalasset/dh_117811.pdf), which actually concludes \"The Government Chief Scientific Adviser cannot envisage scientifically credible proposals for funding for research into homeopathy in the future\" NHS Choices was not happy with the result Shortly before the revised page was published, Paul Nuki, Editor in Chief of NHS Choicea, sent an email to DH. | | Date: 7th September 2011 Time: 3:33:42 pm Hi I've been through the CAM articles and asked that we publish them asap as requested. For the record, we will be publishing these pieces outside of the normal editorial process. Although originally signed off by a suitably qualified clinician, the time lapse and policy changes have been so substantial as to render that null and void. We also don't have a formal It doesn't need much reading between the lines to see that he was unhappy with the result. It will be interesting to see whether the [Information Standard](http://www.rsph.org.uk/en/products-and-services/Certification/rsph-certification-and-the-information-standard/index.cfm) people at the Royal Society for Public Health do anything about it. The Department of Health has not just ignored evidence but actively opposed it. That's the only possible conclusion from the documents that I was sent. And it's pretty shocking that the DH has preferred advice from the Prince's Foundation and its handful of acolytes (in particular Michael Dixon and George Lewith) to the findings of the Science and Technology Select Committee and the views of the Chief Scientific Advisor. In January this year, the Chief medical Officer, [ Dame Sally Davies, said](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9822744/Homeopathy-is-rubbish-says-chief-medical-officer.html), in a rare outburst of candour | | 'I'm very concerned when homeopathic practitioners try to peddle this way of life to prevent malaria or other infectious disease,\" she said. \"I am perpetually surprised that homeopathy is available on the NHS.\" Dame Sally, who is England's most senior doctor, concluded by remarking that homeopathy \"is rubbish\". | | So one part of DH is working to contradict another part. the Chief Medical Officer. Perhaps Sally Davies should have a word with Dr Gupta. This all predates the advent of Jeremy Hunt (and known defender of homeopathy) as health minister. But the sympathies of some DH people are made obvious by the presence on the [ DH web site of an article](http://www.personalhealthbudgets.dh.gov.uk/Topics/latest/Resource/?cid=8167&excludepageid=2289) \"Personal health budgets: A new way of accessing complementary therapies?\". This astonishing piece confirms the worst fears that quacks will see personal health budgets as a commercial opportunity to peddle their wares. The article is by Jim Rogers of Lincoln University. What his paper does not mention is Rogers' conflict of interest. He's a homeopath, and he has a paper in the International Journal of High Dilution Research (yes, there is a journal for every form of make-believe). You can [download a reprint](/Rogers-paper-IJHDR,_9,32_(_2010)_JRogers.pdf) of this paper. It advocates more research into homeopathic provings, something that even George Lewith [seems to have given up on](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3695). It's about time that the DH started to listen to the Chief Medical Officer. As it is, some people at DH seem to prefer the advice of the Prince's Foundation, and to actively suppress employees who prefer evidence to anecdote. One thing is clear. The DH is an unholy mess. Parts of it are intent on producing policy-based evidence. Comment by David Mattin, who edited the first draft for NHS Choices David Mattin left NHS Choices in September, 2012. He edited the new version and lived through the two years of wrangling with DH during which much of the best content was eviscerated. He sent me this statement about the affair. | | As an editor at NHS Choices, I viewed it as my job to present evidence-based information to the public. The article we prepared on homeopathy stayed true to that central purpose: it made clear to readers that there is no good quality evidence that homeopathy is an effective treatment for any health condition, and also presented the broad scientific consensus that the supposed method of action of homeopathy is implausible. What followed was a two year story of delay, and eventual suppression, of that article. My strong impression was of DH civil servants who lacked the courage, and, frankly, the energy to stand up to the criticism from special interest groups that they anticipated would arise because of the article; and that did indeed arise when a draft of the article and other draft content on complementary and alternative medicines fell into the hands of the Prince's Foundation and other CAM groups. The attitude of DH civil servants, broadly, was simply to tell us 'we can't say this about homeopathy, people will complain'. They seemed to have no interest in making an appraisal of the evidence on homeopathy themselves to see if what we were saying was actually true or not. We repeatedly pushed back with the message: 'some people may very well complain, but if what we are saying about the evidence base is true - and it is - then we must simply weather those complaints, and stand by our content. Our duty is to supply our readers with the best information, not to please the homeopathy community.' But these arguments were disregarded. The DH civil servants were almost entirely concerned with the politics of the situation - that is, the politics as they saw them - and the possibility that this article may create new work for them, and very little concerned with the evidence itself, or the presentation of this evidence to the public. The whole episode is an insight into the way special interest groups can influence the workings of government and the public sector simply by making a lot of noise, and having a few powerful friends. In causing NHS Choices to publish content that is less than completely frank about the evidence on homeopathy, the DH have compromised the editorial standards of a website that they themselves established, and that they fund. They have sold out the NHS Choices editorial team, who work tirelessly to fulfil their remit. And, most seriously, they have failed the general public, by putting special interests, politics, and the path of least resistance (as they saw it) before the truth about health and healthcare. Follow-up 13 February 2013 The Guardian version of this story, written by Sarah Boseley, is [Prince's charity lobbied government to water down homeopathy criticism](http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2013/feb/13/prince-charity-lobbied-government-homeopathy). It's fine as far as it goes but it doesn't name any names. There are some good comments though. 14 February 2013. The printed Guardian gave the story full 5 column-width coverage. [ [download print version](/Guardian-DeptHealth140213.pdf)] And news has reached the USA: there's an account of the affair on the Neurologica blog: [Politics trumping science at the NHS](http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/politics-trumping-science-at-the-nhs/). On 14 February, the Guardian version was Editor's Choice by lunchtime, and the Guardian web version already had 414 comments, mostly sensible (though this blog got far more referrals from twitter than from the Guardian) And news has reached the USA: there's an account of the affair on the Neurologica blog: [Politics trumping science at the NHS](http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/politics-trumping-science-at-the-nhs/). 15 February 2013. The Daily Mail had very fair coverage of the story. The Guardian closed the comments on the story when it had got 642 comments, most of them very sensible. And this page got almost 6000 hits in 24 hours. The majority of the referrals came from Twitter rather than from the Guardian, despite the direct link to the page from the Guardian. 18 February 2013. The affair featured in BMJ News [ [download the reprint](/DH-homeop-bmj-news-2013.pdf)]. The item featured prominently on the BMJ news page. 19 February 2013 Only six days of this post, the [NHS Choices page](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/homeopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx?a=1) has been re-written again, in a much improved form. That looks like bloggers 1, DH 0. It is baffling that it's left to bloggers, working for nothing, to extract a bit of sense from the highly-paid civil servants at the Department of Health. But at least they listened this time, which is a lot more than happens often. Paul Nuki, who runs NHS Choices, deserves congratulations. Of course the revised page still doesn't call a spade a spade, but it gets close at times. I like the way it starts \"Homeopathy is a 'treatment' based\". Notice the quotation marks. Reputation management? Incidentally, NHS Choices is outsourced to the [(in)famous company, Capita](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5295). And the moderation of the comments on their site is outsourced again to [Tempero](http://tempero.co.uk/), which describes itself as a \"reputation management\" company. Each of them creams off money meant of patient care. This discovery might explain why I and others have had comments rejected by NHS Choices several times. \"Reputation management\" is the antithesis of evidence. It is public relations, i.e. paid lying. That is quite wrong for a site that is meant to provide dispassionate information. 21 February 2013. Sadly a step backwards. Part of the improved page was removed. This bit. The Chief Medical Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, has said there is no scientifically plausible way that homeopathy can prevent or cure diseases. She has made it clear she is particularly concerned about the use of homeopathy in developing countries as a so-called cure for malaria. We can only speculate why this was removed, because it was true. In fact she accurately described homeopathy as \"rubbish\". Why she should not be quoted beats me. The Scottish Universities Medical Journal asked me to write about the regulation of alternative medicine. It's an interesting topic and not easy to follow because of the veritable maze of more than twenty overlapping regulators and quangos which fail utterly to protect the public against health fraud. In fact they mostly promote health fraud. The paper is [now published](http://sumj.dundee.ac.uk/data/uploads/epub-article/016-sumj.epub.pdf), and here is a version with embedded links (and some small updates). We are witnessing an increasing commercialisation of medicine. It's really taken off since the passage of the Health and Social Security Bill into law. Not only does that mean having NHS hospitals run by private companies, but it means that \"any qualified provider\" can bid for just about any service. The problem lies, of course, in what you consider \"qualified\" to mean. Any qualified homeopath or herbalist will, no doubt, be eligible. University College London Hospital advertised for a spiritual healer. The \"person specification\" specified a \"quallfication\", but only HR people think that a paper qualification means that spiritual healing is anything but a delusion. The vocabulary of bait and switch First, a bit of vocabulary. Alternative medicine is a term that is used for medical treatments that don't work (or at least haven't been shown to work). If they worked, they'd be called \"medicine\". The anti-malarial, artemesinin, came originally from a Chinese herb, but once it had been purified and properly tested, it was no longer alternative. But the word alternative is not favoured by quacks. They prefer their nostrums to be described as \"complementary\" -it sounds more respectable. So CAM (complementary and alternative medicine became the politically-correct euphemism. Now it has gone a stage further, and the euphemism in vogue with quacks at the moment is \"integrated\" or \"integrative\" medicine. That means, very often, integrating things that don't work with things that do. But it sounds fashionable. In reality it is designed to confuse politicians who ask for, say, integrated services for old people. Put another way, the salespeople of quackery have become rather good at bait and switch. The wikepedia definition is as good as any. Bait-and-switch is a form of fraud, most commonly used in retail sales but also applicable to other contexts. First, customers are \"baited\" by advertising for a product or service at a low price; second, the customers discover that the advertised good is not available and are \"switched\" to a costlier product. As applied to the alternative medicine industry, the bait is usually in the form of some nice touchy-feely stuff which barely mentions the mystical nonsense. But when you've bought into it you get the whole panoply of nonsense. Steven Novella has [written eloquently](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/the-bait-and-switch-of-unscientific-medicine/) about the use of bait and switch in the USA to sell chiropractic, acupuncture, homeopathy and herbal medicine: \"The bait is that CAM offers legitimate alternatives, the switch is that it primarily promotes treatments that don't work or are at best untested and highly implausible.\". The \"College of Medicine\" provides a near-perfect example of bait and switch. It is the direct successor of the Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health. The Prince's Foundation was a consistent purveyor of dangerous medical myths. When it collapsed in 2010 because of a financial scandal, a company was formed called \"The College for Integrated Health\". [A slide show](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), not meant for public consumption, said \"The College represents a new strategy to take forward the vision of HRH Prince Charles\". But it seems that too many people have now tumbled to the idea that \"integrated\", in this context, means barmpottery. Within less than a month, the new institution was renamed \"The College of Medicine\". That might be a deceptive name, but it's a much better bait. That's why I described the College as a [fraud and delusion](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632). Not only did the directors, all of them quacks, devise a respectable sounding name, but they also succeeded in recruiting some respectable-sounding people to act as figureheads for the new organisation. The president of the College is Professor Sir Graham Catto, emeritus professor of medicine at the University of Aberdeen. Names like his make the bait sound even more plausible. He claims not to believe that homeopathy works, but seems quite happy to have a homeopathic pharmacist, Christine Glover, on the [governing council of his college](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council). At least half of the governing Council can safely be classified as quacks. So the bait is clear. What about the switch? The first thing to notice is that the whole outfit is skewed towards private medicine: see [ The College of Medicine is in the pocket of Crapita Capita](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5295). The founder, and presumably the main provider of funds (they won't say how much) is the huge outsourcing company, Capita. This is company known in Private Eye as Crapita. Their inefficiency is legendary. They are the folks who messed up the NHS computer system and the courts computer system. After swallowing large amounts of taxpayers' money, they failed to deliver anything that worked. Their latest failure is the [court translation service](http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/mar/02/interpreters-courts-protest-privatised-contract).. The president (Catto), the vice president (Harry Brunjes) and the CEO (Mark Ratnarajah) are all employees of Capita. The second thing to notice is that their conferences and courses are a bizarre mixture of real medicine and pure quackery. Their 2012 conference had some very good speakers, but then it had [ a \"herbal workshop\" with Simon Mills](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5360) (see a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=lGhp0PNHVnc)) and David Peters (the man who tolerates [dowsing as a way to diagnose](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4541) which herb to give you). The other speaker was Dick Middleton, who represents the huge herbal company, Schwabe (I debated with him [on BBC Breakfast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3RZ6K0Ng0c&feature=player_embedded)), In fact the College's [Faculty of Self-care](/COM-Self-care.pdf) appears to resemble a marketing device for Schwabe. Why regulation isn't working, and can't work There are various levels of regulation. The \"highest\" level is the statutory regulation of osteopathy and chiropractic. The General Chiropractic Council (GCC) has exactly the same legal status as the General Medical Council (GMC). This ludicrous state of affairs arose because nobody in John Major's government had enough scientific knowledge to realise that chiropractic, and some parts of osteopathy, are pure quackery, The problem is that organisations like the GCC function more to promote chiropractic than to regulate them. This became very obvious when the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) decided to sue Simon Singh for defamation, after he described some of their treatments as [\"bogus\", \"without a jot of evidence\"](http://jackofkent.blogspot.co.uk/2010/02/good-day-in-court.html). In order to support Singh, several bloggers assessed the \"plethora of evidence\" which the BCA said could be used to justify their claims. When, 15 months later, the BCA produced its \"plethora\" it was shown within 24 hours that the evidence was pathetic. The demolition was summarised by lawyer, David Allen Green, in [The BCA's Worst Day](http://jackofkent.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/bcas-worst-day-yet.html). In the wake of this, over 600 complaints were made to the GCC about unjustified claims made by chiropractors, thanks in large part to heroic work by two people, [Simon Perry](http://adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/500-chiropractors-reported-to-trading.html) and [Allan Henness](http://www.zenosblog.com/2009/06/omnibus-complaint-to-the-general-chiropractic-council/). Simon Perry's [Fishbarrel](http://adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/fishbarrel-easy-way-to-report.html) (browser plugin) allows complaints to be made quickly and easily -try it). The majority of these complaints were rejected by the GCC, apparently on the grounds that chiropractors could not be blamed because the false claims had been endorsed by the GCC itself. My own complaint was based on phone calls to two chiropractors, [I was told](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1542) such nonsense as \"colic is down to, er um, faulty movement patterns in the spine\". But my complaint never reached the Conduct and Competence committee because it had been judged by a preliminary investigating committee that there was no case to answer. The impression one got from this (very costly) exercise was that the GCC was there to protect chiropractors, not to protect the public. The outcome was a disaster for chiropractors, wno emerged totally discredited. It was also a disaster for the GCC which was forced to admit that it hadn't properly advised chiropractors about what they could and couldn't claim. The recantation culminated in the [GCC declaring, in August 2010](http://www.gcc-uk.org/files/link_file/Guidance_on_claims_made_for_the_chiropractic_VSC_18August10.pdf), that the mythical \"subluxation\" is a \"historical concept \" \"It is not supported by any clinical research evidence that would allow claims to be made that it is the cause of disease.\". Subluxation was a product of the fevered imagination of the founder of the chiropractic cult, D.D. Palmer. It referred to an imaginary spinal lesion that he claimed to be the cause of most diseases. .Since 'subluxation' is the only thing that's distinguished chiropractic from any other sort of manipulation, the admission by the GCC that it does not exist, after a century of pretending that it does, is quite an admission. The President of the BCA himself [admitted in November 2011](http://chiropracticreport.com/portal/images/back_issues/No_%206%20-%20Nov%202011.pdf) \"The BCA sued Simon Singh personally for libel. In doing so, the BCA began one of the darkest periods in its history; one that was ultimately to cost it financially,\" As a result of all this, the deficiencies of chiropractic, and the deficiencies of its regulator were revealed, and advertisements for chiropractic are somewhat less misleading. But this change for the better was brought about entirely by the unpaid efforts of bloggers and a few journalists, and not at all by the official regulator, the GCC. which was part of the problem. not the solution. And it was certainly not helped by the organisation that is meant to regulate the GCC, the Council for Health Regulatory Excellence (CHRE) which did nothing whatsoever to stop the farce. At the other end of the regulatory spectrum, voluntary self-regulation, is an even worse farce than the GCC. They all have grand sounding \"Codes of Practice\" which, in practice, the ignore totally. The Society of Homeopaths is just a joke. When homeopaths were caught out recommending [sugar pills for prevention of malaria](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2855), they did nothing (arguably such homicidal advice deserves a [jail sentence](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1661)). The Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) is widely know in the blogosphere as Ofquack. I know about them from the inside, having [been a member of](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3311) their Conduct and Competence Committee, It was set up with the help of a \u00a3900,000 grant from the Department of Health to the Prince of Wales, to oversee voluntary self-regulation. It fails utterly to do anything useful.. The CNHC code of practice, paragraph 15 , states \"Any advertising you undertake in relation to your professional activities must be accurate. Advertisements must not be misleading, false, unfair or exaggerated\". When [Simon Perry made a complaint](http://adventuresinnonsense.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/cnhc-wishes-to-place-on-formal-record_27.html) to the CNHC about claims being made by a CNHC-registered reflexologist, the Investigating Committee upheld all 15 complaints. But it then went on to say that there was no case to answer because the unjustified claims were what the person had been taught, and were made in good faith. This is precisely the ludicrous situation which will occur again and again if reflexologists (and many other alternative therapies) are \"accredited\". The CNHC said, correctly, that the reflexologist had been taught things that were not true, but then did nothing whatsoever about it apart from toning down the advertisements a bit. They still register reflexologists who make outrageously false claims. Once again we see that no sensible regulation is possible for subjects that are pure make-believe. The first two examples deal (or rather, fail to deal) with regulation of outright quackery. But there are dozens of other quangos that sound a lot more respectable. European Food Standards Agency (EFSA). One of the common scams is to have have your favourite quack treatment classified as a food not as a medicine. The laws about what you can claim have been a lot laxer for foods. But the EFSA has done a pretty good job in stopping unjustified claims for health benefits from foods. Dozens of claims made by makers of probiotics have been banned. The food industry, needless to say, objects very strongly to be being forced to tell the truth. In my view, the ESFA has not gone far enough. They recently [issued a directive](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:136:FULL:EN:PDF) about claims that could legally be made. Some of these betray the previously high standards of the EFSA. For example you are allowed to say that \"Vitamin C contributes to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue\" (as long as the product contains above a specified amount of Vitamin C. I'm not aware of any trials that show vitamin C has the slightest effect on tiredness or fatigue, Although these laws do not come into effect until December 2012, they have already been [invoked by the ASA](http://www.asa.org.uk/ASA-action/Adjudications/2012/6/Natures-Best-Health-Products-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_179089.aspx) has a reason not to uphold a complaint about a multivitamin pill which claimed that it \"Includes 8 nutrients that can contribute to the reduction in tiredness and fatigue\" The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). This is almost the only organisation that has done a good job on false health claims. Their [Guidance on Health Therapies & Evidence](http://www.asa.org.uk/Resource-Centre/Hot-Topics/~/media/Files/ASA/Misc/Guidance%20on%20Health%20Therapies%20and%20Evidence%20QA%20%28Sept%202011%29.ashx) says \"Whether you use the words 'treatment', 'treat' or 'cure', all are likely to be seen by members of the public as claims to alleviate effectively a condition or symptom.

The ASA's [Guidance for Advertisers of Homeopathic Services](http://www.asa.org.uk/Resource-Centre/Hot-Topics/~/media/Files/CAP/CAP/Guidance%20for%20Advertisers%20of%20Homeopathic%20Services%20September%20%28Sept%202011%29.ashx) is wonderful. \"In the simplest terms, you should avoid using efficacy claims, whether implied or direct,\" \"To date, the ASA has have not seen persuasive evidence to support claims that homeopathy can treat, cure or relieve specific conditions or symptoms.\" That seems to condemn the (mis) [labelling allowed by the MHRA](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=28) as breaking the rules.. Sadly, though, the ASA has no powers to enforce its decisions and [only too often they are ignored](http://www.asa.org.uk/~/media/Files/ASA/Misc/3rd%20Letter%20to%20Homeopathy%20Adv%203.ashx). The [Nightingale collaboration](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/) has produced an [excellent letter](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/images/stories/POS_advertising_of_homeopathic_products.pdf) that you can hand to any pharmacist who breaks the rules The ASA has also [judged against claims](http://nightingale-collaboration.org/news/111-working-within-the-qcranial-paradigmq.html) made by \"Craniosacral therapists\" (that's the lunatic fringe of osteopathy). They will presumably uphold complaints about [similar claims](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4213) made (I'm ashamed to say) by UCLH Hospitals. The private examination company Edexcel sets [exams in antiscientific subjects](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=454), so miseducating children. The teaching of quackery to 16 year-olds has been approved by a maze of quangos, none of which will take responsibility, or justify their actions. So far [ I've located no fewer than eight](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=454) of them. The Office of the Qualifications and Examinations Regulator (OfQual), Edexcel, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), Skills for Health, Skills for Care, National Occupational Standards (NOS), private exam company VTCT and the schools inspectorate, Ofsted.. Asking any of these people why they approve of examinations in imaginary subjects meets with blank incomprehension. They fail totally to protect tha public from utter nonsense. The Department of Education has failed to do anything about the miseducation of children in quackery. In fact it has encouraged it by, for the first time, giving taxpayers' money to a Steiner (Waldorf) school (at Frome, in Somerset). Steiner schools are run by a secretive and cult-like body of people ( [read about it](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Steiner+Waldorf)). They teach about reincarnation, karma, gnomes, and all manner of nonsense, sometimes with unpleasant racial overtones. The [teachers are trained ](http://www.james-gray.org/heavenly-beings-and-astral-forces/)in Steiner's Anthroposophy, so if your child gets ill at school they'll probably get homeopathic sugar pills. They might well get measles or mumps too, since Steiner people don't believe in vaccination. Incredibly, the University of Aberdeen came perilously close to appointing a [chair in anthroposophical medicine.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5261) This disaster was aborted [by bloggers](http://www.james-gray.org/heavenly-beings-and-astral-forces/), and a last minute intervention [from journalists](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5261). Neither the university's regulatory mechanisms. nor any others, seemed to realise that a chair in [mystical barmpottery](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3528) was a bad idea. Trading Standards offices and the Office of Fair Trading. It is the statutory duty of Trading Standards to enforce the Consumer Protection Regulations (2008) This European legislation is pretty good. it caused a lawyer to write \" [Has The UK Quietly Outlawed \"Alternative\" Medicine?\". ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=790) Unfortunately Trading Standards people have consistently refused to enforce these laws. The whole organisation is a mess. Its local office arrangement fails totally to deal with the age of the internet. The situation is so bad that a group of us decided to put them to the test. The results were published in the Medico-Legal Journal, Rose et al., 2012. [\"Spurious Claims for Health-care Products](http://www.dcscience.net/Rose-medico-legal-2012.pdf): An Experimental Approach to Evaluating Current UK Legislation and its Implementation\". They concluded \"EU directive 2005/29/EC is largely ineffective in preventing misleading health claims for consumer products in the UK\" Skills for Health is an enormous quango which produces HR style \"competences\" for everything under the son. They are mostly quite useless. But those concerned with alternative medicine are not just useless. [They are positively harmful.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=215'#sfh) Totally barmy. There are competences and National Occupational Standards for every lunatic made-up therapy under the sun. When I phoned them to discover who'd written them, I learned that the had been drafted by the Prince of Wales' Foundation for Magic Medicine. And when I joked by asking if they had a competence for talking to trees, I was told, perfectly seriously, \"You'd have to talk to LANTRA, the land-based organisation for that.\" That was in January 2008. A lot of correspondence with the head of Skills for Health got nowhere at all. She understood nothing and it hasn't improved a jot. This organisation costs a lot of taxpayers' money and it should have been consigned to the \"bonfire of the quangos\" (but of course there was no such bonfire in reality). It is a disgrace. The Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) is supposed to ensure the quality of university courses. In fact it endorses courses in nonsense alternative medicine and so does more harm than good. The worst recent failure of the QAA was in the case of the University of Wales: see [Scandal of the University of Wales and the Quality Assurance Agency](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3675). The university was making money by validating thousands of external degrees in everything from fundamentalist theology to Chinese Medicine. These validations were revealed as [utterly incompetent](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259) by bloggers, and later by BBC Wales journalist Ciaran Jenkins (now working for Channel 4). The mainstream media eventually caught up with bloggers. In 2010, BBC1 TV (Wales) produced an excellent TV programme that [exposed the enormous degree validation scam](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3675) run by the University of Wales. The programme can be seen on YouTube ( [Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ix4HTi9LWE), and [Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG2kBeDer-0)). The programme also exposed, incidentally, the uselessness of the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) which did nothing until the scam was exposed by TV and blogs. Eventually the QAA sent nine people to Malaysia to investigate a dodgy college that had been revealed by the BBC. The trip cost \u00a391,000. It could have been done for nothing if anyone at the QAA knew how to use Google. The outcome was that the University of Wales stopped endorsing external courses, and it was soon shut down altogether (though bafflingly, its vice-chancellor, Marc Clement was promoted). The credit for this lies entirely with bloggers and the BBC. The QAA did nothing to help until the very last moment. Throughout this saga Universities UK (UUK), has maintained its usual total passivity. They have [done nothing whatsoever](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=42) about their members who give BSc degrees in anti-scientific subjects. (UUK used to known as the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals). Council for Health Regulatory Excellence (CHRE), soon to become the PSAHSC, Back now to the CHRE, the people who failed so signally to sort out the GCC. They are being reorganised. Their [consultation document](http://www.chre.org.uk/_img/pics/library/120416_-_standards_for_consultation_-_PDF.pdf) says \"The Health and Social Care Act 20122 confers a new function on the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (the renamed Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence). From November 2012 we will set standards for organisations that hold voluntary registers for people working in health and social care occupations and we will accredit the register if they meet those standards. It will then be known as an 'Accredited Register'. \" They are trying to decide what the criteria should be for \"accreditation\" of a regulatory body. The [list of those interested](http://www.chre.org.uk/voluntaryregisters/421/) has some perfectly respectable organisations, like the [British Psychological Society](http://www.bps.org.uk/). It also contains a large number of crackpot organisations, like [Crystal and Healing International, as well as joke regulators like the CNHC](http://crystalandhealinginternational.co.uk). They already oversee the Health Professions Council (HPC) which is [due to take over Herbal medicine ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4117)and Traditional Chinese Medicine, with predictably disastrous consequences. Two of the proposed criteria for \"accreditation\" appear to be directly contradictory. Para 2.5 makes the whole accreditation pointless from the point of view of patients 2.5 It will not be an endorsement of the therapeutic validity or effectiveness of any particular discipline or treatment. Since the only thing that matters to the patient is whether the therapy works (and is safe), accrediting of organisations that ignore this will merely give the appearance of official approval of crystal healing etc etc. This appears to contradict directly A.7 The organisation can demonstrate that there either is a sound knowledge base underpinning the profession or it is developing one and makes that explicit to the public. A \"sound knowledge base\", if it is to mean anything useful at all, means knowledge that the treatment is effective. If it doesn't mean that, what does it mean? It seems that the official mind has still not grasped the obvious fact that there can be no sensible regulation of subjects that are untrue nonsense. If it is nonsense, the only form of regulation that makes any sense is the law. Please fill in the consultation. My completed return [can be downloaded](CHRE-consultation.docx) as an example, if you wish. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) should be a top level defender of truth. Its strapline is \"We enhance and safeguard the health of the public by ensuring that medicines and medical devices work and are acceptably safe.\" The MHRA did something (they won't tell me exactly what) about one of the [most cruel scams that I've ever encountered, Esperanza Homeopathic Neuropeptide](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/05/29/the-esperanza-scandal-office-of-trading-standards-useless-mhra-a-bit-better/), peddled for multiple sclerosis, at an outrageous price ( \u00a36,759 for 12 month's supply). Needless to say there was not a jot of evidence that it worked (and it wasn't actually homeopathic). Astoundingly, Trading Standards officers refused to do anything about it. The MHRA admit (when pushed really hard) that there is precious little evidence that any of the herbs work, and that homeopathy is nothing more than sugar pills. Their answer to that is to forget that bit about \"ensuring that medicines ... work\" Here's the MHRA's [Traditional Herbal Registration Certificate](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/par/documents/websiteresources/con134892.pdf) for devils claw tablets. The wording \"based on traditional use only\" has to be included because of European legislation. Shockingly, the MHRA have allowed them to relegate that to small print, with all the emphasis on the alleged indications. The pro-CAM agency NCCAM rates devil's claw as \"possibly effective\" or \"insufficient evidence\" for all these indications, but that doesn't matter because the MHRA requires no evidence whatsoever that the tablets do anything. They should, of course, added a statement to this effect to the label. They have failed in their duty to protect and inform the public by allowing this labelling. But it gets worse. Here is the MHRA's [homeopathic marketing authorisation for the homeopathic medicinal product Arnicare Arnica 30c pillules](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/par/documents/websiteresources/con049307.pdf) It is nothing short of surreal. | || | Since the pills contain nothing at all, they don't have the slightest effect on sprains, muscular aches or bruising. The wording on the label is exceedingly misleading. If you \"pregnant or breastfeeding\" there is no need to waste you doctor's time before swallowing a few sugar pills. \"Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one\". Since the pills contain nothing, it doesn't matter a damn. \"If you overdose . . \" it won't have the slightest effect because there is nothing in them And it gets worse. The MHRA-approved label specifies ACTIVE INGREDIENT. Each pillule contains 30c Arnica Montana No, they contain no arnica whatsoever. | || | It truly boggles the mind that men with dark suits and lots of letters after their names have sat for hours only to produce dishonest and misleading labels like these. When [this mislabeling](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=28) was first allowed, it was condemned by [just about every scientific society](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=30), but the MHRA did nothing. The Nightingale Collaboration. This is an excellent organisation, set up by two very smart skeptics, Alan Henness and Maria MacLachlan. [Visit their site](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/) regularly, sign up for their newsletter Help with their campaigns. Make a difference. Conclusions The regulation of alternative medicine in the UK is a farce. It is utterly ineffective in preventing deception of patients. Such improvements as have occurred have resulted from the activity of bloggers, and sometime the mainstream media. All the official regulators have, to varying extents, made things worse. The CHRE proposals promise to make matters still worse by offering \"accreditation\" to organisations that promote nonsensical quackery. None of the official regulators seem to be able to grasp the obvious fact that is impossible to have any sensible regulation of people who promote nonsensical untruths. One gets the impression that politicians are more concerned to protect the homeopathic (etc, etc) industry than they are to protect patients. Deception by advocates of alternative medicine harms patients. There are adequate laws that make such deception illegal, but they are not being enforced. The CHRE and its successor should restrict themselves to real medicine. The money that they spend on pseudo-regulation of quacks should be transferred to the MHRA or a reformed Trading Standards organisation so they can afford to investigate and prosecute breaches of the law. That is the only form of regulation that makes sense. Follow-up The shocking case of the continuing sale of \"homeopathic vaccines\" for meningitis, rubella, pertussis etc was highlighted in an [excellent TV programme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZf9mUzI4RI) by BBC South West. The failure of the MHRA and the GPC do take any effective action is a yet another illustration of the failure of regulators to do their job. I have to agree with Andy Lewis when [he concludes](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2013/01/why-does-the-mhra-not-close-down-these-homeopaths.html) \"Children will die. And the fault must lie with Professor Sir Kent Woods, chairman of the regulator.\" Although many university [courses in quackery have now closed](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4900), two subjects that hang on in a few places are western herbalism, and traditional Chinese medicine (including acupuncture). The University of Westminster still runs [Chinese medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4683), and [Western herbal medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4361) (with [dowsing](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4541)). So do the [University of Middlesex](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923) and University of East London. Since the passing of the Health and Social Security Act, these people have been busy with their customary bait and switch tactics, trying to get taxpayers' money. It's worth looking again at the nonsense these people talk. Take for example, the well known herbalist, [Simon Mills](http://www.plant-medicine.com/cvs/SYMcv.htm). At one time he was associated with the University of Exeter, but no longer. Perhaps his views are too weird even for their [Third Gap](http://www.pcmd.ac.uk/research/index.php?page=1&group=17) section (the folks who so [ misrepresented their results](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4439) in a trial of acupuncture). Unsurprisingly, he was involved in the late Prince's Foundation for Magic Medicine, and, unsurprisingly, he is involved with its successor, the \" [College of Medicine](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/search/node/Simon%20Mills)\", where [he spoke](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/human-experiences-herbal-medicines) along similar lines. You can get a good idea about his views from [the video of a talk](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6720250368336924437) that he gave at Schumacher College in 2005. It's rather long, and exceedingly uncritical, so here's a shorter version to which some helpful captions have been added. That talk is weird by any standards. He says, apparently with a straight face, that \"all modern medicines are cold in the third degree\"..And with ginger and cinnamon \"You can stop a cold, generally speaking, in its tracks\" (at 21 30\" in the video). This is simply not true, but he says it, despite the fact that the [Plant Medicine](http://www.plant-medicine.com/) with site (of which he's a director) which he is associated [gives them low ratings](http://www.plant-medicine.com/freepages/find-herbs.asp?symptom2=cold,%20common) Simon Mills is also a director of [SustainCare](http://www.sustaincare.net/company.htm). Their web site says SustainCare Community Interest Company is a social enterprise set up to return health care to its owners: \"learning to look after ourselves and our families in ways that make sense and do not cost the earth\". It is founded on the principle that one's health is a personal story, and that illness is best managed when we make our health care our own. The enterprise brings clinical expertise, long experience of academia, education and business, and the connections and resources to deliver new approaches. \"As its own social enterprise contribution to this project Sustaincare set up and supported Caf\u00e9 Sustain as a demonstration Intelligent Waiting Room at Culm Valley Integrated Centre for Health in Devon\". (yes, that's Michael Dixon, again] In the talk (see video) Mills appears to want to take medicine back to how it was 1900 years ago, in the time of Galen. The oblique speaking style is fascinating. He never quite admits that he thinks all that nonsense is true, but presumably it is how he treats patients. Yet a person with these bizarre pre-scientific ideas is thought appropriate to advise the MHRA It's characteristic of herbalists that they have a very long list of conditions for which each herb is said to be good. The sort of things said by Mills differ little from the 1900-year old ideas of Galen, io the 17th century ideas of Culpepper. You can see some of the latter in my oldest book, Blagrave's supplement to Culpepper's famous herbal, published in 1674. See what he has to say about daffodils It is \"under the dominion of Mars, and the roots hereof are hot and dry almost in the third degree\". \"The root, boyled in [posset drink], and drunk, causeth vomiting, and is used with good successe in the beginning of [Agues], especially [Tertians], which frequently rage in the spring-time: a plaister made of the roots with parched Barley meal, and applied to swellings and [imposthumes]do dissolve them; the juice mingled with hony, frankincense, wine and myrrhe, and dropped into the Eares, is good against the corrupt filth and running matter of the Eares; the roots made hollow and boyled in oyl doth help [Kib'd heels [or] [here] the root is good for [Morphew], and discolourings of the skin.\" It seems that daffodils would do a lot in 1674. Even herbalists don't seem to use it much now. A recent [herbal site describes](http://medicineherbs.net/medicinal-herbs/daffodil) daffodil as \"poisonous\". But the descriptions are very like those used by present day herbalists, as you can hear in Simon Mills' talk. Chinese medicine is even less tested than western herbs. Not a single Chinese herb has been shown to be useful for treating anything (though in a very few case, they have been found to contain drugs that are useful when purified, notably the anti-malarial compound, artemesinin). They are often contaminated, some are dangerously toxic. And they [contribute to the extinction of tigers and rhinoceros](http://www.dcscience.net/pittilo-consultation-response.pdf) because of the silly myths that these make useful medicines. The cruelty of bear bile farming is legendary. In a recent [report in China Daily](http://www.google.com/url?sa=X&q=http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-06/08/content_15489946.htm&ct=ga&cad=CAcQAhgAIAAoATABOAFAjtvJ_gRIAVAAWABiAmVu&cd=ZA4JQyP9VeE&usg=AFQjCNEfqSqaUnGuh7mjZkKTM_uFXyDz1w) (my emphasis). In a congratulation letter, Vice-Premier Li Keqiang called for integration of TCM and Western medicine. TCM, as a time-honored treasure of Chinese civilization, has contributed to the prosperity of China and brought impacts to world civilization, Li said. He also urged medical workers to combine the merits of TCM with contemporary medicine to better facilitate the ongoing healthcare reform in China. The trade in Chinese medicines survives only for two reasons. One is that thay are a useful tool for promoting Chinese nationalism. The other is that they are big business. Both are evident in the vice-premier's statement. I presume that it's the business bit that is the reason why London South Bank University (ranked 114 ou ot 114) that led to one of their main lecture theatres being decorated with pictures like this.\"Mr Li Changchun awarding 2010 Confucius Institute of the year to LSBU Vice Chancellor\" . I'll bet Mr Li Changchun uses real medicine himself, as most Chinese who can afford it do. Presumably, what's taught in their Confucius Institute is the same sort of [dangerous make-believe nonsense](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043).that's taught on other such courses. The \"College of Medicine\" run a classical bait and switch operation. Their \" [First Thursday lectures](http://members.collegeofmedicine.eu/courses)\" have several good respectable speakers, but then they have Andrew Flower, He is \"a former president of the Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine, a medical herbalist and acupuncturist. He has recently completed a PhD exploring the role of Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of endometriosis\". He's associated with the [Avicenna Centre for Chinese Medicine](http://www.avicenna.co.uk/practitioners/andrew-flower/), and with the [University of Southampton's quack division](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/details.php?id=4) The only bit of research I could find by Andrew Flower was a Cochrane review, [Chinese herbal medicine for endometriosis](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006568.pub3/abstract). The main results tell us \"Two Chinese RCTs involving 158 women were included in this review. Both these trials described adequate methodology. Neither trial compared CHM with placebo treatment.\" But the plain language summary says \"This review suggests that Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) may be useful in relieving endometriosis-related pain with fewer side effects than experienced with conventional treatment.\" It sounds to me as though people as partisan as the authors of this should not be allowed to write Cochrane reviews. Flower's talk is followed by one from the notorious representative of the herbal industry, [ Michael McIntyre](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4269#follow), talking on [Herbal medicine: A major resource for the 21st century](http://members.collegeofmedicine.eu/courses/firstthursdayherbal?dm_i=PC7,U1NI,3PB5TI,2GPNL,1). That's likely to be about as objective as if they'd invited a GSK drug rep to talk about SSRIs. The people at Kings College London Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences are most certainly not quacks. They have made a database of chemicals found in traditional Chinese medicine. It's sold by a US company, [Chem-TCM](http://www.chemtcm.com/) and it's very expensive (Commercial license: $3,740.00. Academic/government license: $1,850.00). Not much open access there. It's a good idea to look at chemicals of plant origin, but only as long as you don't get sucked into the myths. It's only too easy to fall for the bait and switch of quacks (like TCM salespeople). The sample page shows good chemical and botanical information, and predicted (not observed) pharmacological activity. More bizarrely, it shows also analysis of the actions claimed by TCM people. It does seem odd to me to apply sophisticated classification methods to things that are mostly myth. The multiple uses claimed for Chinese medicines are very like the make-believe claims made for western herbs by Galen, Culpepper and (with much less excuse) by Mills. They are almost all untrue, but their proponents are good salesmen. Don't let them get a foot in your door. Follow-up 10 June 2012. No sooner did this post go public when I can across what must be one of the worst herbal scams ever: \" [Arthroplex](http://josephinejones.wordpress.com/2012/05/29/arthroplex-instant-relief-for-the-wallet/)\" 31 July 2012. Coffee is the subject of another entry in the 1674 edition of Blagrave. Blagrave evidently had a lower regard for coffee than I have. \"But being pounded and baked, as do it to make the Coffee-liquor with, it then stinks most loathsomly, which is an argument of some Saturnine quality in it.\" \"But there is no mention of an medicinal use thereof, by any Author either Antient of Modern\" Blagrave says also \"But this I of UCL's History department \"that the bodies of the English that indulge in this liquor to such an extent seem to degenerate into the nature of barbarians\" My boss, Lucia Sivolotti got something very like that herself. Be very impressed. Salway suggested that clearer Latin would have been \"quod on to Blagrave, but I can't find his email address. I much prefer Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi's aphorism (often misattributed to Paul Erd\u00f6s) \"A mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems\" Much has been written on this blog about [Dr Michael Dixon](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Michael+Dixon%22), and about the \" [College of Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22College+of+Medicine%22)\", which is the direct inheritor of the mantle of the late, unlamented, Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. At the time of the foundation of the College it was [stated that](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263) \"The College represents a new strategy to take forward the vision of HRH Prince Charles\". Michael Dixon has also been chairman of the NHS Alliance since 1998. That was one of very few organisations to support Andrew Lansley's Health Bill. No doubt [he will be happy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5295) for Crapita Capita to supply alternative nonsense at public expense. Dr Dixon took offence to a review in The Times of Mark Henderson's new book, The Geek Manifesto. . The [review, by David Aaronovitch](http://journalisted.com/article/3olf4), said, apropos of the [1023 campaign](http://www.1023.org.uk/), \" . . .there was now, almost for the first time, a group of people who were not content to see claims made for discredited treatments without making everyone aware of the science that disproved those claims. And second, what they were doing had implications for public policy.\" and \"The geeks represent, for me, one of the most encouraging recent developments in British public life.\" This excellent review evidently upset Dr Dixon, because on 20th May, his letter appeared in the Times. | | David Aaronovitch is right to argue for a robust scientific approach in medicine. However, he is not being logical or scientific when he says that if something is suspected to be placebo then it has no benefit and the NHS should not pay for it. What about scientific research on remedies that many believe to be placebo? These frequently show that there is a benefit but this is confined to those who believe in the treatment given. Surely, in such cases, it would be logical to say that the treatment was beneficial albeit in a specific group of \"believers\". From there, it would be good science to compare the safety costs of this supposed placebo remedy with its currently given alternative before deciding whether \"believers\" should be able to receive such a remedy on the NHS. The problem here is that belief and mindset play an enormous part in healing - science needs to take account of this. Patients' symptoms are frequently metaphors and effective treatment can often be symbolic and culturally dependent. The mind, in the right circumstances, can produce its own healing chemicals often mimicking those given in conventional medicine. Until science can explain healing in psychosocial as well as biomedical language, we must be cautious about \"voting for the geeks\" as Mr Aaronovitch suggests. It is far better surely that individual treatment should be tailored, within reason, to the patient and their beliefs and perspectives. Further more, might it not be wiser to direct NHS resources according to pragmatic trials of cost effectiveness and safety rather than a limited interpretation of science that excludes the effect of the mind? Dr Michael Dixon Chair of Council College of Medicine. This letter seemed remarkable to me. It is very close to being an admission that alternative medicine is largely placebo. It called for a reply. We have been here before. Many people have discussed the dubious ethics of deceiving patients by giving placebos while pretending they are no such thing. There is wide agreement that it is not only unethical, but also unnecessary. Kevin Smith has written [a scholarly essay](http://www.dcscience.net/Smith-response.pdf) on the topic. Edzard Ernst wrote [Mind over matter?](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103080345/http://www.arc.org.uk/news/arthritistoday/131_1.asp) Margaret McCartney, the Glasgow GP, and author of The Patient Paradox, has [explained it](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=1071). Some views of Dr Dixon's approach are less flattering than mine. For example, from the USA, Steven Novella's [Dr. Michael Dixon - \"A Pyromaniac In a Field of (Integrative) Straw Men\"](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/dr-michael-dixon-a-pyromaniac-in-a-field-of-integrative-straw-men/). And, Majikthyse, [Michael Dixon caught red-handed!](http://majikthyse.wordpress.com/2008/10/01/michael-dixon-caught-red-handed/), and Dr Aust's [Dr Michael Dixon is annoyed](http://draust.wordpress.com/2010/03/10/dr-michael-dixon-is-annoyed/). The list is almost endless. .Two replies were published in the Times on 26 May (and they were the lead letters -bold print). One from the excellent Evan Harris, and one from me. Here they are as text. | | Sir, Dr Michael Dixon's letter (May 21) is fascinating. He is, of course, a well-known advocate of alternative medicine. Yet he seems now to believe that much alternative medicine is just a placebo. That's something the geeks have been saying for years, and he appears, at last, to have accepted it. That being the case, it follows that we have to ask whether placebos produce useful benefits, and whether it is ethical to prescribe them. Nobody denies the existence of placebo effects. But recent research has shown that they are usually both small and transient. Often they are not big enough to provide a useful degree of relief. For example, a recent paper on acupuncture in the British Journal of General Practice showed that it had a remarkably small placebo effect. And placebos have no effect at all on the course of cancer or infectious diseases. There has been an admirable movement in medicine for doctors to be open and honest with patients. Prescribing of medicines that contain no active ingredient involves lying to patients. That is old-fashioned and unethical. It is fair to ask why so many people seem to believe in alternative medicine, if even their placebo effects are small. The answer seems to lie in the \"get better anyway\" effect (known to geeks as regression to the mean). Most of the conditions for which placebos seem to work are things that wax and wane naturally. You take the \"cure\" when you are at your worst, and next day you are better. You would have been better anyway, but it's hard to avoid attributing the improvement to whatever you took. That is why alternative medicine is advertised largely on the basis of anecdotal testimonials. And it is doubtless why Dr Dixon advocates \"pragmatic\" trials: that's a euphemism for trials without a proper control group. Psychosocial problems may indeed be very important for some patients. But deceiving such patients with dummy pills is not the proper way to deal with their problems. D. Colquhoun, FRS Professor of Pharmacology, University College London Sir, Dr Michael Dixon argues that the NHS should fund placebo treatments such as homeopathy (though he stops short of agreeing that homeopathy is a placebo) on the basis that they can offer limited help to those who \"believe\" in them. It is no part of modern ethical medical practice to deceive patients into thinking \u2014 or failing to disabuse them of the belief \u2014 that an inert substance or ineffective medicine has beneficial effects. This can not be justified by the hope \u2014 or even expectation \u2014 of deriving for that patient the limited psychologically based improvement in symptoms that may follow from the deployment of the placebo. Pedlars of homeopathy for profit in the private sector will, alas, always seek to fool people into believing the hocus pocus of \"memory of water\" and the effects of infinite dilution and a lot of bottle-shaking. But doctors have responsibilities not to deceive their patients, even out of a paternalistic wish to assist them to manage their symptoms; and public policy demands that the NHS spends its resources only on treatments that work without deception in a cost-effective way. Dr Evan Harris Oxford Follow-up The College of Medicine is [well known to be the reincarnation](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263) of the late unlamented Prince of Wales Foundation for Integrated Health. I labelled it as a [Fraud and Delusion](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632), but that was perhaps over-generous. It seems to be morphing into a major operator in the destruction of the National Health Service through its close associations with the private health industry. Their [2012 Conference](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/annual-conference-2012) was held on 3rd May. It has a mixture of speakers, some quite sound, some outright quacks. It's a typical bait and switch event. You can judge its quality by the fact that the picture at the top of the page that advertises the conference shows Christine Glover, a homeopathic pharmacist who makes a living by selling sugar pills to sick people (and a Trustee of the College of Medicine). Her own [company's web site says](http://www.glovers-health.co.uk/) | | The approaches are, of course, based on sugar pills. The claim is untrue and dangerous. My name for that is fraud. | | When the \"College of Medicine\" started it was a company, but on January 30th 2012, it was [converted to being a charity](http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/PrintReport.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1145676&ReportType=COLOUR). But the Trustees of the charity are the same people as the directors of the company. They are all advocates of ineffective quack medicine. The contact is named as Linda Leung, who was Operations Director of the Prince's Foundation until it closed, and then became Company Secretary for the \"College of Medicine\". The trustees of the charity are the same people who were directors of the company - Dr Michael Dixon, general practitioner.

The involvement of Capita According to [their web site](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/who-we-are) \"A Founder of the College of Medicine is Capita.\" Still more amazingly, the CEO of the College of Medicine is actually an employee of Capita too. \"Mark Ratnarajah is interim CEO of the College of Medicine as well as Business Director at Capita Health and Wellbeing.\" | || | That isn't the end of it. The vice-president of the College of Medicine is It has to be said that he doesn't sound like a man with much interest in the National Health Service.. Within 9 years of graduating he set up in private practice in Harley Street. Five years later he set up [Premier Medical](http://www.premiermedicalgroup.com/), which, after swallowing a couple of rivals, he sold to Capita for \u00a360 million. He is now recorded in a [Companies House document](/capita-health-holdings.pdf) as Dr Henry Otto Brunjes, a director of Capita Health Holdings Limited. This company owns all the shares in Capita Health and Wellbeing Limited, and it is, in turn, owned by Capita Business Services Limited. And they are owned by Capita Holdings Limited. I do hope that this baroquely complicated array of companies with no employees has nothing to do with tax avoidance. Capita is, of course, a company with a huge interest in the privatisation of health care. It also has a pretty appalling record for ripping off the taxpayer. It has long been known [ in Private Eye](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Eye), as \"Crapita\" and \"the world's worst outsourcing firm\". Capita were responsible for of the multimillion pound failed/delayed IT project for the NHS and HMRC. They messed up on staff administration services at Leicester Hospitals NHS Trust and the BBC where staff details were lost. They failed to provide sufficient computing systems for the Criminal Records Bureau, which caused lengthy delays. Capita were also involved in the failure of the Individual Learning Accounts following a \u00a360M over-spend. And most recently, they have caused the near collapse of court translation services after their acquisition of Applied Language Services. With allies like that, perhaps the College of Medicine hardly needs enemies. No doubt Capita will be happy to provide the public with quackery for an enormous fee from the taxpayer. | || | One shouldn't be surprised that the College is involved in Andrew Lansley's attempts to privatise healthcare. One would have thought that such a close association with a company with huge vested interests would not be compatible with charitable status. I've asked the Charity Commission about that. The Charity commission, sadly, makes no judgements about the worthiness of the objects of the charities it endorses. All sorts of dangerous quack organisations are registered charities, like, for example, [Yes to Life](http://www.yestolife.org.uk/). Secrecy at the College of Medicine One of the big problems about the privatisation of medicine and education is that you can't use the Freedom of Information Act to discover what they are up to. A few private companies try to abide by that act, despite not being obliged to do so. But the College of Medicine is not one of them. Capita They refuse to disclose anything about their relationship with Capita. I asked I asked Graeme Catto, who is a friend (despite the fact that I think he's wrong). I got nothing. \"Critical appraisal\" I also asked Catto for the teaching materials used on a course that they ran about \"critical appraisal\". Any university is obliged, by the decision of the Information Tribunal, to produce such material on request. The College of Medicine refused, point blank. What, one wonders, have they got to hide? Their refusal strikes me as deeply unethical. The course (costing \u00a3100) on Critical Appraisal, ran on February 2nd 2012. The aims are \"To develop introductory skills in the critical appraisal of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews (SRs)\". That sounds good. Have they had a change of heart about testing treatments? But, as always, you have to look at who is running the course. Is it perhaps a statistician with expertise in clinical trials? Or is it a clinician with experience in running trials? There are plenty of people with this sort of expertise. But no, It is being run by a pharmacist, [Karen Pilkington](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/directory/pilkington,-karen), from that hotbed of unscientific medicine, the University of Westminster. Pilkington originally joined the University of Westminster as manager for a 4-year project to review the evidence on complementary therapies (funded by the Department of Health). All of her current activities centre round alternative medicine and most of her publications are in journals that are dedicated to alternative medicine. She teaches \"Critical Appraisal\" at Westminster too, so I should soon have the teaching materials, despite the College's attempts to conceal them. Three people who ought to know better Ore has to admire, however grudgingly, the way that the quacks who run the College of Medicine have managed to enlist the support of several people who really should know better. I suppose they have been duped by that most irritating characteristic of quacks, the tendency to pretend they have the monopoly on empathetic treatment of patients. We all agree that empathy is good, but every good doctor has it. One problem seems to be that senior medical people are not very good at using Google. They don't do their homework. | || | Professor Sir Graeme Catto MD DSc FRCP FMedSci FRSE is FBA, FKC, FUCL, Hon.DSc(Glasgow), Hon.FRCP is vice-president of the College. Among many other things he is Emeritus Professor of Health Law, Ethics and Policy at University College London.

He's undoubtedly a well-meaning man, but so focussed on his (excellent) homelessness project that he seems immune to the company he keeps. Perhaps the clue lies in the fact that when I asked him what he thought of Lansely's health bill, he seemed to quite like it. It seems to me to be incomprehensible that these three people should be willing to sign a [letter in the British Medical Journal](/bmj-CoM-letters-2011.pdf) in defence of the College, with co-signatories George Lewith (about whom much has been written here) and the homeopath Christine Glover. In so doing, they betray medicine, they betray reason, and most important of all, they betray patients. Perhaps they have spent too much time sitting on very important committees and not enough time with patients. The stated aims of the College sound good. \"A force that combines scientific knowledge, clinical expertise and the patient's own perspective. A force that will re-define what good medicine means renewing the traditional values of service, commitment and compassion and creating a more holistic, patient-centred, preventative approach to healthcare.\" But what they propose to do about it is, with a few exceptions, bad. They try to whip up panic by exaggerating the crisis in the NHS. There are problems of course, but they result largely from under-funding (we still spend less on healthcare than most developed countries), and from the progressive involvement of for-profit commercial companies, like Capita. The College has the wrong diagnosis and the wrong solution. How do they propose to take care of an aging population? Self-care and herbal medicines seem to be their solution. | | The | | It seems that the College of Medicine are aiding and abetting the destruction of the National Health Service.

[Use Firefox if embedded videos do not show in Chrome] Andrew Lansley's Health Bill (HASSB) aims to change the NHS into something more like the US system, which gives worse results at twice the cost. The only possible reason for wanting to do that is simple far-right ideology. No wonder that no hint was given of its intentions before the election. On the contrary, David Cameron stated repeatedly that there would be no top-down reorganisation of the NHS. That turned out to be a straight lie. \"First let me tell you what we are not going to do. There will be no more of those pointless reorganisations that aim for change, but instead bring chaos.\" [David Cameron speaking to Royal College of Nursing in 2009, before election]. We all know that money must be saved. But the two major disasters of the coalition government don't save any money. On the contrary, both tuition fees and NHS-wrecking will cost taxpayers' money. The tuition fees are done (for the time being) but there is still time to save the NHS. The best simple explanation that I've found is by Dr Max Pemberton in the Telegraph: [Read this - and prepare to fight for your NHS](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/9106880/Read-this-and-prepare-to-fight-for-your-NHS.html). The Bill is three times longer than the 1946 Bill that brought the NHS into existence. \"The power to determine the services that make up the NHS will be transferred from the Secretary of State to newly created Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), which are unelected. Members will include GPs but also company chief executives who can, if they wish, outsource decisions about the appropriate level of services offered to companies with commercial interests. This is what the Government means when it says it is handing GPs \u00a360 billion of NHS money. \" \"Monitor. This quango is composed of unelected and unaccountable individuals. It will not have overarching responsibility - which the Government does currently - to ensure that everyone's health needs are met.\" \"It will have the power to decide, on purely financial grounds, if an area loses its existing range of hospital services, such as A&E departments, with no duty to consider alternative provision. \"With so many different providers of health care created under this Bill, those with complex health care needs may not receive the joined-up medical care that the NHS now works hard to provide.\" \"Less profitable patients - those requiring complex levels of care from multiple individuals and areas of expertise, for example - may be sidelined by these private companies. \" \"the Bill allows CCGs to contract out commissioning functions to private accountancy, health insurance and management consultant firms, which will be able to decide what care is provided free at the point of use through the NHS and what is not. This means that profit-making companies will be able to provide your clinical care and also decide what you're entitled to under the NHS and from which care providers.\" \"There is the potential for commercial conflicts when the needs of shareholders come between doctors and patients. \" \"Providers, too, can reduce levels of service provision and entitlement to NHS-funded care and there are no restrictions on charging for non-NHS care.\" \"Now, up to 49 per cent of income can be generated from private income. This means that almost half the beds currently used for NHS care could be given over to private patients.\" \"This could create a two-tier system in hospitals\" and \"create a conflict of interest, with hospitals having a clear incentive to encourage as many patients as possible to use the private half of their facilities. Moreover, hospitals can decide when to discharge patients. The requirement for coordinated discharge and aftercare of patients between health and social care is abolished in the Bill. \" Why is the bill needed at all? Most people believe that there is no need for a bill. The real aim appears to be in part 3, which proposes a vast increase in private providers. [Oliver Huitson says](http://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/oliver-huitson/nhs-still-on-road-to-privatisation) \"A [US report comparing]the health services of 7 major economies ranked the NHS 1st in terms of efficiency, and 2nd overall. The US, which has vast private sector involvement and much greater use of GP commissioning, was ranked last despite spending more than twice as much per head as the UK\" \" Despite being ranked as one of the most efficient and equitable health services in the developed world, the Conservatives are determined to remodel it in the image of one of the least efficient - all in the name of \"improving efficiency\".\" Although most GPs are in favour of having more say in what happens, even the first parts of the bill are a mess. They are advertised as reducing bureaucracy and reducing costs. According to [ the Financial Times](http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2011/08/organograms-show-nhs-becoming-even-more-complex/#axzz1l1XR4ufQ), they do exactly the opposite. \"Here was the original NHS bureaucracy in graphic form\" Here is the new NHS bureaucracy in graphic form Ed Miliband [pointed out](http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2011/06/uncomfortable-pmqs-for-both-leaders-over-health-quangos-and-strikes/#axzz1U3rlO6n6) that the number of NHS statutory organisations was growing from 163 to 521 - networks\", \"clinical senates\" and so on. So much for reduced bureaucracy. Who thinks this is not a good idea? Almost everyone. Not just the BMA which Lansley dismisses as a Trade Union, despite the fact that now (unlike in 1948) the BMA is voting against the financial interests of its members. The Royal College of General Practitioners says Drop the Bill. So do Royal College of Nursing. Royal College of Midwives, Faculty of Public Health, Chartered Society of Physiotherapists, the Patients' Association, among others. Almost the only support left is from the NHS Alliance, a tiny organisation run by [Michael Dixon](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466#dixon), friend of the Prince of Wales and advocate of quack medicine. The NHS alliance ran its own poll. A total of 100 people have voted so far, 99 of them against the Alliance's policy. Some support.

It now has over 167,000 signatories. But despite the fact that petitions with over 100,000 signatures are meant to trigger a debate in the House of Commons, the backbench business committee of MPs has decided not to debate the e-petition.

If you feel reassured by Lansley's assurances that his measures aren't de facto privatisation, just watch this video. It reveals some of the network of lobby groups that are circling the NHS, eager to take your money. For example, the lobby group, Policy Exchange, \"Cameron's favourite\", co-founded by Francis Maude, a member of Cameron's cabinet, and is lobbying for more private sector provision of NHS services. One of the companies that it's taken money from is called Tribal, which wants to take over commissioning from GPs. One of the directors of Tribal has described Andrew Lansley's reforms as being \"denationalisation of health services in England\". So you don't need to listen to left-wingers. The industry itself is in no doubt that it's privatisation, and it's ready and waiting to grab our money.. And of all unlikely allies, the vice chair of the British Holistic Medical Association has written [a powerful letter](http://www.bhma.org/media/blog%20and%20news/Privatisation_of_the_NHS_Feb2012.pdf) about how the bill really would result in privatisation. The likely consequences have been put well by Ben Goldacre in his [What will happen with the NHS bill, in 5 tweets.](http://bengoldacre.posterous.com/what-will-happen-with-the-nhs-bill-in-5-tweet) The following points are based partly on this. - GPs know they're being set up to fail by being given commissioning powers, which they have neither the time nor the expertise to do properly. - After GPs fail, private commissioning expertise will be needed. Large private companies will be given the job and they will come to operate like health insurers. - These large bodies, like public/private insurance companies, will be able to pick and choose patients. They will naturally prefer the ones from whom they can make the most money (and not the sick or the old). Note that there is no geographical responsibility in the bill - Small differences will gradually emerge in what services they offer. Top up plans will become available. And that will be the end of the NHS in the form in which we know it. The only way that the proposals make any sense at all is if the underlying aim is to destroy the NHS, in anything like its present form. I believe that Lansley's aims are much more to do with his personal political ideologies than anything to do with health. Those ideologies are far to the right of anything envisaged by Margaret Thatcher. The politics. Where are the Lib Dems? I voted Lib Dem in 2010, and [I said precisely why](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3000). Of course I didn't expect they'd get a majority. They were just the party that I found least objectionable. Like so many others I watched with horror as the numbers came out. There was no other option but to form a coalition with Conservatives. Well, I'd have been happier with no coalition, but the danger of that producing an overall majority for Conservatives after a year or so made that a very risky option. When the coalition formed I was alarmed by the prospects for both education and for the NHS. I was less alarmed by the latter, because Cameron had said so many times that he had no intention of messing with the NHS. That turned out to be a direct lie. I could scarcely believe it when Lansley produced a plan after the election for the biggest reorganisation ever in the NHS, something that had not been foreshadowed in any way in the Conservative manifesto. This was one of the most dishonest bits of political manoeuvring that I've ever encountered. Clearly we were spending more than we could afford. What's unforgivable is to do things that actually cost the taxpayer more than before. Such actions are quite the opposite of cuts. Yet they are being done in the two areas, than any others, that have got Lib Dem voters angry. (a) The \u00a39k tuition fees cost the taxpayer more than the \u00a33k fees did, because of the financing arrangements. I can see no conceivable reason for spending more taxpayers' money than before apart from (Conservative) political ideology. That's done (for now) so back to the main topic of this post, the NHS. (b) It seems inevitable that Lansley's proposals will cost money, not save money. Presumably that was predicted in the risk register, the concealment of which is a disgrace. See [Liberal Conspiracy ](http://liberalconspiracy.org/2012/02/04/releasing-lansleys-risk-register-is-key-to-saving-the-nhs/)and the [Green Benches](http://eoin-clarke.blogspot.com/2012/02/andrew-lansley-covers-up-nhs-report.html) blogs. The Information Commissioner ordered the release of the risk register, but the coalition refused (so much for transparent government). They appealed so now it goes to an Information Tribunal. An [Early Day Motion](http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2010-12/2659) in the House of Commons urged release. It was signed by only 16 Lib Dems. The bill started to fall apart in a major way when, on February 6th, The Times [reported that](http://politicalscrapbook.net/2012/02/andrew-lansley-shot-rachel-sylvester/) \"Andrew Lansley should be taken out and shot,\" says a Downing Street source. \"He's messed up both the communication and the substance of the policy.\" But Cameron, instead of grasping the chance, decided to back a loser. Some Lib Dems have stuck to their principles. For example John Pugh MP, Co-Chair of the Lib Dem Parliamentary Health Committee, re-established the [Beveridge group, and ](http://www.beveridgegroup.org.uk/) [wrote a letter](http://www.beveridgegroup.org.uk/docs/letter.htm) [ to parliamentarians to explain why.](http://www.beveridgegroup.org.uk/) Andrew George MP wrote [Health Bill has no friends. Dignified withdrawal would be best](http://andrewgeorge.org.uk/featured-articles/health-bill-has-no-friends-dignified-withdrawal-would-be-best/). On 13 February, hearts soared when Lib Dem peer [Shirley Williams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Williams) spoke out at last. [She urged Lansley](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/feb/13/shirley-williams-andrew-lansley-nhs-competition-clauses) to drop part 3 of the bill, the part that deals with privatisation. The elation didn't last long though. Nick Clegg told the BBC: \"Andrew Lansley is the architect of the NHS bill. He cares passionately about the NHS. He's the right man for the job and he must see it through.\". Yes, I know about Cabinet solidarity, but it's hard to think of any surer way to lose elections than to make statements like that. Even many Conservatives don't believe it: see, for example, [Dr Rachel Joyce](http://conservativehome.blogs.com/platform/2012/02/dr-rachel-joyce-why-are-doctors-nurses-and-midwives-so-opposed-to-the-nhs-reforms-and-what-should-be.html) on Conservative Home. On 24th February, the Lib Dem president, Tim Farron MP, [spoke up at last](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17156756). \"Mr Farron told ITV the bill should have been \"massively changed\" or dropped earlier and he wanted plans for more competition in the NHS to be dropped\". On 26 February, Nigel Crisp, described the bill as a [confusing mess that risks setting the NHS back](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17169519). Crisp was formerly NHS chief executive and the permanent secretary at the Department of Health from 2000 to 2006, and is now a crossbench peer. Like everyone else, he was ignored. The elation about Shirley Williams intervention didn't last long. On 27th February a [joint letter from Williams and Clegg](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/feb/27/letter-nick-clegg-shirley-williams) claimed that they'd fixed the bill. The letter was quickly subjected to a [bullshitometer analysis, by Health Policy Insight. ](http://www.healthpolicyinsight.com/?q=node/1350) Bafflingly, Lansley declared in public that he'd \"changed his mind\" about the privatisation, while at the same time Lansley and Cameron claimed that nothing much had changed: see [Downing Street in knots as it plays down Nick Clegg's NHS concessions](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/wintour-and-watt/2012/feb/27/nickclegg-davidcameron), and [Paul Corrigan's blog](http://www.pauldcorrigan.com/Blog/conservative-party/question-when-is-an-amendment-to-the-health-and-social-care-bill-both-insignificant-and-important-at-the-same-time/comment-page-1/#comment-85397). March 1st saw two more blows for Clegg and Lansley. First, as reported thus in [the Independent.](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/yellow-rebels-take-on-clegg-over-nhs-betrayal-7469060.html) \"Graham Winyard, the former deputy Chief Medical Officer, resigned from the party in protest at the leadership's backing for the Bill. Dr Winyard, who was chairman of Winchester Liberal Democrats until last year, told Mr Clegg in a letter: \"It is just not sensible to impose this top-down reorganisation on an NHS struggling to meet the biggest financial challenge in its history. To continue to do so in the face of near unanimous opposition from patient, staff and professional organisations simply invites slow motion disaster both for the NHS and for the party.\" He said that he had no option but to resign \"with great sadness\". \" Then, also on 1st March, Dr Laurence Buckman, chairman of the BMA's GPs committee, wrote to 22,000 GPs.

New Year's day seems like a good time to assess how far we've got, five years on. At the beginning of 2007 [UCAS](http://www.ucas.com/) (the universities central admission service) offered 45 different BSc degrees in quackery, at 16 universities. Now there are only 24 such degrees. If you exclude chiropractic and osteopathy, which all run at private colleges, with some sort of \"validation\" from a university, there are now only 18 BSc/MSc courses being offered in eight universities. Degrees in homeopathy, naturopathy and \"nutritional therapy\", reflexology and aromatherapy have vanished altogether from UCAS. In the race to provide BScs in anti-science, Middlesex University has now overhauled the long-standing leader, Westminster, by a short head. | | Michael Driscoll, vice-chancellor of Middlesex | | Let's see what's gone. The University of Central Lancashire (UCLAN) was the first to see sense. In August 2008 they [announced closure of their \"BSc\" degree in homeopathy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=249). On September 2008 they announced [ an internal review ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=252)of their courses in homeopathy. herbalism and acupuncture. The report of this review [closed down all of them in July 2009.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899) I first asked for their teaching materials in July 2006. I finally got them in December 2010, after winning an appeal to [the Information Commissioner](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1364), and then winning an appeal against that decision at an [ Information tribunal](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2485) . By the time I got them, the course had been closed for over two years. That is just as well, because it turned out that UCLAN's students were [being taught dangerous nonsense](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2628). No wonder they tried so hard to conceal it. Salford University was the next to go. They [shut down their courses](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885) in complementary medicine, homeopathy and acupuncture. In January 2009 they announced \" they are no longer considered \"a sound academic fit\" \". Shortly afterwards. a [letter appeared in The Times](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=984) from three heavyweights (plus me) congratulating the vice-chancellor on his decision. University of Westminster For many years, Westminster was the biggest supplier of BSc degrees in quackery. At the beginning of 2007 they offered 14 different BSc degrees in homeopathy, naturopathy, nutritional therapy, \"complementary therapies\", (western) herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine with acupuncture. Some of their courses were so bizarre that some of the students and even staff sent me slides which taught things like \"amethysts emit high Yin energy\". Like UCLAN, Westminster also [held an internal review](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=984). Unlike UCLAN it came to the absurd conclusion that all would be well if they injected more science into the courses. The incompetence of the review meant that those who wrote it hadn't noticed that if you try to put science into homeopathy or naturopathy, the whole subject vanishes in a puff of smoke. Nevertheless Westminster closed down entry to BSc homeopathy in March 2009 (though the subject remained as part of other courses). Three years after the [Nature article](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19), all five BSc homeopathy degrees had shut their doors. During 2011, Westminster shut down Naturopathy, Nutritional therapy, Therapeutic bodywork and Complementary Medicine. See, for example, [More dangerous nonsense from the University of Westminster: when will Professor Geoffrey Petts do something about it?](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4361) [Professor Geoffrey Petts of the University of Westminster says they \"are not teaching pseudo-science\". The facts show this is not true](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4683) [University of Westminster shuts down naturopathy, nutritional therapy, but keeps Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4704) Now Westminster has only four courses in two subjects. They still teach some dangerous and untrue things, but I suspect the writing is on the wall for these too. I have seen a document, dated 11 April 2011, which states \"The following courses have been identified as 'at risk' (School definition) and will be discussed at the APRG and University Review Group2, due to poor recruitment and high cost of delivery: Integrated Health Scheme: BSc BSc Herbal Medicine\" All but Chinese medicine and Herbal medicine have already gone. Almost there. University of Wales Since my first [post in 2008](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259) about the validation scam operated by the University of Wales, and some good investigations by BBC Wales TV, the outcome was the most spectacular so far. The entire [institution collapsed](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education-news/2011/12/29/can-education-heed-the-lessons-of-2011-91466-30025844/).

[Another worthless validation: the University of Wales and nutritional therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259) (October 2008) This is a 'degree' in nutrtional therapy. It is even more hilarious than usual, but it passed the validation anyway. [Scandal of the University of Wales and the Quality Assurance Agency](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3675) (November 2010).

[The University of Wales disgraced (but its vice chancellor is promoted)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4766) (October, 2011) The eventual collapse of the university was well-deserved. But it is very weird that the people who were responsible for it have still got their jobs. In fact the vice-chancellor, Marc Clement, was promoted despite his mendacious claim to be unaware of what was going on. It remains to be seen how many of the many quack courses that were validated by the University of Wales will be taken on by other universities. The McTimoney College of Chiropractic is owned by BPP University (so much for their quality control, as [explained in Private Eye](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4422)). but still claims to be validated by Wales until 2017. Some of the more minor players Edinburgh Napier University. After an FOI request (rejected), Napier closed their herbal medicine degree in 2010. [Hot and cold herbal nonsense from Napier University Edinburgh: another course shuts.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3200) (June 2010) As expected, the Scottish Information Commissioner agreed with that for England and Wales and ordered material to be sent.

Chiropractic Surprisingly, given the total discreditation of chiropractic in the wake of the Simon Singh affair, and the internecine warfare that followed it, none of the chiropractic courses have shut yet. Some are clearly in trouble, so watch this space. Osteopathy has also had no course closures since 2007. Like chiropractic it also suffers from internecine warfare. The General Osteopathic Council refuses to disown the utter nonsense of \"craniosacral\" osteopathy. But the more sensible practitioners do so and are roughly as effective as physiotherapists (though [there are real doubts](http://bodyinmind.com.au/research-into-back-pain-treatments/) about how effective that is). Excluding chiropractic and osteopathy, this is all that's left. It now consists almost entirely of Chinese medicine and a bit of herbal.

Manchester Metropolitan gets the booby prize for actually starting a new course, just as all around are closing theirs. Dr Peter Banister, who was on the committee that approved the course (but now retired), has told me \" I am sceptical in the current economic climate whether it will prove to be successful\". Let's hope he's right. But well done Westminster. Your position as the leader in antiscientific degrees has now been claimed by Middlesex University. Their \"degrees\" [ in Ayurveda](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/search/index.aspx?q=ayurveda) mark out Middlesex University as the new King of Woo. Over to you, Professor Driscoll. As vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, the buck stops with you. Both still teach Chinese and herbal medicine, which are potentially dangerous. There is not a single product from either that has marketing authorisation from the MHRA, though the MHRA has betrayed its trust by allowing misleading labelling of herbal medicines without requiring any evidence whatsoever that they work, see, for example [Why degrees in Chinese medicine are a danger to patients](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043) [More quackedemia. Dangerous Chinese medicine taught at Middlesex University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923) [Why does the MHRA refuse to label herbal products honestly? Kent Woods and Richard Woodfield tell me](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4269) Sub-degree courses In contrast to the large reduction in the number of BSc and MSc degrees, there has actually been an increase in two year foundation degrees and HND courses in complementary medicine, at places right near the [ bottom of the academic heap](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?v=wide). The subject is sinking to the bottom. With luck it will vanish entirely from universities before too long. Research-intensive Universities Although all of the degrees in magic medicine are from post-1992 universities, the subject has crept into more prestigious universities. Of these, the [University of Southampton](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4582) is perhaps the worst, because of the presence of [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956), and his defender, Stephen Holgate. Others have staunch defenders of quackery, including the University of Warwick, University of [Edinburgh](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#cumming) and [St Batholomew's](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=555). Why have all these courses closed? One reason is certainly the embarrassment caused by exposure of what's taught on the courses. Professors Petts (Westminster) and Driscoll (Middlesex) must be aware that googling their names produces references to this and other skeptical blogs on the front page. Thanks to some plain brown emails, and, after a three year battle, the Freedom of Information Act, it has been possible to show here the nonsense that has been foisted on students by some universities. Not only is this a burden on the taxpayer, but, more importantly, some of it is a danger to patients. When a course closes, it is often said that it is because of falling student numbers (though UCLAN and Salford did not use that excuse). Insofar as that is true, the credit must go to the whole of the skeptical movement that has grown so remarkably in the last few years. Ben Goldacre's \"ragged band of bloggers\" have produced a real change in universities and in society as a whole. The people who should have done the job have either been passive or an active hindrance. The list is long.

This contradicts the statement from UoW. Watch this space. 3 January 2012. Thanks to [Neil O'Connell](http://bodyinmind.com.au/research-into-back-pain-treatments/) for drawing my attention to a paper [in Pain](/white-2011-acupuncture-placebo-rct.pdf). The paper is particularly interesting because it comes from the [Southampton group](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4582) which has previously been sympathetic to acupuncture. Its authors include [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956). It shows, yet again that there is no detectable difference between real and sham acupuncture treatment. It also shows that the empathy of the practitioner has little effect: in fact the stern authoritarian practitioner may have been more effective. Patients receiving acupuncture demonstrated clinically important improvements from baseline (i.e., a 29.5% reduction in pain), but despite this, acupuncture has no specific efficacy over placebo for this group of patients. The clinical effect of acupuncture treatment and associated controls is not related to the use of an acupuncture needle, nor mediated by empathy, but is practitioner related and may be linked to the perceived authority of the practitioner.\" Sadly. the trial didn't include a no-treatment group, so it is impossible to say how much of the improvement is regression to the mean and how much is a placebo effect. The authors admit that it could be mostly the former. Surely now the misplaced confidence in acupuncture shown by some medical and university people must be in tatters. In yet another sign that even acupuncture advovates are beginning to notice that it doesn't work, a recent article [Paradoxes in Acupuncture Research: Strategies for Moving Forward](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2011/180805/), shows some fascinating squirming. 3 January 2012.

On [31 January](#310112) they carried a much longer piece. 3 January 2012. It is a great pity that some physiotherapists seem to have fallen hook, line and sinker for the myths of acupuncture. Physiotherapists are, by and large, the respectable face of manipulative therapy. Their evidence base is certainly not all one would wish, but at least they are free of the outrageous mumbo humbo of chiropractors. Well, most of them are, but not the [Acupuncture Association of Chartered Physiotherapists](http://www.aacp.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=137&Itemid=149) (AACP), or, still worse, The [Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Energy Medicine](http://www.energymedphysio.org.uk/), a group that is truly away with the fairies. These organisations are bringing a very respectable job into disrepute. And the Health Professions Council, which is meant to be their regulator, has, like most regulators, done nothing whatsoever to stop it. 5 January 2012. Times Higher Education gives a history of the demise of the University of Wales, [Boom or Bust](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=418612). It's a useful timeline, but like so many journalists, it's unwilling to admit that bloggers were on to the problem long before the BBC, never mind the QAA. There was also a leader on the same topic, [Perils of the export business](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=418588&c=2). It again fails to take the QAA to task for its failures.

I just learned that the [ludicrous course in Nutritional Therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259), previously validated by the University of Wales (and a contributor to its downfall), is now being validated by, yes, you guessed, [Middlesex University](http://www.chinese-medicine.co.uk/studying/qualified-nutritional-therapist-graduates.htm). Professor Driscoll seems determined to lead his univerity to the bottom of the academic heap. His new partnership with the Northern college of Acupuncture is just [one of a long list](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/business/partners/uk/index.aspx) of validations that almost rivals that of the [late University of Wales](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4766). The course has, of course, an [enthusiastic testimonial](http://www.chinese-medicine.co.uk/studying/qualified-nutritional-therapist-graduates.htm), from a student. It starts I work full time as a team leader for a pension company but I am also a kinesiologist and work in my spare time doing kinesiology, reiki and Indian head massage. Evidently she's a believer in the barmiest and totally disproved forms of magic medicine. And Middlesex University will give her a Master of Science degree. I have to say I find it worrying that she's a team leader for a pension company. Does she also believe in the value of worthless derivatives. I wonder? 18 January 2012. the story has gone international, with an interview that I did for Deutsche Welle, [UK universities drop alternative medicine degree programs](http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15673133,00.html). I'm quoted as saying \"They're dishonest, they teach things that aren't true, and things that are dangerous to patients in some cases\". That seems fair enough. There is also an [interesting item](http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5789488,00.html) from July 2010 about pressure to drop payment for homeopathy by German health insurance 31 January 2012 The Daily Telegraph carried a prominent 1200 word account (the title wasn't mine). The [published version](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/9051103/Complementary-medicine-courses-in-universities-how-I-beat-the-varsity-quacks.html) was edited slightly. There's been no official announcement, but four more of Westminster's courses in junk medicine have quietly closed. For entry in 2011 they offer |University of Westminster (W50)||qualification| |Chinese Medicine: Hon BSc/MSci| |Nutritional Therapy (B400)||3FT Hon BSc| But Medicine: BSc| |Herbal Medicine with Foundation Year (B340)||4FT/5FT Hon BSc/MSc| At the end of 2006, Westminster was offering 14 different BSc degrees in seven flavours of junk medicine. In [October 2008](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=404104), it was eleven. This year it's eight, and next year only four degrees in two subjects. Since \"Integrated Health\" was 'merged' with Biological Sciences in May 2010, two of the original courses have been dropped each year. This September there will be a final intake for Nutrition Therapy and Naturopathy. That leaves only two, Chinese Medicine (acupuncture and (Western) Herbal Medicine. The official reason given for the closures is always that the number of applications has fallen. I'm told that the number of applications has halved over the last five or six years. If that's right, it counts as a big success for the attempts of skeptics to show the public the nonsense that's taught on these degrees. Perhaps it is a sign that we are emerging from the endarkenment. Rumour has it that the remaining degrees will eventually close too. Let's hope so. Meanwhile, here is another helping hand. There is already quite a bit here about the dangers of Chinese medicine, e.g. [here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329#tcm) and, especially, [here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043). A [submission to the Department of Health](http://www.dcscience.net/pittilo-consultation-response.pdf) gives more detail. There has been a lot on [acupuncture](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=acupuncture) here too. There is now little doubt that it's no more than a theatrical, and [not very effective](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4439), placebo. So this time I'll concentrate on Western herbal medicine. Western Herbal Medicine Herbal medicine is just a branch of pharmacology and it could be taught as such. But it isn't. It comes overlaid with much superstitious nonsense. Some of it can be seen in slides from [Edinburgh Napier University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3200) (the difference being that Napier closed that course, and Westminster hasn't) Even if it were taught properly, it wouldn't be appropriate for a BSc for several reasons. First, there isn't a single herbal that has full marketing authorisation from the MHRA. In other words, there isn't a single herb for which there is good evidence that it works to a useful extent. Second, the fact that the active principals in plants are virtually always given in an unknown dose makes them potentially dangerous. This isn't 1950s pharmacology. It's 1920s pharmacology, dating from a time before methods were worked out for standardising the potency of natural products (see [Plants as Medicines](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=205)). Third, if you are going to treat illness with chemicals, why restrict yourself to chemicals that occur in plants? It was the herbal medicine course that gave rise to the most virulent [internal complaints](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4541) at the University of Westminster. These complaints revealed the use of pendulum dowsing by some teachers on the course and the near-illegal, and certainly dangerous, teaching about herbs [in cancer](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043). Here are a few slides from Principles of Herbal Medicine(3CT0 502). The vocabulary seems to be stuck in a time warp. When I first started in the late 1950s, words like tonic, carminative, demulcent and expectorant were common Over the last 40 years all these words have died out in pharmacology, for the simple reason that it became apparent that there were no such actions. But these imaginary categories are still alive and well in the herbal world. There was a lecture on a categories of drugs so old-fashioned that I've never even heard the words: \"nervines\". and \"adaptogens\". | | | || | The \"tonics\" listed here seem quite bizarre. In the 1950s, \"tonics\" containing nux vomica (a small dose of strychnine) and gentian (tastes nasty) were common, but they vanished years ago, because they don't work. None of those named here even get a mention in | | The only 'relaxant' here for which there is the slightest evidence is Valerian. I recall tincture of Valerian in a late 1950s pharmacy. It smells terrible, According to Not much, for something that's been around for centuries. And None of this near-total lack of evidence is mentioned on the slides. | | What about the 'stimulants'? Rosemary? No evidence at all. Tea and coffee aren't medicine (and not very good stimulants for me either). | | Ginseng, on the other hand, is big business. That doesn't mean it works of course. | | Thymoleptics - antidepressants are defined as \"herbs that engender a feeling of wellbeing. They uplift the spirit, improve the mood and counteract depression\". Oats, Lemon balm, Damiana, Vervain. Lavender and Rosemary are just old bits of folklore | | | | The only serious contender here is St John's Wort. At one time this was the prize exhibit for herbalists. It has been shown to be as good as the conventional SSRIs for treatment of mild to moderate depression. Sadly it has turned out that the SSRIs are themselves barely better than placebos. [NCCAM says](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/stjohnswort/ataglance.htm) - There is scientific evidence that St. John's wort may be useful for short-term treatment of mild to moderate depression. Although some studies have reported benefits for more severe depression, others have not; for example, a large study sponsored by NCCAM found that the herb was no more effective than placebo in treating major depression of moderate severity. \"Adaptogens\" are another figment of the herbalists' imaginations. They are defined in the lecture thus. | || | Well, it would be quite nice if such drugs existed. Sadly they don't. - The evidence for using astragalus for any health condition is limited. High-quality clinical trials (studies in people) are generally lacking. Another lecture dealt with \"stimulating herbs\". No shortage of them, it seems. Well at least one of these has quite well-understood effects in pharmacology, ephedrine, a sympathomimetic amine. It isn't used much because it can be quite dangerous, even with the controlled dose that's used in real medicine. In the uncontrolled dose in herbal medicines it is downright dangerous. | || | | || | This is what [NCCAM says](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/ephedra/) about Ephedra - An NCCAM-funded study that analyzed phone calls to poison control centers found a higher rate of side effects from ephedra, compared with other herbal products. - Other studies and systematic reviews have found an increased risk of heart, psychiatric, and gastrointestinal problems, as well as high blood pressure and stroke, with ephedra use. - According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there is little evidence of ephedra's effectiveness, except for short-term weight loss. However, the increased risk of heart problems and stroke outweighs any benefits. It seems that what is taught in the BSc Herbal Medicine degree consists largely of folk-lore and old wives' tales. Some of it could be quite dangerous for patients. A problem for pharmacognosists While talking about herbal medicine, it's appropriate to mention a related problem, though it has nothing to do with the University of Westminster. My guess is that not many people have even heard of pharmacognosy. If it were not for my humble origins as an apprentice pharmacist in Grange Road, Birkenhead (you can't get much more humble than that) I might not know either. Pharmacognosy is a branch of botany, the study of plant drugs. I recall inspecting powered digitalis leaves under a microscope. In Edinburgh, in the time of the great pharmacologist John Henry Gaddum, medical students might be presented in the oral exam with a jar of calabar beans and required to talk about their anticholinesterase effects of the physostigmine that they contain. The need for pharmacognosy has now all but vanished, but it hangs on in the curriculum for pharmacy students. This has engendered a certain unease about the role of pharmacognists. They often try to justify their existence by rebranding themselves as \"phytotherapists\". There are even journals of phytotherapy. It sounds a lot more respectable that herbalism. At its best, it is more respectable, but the fact remains that there no herbs whatsoever that have well-documented medical uses. The London School of Pharmacy is a case in point. Simon Gibbons (Professor of Phytochemistry, Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry). The School of Pharmacy) has chosen, for reasons that baffle me, to throw in his lot with the reincarnated Prince of Wales Foundation known as the \" [College of Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632)\". That organisation exists largely (not entirely) to promote various forms of quackery under the euphemism \"integrated medicine\". On [their web site](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/perspectives-medicines-natural-resource) he says \"Western science is now recognising the extremely high value of herbal medicinal products . . .\", despite the fact that there isn't a single herbal preparation with efficacy sufficient for it to get marketing authorisation in the UK. This is grasping at straws, not science. The true nature of the \"College of Medicine\" is illustrated, yet again, by their \" [innovations network](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/innovations-network)\". Their idea of \"innovation\" includes the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital and the Royal London Hospital for Integrated medicine, both devoted to promoting the utterly discredited late-18th century practice of giving people pills that contain no medicine. Some \"innovation\". It baffles me that Simon Gibbons is willing to appear on the same programme as Simon Mills and [ David Peters](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22David+Peters%22), and [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956). Mills' ideas can be judged by [watching a video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6720250368336924437#) of a talk he gave in which he 'explains' \"hot and cold herbs\". It strikes me as pure gobbledygook. Make up your own mind. He too has rebranded himself as \"phytotherapist\" though in fact he's an old-fashioned herbalist with no concern for good evidence. David Peters is the chap who, as Clinical Director of the University of Westminster's ever-shrinking School of Quackery, tolerates dowsing as a way to select 'remedies'. The present chair of Pharmacognosy at the School of Pharmacy is Michael Heinrich. He, with Simon Gibbons, has written a book [Fundamentals of pharmacognosy and phytotherapy](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BEV_6SGtZJIC&pg=PA172&lpg=PA172&ots=phB98jokgG&dq=%22Simon+Gibbons%22+quack&output=html). As well as much good chemistry, it contains this extraordinary statement \"TCM [traditional Chinese medicine] still contains very many remedies which were selected by their symbolic significance rather than their proven effects; however this does not mean that they are all 'quack'remedies! There may even be some value in medicines such as tiger bone, bear gall, turtle shell, dried centipedes, bat dung and so on. The herbs, however, are well researched and are becoming increasingly popular as people become disillusioned with Western Medicine.\" It is irresponsible to give any solace at all to the wicked industries that kill tigers and torture bears to extract their bile. And it is simple untrue that \"herbs are well-researched\". Try the test, A simple test for herbalists. Next time you encounter a herbalist, ask them to name the herb for which there is the best evidence of benefit when given for any condition. Mostly they refuse to answer, as was the case with [Michael McIntyre](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4269) (but he is really an industry spokesman with few scientific pretensions). I asked Michael Heinrich, Professor of Pharmacognosy at the School of Pharmacy. Again I couldn't get a straight answer. Usually, when pressed, the two things that come up are St John's Wort and Echinacea. Let's see what The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) has to say about them. NCCAM is the branch of the US National Institutes of Health which has spent around a billion dollars of US taxpayers' money on research into alternative medicine, For all that effort they have failed to come up with a single useful treatment. Clearly [they should be shut down](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=123). Nevertheless, as an organisation that is enthusiastic about alternative medicine, their view can only be overoptimistic. For St John's Wort . [NCCAM says](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/stjohnswort/ataglance.htm) - There is scientific evidence that St. John's wort may be useful for short-term treatment of mild to moderate depression. Although some studies have reported benefits for more severe depression, others have not; for example, a large study sponsored by NCCAM found that the herb was no more effective than placebo in treating major depression of moderate severity. For Echinacea [NCCAM say](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/echinacea/ataglance.htm)s - Study results are mixed on whether echinacea can prevent or effectively treat upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold. For example, two NCCAM-funded studies did not find a benefit from echinacea, either as Echinacea purpurea fresh-pressed juice for treating colds in children, or as an unrefined mixture of Echinacea angustifolia root and Echinacea purpurea root and herb in adults. However, other studies have shown that echinacea may be beneficial in treating upper respiratory infections. If these are the best ones, heaven help the rest. Follow-up Almost all the revelations about what's taught on university courses in alternative medicine have come from [post-1992 universities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_universities). (For readers not in the UK, post-1992 universities are the many new univerities created in 1992, from former polytechnics etc, and [Russell group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_group) universities are the \"top 20\" research-intensive universities) It is true that all the undergraduate courses are in post-1992 universities, but the advance of quackademia is by no means limited to them. The teaching at [St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical School](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1143), one of the oldest, was pretty disgraceful for example, though after protests from their own students, and from me, it is now better, I believe. Quackery creeps into all universities to varying extents. The good ones (like Southampton) don't run \"BSc\" degrees, but it still infiltrates through two main sources, The first is via their HR departments, which are run by people who tend to be (I quote) \" [credulous and moronic](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=226)\" when it comes to science. The other main source is in teaching to medical students. The General Medical Council says that medical students must know something about alterantive medicine and that's quite right, A lot of their patients will use it. The problem is that the guidance is shockingly vague . \"They must be aware that many patients are interested in and choose to use a range of alternative and complementary therapies. Graduates must be aware of the existence and range of such therapies, why some patients use them, and how these might affect other types of treatment that patients are receiving.\" (from [Tomorrow's Doctors, GMC]) In many medical schools, the information that medical students get is quite accurate. At UCL and at King's (London) I have done some of the familiarisation myself. In other good medical schools, the students get some shocking stuff. [St Bartholomew's Hospital](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=555) medical School was one example. [Edinburgh University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#cumming) was another. But there is one Russell group university where alternative myths are propagated more than any other that I know about. That is the University of Southampton. In general, Southampton is a good place, I worked there for three years myself (1972 - 1975). The very first noise spectra I measured were calculated on a PDP computer in their excellent Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, before I wrote my own programs to do it. But Southanpton also has a The Complementary and Integrated Medicine Research Unit . Oddly the unit's web site, [http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk), is not a university address, and a search of the university's web site for \"Complementary and Integrated Medicine Research Unit\" produces no result. Nevertheless the unit is \"within the School of Medicine at the University of Southampton\" Notice the usual euphemisms 'complementary' and 'integrated' in the title: the word 'alternative' is never used. This sort of word play is part of the [bait and switch](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/personalized-medicine-bait-and-switch/) approach of alternative medicine. The unit is [quite big](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/people.php): ten research staff, four PhD students and two support staff It is headed by [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956). Teaching about alternative medicine to Southampton medical students. The whole medical class seems to get quite a lot compared with other places I know about. That's 250 students (210 on the 5-year course plus another 40 from the 4-year graduate-entry route). Year 1: Lecture by David Owen on 'holism' within the Foundation Course given to all 210 medical students doing the standard (5-year) course. Year 2: Lecture by Lewith (on complementary medicine, focusing on acupuncture for pain) given within the nervous systems course to the whole medical student year-group (210 students). Year 3 SBOM (scientific basis of medicine) symposium: The 3-hour session (\"Complementary or Alternative Medicine: You Decide\"). I'm told that attendance at this symposium is often pretty low, but many do turn up and all of them are officially 'expected' to attend. There is also an optional CAM special study module chosen by 20 students in year 3, but also a small number of medical students (perhaps 2 - 3 each year?) choose to do a BMedSci research project supervised by the CAM research group and involving 16-18 weeks of study from October to May in Year 4. The CAM research group also supervise postgraduate students doing PhD research. As always, a list of lectures doesn't tell you much. What we need to know is what's taught to the students and something about the people who teach it. The other interesting question is how it comes about that alternative medicine has been allowed to become so prominent in a Russell group university. It must have support from on high. In this case it isn't hard to find out where it comes from. Here are some details. Year 1 Dr David Owen [David Owen](http://www.thenaturalpractice.com/practitioners/index/?practitioner=1) is not part of Lewith's group, but a member of the Division of Medical Education headed by Dr Faith Hill (of whom, more below). He's one of the many part-time academics in this area, being also a founder of [The Natural Practice](http://www.thenaturalpractice.com/) . Owen is an advocate of homeopathy (a past president of the Faculty of Homeopathy). Homeopathy is, of course, the most barmy and discredited of all the popular sorts of alternative medicine. Among those who have discredited it is the head of the alt med unit, [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3695) himself (though oddly he [still prescribes it](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956)). And he's also a member of the [British Society of Environmental Medicine](http://www.ecomed.org.uk/) (BSEM). That sounds like a very respectable title, but don't be deceived. It is an organisation that promotes all sorts of seriously fringe ideas. All you have to do is notice that the star speaker at their 2011 conference was none other than used-to-be a doctor, Andrew Wakefield, a man who has been responsible for the death of children from measles by causing an unfounded scare about vaccination on the basis of data that turned out to [ have been falsified](http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452). There is still a [letter of support](http://www.ecomed.org.uk/the-gmc-and-dr-andrew-wakefield) for Wakefield on the BSEM web site. The BSEM [specialises in](http://www.ecomed.org.uk/practitioners) exaggerated claims about 'environmental toxins' and uses phony allergy tests like [ kinesiology](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/05/how-applied-kinesiology-can-be-used-to-justify-any-quack-treatment.html) and the [Vega test](http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/south/series2/food_sensitivity_allergy_vega_tests.shtml) that misdiagnose allergies, but provide en excuse to prescribe expensive but unproven nutritional supplements, or expensive psychobabble like \"neuro-linguistic programming\". Other registered \"ecological physicians\" include the infamous D [r Sarah Myhil](http://www.skepticat.org/2010/04/dr-myhill/)l, who, in 2010, was the subject of a [damning verdict by the GMC](http://www.drmyhill.co.uk/wiki/GMC%27s_full_verdict), and Southampton's George Lewith. If it is wrong to expose medical students to someone who believes that dose-response curves have a negative slope (the smaller the dose the bigger the effect -I know, it's crazy), then it is downright wicked to expose students to a supporter of Andrew Wakefield. David Owen's appearance on Radio Oxford, with the indomitable Andy Lewis appears on his [Quackometer blog](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/06/debating-homeopathy-on-bbc-oxford-radio.html). Year 2 Dr George Lewith Lewith is a mystery wrapped in an enigma. He's participated in some research that is quite good by the (generally pathetic) standards of the world of alternative medicine. In 2001 he showed that the [ Vega test did not work](http://www.dcscience.net/Lewith-Vega-test-01.pdf) as a method of allergy diagnosis. \"Conclusion Electrodermal testing cannot be used to diagnose environmental allergies\", published in the BMJ .[ [download reprint](http://www.dcscience.net/Lewith-Vega-test-01.pdf)]. In 2003 reprint](http://www.dcscience.net/Brien-Lewith-2003.pdf)] that showed homeopathic pills with no active ingredients had no effects: The conclusion was \"\"Ultramolecular homeopathy has no observable clinical effects\" (the word ultramolecular, in this context, means that the belladonna pills contained no belladonna). In 2010 he again concluded that homeopathic pills were no more than placebos, as described in [Despite the spin, Lewith's paper surely signals the end of homeopathy (again)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3695). [ [download reprint](http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/11/08/rheumatology.keq234.full.pdf)] What i cannot understand is that, despite his own findings, his private practice continues to prescribe the Vega machine and continues to prescribe homeopathic pills. And he continues to preach this subject to unfortunate medical students. Lewith is also one of the practitioners [recommended by BSEM](http://www.ecomed.org.uk/practitioners). He's a [director of](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263) the \"College of Medicine\". And he's also an advisor to a charity called Yes To Life. (see [A thoroughly dangerous charity: YesToLife promotes nonsense cancer treatments](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4239)). 3rd year Student Selected Unit The teaching team includes: - David Owen - Principal Clinical Teaching Fellow SoM, Holistic Physician - George Lewith - Professor of Health Research and Consultant Physician - Caroline Eyles - Homeopathic Physician - Susan Woodhead - Acupuncturist - Elaine Cooke - Chiropractic Practitioner - Phine Dahle - Psychotherapist - Keith Carr - Reiki Master - Christine Rose - Homeopath and GP - David Nicolson - Nutritionalist - Shelley Baker - Aromatherapist - Cheryl Dunford - Hypnotherapist - Dedj Leibbrandt - Herbalist More details of the teaching team [here](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/teachingteam.php). There is not a single sceptic among them, so the students don't get a debate, just propaganda. In this case. there's no need for the Freedom of Information Act. The [ handouts](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/handouts.php). and the [powerpoints](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/presentations.php) are on their web site. They seem to be proud of them Let's look at some examples Chiropractic makes an interesting case, because, in the wake of the [Singh-BCA libel case](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1980), the claims of chiropractors have been [scrutinised as never before](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1775) and most of their claims have turned out to be bogus. There is a close relationship between Lewith's unit and the Anglo-European Chiropractic College (the 3rd year module includes a visit there). In fact the handout provided for students, [Evidence for Chiropractic Care ](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/pdf/evidence_for_chiropractic_care.pdf), was written by the College. It's interesting because it provides no real evidence whatsoever for the effectiveness of chiropractic care. It's fairly honest in stating that the view at present is that, for low back pain, it isn't possible to detect any difference between the usefulness of manipulation by a physiotherapist, by an osteopath or by a chiropractor. Of course it does not draw the obvious conclusion that this makes chiropractic and osteopathy entirely redundant -you can get the same result without all the absurd mumbo jumbo that chiropractors and osteopaths love, or their high-pressure salesmanship and superfluous X-rays. Neither does it mention the sad, but entirely possible, outcome that none of the manipulations are effective for low back pain. There is, for example, no mention of the fascinating paper by Artus et al [ [download reprint](http://www.dcscience.net/artus-rheumatology-2010.pdf)]. This paper concludes \"symptoms seem to improve in a similar pattern in clinical trials following a wide variety of active as well as inactive treatments.\" This paper was brought to my attention through the blog run by the exellent physiotherapist, Neil O'Connell. [He comments](http://bodyinmind.com.au/research-into-back-pain-treatments/) \"If this finding is supported by future studies it might suggest that we can't even claim victory through the non-specific effects of our interventions such as care, attention and placebo. People enrolled in trials for back pain may improve whatever you do. This is probably explained by the fact that patients enrol in a trial when their pain is at its worst which raises the murky spectre of regression to the mean and the beautiful phenomenon of natural recovery.\" This sort of critical thinking is conspicuously absent from this (and all the other) Southampton handouts. The handout is a superb example of bait and switch: No nonsense about infant colic, innate energy or imaginary subluxations appears in it. Acupuncture is another interesting case because there is quite a lot of research evidence, in stark contrast to the rest of traditional Chinese medicine, for which there is very little research. | | There is a The message is simple and totally uncritical. It works. | | In fact there is now a broad consensus about acupuncture. (1) Real acupuncture and sham acupuncture have been found to be indistinguishable in many trials. This is the case regardless of whether the sham is a retractable needle (or even a toothpick) in the \"right\" places, or whether it is real needles inserted in the \"wrong\" places. The latter finding shows clearly that all that stuff about meridians and flow of Qi is sheer hocus pocus. It dates from a pre-scientific age and it was wrong. (2) A non-blind comparison of acupuncture versus no acupuncture shows an advantage for acupuncture. But the advantage is usually too small to be of any clinical significance. [ In all probability it is a placebo effect](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3136) -it's hard to imagine a more theatrical event than having someone in a white coat stick long needles into you, like a voodoo doll. Sadly, the placebo effect isn't big enough to be of much use. Needless to say, none of this is conveyed to the medical students of Southampton. Instead they are shown crude ancient ideas that date from long before anything was known about physiology as though they were actually true. These folks truly live in some alternative universe. Here are some samples from the acupuncture [powerpoint show](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/presentations/Acupuncture%20presentation%20Susan%20Woodhead.pdf) by Susan Woodhead. Well this is certainly a \"different diagnostic language\", but no attempt is made to say which one is right. In the mind of the acupuncurist it seems both are true. It is a characteristic of alternative medicine advocates that they have no difficulty in believing simultaneously several mutually contradictory propositions. As a final exmple of barminess, just look at the acupuncture points (allegedly) on the ear The fact that it is a favoured by some people in the Pentagon as [battlefield acupuncture](http://blogs.forbes.com/sciencebiz/2010/02/15/battlefield-acupuncture-pseudoscience-for-wounded-troops/), is more reminiscent of the mad general, Jack D. Ripper, in [Dr Strangelove](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1KvgtEnABY&feature=related) than it is of science. There is an equally uncritical [handout on acupuncture](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/pdf/_compmed_handouts_acupuncture.pdf) by Val Hopwood. It's dated March 2003, a time before some of the most valuable experiments were done. The handout says \"sham acupuncture is generally less effective than true acupuncture\", precisely the opposite of what's known now. And there are some bits that give you a good laugh, always helpful in teaching. I like \"There is little doubt that an intact functioning nervous system is required for acupuncture to produce analgesia or, for that matter, any physiological changes\" and Modern techniques: These include hybrid electro-acupuncture . . . and Ryadoraku [sic] therapy and Vega testing. Vega testing!! That's been disproved dozens of times (not least by George Lewith). And actually the other made-up nonsense is spelled [Ryodoraku](http://www.ryodoraku.eu/). It's true that there is a short paragraph at the end of the handout headed \"Scientific evaluation of acupuncture\" but it doesn't cite a single reference and reads more like excuses for why acupuncture so often fails when it's tested properly. Homeopathy. Finally a bit about that most boring of topics, the laughable medicine that contains no medicine, homeopathy. Caroline Eyles is a member for the Society of Homeopaths, the organisation that did nothing when its members were caught out in the murderous practice of recommending homeopathy for prevention of malaria. The Society of Homeopaths also [endorses Jeremy Sherr](http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2007/11/01/jeremy-sherr-fellow-of-the-society-of-homeopaths-wants-to-cure-aids-and-malaria-with-homeopathy/), a man so crazy that he believes he can cure AIDS and malaria with sugar pills. The homeopathy [handout](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/pdf/_compmed_handouts_homeopathy.pdf) given to the students has 367 references, but somehow manages to omit the references to their own boss's work showing that the pills are placebos. The handout has all the sciencey-sounding words, abused by people who don't understand them. \"The remedy will be particularly effective if matched to the specific/particular characteristics of the individual (the 'totality' of the patient) on all levels, including the emotional and mental levels, as well as just the physical symptoms. 'Resonance' with the remedy's curative power will then be at it's [sic] best.\" The handout is totally misleading about the current state of research. It says \"increasing clinical research confirms it's [sic] clinical effectiveness in treating patients, including babies and animals (where a placebo effect would be hard to justify).\" | | The | | Anyone who has to rely on the utterly discredited [Jacques Benveniste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Benveniste) as evidence is clearly clutching at straws. What's more interesting about this slide the admission that \"reproducibility is a problem -oops, an issue\" and that RCTs (done largely by homeopaths of course) have \"various methodological flaws and poor external validity\". You'd think that if that was the best that could be produced after 200 yours, they'd shut up shop and get another job. But, like aging vicars who long since stopped believing in god, but are damned if they'll give up the nice country rectory, they struggle on, sounding [increasingly desperate](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/07/1887.html). How have topics like this become so embedded in a medical course at a Russell group university? The details above are a bit tedious and repetitive. It's already established that hardly any alternative medicine works. Don't take my word for it. Check [the web site](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/atoz.htm) of the US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) who, at a cost of over $2 billion have produced nothing useful. A rather more interesting question is how a good university like Southampton comes to be exposing its medical students to teaching like this. There must be some powerful allies higher up in the university. In this case it's pretty obvious who thay are. Professor Stephen Holgate FBMS FMed Sci CBE has to be the primary suspect, He's listed as one of Southampton's [Outstanding Academics](http://www.soton.ac.uk/research/outstanding_academics/index.html). His work is nothing to do with alternative medicine but he's been a long term supporter of the late unlamented Prince of Wales' Foundation, and he's now [on the advisory board](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/professor-stephen-holgate) of it's successor, the so called \"College of Medicine\" (for more information about that place see the [new \"College of Medicine\" arising from the ashes of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), and also [Don't be deceived. The new \"College of Medicine\" is a fraud and delusion](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632) ). His description on that site reads thus. \"Stephen Holgate is MRC Clinical Professor of Immunopharmacology at the University of Southampton School of Medicine and Honorary Consultant Physician at Southampton University Hospital Trust. He is also chair of the MRC's Populations and Systems Medicine Board. Specialising in respiratory medicine, he is the author of over 800 peer-reviewed papers and contributions to scientific journals and editor of major textbooks on asthma and rhinitis. He is Co-Editor of Clinical and Experimental Allergy, Associate Editor of Clinical Science and on the editorial board of 25 other scientific journals.\" Clearly a busy man. Personally I'm deeply suspicious of anyone who claims to be the author of over 800 papers. He graduated in medicine in 1971, so that is an average of over 20 papers a year since then, one every two or three weeks. I'd have trouble reading that many, never mind writing them. Holgate's long-standing interest in alternative medicine is baffling. He's published on the topic with George Lewith, who, incidentally, is [one of the directors](http://www.dcscience.net/blREX+0L0198-7358_6-05180774.pdf) of the \"College of Medicine\".. It may be unkind to mention that, for many years now, I've been hearing rumours that Holgate is suffering from an unusually bad case of [Knight starvation](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=13#quote). The Division of Medical Education appears to be the other big source of support for. anti-scientific medicine. That is very odd, I know, but it was also the medical education people who were responsible for mis-educating medical students at. [St. Bartholomew's](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=555) and at [ Edinburgh university](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#cumming). Southampton's [Division of Medical Education](http://www.som.soton.ac.uk/research/medicaleducation/) has a mind-boggling 60 academic and support staff. Two of them are of particular interest here. Faith Hill is director of the division. [Her profile](http://www.som.soton.ac.uk/about/staff/listing/profile.asp?fhill) doesn't say anything about alternative medicine, but her interest is clear from a 2003 paper, [Complementary and alternative medicine: the next generation of health promotion?](http://www.dcscience.net/Faith-Hill-CAM.pdf). The research consisted of reporting anecdotes from interviews of 52 unnamed people (this sort of thing seems to pass for research in the social sciences). It starts badly by misrepresenting the conclusions of the [House of Lords report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=199) (2000) on CAM. Although it comes to no useful conclusions, it certainly shows a high tolerance of nonsensical treatments. Chris Stephens is Associate Dean of Medical Education & Student Experience. His sympathy is shown by a paper he wrote In 2001, with David Owen (the homeopath, above) and George Lewith: [Can doctors respond to patients' increasing interest in complementary and alternative medicine?](http://www.bmj.com/content/322/7279/154.full?ijkey=cef1ed0dd3a181def66f02738144eb35ba3f229c&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha). Two of the conclusions of this paper were as follows. \"Doctors are training in complementary and alternative medicine and report benefits both for their patients and themselves\" Well, no actually. It wasn't true then, and it's probably even less true now. There's now a lot more evidence and most of it shows alternative medicine doesn't work. \"Doctors need to address training in and practice of complementary and alternative medicine within their own organisations\" Yes they certainly need to do that. And the first thing that Drs Hill and Stephens should do is look a bit more closely about what's taught in their own university, I hope that this post helps them, Follow-up 4 July 2011. A correspondent has just pointed out that Chris Stephens is a [member of the General Chiropractic Council](http://www.gcc-uk.org/page.cfm?page_id=8). The GCC is a truly pathetic pseudo-regulator. In the wake of the Simon Singh affair it has been kept busy fending off well-justified complaints against untrue claims made by chiropractors. The [ GCC is a sad joke](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2010/11/chiropractors-at-war-with-their-regulator-the-gcc.html), but it's even sadder to see a Dean of Medical Education at the University of Southampton being involved with an organisation that has treated little matters of truth with such disdain. A rather unkind tweet from (ex)-chiropractor @RichardLanigan. \"Chris is just another light weight academic who likes being on committees. Regulatory bodies are full of them\" This is a slightly-modified version of the article that [appeared in BMJ blogs](http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2011/04/14/david-colquhoun-the-a-to-z-of-the-wellbeing-industry-from-angelic-reiki-to-patient-centred-care/) yesterday, but with more links to original sources, and a picture. There are already some [comments in the BMJ](http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2011/04/14/david-colquhoun-the-a-to-z-of-the-wellbeing-industry-from-angelic-reiki-to-patient-centred-care/). The original article, diplomatically, did not link directly to UCL's [Grand Challenge of Human Wellbeing](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-wellbeing/), a well-meaning initiative which, I suspect, will not prove to be value for money when it comes to practical action. Neither, when referring to the bad effects of disempowerment on human wellbeing (as elucidated by, among others, UCL's Michael Marmot), did I mention the several ways in which staff have been disempowered and rendered voiceless at UCL during the last five years. Although these actions have undoubtedly had a bad effect on the wellbeing of UCL's staff, it seemed a litlle unfair to single out UCL since similar things are happening in most universities. Indeed the fact that it has been [ far worse at Imperial](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=182) College (at least in medicine) has probably saved UCL from being denuded. One must be thankful for small mercies. There is, i think, a lesson to be learned from the fact that formal initiatives in wellbeing are springing up at a time when university managers are set on taking actions that have exactly the opposite effect. A 'change manager' is not an adequate substitute for a vote. Who do they imagine is being fooled? The A to Z of the wellbeing industry From angelic reiki to patient-centred care Nobody could possibly be against wellbeing. It would be like opposing motherhood and apple pie. There is a whole spectrum of activities under the wellbeing banner, from the undoubtedly well-meaning patient-centred care at one end, to downright barmy new-age claptrap at the other end. The only question that really matters is, how much of it works? Let's start at the fruitcake end of the spectrum. One thing is obvious. Wellbeing is big business. And if it is no more than a branch of the multi-billion-dollar positive-thinking industry, save your money and get on with your life. In June 2010, Northamptonshire NHS Foundation Trust sponsored a \"Festival of Wellbeing\" that included a complementary therapy taster day. [In a BBC interview](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=3179#110610) one practitioner used the advertising opportunity, paid for by the NHS, to say \"I'm an angelic reiki master teacher and also an angel therapist.\" \"Angels are just flying spirits, 100 percent just pure light from heaven. They are all around us. Everybody has a guardian angel.\" Another said \"I am a member of the British Society of Dowsers and use a crystal pendulum to dowse in treatment sessions. Sessions may include a combination of meditation, colour breathing, crystals, colour scarves, and use of a light box.\" You couldn't make it up. The enormous positive-thinking industry is no better. Barbara Ehrenreich's book, [Smile Or Die: How Positive Thinking Fooled America and the World](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jan/10/smile-or-die-barbara-ehrenreich), explains how dangerous the industry is, because, as much as guardian angels, it is based on myth and delusion. It simply doesn't work (except for those who make fortunes by promoting it). She argues that it fosters the sort of delusion that gave us the financial crisis (and pessimistic bankers were fired for being right). Her interest in the industry started when she was diagnosed with cancer. [She says](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJGMFu74a70) \"When I was diagnosed, what I found was constant exhortations to be positive, to be cheerful, to even embrace the disease as if it were a gift. If that's a gift, take me off your Christmas list,\" It is quite clear that positive thinking does nothing whatsoever to prolong your life ( [Schofield et al 2004](http://www.dcscience.net/schofield-optimism-lung-cancer-2004.pdf); [ Coyne et al 2007](http://www.dcscience.net/coyne-psych-bul-07.pdf); 2,3), any more than it will cure tuberculosis or cholera. \"Encouraging patients to \"be positive\" only may add to the burden of having cancer while providing little benefit\" ( [Schofield et al 2004](http://www.dcscience.net/schofield-optimism-lung-cancer-2004.pdf)). Far from being helpful, it can be rather cruel. Just about every government department, the NHS, BIS, HEFCE, and NICE, has produced long reports on wellbeing and stress at work. It's well known that income is correlated strongly with health ( [Marmot, M., 2004](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/whitehallII/pdf/Whitehallbooklet_1_.pdf)). For every tube stop you go east of Westminster you lose a year of life expectancy ( [London Health Observatory](http://www.lho.org.uk/LHO_Topics/National_Lead_Areas/HealthInequalitiesOverview.aspx)). It's been proposed that what matters is inequality of income (Wilkinson & Pickett, 2009). The nature of the evidence doesn't allow such a firm conclusion ( [Lynch et al. 2004](http://www.dcscience.net/Lynch-Davey-Smith-2004.pdf)), but that isn't really the point. The real problem is that nobody has come up with good solutions. Sadly the recommendations at the ends of all these reports don't amount to a hill of beans. Nobody knows what to do, partly because pilot studies are rarely randomised so causality is always dubious, and partly because the obvious steps are either managerially inconvenient, ideologically unacceptable, or too expensive. Take two examples: Sir Michael Marmot's famous Whitehall study ( [Marmot, M., 2004)](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/whitehallII/pdf/Whitehallbooklet_1_.pdf) has shown that a major correlate of illness is lack of control over one's own fate: disempowerment. What has been done about it? In universities it has proved useful to managers to increase centralisation and to disempower academics, precisely the opposite of what Marmot recommends. | | As long as it's convenient to managers they are not going to change policy. Rather, they hand the job to the HR department which appoints highly paid \"change managers,\" who add to the stress by sending you stupid graphs that show you emerging from the slough of despond into eternal light once you realise that you really wanted to be disempowered after all. Or they send you on some silly \"resilience\" course. | | A second example comes from debt. According to a BIS report ( [Mental Capital and Wellbeing](http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/migratedD/ec_group/113-08-FO_b)), debt is an even stronger risk factor for mental disorder than low income. So what is the government's response to that? To treble tuition fees to ensure that almost all graduates will stay in debt for most of their lifetime. And this was done despite the fact that the \u00a39k fees will save nothing for the taxpayer: in fact they'll cost more than the \u00a33k fees. The rise has happened, presumably, because the ideological reasons overrode the [government's own ideas](http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/migratedD/ec_group/113-08-FO_b) on how to make people happy. Nothing illustrates better the futility of the wellbeing industry than the response that is reported to have been given to a reporter who posed as an applicant for a \"health, safety, and wellbeing adviser\" with a local council. When he asked what \"wellbeing\" advice would involve, a member of the council's human resources team said: \"We are not really sure yet as we have only just added that to the role. We'll want someone to make sure that staff take breaks, go for walks \u2014 that kind of stuff.\" The latest wellbeing notion to re-emerge is the happiness survey. Jeremy Bentham advocated \"the greatest happiness for the greatest number,\" but neglected to say how you measure it. A YouGov poll asks, \"what about your general well-being right now, on a scale from 1 to 10.\" I have not the slightest idea about how to answer such a question. As always some things are good, some are bad, and anyway wellbeing relative to whom? Writing this is fun. Trying to solve an algebraic problem is fun. Constant battling with university management in order to be able to do these things is not fun. The whole exercise smacks of the sort of intellectual arrogance that led psychologists in the 1930s to claim that they could sum up a person's intelligence in a single number. That claim was wrong and it did great social harm. HEFCE has spent a large amount of money setting up \"pilot studies\" of wellbeing in nine universities. Only one is randomised, so there will be no [evidence for causality](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1435). The design of the pilots is contracted to a private company, Robertson Cooper, which declines to give full details but it seems likely that the results will be about as useless as the notorious Durham fish oil \"trials\"( [Goldacre, 2008](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/27/medicalresearch)). Lastly we get to the sensible end of the spectrum: patient-centred care. Again this has turned into an industry with endless meetings and reports and very few conclusions. [Epstein & Street (2011) say](http://www.annfammed.org/cgi/content/full/9/2/100#R7) \"Helping patients to be more active in consultations changes centuries of physician-dominated dialogues to those that engage patients as active participants. Training physicians to be more mindful, informative, and empathic transforms their role from one characterized by authority to one that has the goals of partnership, solidarity, empathy, and collaboration.\" That's fine, but the question that is constantly avoided is what happens when a patient with metastatic breast cancer expresses a strong preference for Vitamin C or Gerson therapy, as advocated by the [YesToLife charity](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4239). The fact of the matter is that the relationship can't be equal when one party, usually (but not invariably) the doctor, knows a lot more about the problem than the other. What really matters above all to patients is getting better. Anyone in their right mind would prefer a grumpy condescending doctor who correctly diagnoses their tumour, to an empathetic doctor who misses it. It's fine for medical students to learn social skills but there is a real danger of so much time being spent on it that they can no longer make a correct diagnosis. Put another way, there is [confusion between caring and curing](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3095). It is curing that matters most to patients. It is this confusion that forms the basis of the [bait and switch](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=156) tactics (see [also here](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1516)) used by [magic medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733) advocates to gain the respectability that they crave but rarely deserve. If, as is only too often the case, the patient can't be cured, then certainly they should be cared for. That's a moral obligation when medicine fails in its primary aim. There is a lot of talk about individualised care. It is a buzzword of quacks and also of the libertarian wing which says NICE is too prescriptive. It sounds great, but it helps only if the individualised treatment actually works. Nobody knows how often medicine fails to be \"patient-centred.\". Even less does anyone know whether patient-centred care can improve the actual health of patients. There is a strong tendency to do small pilot trials that are as likely to mislead as inform. One properly randomised trial ( [Kinmonth et al., 1998](http://www.bmj.com/content/317/7167/1202.1.full.pdf)) concluded \"those committed to achieving the benefits of patient centred consulting should not lose the focus on disease management.\" Non-randomised studies may produce more optimistic conclusions (e.g. [Hojat et al, 2011)](http://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/Fulltext/2011/03000/Physicians__Empathy_and_Clinical_Outcomes_for.26.aspx), but there is no way to tell if this is simply because doctors find it easy to be empathetic with patients who have better outcomes. Obviously I'm in favour of doctors being nice to patients and to listening to their wishes. But there is a real danger that it will be seen as more important than curing. There is also a real danger that it will open the doors to all sorts of quacks who claim to provide individualised empathic treatment, but end up recommending Gerson therapy for metastatic breast cancer. The new [College of Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632), which in reality is simply a reincarnation of the late unlamented Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health, lists as its founder [ Capita](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&rlz=1D3GGLD_en-GBGB400&q=crapita&aq=f&aqi=p-p2g-s1g2g-s1g1g-s1g-m1&aql=&oq=), the private healthcare provider that will, no doubt, be happy to back the herbalists and homeopaths in the College of Medicine, and, no doubt, to make a profit from selling their wares to the NHS. In my own experience as a patient, there is not nearly as much of a problem with patient centred care as the industry makes out. Others have been less lucky, as shown by the mid-Staffordshire disaster ( [Delamothe, 2010](http://www.dcscience.net/delamothe-bmj-2010.pdf)), That seems to have resulted from PR being given priority over patients. Perhaps all that's needed is to save money on all the endless reports and meetings (\"the best substitute for work\"), ban use of PR agencies (paid lying) and to spend the money on more doctors and nurses so they can give time to people who need it. This is a job that will be hindered considerably by the government's proposals to sell off NHS work to private providers who will be happy to make money from junk medicine. Reference Wilkinson. R & Pickett, K. 2009 , The Spirit Level, ISBN 978 1 84614 039 6 A footnote on Robertson Cooper and \"resilience\" I took up the offer of [Robertson Cooper](http://www.robertsoncooper.com/) to do their free \"resilience\" assessment, the company to which HEFCE has paid an undisclosed amount of money. The first problem arose when it asked about your job. There was no option for scientist, mathematician, university or research, so I was forced to choose \"education and training\". (a funny juxtaposition since training is arguably the antithesis of education). It had 195 questions. mostly as unanswerable as in the YouGov happiness survey. I particularly liked question 124 \"I see little point in many of the theoretical models I come across\". The theoretical models that I come across most are Markov models for the intramolecular changes in a receptor molecule when it binds a ligand (try, for example, [Joint distributions of apparent open and shut times of single-ion channels and maximum likelihood fitting of mechanisms](/Colquhoun-Hawkes-Srodzinski 1996.pdf)). I doubt the person who wrote the question has ever heard of a model of that sort. The answer to that question (and most of the others) would not be worth the paper they are written on. The whole exercise struck me as the worst sort of vacuous HR psychobabble. It is worrying that HEFCE thinks it is worth spending money on it. Follow-up The Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health [shut down amidst scandal](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3023) in April 2010. In July, we heard that a new \"College of Medicine\" was to arise from its ashes. It seemed clear [from the people involved](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263) that the name \"College of Medicine\" would be deceptive. Now the College of Medicine has materialised, and it is clear that one's worst fears were well justified. At first sight, it looks entirely plausible and well-meaning. Below the logo [one reads](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/about-college-medicine) \"There is a new force in medicine. A force that brings patients, doctors, nurses and other health professionals together, instead of separating them into tribes.\" \"That force is the new College of Medicine. Uniquely, it brings doctors and other health professionals together with patients and scientists.\" It is apparent from the outset that the well-meaning words fall into the trap described so clearly by James May (see [What 'holistic' really means](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3095)). It fails to distinguish between curing and caring. As always, the clue lies not in the words, but in the people who are running it. Who is involved? After a bit of digging on the web site, you find the names of the people on the [Science Council of the \"College of Medicine\"](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/science-council), The preamble says \"Good medicine must be grounded in good science as well as compassion. The College's Science Council brings a depth of knowledge from many senior figures.\" But then come the names.

There are a few gaps in this table, to be filled in soon. One can guarantee that a great deal more will appear about the College on the web, very soon. The [Governing Council of the College](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council) is equally replete with quacks (plus a few surprising names). It has on it, for example, a spiritual healer (Angie-Buxton King), a homeopath (Christine Glover), a herbalist (Michael McIntyre). Westminster University's king of woo (David Peters), not to mention the infamous [Karol Sikora](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Karol+Sikora%22). Buxton-King [offers a remarkable service](#abk1) to heal people or animals at a distance. Meanwhile, it seemed worthwhile to provide a warning that the title of the College is very deceptive. It hides an agenda that could do much harm. It is, quite simply, the Prince of Wales by stealth. Follow-up 28 October 2010 Professor Sir Graeme Catto, who has, disgracefully, allowed his name to be used as president of this \"College\" has said to me \"There are real problems in knowing how to care for folk with chronic conditions and the extent of the evidence base for medicine is pretty limited\". Yes of course that is quite true. There are many conditions for which medicine can still do little. There is a fascinating discussion to be had about how best to care for them. The answer to that is NOT to bring in spiritual healers and peddlers of sugar pills to deceive patients with their fairy stories. The \"College of Medicine\" will delay and pervert the sort of discussion that Catto says, rightly, is needed. 29 October 2010 I need a press card. I see that the BMJ also had a piece about the \"College of Medicine\" yesterday: [Prince's foundation metamorphoses into new College of Medicine](http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6126.full), by Nigel Hawkes. He got the main point right there in the title. As was [clear since July](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), the driving force was Michael Dixon, Devon GP and ex medical director of the Prince's Foundation. Hawkes goes easy on the homeopaths and spiritual healers, but did spot something that I can't find on their web site. The \"Faculties\" will include \"in 2011, neuromusculoskeletal care. Two of the six strong faculty members for this specialty are from the British Chiropractic Association, which sued the author Simon Singh for libel for his disobliging remarks about the evidence base for their interventions.\" The College certainly picks its moment to endorse chiropractic, a subject that is in chaos and disgrace after they lost the Singh affair. One bit of good news emerges from Hawkes' piece, There is at least one high profile doubter in the medical establishment, Lord (John) Walton (his 2000 report on CAM was less than blunt, and has been widely misquoted by quacks) is reported as saying, at the opening ceremony \"I'm here as a sceptic, and I've just told my former houseman that,\" he said. The target of the remark was Donald Irvine, another former GMC president and a member of the new college's advisory council.\" 31 October 2010. I got an email that pointed out a remarkable service offered by a member of College's [Governing Council](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council). Angie Buxton-King, a \"spiritual healer\" employed by UCLH seems to have another web site, [The Beacon of Healing Light](http://www.angiebuxton-king.com/) that is not mentioned in [her biography](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/angie-buxton-king) on the College's site. Perhaps it should have been because it makes some remarkable claims. The [page about distant healing](http://www.angiebuxton-king.com/Distant_Healing.php) is the most bizarre. Absent Healing/Distant Healing \"Absent healing is available when it is not possible to visit the patient or it is not possible for the patient to be brought to our healing room. This form of healing has proved to be very successful for humans and animals alike.\" \"We keep a healing book within our healing room and every night spend time sending healing to all those who have asked for it. We have found that if a picture of the patient is sent to us the healing is more beneficial, we also require a weekly update to monitor any progress or change in the patients situation. Donations are welcome for this service.\" I wonder what the Advertising Standards people make of the claim that it is \"very successful\"? I wonder what the president of the College makes of it? I've asked him. Other blogs about the \"College of Medicine\" 30 October 2010. Margaret McCartney is always worth reading. As a GP she is at the forefront of medicine. She's written about the College in [The Crisis in Caring and dangerous inference](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=801). She's also provided some information about a \"professional member\" of the [College of Medicine](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/dr-sam-everington), in [..and on Dr Sam Everington, at the Bromley by Bow Centre....](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=803) It is one of the more insulting things about alternative medicine addicts that they claim to be the guardians of caring (as opposed to curing), They are not, and people like McCartney and Michael Baum are excellent examples. Prince of Wales to become honorary president of the \"College of Medicine?\" Last night I heard a rumour that the Prince of Wales is, despite all the earlier denials, to become Honorary President of the \"College\". If this is true, it completes the wholesale transformation of the late, unlamented, Prince's Foundation for Integrated Medicine into this new \"College\". Can anybody take it seriously now? Text messages to Graeme Catto and Michael Dixon, inviting them to deny the rumour, have met with silence. Herbal nonsense at the College 29 July 2011. I got an email from the College if Medicine [ [download it](http://www.dcscience.net/COM-Self-care.pdf)]. It contains a lot of fantasy about herbal medicines, sponsered by a company that manufactures them. It is dangeroous and corrupt. "}
