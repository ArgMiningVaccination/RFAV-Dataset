Here is our top-10 list of the places to go for some pampering. Spa Safari at Nihiwatu Sumba Island, Indonesia This resort overlooks the southern Indian Ocean. Its Spa Safari at Nihi Oka is well worth the 90-minute trek through rolling hills, local villages and rice paddies. A breakfast is served on a tree platform, followed by unlimited private spa treatments on the clifftop or down on the beach. Start with a foot bath, and your therapist will massage you as you recharge to the calming sound of waves crashing. If one day isn't enough and you are feeling romantic, opt for the overnight Uma Izzie package, which includes one night at Nihi Oka's one and only Honeymoon Villa. Wellness Sanctuary at Kamalaya Wellness Sanctuary & Holistic Spa, Koh Samui, Thailand Built around a monk's cave, this retreat combines integrative holistic medicine with Eastern as well as Western therapies to balance mind and spirit. Wellness packages include programmes for stress and burnout, detox, optimal fitness, ideal weight, emotional balance, sleep enhancement and yoga. Book at least five or seven nights, as it will take two days to leave your urban life behind. The spa treatments include massages, scrubs, acupuncture, shirodhara liquid therapy, and chi nei tsang abdominal massage. Opt for yoga classes, dips in the plunge pools and moments in the steam cavern in-between. A tip: schedule an evening spa and ask for the treatment room in the corner, built on stilts. Sit back and enjoy a soundtrack of cicadas in the background. Fivelements, Bali, Indonesia Raw vegan dishes make this eco-luxury wellness retreat in the Balinese jungle along the Ayung River stand out. It also dishes up authentic Balinese healing traditions (energy healing, deep bodywork, and meditation) and yoga. Based on traditional Balinese recipes, superfood ingredients are freshly prepared and also used in the beauty treatments, massages and bathing rituals. Cucumbers are sliced to create hydrating facial masks, and Balinese salt crystals are mixed with virgin coconut oil for rich body scrubs.Aloe vera and kaffir lime are pressed for revitalising bath rituals, while raw cacao is heated up for a deeply nourishing body mask. You can choose between the Rejuvenation Retreat, Detox Retreat and the Culinary Retreat.

The water can also ease joint and nerve pain and heal skin ailments, as well as burns and cuts.
