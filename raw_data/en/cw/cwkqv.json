In five simple steps, it will give you the information you need about the virus and the vaccine, and help you think about what the risks and benefits of vaccination mean for your family. We have also produced a decision aid for people aged 16 and over. If you want to think about whether COVID-19 vaccination is right for you, change to the COVID-19 Decision Aid (16+ years).

Decision aids can help you make decisions about your health.1 They do three things to prepare you to make a decision:1 They give you information about a medicine or health problem and outline the available options. They help you work out what matters most (your 'values'). They help you share your thoughts and values with your healthcare provider and others. This means that you can plan a course of action that matches your values. Decision aids do not direct you to choose one option over another.2 We developed this patient decision aid using the decision support format of the Ottawa Health Decision Centre at the University of Ottawa and Ottawa Health Research Institute, Ontario, Canada.1 This decision aid contains information relating specifically to children (aged 5-15). If you are making a decision about vaccination for yourself, we recommend that you use the COVID-19 Decision Aid (16+ years). We used the best available research about COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccines to develop this decision aid. First, we looked closely at the research studies from around the world to find out what happens when a child gets COVID-19 or has the COVID-19 vaccine. Then we reviewed all the research and summarised it in this decision aid. Other countries approved the COVID-19 vaccine for children earlier than Australia, giving us good data to consult, including side-effects reported by parents, doctors and hospitals. We will update this decision aid as important new research becomes available.
