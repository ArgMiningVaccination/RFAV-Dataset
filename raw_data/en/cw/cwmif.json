[1](#B1)). In Korea, there are many -glucan products available on the market, which are generally extracted from mushrooms, such as Phellinus linteus or Sparassis crispa. [2](#B2)). In addition, cornstarch, which is a hydrosoluble fiber, does not lower the cholesterol levels. Moreover, while a large number of insoluble fibers increase the quantity of stools, cellulose does not. However, although their categorization suggests that they should not, some hydrosoluble fibers, such as oat bran and psyllium, increase the quantity of stools. [3](#B3)), and offered the following categories: 1) total fiber, which is the sum of dietary fiber and functional fiber, 2) functional fibers, which are physiologically beneficial nondigestible carbohydrates. These categories are quite broad and need to be refined considerably if they are to be of any use in clinical settings. The panel also determined that the recommended daily intake of fiber is 38 g and 25 g for adult men and women or adolescents, respectively ( [4](#B4)). The aim of this study was to determine future research directions. SEARCH STRATEGY RESULTS OF CLINICAL EXPERIMENTS Immune modulator [5](#B5)- [10](#B10)). Cholesterol reduction [11](#B11)- [15](#B15)). [16](#B16)). However, dietary fibers differ in viscosity and fermentability, and their effects depend on these properties ( [3](#B3)). Therefore, it is essential to determine the function of all dietary fibers individually. [17](#B17)). In 1999, Brown et al. reported the results of meta-analysis on the effect of cholesterol reduction when hydrosoluble fibers such as pectin, oat bran, guar gum and psyllium were administered. They showed that the cholesterol level decreased by 1.73 mg/dL per gram of hydrosoluble fiber when 2-10 g of hydrosoluble fiber was administered, which is not very high but significant. The results also showed that oats, pectin and psyllium had a similar effect on the blood lipids, and did not affect the triglyceride or HDL cholesterol levels. In addition, the results did not show a difference between each research design, treatment period, the quantity of dietary fat ( [16](#B16)). [18](#B18)). In 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acknowledged that hydrosoluble fiber obtained from oat (oat bran, oatmeal and oat flour) can reduce the risk of cardiac disease ( [Table 1](#T1)). The FDA reported that more than 3 g of hydrosoluble fiber from oats per day are needed to achieve significant reductions in cholesterol. Most studies on -glucan in oats produced positive results but some studies reported no effect ( [19](#B19)- [22](#B22)). This inconsistency can be explained in several ways: amount of -glucan intake, the type of diet or supplements, the molecular size of -glucan, the baseline cholesterol level, dose-response and long-term effect. Amount of -glucan intake [19](#B19)). However, Karmally et al. reported that the total cholesterol level fell significantly by 10.9\u00b121.6 mg/dL (4.5%) when 152 Hispanic people were fed either oat cereal (3 g of -glucan per day) or corn cereal for six weeks ( [23](#B23)). This shows that the intake alone cannot explain the degree to which -glucan is effective in reducing the cholesterol level. Type of diets or supplements [24](#B24)). Indeed, many studies in which -glucan had been administered in bread did not report any reduction in the cholesterol level. Torronen et al. reported no difference in the lipid level when oat bran bread (11.2 g of -glucan) was fed to patients with mild or moderate hypercholesterolemia for eight weeks ( [20](#B20)), and Leadbetter et al. also reported no significant difference in the cholesterol level in 40 hyperlipidemic patients given bread prepared with 30, 60 or 90 g of oat fiber was ( [25](#B25)). However, some studies report that feeding hyperlipidemic patients -glucan in bread was effective ( [26](#B26)). Molecular size of -glucan [20](#B20)) and Beer et al. ( [21](#B21)) explained the ineffectiveness of the intake of -glucan by the small molecular size of the sample ingested. The molecular size of -glucan used by Torronen et al. was relatively small (370,000) and that used by Beer et al. was 1,000,000. The molecular size of -glucan used by Braaten et al. was 1,200,000, in which -glucan was effective in reducing the cholesterol level ( [18](#B18)). This suggests that the molecular size should be at least 1,200,000 for -glucan to be effective. However, the molecular size of -glucan used in Kerckhoffs et al. study was less than 100,000 and was found to be effective ( [24](#B24)). Therefore, this mechanism cannot explain all the results either. Subject variation of baseline cholesterol level [17](#B17)). However, Brown et al. reported that there was virtually no relationship between the baseline cholesterol level and the reduction in cholesterol ( [16](#B16)). Among the three clinical experiments on patients without hyperlipidemia, two produced effective results but one did not. Beer et al. reported no significant difference in the total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels of 14 randomly selected young men who ingested oat gum (9 g of -glucan per day) for 14 days ( [25](#B25)). Robitaille et al. reported no significant change in the cholesterol level when 34 menopausal women were fed oat bran muffins for 4 weeks ( [22](#B22)). In contrast, Reyna et al. reported that the lipid level in 16 well-controlled Type 2 diabetic patients was improved more by a low-calorie diet (containing oat -glucan instead of fat) than by the diet recommended by the American Diabetes Association ( [27](#B27)). Dose response [17](#B17)). 10 g and 8 g of dietary fiber was a significant cutoff point for cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, respectively. Davison et al. reported that when 156 hyperlipidemia patients were fed 28, 56 or 84 g of oatmeal or oat bran for six weeks, a significant reduction in the LDL cholesterol level was observed only in the groups fed 84 g of oatmeal. The level of reduction in those given 28 g, 56 g and 84 g of oat bran were 10.1%, 15.9% and 11.5%, respectively. There appeared to be a general trend with dose but no obvious dose-response relationship ( [28](#B28)). Long-term effect [29](#B29), [30](#B30)). [31](#B31)). Lupton al. reported that 79 hyperlipidemic patients fed meals supplemented with 3 g of barley oil extract or 30 g of barley wheat flour showed a decrease in the LDL cholesterol level by 6.5% (barley wheat flour)-9.2% (barley oil extract) than those given 20 g cellulose ( [32](#B32)). Behall et al. examined 18 patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia. They showed that three groups fed different amounts of barley showed a linear reduction in the total cholesterol level of 14%, 17% and 20%, respectively, compared with that of the control group ( [33](#B33)). However, Keogh et al. divided 18 patients with mild hyperlipidemia into two groups and gave them -glucan extracted from barley (8.1-11.9 g per day) or 6.5-9.2 g of glucose with the same number of calories over a four-week period. However, they did not observe any difference in the total cholesterol level ( [34](#B34)). [35](#B35)). As mentioned above, yeast -glucan has a low viscosity and hydrosolubility. Therefore, if the results of the clinical experiment are accepted, the effect is not likely to be caused by an increase in viscosity in the small intestine, and should be explained by a different mechanism, such as an increase in the production of short-chain fatty acids or decrease in the blood insulin concentration. Effects on blood sugar [36](#B36)). In addition, grains such as oats and barley generally have a low glycemic index, so they help to improve the glycometabolism. Jennie et al. compared the results of 14 randomized controlled trials that compared the effect of a diet with a low blood sugar index with other usual diets on diabetic patients. They reported that the HbA1C concentration decreased by 0.43% (95% CI 0.13-0.73) in the groups fed a diet with a low blood sugar index. This effect is comparable to that of acarbose and insulin lispro regarding the reduction of the postprandial blood sugar level ( [37](#B37)). In general, grains, fruit, and vegetables are recommended because they contain many vitamins, minerals and fiber, which promote health. However, the American Diabetes Association has not yet made a judgment as to whether a higher intake of fiber is helpful in controlling sugar, in either people with diabetes or in the general population ( [38](#B38)). [39](#B39)). Reyna et al. reported the results of well-controlled Type 2 diabetic patients fed a diet recommended by the American Diabetes Association and a low-calorie diet that contained -glucan (oat extract instead of fat) for four weeks. They found that the -glucan diet group showed greater improvement in the HbA1C level ( [27](#B27)). Jenkins et al. fed 17 volunteer Type 2 diabetics with 50 g of white bread, commercial oatmeal cereal (4.4 g% -glucan), -glucan reinforced morning cereal (8.1 -glucan) or a -glucan reinforced bar (6.5 g% -glucan) and measured their blood sugar level. They showed that the blood sugar of those subjects who ate the reinforced morning cereal and reinforced bar was lower than in those who ate the oatmeal cereal and white bread ( [40](#B40)). Pick et al. gave 80 Type 2 diabetics an oat bran extract or white bread with the same number of calories for 12 weeks and found significant differences in the area below the average blood sugar curve and the insulin peak ( [41](#B41)). They suggested that oat -glucan fed to diabetics has positive effects on blood sugar, HbA1C, insulin, etc. and recommended an oat or barley diet for diabetic patients. [42](#B42)). There were two randomized controlled studies that fed -glucan to hyperlipidemic patients, both of which reported no difference in the blood glucose level of the sugar control through a -glucan diet ( [31](#B31), [34](#B34)). [15](#B15)). Li et al. reported that there was no difference in blood sugar in 10 volunteer women fed a standard diet and barley diet for four weeks ( [43](#B43)). Lovergrove et al. reported no difference in the fasting blood sugar level and insulin secretion when oat bran concentrate or wheat bran was fed to 62 healthy adults over an eight week period ( [19](#B19)). Juntunen et al. fed 20 adults with normal glucose tolerance with rye bread, wheat bread, rye bread containing oat extract, wheat pasta or white wheat bread and observed them for eight hours. The results showed that the blood sugar curve was similar. However, the insulin concentration was lowest in those fed with the bread containing the oat extract ( [44](#B44)). Overall, these reports show that barley, oat, etc. does not have any significant effect on the blood sugar in people whose glucose tolerance is normal. Body weight reduction [45](#B45)) and the obesity rate is low in those whose food intake contains an adequate amount of fiber ( [46](#B46)). Moreover, an inverse correlation has been reported between the fiber intake and weight ( [47](#B47)) as well as with the body mass index. The Nurse's Health Study found that the amount of weight gain is lower in those whose diet contains an adequate amount of fiber ( [48](#B48)). Most observational studies reported that the intake of fiber reduces the level of weight gain or the risk of obesity. However, several intervention studies did not report a clear conclusion. At best, there are reports showing that additional weight loss is achieved through the addition of fiber to a low-calorie diet (5.8 kg vs. 8.0 kg) ( [49](#B49)) and that the weight decreases with increasing amount of carbohydrate in the diet ( [50](#B50)). According to Howarth et al., the effect of dietary fiber intake on weight loss is greater in obese people, and an additional intake of 14 g of dietary fiber reduced the energy intake by 10% and reduced the weight by 1.9 kg over a four-month period ( [51](#B51)). In general, the effect of fiber on weight control is affected by the blood sugar level, which is ultimately related to hunger, insulin secretion, gastric emptying time and the intestinal hormones response ( [42](#B42)). However, because most clinical experiments do not distinguish between the different types of fiber, it is unclear if a specific fiber, -glucan in particular, is more or less effective in reducing weight. [17](#B17), [41](#B41)). In another study, no significant effect on weight was observed in 68 hyperlipidemic patients given a high fiber ( -glucan) diet compared with a control group ( [40](#B40)). However, these clinical experiments focused on the changes in blood sugar or blood lipid. Therefore, the long duration for observing weight change could be a limitation. The inconsistent ground data on the effect of dietary or supplementary -glucan on weight highlights the need for further research. Infections [1](#B1)), which may facilitate the prevention of infection or affect the progress of infections already contracted. Four studies examined whether or not feeding yeast -glucan reduces the risk of a postoperative infection. Babineau et al. published two randomized controlled studies on the risk of postoperative infections in patients who had undergone thoracic or abdominal surgery. In the two studies, PGG-glucan was fed to 67 and 34 patients who had undergone thoracic and abdominal surgery, respectively, and reported a significantly lower risk of postoperative infections ( [52](#B52), [53](#B53)). The Betafectin Gastrointestinal 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg of PGG-glucan and a placebo to 1,249 high-risk patients who had undergone gastrointestinal surgery and reported no difference in serious infections but showed that the risk of serious infection and death decreased by 39% in cases other than large intestine operations. However, the clinical experiment was stopped early because there were more frequent abnormal reactions in the PGG-glucan administered group ( [54](#B54)). Hamano et al. reported that, when lentinan or a placebo was administered randomly to 25 patients who had undergone cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, the intervention group easily recovered from the lymphocyte hypofunction that had been observed after surgery ( [55](#B55)). It was also reported that the frequencies of sepsis and death decreased significantly when a placebo or -glucan was administered to 41 patients who had incurred severe damage but who had not undergone surgery ( [56](#B56)). [57](#B57)). Cancer [58](#B58)- [61](#B61)), and the survival time of the subjects was extended in all four cases. Three studies were carried out on operable or postoperative cases ( [62](#B62)- [64](#B64)) but no effect regarding survival was observed except in one case of postoperative administration. The remaining two studies did not state the stage of stomach cancer but reported that the survival time of the subjects was extended significantly ( [65](#B65), [66](#B66)). [67](#B67)) was applied to patients at stage IB-IV, and the others were applied to patients at stages II or III ( [68](#B68)- [72](#B72)). They compared the survival time, complete remission rate, recurrence, the size of tumor, etc., with positive results being obtained in most cases. [73](#B73)). Among the 33 patients with recurrent breast cancer, those who were injected with lentinan (LNT), postoperatively, showed slower tumor growth than "}
