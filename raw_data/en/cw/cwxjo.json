Front cover Living next to the Welsh coastline in the UK naturally drew young Jack Fraser to the sea and the chance to develop his surng skills. However, his asthma and symptoms such as tightness in his chest meant that he could not breathe properly and was reluctant to go outside. His mother, Catherine, heard about Seretide from a friend and eventually obtained a prescription for her son. The result? Jack can be seen practising his surng skills on a regular basis and has also developed a keen interest in golf.

For most companies, a threat to sales on this Merger and integration items represent those items that have arisen as a result of the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline B eecham and the acquisition of Block Drug. Restructuring costs arise from the merger and acquisition and from manufacturing restructuri ng programmes that had already been agreed by Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham before the date of the merger. These items by their nature are considered to be outside the normal business expenditure of GlaxoSmithKline and are not expected to occur on a regular basis. Statutory results which appear on pages 88 and 89 include these items. Other costs associated with restructuring activities that arise outside these specic restructuring programmes are not treated as exceptional items. Pricing pressures also continue. In the USA, this has come from scale would be catastrophic. But we expect to be able to weather pressure to cut pharmaceutical prices for senior citizens and efforts the impact well - partly because of our size, partly through the to allow the unregulated import of lower priced drugs from introduction of improved versions of these medicines and partly abroad.

At the same time, we expect to see a big increase in pioneering the availability of preferentially priced medicines and the number of major new compounds entering Phase III trials vaccines. We believe we remain the only pharmaceutical company from our promising pipeline. The Group's reports led with or furnished to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including this document and written information released, or oral statements made, to the public in the future by or on behalf of the Group, may contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give the Group's current expectations or forecasts of future events. An investor can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as 'anticipate', 'estimate', 'expect', 'intend', 'will', 'project', 'plan', 'believe' and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or nancial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and nancial results. The Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. conducting research into the prevention and treatment of the World Health Organization's three priority diseases of the Broad product portfolio drives growth developing world; HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria.

Such factors include, but are not limited to, strong. those discussed under 'Risk factors' on pages 74 to 76 of this Annual Report. The bases for business performance results and CER growth rates are explained on page 2. 04 GlaxoSmithKline Joint statement by the Chairman and the Chief Executive Ofcer GlaxoSmithKline 05 The company now has 10 major products (accounting for \u00a37.6 billion of sales) growing in strong double digits. These include Seretide/Advair for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which grew 39 per cent during the year to \u00a32.2 billion, and is now one of the top 10 pharmaceutical brands in the world. Our diabetes treatments A vandia/A vandamet also continue to perform well, with sales of \u00a30.9 billion, up 24 per cent. Products like Va ltrex for herpes and Lamictal for epilepsy are growing very strongly and are now approaching blockbuster status. Also both our vaccines and HIV/AIDS businesses have sales of over \u00a31 billion. New product launches in 2003 and 2004 Several new and important products were introduced in 2003. Highlights included US launches of W ellbutrin XL, a new and improved version of the anti-depressant, and Levitra for erectile dysfunction. Approval was received for Lexiva for HIV/AIDS, Advair for COPD and Lamictal for bi-polar disorder in the USA, and Avandamet for diabetes in Europe. We plan to make several signicant product launches and lings during 2004. These include: solifenacin for over-active bladder (developed with our partner Yamanouchi Pharmaceuticals Ltd of Japan); Avandaryl, a xed-dose combination treatment which will further extend the A vandia family of treatments for type 2 diabetes; and Epivir plus Ziagen, the rst once-daily combination HIV/AIDS treatment to be available in a single tablet. Building a strong and diverse R&D pipeline 2003 provided the clearest evidence yet of our success in creating the most productive R&D organisation in the industry. At our R&D Day in December we demonstrated how our re-designed R&D operation is delivering a product pipeline of exceptional diversity, quality and quantity that will drive the future growth of the company. We now have 148 projects in clinical development. These span a variety of therapeutic areas and encompass a number of pioneering approaches to treating patients, including exciting new compounds in the areas of oncology and cardio-vascular disease. The 148 projects include 83 new chemical entities (NCEs), 45 product line extensions (PLEs) and 20 vaccines. 46 of the NCEs are now in clinical Phases II and III/registration and we expect to make a record number of lings over the next ve years. As many as 20 of these compounds have the potential to reach blockbuster status. Included in the many promising compounds highlighted in December were: '016, a rst of its kind dual kinase inhibitor for the treatment of breast and lung cancer; Cervarix, a vaccine with the potential to prevent more than 70 per cent of cervical cancers; '162, a next-generation anti-depressant; Lp-PLA2 inhibitors which target a newly identied risk factor for heart disease; odiparcil, a novel anti-blood clotting treatment, and '381, the rst dual action COX-2 inhibitor targeting both inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Building on our strong heritage in respiratory medicine, we are also developing a next-generation Seretide/Advair - a once-daily combination of a selective beta2 agonist, '797, developed with Theravance Inc. Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility has particular resonance for the pharmaceutical sector. Our business is creating medicines to treat and prevent disease - something that society needs and values. At the same time, healthcare and the way it is delivered and funded provoke much debate. Our third Corporate Responsibility Report sets out the issues that we face in this area and explains how we are addressing them. Where possible, performance measures are included to show our progress. Signicant achievements this year include the progress we are making in our programmes for the developing world, such as our efforts to eliminate lymphatic lariasis (LF or elephantiasis), a debilitating disease affecting 120 million people. The World Health Organization target is to eliminate LF by 2020, by which time we expect to have donated six billion treatments of our medicine albendazole, worth around $1 billion. This is one of the pharmaceutical industry's largest ever donation programmes. We reduced the not-for-prot prices of our HIV treatments twice in 2003, taking the price of Combivir down from $1.70 to just 65 cents a day. However, much more needs to be done to tackle the enormous HIV/AIDS crisis. Real progress will only be made if responsibility is shared by all sectors of global society - governments, international agencies and companies such as GlaxoSmithKline. We are very proud of our global community investment of \u00a3338 million, 5.3 per cent of the Group's pre-tax prot. This included \u00a3125 million for the Group's Patient Assistance Programs and other initiatives for low-income groups in the USA and \u00a3105 million of humanitarian product donations. Governance The Financial Reporting Council's new Combined Code on Corporate Governance was published in 2003. The Board supports the New Code and has moved quickly to bring GlaxoSmithKline's governance procedures substantially in line with the best practices that flow from the Code. Acknowledgements During the year there were a number of changes to the Board. The Board now benets from the direct presence of Dr Tachi Yamada, who has great knowledge and experience in medical practice as well as the pharmaceutical industry. Three new Non-Executive Directors joined the Board during the year: Larry Culp, President of Danaher Corporation; Crispin Davis, Chief Executive of Reed Elsevier PLC; and Sir Robert Wilson, Chairman of BG Group plc. They each bring many years of experience and successful track records in different industries. Their undoubted skills further strengthen the Board. Sir Roger Hurn and Paul Allaire left the Board in June. Dr Mich\u00e8le Barzach, John McArthur and Donald McHenry will step down from the Board after the AGM in May. We express our appreciation to each of them for their contribution to the company and for their dedicated and effective service to the Board. In conclusion, on behalf of the Board and the Corporate Executive Team, we thank you, our shareholders, for your continued support through this challenging time.

GlaxoSmithKline's principal competitors are large international pharmaceutical companies with substantial resources. Some of these companies and their major products are mentioned below. Pharmaceuticals may be subject to competition from other products during the period of patent protection and, once off patent, from generic versions. The manufacturers of generic products typically do not bear signicant research and development costs and consequently are able to offer their products at considerably lower prices than the branded competitors. A research and development based pharmaceutical company will normally seek to achieve a sufciently high prot margin and sales volume during the period of patent protection to repay the original investment, which is generally substantial, and to fund research for the future. Competition from generic products generally occurs as patents in major markets expire. Increasingly patent challenges are made, prior to patent expiry, claiming that the innovator patent is not valid and/or that it is not infringed by the generic product. Following loss of patent protection, generic products rapidly capture a large share of the market, particularly in the USA. GlaxoSmithKline undertakes a range of activities to maximise the value of its intellectual property, including introducing innovative products into as many markets as possible, accelerating the process to bring new products to market developing improved, patent protected, versions of older products and increasing brand recognition among customers. GlaxoSmithKline believes that its competitive position is dependent upon the discovery and development of new products, together with effective marketing of existing products. Within the pharmaceutical industry, the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may affect pricing levels or result in product replacement. There can be no assurance that products may not become outmoded, notwithstanding patent or trade mark protection. In addition, increasing government and other pressure for physicians and patients to use generic pharmaceuticals, rather than brand-name medicines, may increase competition for products that are no longer protected by patent. CNS disorders Major competitors in the USA to Paxil are its generic forms, launched in September, fluoxetine, the generic form of Eli Lilly's Prozac, Zoloft from Pzer, Forest Laboratories' Celexa and Lexapro. The principal competitors in the USA for W ellbutrin are SSRIs and Effexor XR, a Wyeth product. Limited generic competition to Wellbutrin began in the USA in January 2004. The success of Seroxat/Paxil and Wellbutrin has made them a target for generic manufacturers, against whom GlaxoSmithKline continues to respond appropriately (see Note 30 to the Financial statements, 'Legal proceedings'). The recent launches of Paxil CR and the once-daily W ellbutrin XL are expected to help to retain a strong presence in the anti-depressant market, given the recent entry of generic paroxetine in the USA. Generic competition has also commenced in the UK and a number of other markets. Respiratory GlaxoSmithKline's respiratory franchise is driven by the growth of Seretide/Advair, gaining patients from competitor products and the cannibalisation of Serevent and Flixotide. Ventolin and Becotide have faced generic competition for some years but have maintained signicant sales. Major respiratory competitors are Singulair from Merck, especially in the USA and in Europe, Symbicort from AstraZeneca and Spiriva from Pzer/Boehringer Ingelheim. Anti-virals The major competitors in the HIV market are Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck and Pzer amongst others. GlaxoSmithKline has a pioneering role in the HIV market, with Retrovir and Epivir acting as the cornerstone of combination therapy, and available as Combivir in a single tablet. The launches of Ziagen, Agenerase, Trizivir and Lexiva have broadened the Group's portfolio of HIV products. Valtrex has helped strengthen the Group's position in the anti-herpes area, although Zovirax faces competition from generic aciclovir. Both Valtrex and Zovirax compete with Novartis' Famvir. Zefx was the rst anti-viral on the market to treat Hepatitis B. Gilead's Hepsera is the second and was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2002. Anti-bacterials and anti-malarials In 2002 generic versions of both Augmentin and Ceftin/Zinnat were introduced in the USA, following successful legal challenges by generic manufacturers (see Note 30 to the Financial statements, 'Legal proceedings'). Augmentin has already lost patent protection in various countries in Europe. Augmentin XR and Augmentin ES compete against a broad range of other branded and generic antibiotics. Malarone's safety prole and convenient dosing regimen have helped put this product in a strong position versus mefloquine following its recent launch for malaria prophylaxis. Metabolic The major competitor for A vandia is Takeda Chemical's Actos, which is co-promoted with Eli Lilly in the USA. Vaccines GlaxoSmithKline's major competitors in the vaccine market include Aventis Pasteur (AP), Merck and Wyeth. Engerix-B and Havrix compete with vaccines produced by AP and Merck - Comvax and Recombivax HB for hepatitis B, and Vaqta and Avaxim for hepatitis A. Infanrix's major competitor is AP's range of DTPa-based combination vaccines. Oncology and emesis Zofran presently provides GlaxoSmithKline a leadership position in the anti-emetic market where the competition includes Roche/Chugai, Aventis and most recently Merck. Major competitors in the diverse cytotoxic market include Bristol Myers Squibb, Aventis, Pzer and Novartis. GlaxoSmithKline's cytotoxic portfolio, led by Hycamtin and Navelbine, holds a relatively small market position. Cardiovascular and urogenital GlaxoSmithKline markets Coreg in the USA where its major competitors are Toprol XL and generic betablockers. During 2003, the Group launched two urogenital products: Levitra and Avodart. Avodart the BPH market. Levitra is marketed for male erectile dysfunction and faces competition from Pzer's Viagra and Lilly's Cialis. Competition - Consumer Healthcare The main competitors in the Group's Consumer Healthcare markets include the major international companies Colgate-Palmolive, Johnson & Johnson, Pzer, Procter & Gamble, Unilever and Wyeth. In addition, there are many other companies that compete with GlaxoSmithKline in selected markets. The major competitor products in over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are: in the USA: Metamucil (laxative), Clearasil (acne treatment), Pepcid (indigestion) and private label smoking control products in the UK: Lemsip (cold remedy), Nurofen and Anadin (analgesics), and Nicorette and Nicotinell (smoking control remedies). In Oral healthcare the major competitors are Colgate-Palmolive's Colgate and Procter & Gamble's Crest. In Nutritional healthcare the major competitors to Horlicks are Ovaltine and Milo malted food and chocolate drinks. The competitors to Ribena are primarily local fruit juice products while Lucozade competes with other energy drinks. GlaxoSmithKline holds leading global positions in all its key consumer product areas. Worldwide it is the second largest in Oral care and the third largest in OTC medicines. In Nutritional healthcare it holds the leading position in the UK, India and Ireland. Regulation - Pharmaceuticals The international pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated. National regulatory authorities administer a panoply of laws and regulations governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, labelling and marketing of drugs and also review the safety and efcacy of pharmaceutical products. These regulatory requirements are a major factor in determining whether a substance can be developed into a marketable product and the amount of time and expense associated with such development. Of particular importance is the requirement in many countries that products be authorised or registered prior to marketing and that such authorisation or registration be maintained subsequently. The national regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions, including the USA, the European Union, Japan and Australia, have high standards of technical appraisal and consequently the introduction of new pharmaceutical products generally entails a lengthy approval process. In the European Union, there are currently two procedures for obtaining marketing authorisations for medicinal products: The Centralised Procedure, with applications made direct to the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and leading to an authorisation valid in all member states, is compulsory for products derived from biotechnology and optional for new active substances and other innovative medicinal products The Mutual Recognition Procedure, which is applicable to the majority of conventional medicinal products, operates by mutual recognition of national marketing authorisations. Where agreement cannot be reached, it is resolved by procedure of binding arbitration. Grant of a marketing authorisation affords the Group a protection period during which a competitor cannot rely on condential data in the regulatory le as a basis for its own marketing authorisation. The data protection period begins on the date an authorisation is rst granted in the European Union and expires after ten years for authorisations granted via the Centralised Procedure, or ten or six years for authorisations granted via the Mutual Recognition procedure, depending on the country concerned. In May 2004, the European Union will be expanded from 15 to 25 Member States. In anticipation of this enlargement European regulatory legislation is currently undergoing review. The impact of any changes on regulatory procedures and data protection periods remains to be seen. In the USA, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman) established the current framework for approval of generic drugs, including related patent and data protection provisions. Under Hatch-Waxman, the sponsor of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) can receive marketing approval without submitting any safety or efcacy data. It can rely on the pioneer company's extensive pre-clinical and clinical development data, provided the proposed generic drug has been demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the pioneer product. However, generic drug approvals are subject to data protection periods of ve years for new chemical entities and three years for any modications supported by new clinical studies. Moreover, under the provisions of Hatch-Waxman, the ling of an ANDA can trigger procedures that may allow patent holders to initiate patent infringement litigation with the signicant procedural advantage of being assured that the FDA's approval of the proposed generic product will be stayed for up to 30 months, pending resolution of the litigation. These procedures have generated litigation and controversy, particularly because, as currently applied, they have resulted in multiple, non-concurrent 30-month stays for some proposed generic products. In June 2003, the FDA issued new regulations to clarify certain aspects of its procedures that have generated controversy. In addition, in November 2003 new laws were enacted by the US Congress that modied the Hatch-Waxman laws. These modications eliminated the grant of additional 30-month stays for patents issued after an ANDA is led, and limited the grant of a 30-month stay to one per ANDA applicant under most circumstances. In the USA, the second reauthorisation of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act came into effect on 1st October 2002 (PDUFA III). It remains to be seen if the substantial additional resources funded under PDUFA III will result in a reduction of overall approval times for all drugs and biologicals. However, one of the requirements under PDUFA III calls for the FDA to initiate a review of rst action approvals compared to approvable or non-approvable decisions and to report back on the ndings of this review. The FDA has also completed the previously announced consolidation of the review activities of certain biologicals, other than vaccines, to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). This consolidation also entailed a shifting of resources from the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) to CDER. The impact of this shift in resources remains to be seen. 12 GlaxoSmithKline Description of business Description of business GlaxoSmithKline 13 Operating activities Along with the PDUFA III rst action review and consolidation Value for money Marketing and distribution - Pharmaceuticals Stakeholder initiatives of some CBER review activities into CDER, the FDA has also It is becoming increasingly necessary to demonstrate the value for During 2003 the company launched several initiatives to improve announced, under the sponsorship of the Commissioner, a money of new products, in particular the impact upon drug budget An analysis of total pharmaceutical turnover by geographic region its abilities to deliver important information to physicians and renewed focus on innovation in drug development, hopefully expenditure and the burden of the disease that will be treated. is set out below: patients about diseases and therapies to treat them. allowing more rapid development of needed medicines. This initiative will investigate the use of pharmacogenomics and surrogate markers of efcacy, among other things, as tools for rapidly developing safe and effective drugs for unmet medical needs. Across International markets, countries outside the USA and Europe, the regulatory environment continues to be extremely varied and challenging. GlaxoSmithKline anticipates that the introduction of new products will continue to require substantial effort, time and expense to comply with regulatory requirements. Price controls In some markets, the need to satisfy healthcare purchasers as to value for money is becoming an additional hurdle for product acceptance over and above the regulatory tests of safety, efcacy and quality. This can delay bringing effective and improved medicines to the market and reduce their effective patent protection time. In many markets it is becoming increasingly difcult for even a signicantly improved therapy to obtain a premium price over existing medication. Value-based pricing may be difcult to follow in such circumstances, although in the USA it is still possible to price products to reflect their value. 2003 Turnover by geographic region \u00a3m USA 9,410 Europe 5,114 International: Asia Pacic 1,140 Japan 753 Latin America 597 Middle East, Africa 693 Canada 474 18,181 2002 \u00a3m 9,797 Sales force excellence The Worldwide Sales Force Excellence initiative focuses on increasing GlaxoSmithKline sales representatives' skills in providing value to healthcare professionals around the globe. A centrepiece of the project is a global framework for training that will raise the standards for representatives' knowledge about diseases and the role of GlaxoSmithKline medicines in treating them. The training will also address how to answer the central questions each physician faces when deciding on a patient's treatment: When should I use a GlaxoSmithKline medicine, why should I use it, and how should I use it? In many countries the prices of pharmaceutical products are It is not possible to predict whether, and to what extent, the GlaxoSmithKline sells its prescription medicines primarily to The initiative aims to build on the good reputation that controlled by law. Governments may also influence prices through Group's business may be affected by future legislative and wholesale drug distributors, independent and chain retail GlaxoSmithKline sales forces already enjoy among physicians their control of national healthcare organisations, which may bear regulatory developments relating to specic pharmaceutical pharmacies, physicians, hospitals, clinics, government entities and worldwide.

These products are ordinarily dispensed to the recently rated GlaxoSmithKline sales representatives No. 1 in the Recent Government healthcare reforms in countries such as France, Spain and Germany may restrict pricing and reimbursement. In the USA, recent legislation on healthcare reform, cross-border trade, the acceleration of generics to market and increased patient contributions have further increased the focus on pricing. Currently there are no government price controls over private sector purchases, but federal legislation requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay prescribed rebates on certain drugs in order to be eligible for reimbursement under Medicaid and other federal healthcare programmes. Medicare The US Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 provides limited immediate benets to Medicare patients in the form of government sponsored discount cards to be replaced with a comprehensive out-patient drug benet in 2006. The benet is intended to be administered by a number of private organisations who will construct benet structures consistent with federal law and will market the benet to Medicare patients. While the law provides strong incentives for manufacturers to negotiate prices with plan sponsors, the bill does not provide for explicit government price controls. As most seniors already have some sort of out-patient drug coverage, increases in demand may Regulation - Consumer Healthcare The consumer healthcare industry is subject to national regulation for the testing, approval, manufacturing, labelling and marketing of products. In many countries high standards of technical appraisal entail a lengthy approval process before a new product is launched. National regulatory authorisation is also required to approve the switch of products from prescription to OTC. The requirements include long-term experience of the quality, safety and efcacy of the product in a wide patient population and data to conrm that the relevant condition is both self-limiting and can easily be diagnosed by the consumer. public by pharmacies through prescriptions written by doctors in hospitals or in doctors' surgeries. In the USA, the world's largest pharmaceutical market, the pressure to contain healthcare costs has encouraged the growth of managed care organisations and pharmacy benet managers. These intermediaries use a range of methods to lower costs, including the substitution of generic products or other cheaper therapies for branded products prescribed by doctors. As a result of its increasing importance as a supplier of healthcare to the community, GlaxoSmithKline contracts with the managed care sector through a small number of wholesalers. In each market, GlaxoSmithKline deploys sales forces of representatives and supporting medical staff to promote its prescription products to medical prescribers and healthcare purchasers through personal visits. Promotion of GlaxoSmithKline's products is supplemented by scientic seminars, advertising in medical and other journals, television advertising, provision of samples, direct mailing and information contained on the Group's website. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising is a major component of product marketing in the USA. DTC advertisements are now the primary source of information for patients requesting specic brand name products from their physicians in the USA. industry in the UK, Germany, France and Spain, and No. 1 in the US among pulmonologists, allergists/immunologists, paediatricians, neurologists, ear, nose and throat specialists, and infectious disease specialists. (Source for rankings: Taylor Nelson Sofres Healthcare 2002 for Europe; Verispan 2003 for USA). Marketing excellence Goals of the global Marketing Excellence initiative are rst, to help undiagnosed patients seek a physician's help and, second, to ensure they receive appropriate treatment. For example, in the UK, ofcials estimate that 2.4 million people suffer from type 2 diabetes, yet about 25 per cent of them remain undiagnosed, and of those diagnosed, another 25 per cent remain untreated. Of those treated, a signicant number is under-treated in some way - that is, these patients do not achieve the level of health that the treatments could provide under optimal circumstances. GlaxoSmithKline's marketing initiative explores barriers to proper diagnosis and treatment, and implements programmes to overcome them. As these programmes begin to show effects, the societal costs of disease will decrease. To the extent that physicians choose a GlaxoSmithKline product for their patients' treatment, the company will benet as well.

Instead of reimbursement based on prices published by independent pricing services, the new law provides for reimbursement that is based on the actual market prices as reported by manufacturers and audited by the government. In addition, beginning in 2006, physicians will have the option of subject to certain safeguards. In New Zealand, DTC is allowed and self-regulated by the industry in collaboration with the Advertising Standards Agency. Other markets allow DTC, but to date the impact has been more limited. In addition to the direct marketing of products by its subsidiaries, GlaxoSmithKline has entered into agreements with other pharmaceutical companies for the co-marketing and co-promotion brought as many as 300 leaders of patient groups together to seek areas of common interest among each other and with GlaxoSmithKline, and to plan actions around them. Working together, these groups strive for continued open access to all appropriate medicines for their constituencies - an increasing challenge in a time of tightening budgets - and champion continued investments in the development of new medicines. choosing not to purchase or claim reimbursement for products at of their products in many markets, for example Levitra with Bayer. A similar approach has been launched in Europe, where patient all, instead allowing drug distributors to provide drugs to doctor's advocacy groups are becoming increasingly organised. ofces and submit claims to Medicare and to patients (for their contributions). These distributors will earn the ability to provide these products and services through a competitive bidding process. 14 GlaxoSmithKline Description of business Description of business GlaxoSmithKline 15 Marketing and distribution - Consumer Healthcare The principal markets for Consumer Healthcare's OTC medicines are the USA, the UK, Germany, Australia, Argentina, Italy, Mexico, Japan, Canada and France. The principal markets for Oral care products are the USA, Germany and the UK. The Nutritional drinks business is particularly strong in the UK, Ireland and India, although the range of products is available in other markets. OTC and Oral care products are primarily distributed through pharmacy or mass market outlets either directly or through wholesalers. Nutritional healthcare products are distributed through a similar but more extensive retail and wholesale network. Project Future In 2003, a fundamental review was undertaken of the Consumer Healthcare business model for Product Innovation and Marketing aimed to increase competitiveness and, thereby, sales growth. The review, termed 'Project Future' has transitioned GlaxoSmithKline's Consumer Healthcare from a geographically based structure with some global strategic support, to one where brands are developed in the most appropriate place. As a result, more responsibility will be taken centrally to develop global brands, and more autonomy will be afforded to local markets to manage their local brands, using their entrepreneurial skills to the full. Manufacture and supply GlaxoSmithKline has a large portfolio of products, ranging from tablets and toothpaste to inhalers and complex capsules, in over 28,000 different pack sizes and presentations. Manufacture of medicines begins with the development of a therapeutic active ingredient (bulk active) in a selected formulation. Global Manufacture & Supply (GMS) develops manufacturing processes for full scale volume production of active compounds at 'primary' manufacturing sites. Converting active compounds into a nished dosage formulation is the responsibility of the 'secondary' manufacturing sites. GMS operates as a single global network of 87 sites in 37 countries. Each year GMS produces around 6,000 tonnes of bulk actives and over four billion packs, which are packaged and delivered for sale in over 160 countries. Throughout the world it also supports approximately 2,000 new product and line extension launches a year. GMS is focused on delivering: a secure source of supply of high quality products compliance with regulatory requirements and customer expectations best in class cost leading edge practices and performance - at sites, in procurement and in other global functions. Organisation Primary supply chain This is a global organisation with 12 sites, spread across ve countries, where a broad range of active ingredients for antibiotic and non-antibiotic products are manufactured and packaged. The sites are located in Australia, Ireland, Singapore, the UK and the USA. The majority of the active ingredients manufactured by the primary supply chain are supplied to the secondary pharmaceutical sites in Europe, North America and International. Secondary supply chain European region There are 15 sites in the European region spread across eight countries. Between them the European sites manufacture nearly all of the major pharmaceutical products marketed globally by GlaxoSmithKline in a wide variety of nished dosage forms. North America region There are six pharmaceutical manufacturing sites in the North America region located in Puerto Rico, Canada and the USA. International region The International region comprises 30 manufacturing sites, in 18 countries, spread across six distinct areas. There are ve sites in Middle East/Africa, 15 sites spread across the Asia Pacic/ Australia area, four sites in China, one in Japan and ve in Latin America. GlaxoSmithKline integration This long-term, integrated change programme implemented at the time of the merger is called the Global Supply Network (GSN) and is structured to deliver benets through ve major streams of activity: Reduction in above-site infrastructure and costs Procurement initiatives Continued network rationalisation Logistics improvements Operational excellence and lean-sigma improvements. As part of the network rationalisation plan, production ceased in 2003 at eight sites in countries which included the UK, India, Romania and the USA. The programme has met its merger commitments one year ahead of plan. External suppliers Procurement is a global function supporting all functions and areas of the GlaxoSmithKline business. Manufacturing is one of the largest areas with over \u00a32 billion spent with many external suppliers every year, including the purchase of active ingredients, chemical intermediates, part-nished and nished products. GMS has taken appropriate steps to protect its supply chains from any disruption resulting from interrupted external supply through appropriate stock levels, contracting and alternative registered suppliers. Vaccines supply chain Vaccine manufacturing is located primarily at Rixensart and Wavre in Belgium, with three other sites in France, Germany and Hungary and two joint ventures in China and Russia. Managing the vaccine supply chain involves anticipating market needs and using a flexible approach to be able to meet fluctuations in demand. These are based on forecasts from the different markets and rm orders from health authorities for mass vaccination campaigns. Bulk, lling and packaging is carefully balanced and stocking of vaccines helps manage short-term increases in demand. Such increases are prompted by disease outbreaks or increased demand from the public owing to disease awareness campaigns. Consumer Healthcare supply chain There are 24 Consumer Healthcare manufacturing sites spread across 16 countries. The Consumer Healthcare supply chain is diverse and includes the manufacturing and supply of OTC medicines, Oral care, Nutritional healthcare and Smoking control products. As well as internal facilities, over 220 contract suppliers are used worldwide. Research and development - Pharmaceuticals The global biological and pharmaceutical Research and Development (R&D) function in GlaxoSmithKline is responsible for discovering, developing, registering, commercialising and supporting effective marketing of innovative prescription medicines, vaccines and delivery systems for the treatment and prevention of human disease. Fundamental to this goal is a thorough understanding of the diseases under investigation, facilitated by pioneering work in genetics and a range of technologies, as well as more traditional research disciplines. In addition to the work to create new medicines and vaccines, extensive efforts are made to gain a clear understanding of the unmet needs of patients and of healthcare providers and payers as a guide to the overall direction of R&D. In 2003 GlaxoSmithKline invested nearly \u00a32.7 billion in pharmaceuticals R&D. R&D is an organisation that benets from the insights of top scientists around the world and employs over 15,000 staff in biological and pharmaceutical R&D activities, at more than 20 sites worldwide, including: UK: Upper Merion and Upper Providence, Triangle Madrid. During 2003, R&D once again delivered a wide range of products to the market and achieved signicant success in bringing several new compounds through the earlier stages of research and past the critical proof of concept (PoC) decision point. The extensive in-licensing programme of 2001 and 2002 has slowed as the productivity of the post-merger organisation has started to progress into development of an increasing number of compounds discovered internally. Practical prioritisation and management of the portfolio of compounds in development has also been a focus, ensuring that R&D invests its resources to achieve the optimum value and deliver new medicines to patients. In December 2003, R&D presentations were made in the UK and US, when GlaxoSmithKline's pipeline of future products was unveiled to analysts. It featured 35 promising compounds, selected for novelty, impact on disease and commercial potential. These included 353162, a inhaled corticosteroid offering once-daily treatment and greater efcacy compared with current compounds. R&D Processes - Discovery, Commercialisation & Delivery The diagram below shows the relationship between the various stages of R&D. Genetics Discovery Development Development Development Commercialisation Research Research Research Preclinical Worldwide R&D processes In line with GlaxoSmithKline's strategic intent to become the indisputable leader in the industry, R&D has set itself the goal of becoming the industry's most productive R&D organisation. As a fundamental pre-requisite to this approach, it is crucial that R&D also focuses on the needs of the patient so that the benets that may be derived from new medicines and innovative formulations of existing medicines are available to those who need them to recover health and quality of life. R&D measures productivity not just by the number and innovation of the products it creates, but also by the commercial value of the product's ability to address the unmet needs of all customers including patients, healthcare professionals, budget holders and regulators; each with their own perspective on what constitutes a valuable new product. R&D is positioned to ensure that it generates the right safety, efcacy and quality information to respond to these different perspectives through data demonstrating the overall social benets of the new medicine; increased length or quality of life, and increased workplace productivity. One of the historical contradictions in the pharmaceutical industry has been the need to lever the advantages of a large organisation without losing the creative spirit of the research environment. In GlaxoSmithKline, R&D has been structured to balance the areas that benet from large scale with those that take advantage of being small to enhance their productivity. The key areas that benet from being large are those that are capital intensive or high throughput activities such as compound screening; those that require scarce skills; and those that are highly regulated, mainly at the later end of the development chain. Other areas flourish to their best advantage if the structural unit remains small: the units can respond quickly to the changing environment, the opportunity for scientists to interact is optimised, and the need for return on investment is focused through the fostering of an entrepreneurial, accountable culture. 16 GlaxoSmithKline Description of business Description of business GlaxoSmithKline 17 In addition to the now established Centres of Excellence for Drug Many diseases arise through complex interactions between a Product development pipeline Discovery (CEDD) discussed below, a number of partnerships have number of gene variants and environmental factors, so the The product development pipeline set out below shows considerable breadth and depth: at February 2004 GlaxoSmithKline had 201 been forged with other companies to extend GlaxoSmithKline's challenge involved is signicant.

At the beginning of 2004 to accommodate the unprecedented number of compounds moving through the pipeline this group was transformed, changing the scale and structure of late-stage development to enable a stronger focus on patients and on the delivery of products by creating six therapeutically aligned Medicine Development Centres (MDCs), residing within WWD. The centres, discussed in more detail on page 22, will be accountable for the generation and life cycle management of marketed medicines from compounds reaching Proof of Concept (PoC) in the CEDDs. the basis of drug discovery efforts in the CEDDs. In 2003, DR provided the CEDDs with many high quality new lead compounds with activity against dened targets. Investment in DR is focused on increasing the quality and quantity of the lead compounds available. A central theme of the investment has been a focus on automation. In 2003, R&D has opened new automation facilities for high throughput screening in Tres Cantos (Spain) and high throughput chemistry in Harlow (UK). Construction of a new combined facility was also started in Upper Providence (USA). neutral hypertension peptidase (ACE-NEP) dual inhibitor beta blocker hypertension & congestive heart failure - once daily indirect thrombin inhibitor prevention of thrombotic I I I I II II ll II II ll N/A 2005 The New Product Supply organisation bridges the traditional divide between development and manufacturing, ensuring that robust Another focus for 2003, was high throughput biology.

The technology development organisation keeps abreast of emerging technologies that may advance the creation of new medicines, evaluates them and provides the investment and knowledge required to ensure GlaxoSmithKline's access to appropriate technologies. As R&D generates and modies its own technologies, it will not only focus them on the Group's internal goals but also maximise the return on R&D assets through sales, spin-outs and out-licensing. The resources available to exploit opportunities within the Group will always be limited. As overall productivity is enhanced and attrition reduced better value for money will be achieved. Following the annual portfolio prioritisation review, the CEDDs are able to select which programmes to fund internally. Excess assets may be developed through a novel partnership scheme known as the Alternative Drug Discovery Initiative (ADI). The key philosophy behind ADI is the concept of shared risk and reward for the partners. Consequently, there are many different business arrangements. ADI partnerships have been established with gamma agonist type 2 diabetes and overactive bladder type 2 diabetes type 2 diabetes type 2 diabetes type 2 diabetes - extended release obesity type 2 diabetes type 2 diabetes - xed dose combination type 2 diabetes - xed dose combination type 2 diabetes - in combination with insulin I I I I I II II Submitted Approved Approved 2004 A:Oct03 N/A 2005 S:Oct03 A:Oct02 A:Feb03 Early research and the role of genetics The early stages of nding new medicines requires essentially two components, targets that can be shown to affect mechanisms of important pathological processes in human disease and compounds, typically small molecules but also including macromolecules, protein therapeutics and vaccines, able to modulate the behaviour of specic targets. As part of this target validation process, GlaxoSmithKline aims to identify the genes most relevant to common diseases with large unmet medical needs and major patient burdens, such as asthma, non-insulin dependent diabetes, osteoarthritis, COPD, early onset heart academic institutions to supplement target validation and provide better access to tissue samples and patient populations for clinical studies. R&D has also formed ADI partnerships with biotechnology companies and other pharmaceutical companies to explore different approaches to drug discovery.

There are seven CEDDs, based in the USA and Europe: compounds progressed into Phase I on page 20) and initial evaluation of efcacy in patients. In addition, adjustments to the processes involved in this stage of development are enabling a reduction in development times. Biopharmaceuticals, centred in Stevenage (UK) As a result, a substantial number of new compounds achieved Cardiovascular & Urogenital Diseases, centred in Upper Merion the critical milestone of proof of concept, where potential new (USA) medicines have been shown to have sufcient effect in the target Metabolic & Viral Diseases, centred in Research Triangle Park patient group to justify the transition to the later stages of (USA) development. Microbial, Musculoskeletal & Proliferative Diseases, including cancer, centred in Upper Providence (USA) A major partnership was announced during 2003 with Imperial Neurology & Gastrointestinal Diseases, centred in Harlow (UK) College, London, to develop a major Clinical Imaging Centre for Psychiatry, centred in Verona (Italy) GlaxoSmithKline at Imperial's Hammersmith Hospital site. Respiratory and Inflammation, centred in Stevenage (UK). 22 GlaxoSmithKline Description of business Description of business GlaxoSmithKline 23 This is the rst such partnership in the world, and will be a highly interactive relationship with the clinical service and on-going biomedical, chemical and IT research in a world-class academic centre and medical school. The Imaging Centre will provide unique new capabilities required to drive the clinical portfolio forward. As part of GlaxoSmithKline's major response to the challenges of diseases affecting the developing world, the Microbial, Musculoskeletal & Proliferative Diseases CEDD has responsibility for a drug discovery unit, based at Tres Cantos, that is dedicated to nding new medicines for these diseases. Research projects at Tres Cantos focus on malaria and TB and, together with work elsewhere in the Group on HIV/AIDS and vaccines, address the prevention and treatment of all three of the World Health Organization's (WHO) top priority diseases. The Group also works with numerous external partners worldwide in the search for new treatments for Diseases of the Developing World (DDW). Preclinical development Preclinical Development (PCD) participates in a wide range of activities within the drug development process from optimising the selection of compounds for potential development through launch to the marketplace and enhancement of existing products by devising more convenient formulations. Early in the development process, the metabolic rate and safety of compounds are evaluated in laboratory animals prior to testing in humans. The testing required in both animals and humans is mandated and is highly regulated by government agencies. PCD researchers investigate dosage form (e.g. tablet or inhaled) and develop formulations to enhance the drug's effectiveness. PCD is also responsible for the development of drug formulations used in clinical trials. Processes and supporting analytical methods for drug synthesis and product formulation and delivery are scaled up to meet increasing supply requirements, ultimately leading to the technical transfer of the processes and methods to manufacturing. The New Product Supply Process, a partnership between R&D and Global Manufacturing and Supply, ensures that a robust product is developed for large scale commercial manufacturing and launch. Other key technology areas that provide ways to improve R&D's productivity include drug delivery systems, predictive technologies, particle engineering and process innovation. The use of particle engineering and process innovations enhances the ability to manufacture consistently high-quality products efciently. Worldwide development To provide focus for the development process, all the major functional components of clinical, medical, biomedical data, regulatory and safety have been integrated into this single management organisation, Worldwide Development. During 2003 there were six cross-functional Therapeutic Area Strategy Teams (TASTs), each covering one of the following groups of diseases: Cardiovascular, Urogenital and Metabolic Diseases Infectious Diseases including DDW Neurology & Gastro-intestinal Diseases Oncology, Musculoskeletal Diseases and Inflammation Psychiatry Respiratory. As described above, these TASTs were replaced at the beginning of 2004 with six MDC's responsible for creating value through the delivery of full product development plans. This includes managing the day-to-day operational activities for the post-PoC portfolio, delivery of medicines to patients, maximising the global commercial potential of products and ensuring strong partnerships with the CEDDs and Global Commercial Strategy (GCS). The project management function has been integrated into the MDC framework in order to provide direct expertise in the planning and execution of development activities. The MDC's are therapeutically aligned as Musculoskeletal/Inflammation/Gastrointestinal/Urology Neuroscience (Psychiatry/Neurology) Oncology Respiratory These matrix teams are responsible for maximising the worldwide development opportunities for each product within their remit so that all information needed to support the registration, safety programmes, pricing and formulary negotiations is available when it is required. Commercial input from GCS ensures that at an early stage regional marketing needs are fully integrated into development plans. Careful prioritisation across all phases of development ensures that a high potential and integrated portfolio is achieved. The MDCs collaborate at an early stage with the CEDDs to dene target product proles for new molecules and with integrated technical development and manufacturing functions to ensure rapid, effective launch and delivery of the product. Innovative clinical programmes for lead molecules from the CEDDs are developed using cross-functional project teams. Cross-functional input extends to focused life cycle management for products to deliver new indications and new presentations after the initial regulatory approval and commercial launch. Examples of life cycle management include the extended release formulation, Wellbutrin XL, and development programmes designed to deliver new indications such as the use of Lamictal for bipolar disorder. The rst products under the Gold Pass initiative, started in 2002, Levitra and Wellbutrin XL, were launched in 2003. This designation, agreed between R&D, regional markets and manufacturing, is a key component of the portfolio and resource prioritisation and management process, to ensure that the resources placed behind key emerging assets yield the optimum commercial benet as well as the maximum medical benet to patients. Gold Pass assets are of high value and strategic importance to GlaxoSmithKline and require specic organisational visibility and urgency to meet patients' needs. Consequently, only a small number of assets receive Gold Pass status at any one time, enabling the full focus of the organisation to be aligned. Two further products, 353162 for depression and 572016 for cancer, received the Gold Pass designation during the year. In-licensing and research collaborations GlaxoSmithKline has continued to identify compounds that would enhance the portfolio and to create innovative collaborations to ensure that the Group is regarded as the partner of choice for both large and small companies. Since the Group was formed in December 2000, it has signed 36 major external collaborations, 24 for products in clinical development and a further 12 for products at pre-clinical stage. Compounds that were the subject of in-licensing or co-promotion deals during 2003 were: a pulsatile drug delivery system from Advancis, for use in the controlled delivery of anti-microbials controlled release Micropump technology from Flamel Technologies for use in developing new formulations a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor from Medivir for the treatment of HIV infections a xed-dose combination tablet containing combinations of a long acting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug from POZEN and GlaxoSmithKline's range of anti-migraine therapies, Imigran/Imitrex and Naramig/Amerge, muscarinic for part of a broad alliance covering a number of research programmes in central nervous system diseases, with NeuroSearch A/S. Current collaborative & Co., (HIV and neurology potential broad based collaboration in antimicrobials, Inc. (oncology, inflammation), Inc. (asthma), and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (broad based). GlaxoSmithKline has one academic ADI partner in the UK and two in the USA. These are long term collaborative relationships in which the Group has committed funding for two years, with the option to renew for an additional three years. In addition, GlaxoSmithKline has already entered into a number of agreements with third parties to co-develop and then co-market certain compounds. These arrangements range from milestone payments to third parties to acquire rights to their intellectual property, to joint ventures to develop and commercialise specied compounds. Under many of these agreements the Group has obligations to make payments in the future if specied milestones are achieved. These nancial commitments are summarised in Note 26 to the Financial statements, 'Commitments'. Discontinuations All research and development carries a risk of failure commensurate with the extension of scientic knowledge of a compound and its effects. Not all lead compounds that are identied to possess positive activity against a validated target will prove to be safe enough to introduce to humans or feasible to manufacture on a commercial scale. GlaxoSmithKline R&D endeavours to ensure that as far as possible these risks are ameliorated by extensive predictive testing as early as possible in the development process. Despite these efforts, the ultimate test for a product remains the point at which it is administered to large numbers of patients with the disease. In 2003, GlaxoSmithKline and Merck KGaA reviewed the progress of the development programme for the SSRI + 5HT1a receptor partial agonist vilazodone. As a result, the companies agreed that the development programme should be terminated. Other late-stage projects terminated during 2003 were the development of oxibendazole for helminth intestinal infections in Phase III and in Phase II, both 559090 for asthma and 810781 for the treatment of HIV. Vaccines R&D All vaccines R&D is conducted at GlaxoSmithKline's biologicals centre in Rixensart, Belgium, including other related activities such as clinical development, regulatory strategy, commercial strategy, scaling up, production, packaging and all support functions. Over 1,000 research scientists are employed who are devoted to discovering new vaccines and developing more cost-effective and convenient combination products to prevent infections that cause serious medical problems worldwide. Discovery work identies new vaccines and these candidates are then expressed in yeast, bacteria or mammalian cells and puried to a very high level. This is followed by formulation of the vaccine, which involves mixing antigens with selected adjuvants which will ultimately stimulate a good immune response in humans. The next step is to evaluate safety and efcacy of the candidate vaccine in in-vivo models. Once preclinical proof of concept has been established, the candidate vaccine is then tested in clinical trials in healthy individuals to evaluate safety and how effective the vaccine is in inducing an immune response to protect the body from disease encountered later in a natural setting. Large-scale eld trials in healthy individuals follow to establish safety and efcacy in a cross section of the population. The results obtained during clinical trials and the development of a quality production process and facilities are then combined into a regulatory le which is submitted to the authorities in the various countries where the vaccine is to be made available. Animals and research For ethical, regulatory and scientic reasons, research using animals remains a vital part of the research and development of new medicines and vaccines. Animals are only used where no alternative is available and GlaxoSmithKline constantly aims to reduce the numbers used. The Group strives to exceed industry standards in the care and welfare of the animals it uses: laboratory animals are usually bred specically for research and are well cared for throughout their lives by qualied, trained staff. When animals are used in research unnecessary pain or suffering is scrupulously avoided. GlaxoSmithKline is actively engaged in research to develop and validate experimental methods that can provide more and better alternatives to the use of animals in research. GlaxoSmithKline acknowledges that use of animals for research purposes is a subject that rightly commands a high level of public interest. The full GlaxoSmithKline Public Policy Position 'The care and ethical use of animals in research' is available on the website, www.gsk.com, or from Secretariat. Research and development - Consumer Healthcare The principal centres for Consumer Healthcare R&D are in the UK and in the USA. The focus of R&D is on the identication and rapid development of novel products that bring benets to consumers in the OTC, Oral care and Nutritional healthcare markets. Consumer Healthcare liaises closely with Pharmaceuticals to maximise the Group's assets, by nding applications for prescription products in the OTC marketplace. 24 GlaxoSmithKline Description of business Description of business GlaxoSmithKline 25 Operating resources Intellectual property Levitrad.

Their skills and intellect are key components in the successful implementation of sound business strategy. This is the human capital that maximises the potential of the Group's scientic, commercial and nancial assets. The outcome of effective human resources policy is GlaxoSmithKline's solid reputation as an international employer of choice. To achieve this, the Group initiated Candidate Care - the commitment to seeking and acquiring the best employment candidates who reflect a diversity of background, experience and perspective and who can contribute most to the success of GlaxoSmithKline. Performance and reward The importance of people must translate into employment practices that demonstrate the value of each individual. Compensation and benet packages (GlaxoSmithKline's Total Reward) aim to be competitive and innovative and are either global or local in orientation, depending on what best drives business performance and rewards individual contribution. Compensation philosophy and programme development underscore GlaxoSmithKline's commitment to a performance culture. Performance based pay, both base and variable, share awards, share options, performance and development planning and evaluation contribute to retention of key talent, superior performance and accomplishment of business targets. A commitment to flexible working through flexi-time, teleconferencing, remote working and flexible work schedules, recognises that employees work best in an environment that helps them integrate their work and personal lives. Communication and involvement To stimulate employee engagement, a daily news service is in place on all business unit intranet sites. This includes daily Group news and announcements, an online news magazine service, the Chief Executive Ofcer's home page and Q&A, and an online information resource to encourage employees to serve as company ambassadors. Where appropriate, the publication of media clippings is also accompanied by a Group position statement to ensure employee access to key messages on important issues. An employee survey was undertaken during 2003 to determine employee satisfaction with communications channels and content, and more than 70 per cent of employees expressed satisfaction with them. An employee broadcast, hosted by the CEO and Chairman, Pharmaceuticals R&D, was held in December to recognise 2003 performance, remind employees of R&D pipeline information and reiterate global strategy for 2004. Share ownership schemes encourage participation as owners of the business, increasing awareness of short and long term business objectives. Global and local employee opinion surveys allow employees the opportunity to express their views and perspectives on important Group issues. Diversity The GlaxoSmithKline diversity initiative continued to focus on creating an inclusive work environment, aiming to enhance employee innovation and productivity, and measurably improve employee attraction, development and retention. Last year marked the rst annual Multicultural Marketing and Diversity Awards, with 78 entrants from ve countries. The event highlighted activities that serve diverse employees, customers and stakeholders across GlaxoSmithKline's global community. The Group is committed to employment policies free from discrimination against potential or existing staff on the grounds of age, race, ethnic and national origin, gender, sexual orientation, faith or disability. In particular GlaxoSmithKline is committed to offering people with disabilities access to the full range of recruitment and career opportunities. Every effort is made to retain and support staff who become disabled. Talent management and leadership development Development planning is a key element in performance planning for all employees each year. Reviews are conducted in each business and function to ensure that a diverse talent pool is fully developed to meet future business needs, and that successors are identied for key positions. Comprehensive leadership development opportunities are available to managers at all levels. These opportunities are targeted to help leaders to meet the challenges they face in a complex global organisation. They ensure leaders motivate teams and individuals to do their best work. Human Resources services and information systems GlaxoSmithKline's human resource delivery strategy is designed to make the most of technology. Human Resources services and information are delivered through low cost, highly effective channels that make it easy for job candidates, employees, and retirees to access information about employment, compensation and benets, policies and programmes. These include intuitive personalised web based tools, available to employees in many locations. Property, plant and equipment GlaxoSmithKline has invested over \u00a34 billion in its property, with a carrying value in the Financial statements of almost \u00a33 billion, with a further \u00a33.7 billion, at carrying value, invested in plant and equipment and assets in construction. In 2003, GlaxoSmithKline invested \u00a3870 million in new and renewal property, plant and equipment. This is mainly related to a large number of projects for the improvement and expansion of facilities at various worldwide sites. Property is mainly held freehold. New investment is nanced from Group liquid resources. At 31st December 2003, the Group had capital contractual commitments for future expenditure of some \u00a3171 million and in 2004 operating lease commitments of \u00a3120 million. GlaxoSmithKline's business is science-based, technology-intensive and highly regulated by governmental authorities. It allocates signicant nancial resources to the renewal and maintenance of its property, plant and equipment to minimise risks of interruption of production and to achieve compliance with regulatory standards. The research and development and manufacture of pharmaceuticals uses chemicals and hazardous materials. The Group observes stringent procedures and uses specialist skills to manage environmental risks from these activities. Environmental issues, sometimes dating from operations now modied or discontinued, are referenced under 'Responsibility for Environment, health and safety' (page 27) and in Note 30 to the Financial statements, 'Legal proceedings'. GlaxoSmithKline believes that its facilities are adequate for its current needs. The business and society Corporate responsibility GlaxoSmithKline is committed to connecting business decisions to ethical, social and environmental concerns. Solid nancial performance is closely connected to ethical business practices. The Group understands that it is not just how much prot it makes that matters. Stakeholders want to know how that prot is made and to be reassured of the sound ethical basis for the business. GlaxoSmithKline has identied the broad issues that have generated interest from stakeholders and reports on these each year in the Corporate Responsibility Report. This is available from Secretariat and on the website at www.gsk.com. GlaxoSmithKline has a Corporate Responsibility Committee of Non-Executive Directors, which has oversight of corporate responsibility matters. It advises the Board on social, ethical and environmental issues that have the potential to impact seriously GlaxoSmithKline's business and reputation. The Corporate Executive Team directs the Group's corporate responsibility activities. The General Counsel is responsible for managing the overall programme. Corporate responsibility issues and dialogue with stakeholders are managed in the most appropriate functions within GlaxoSmithKline rather than through a central department. This ensures they remain an integrated part of the everyday operation of the business. To facilitate policy development, implementation and communication, however, a cross-functional team was established at the beginning of 2002 to ensure a co-ordinated and comprehensive approach. This team, made up of representatives from the key business areas, ensures that policies are in place and mechanisms exist for their implementation and monitoring. During 2003 the cross-functional team developed a set of corporate responsibility principles for GlaxoSmithKline. This sets out the approach to ten areas: standards of ethical conduct, leadership and advocacy, research and innovation, products and customers, access to medicines, employment practices, human rights, community investment, caring for the environment and engagement with stakeholders. In some instances, such as caring for the environment and access to medicines, performance measures are already in place to support demonstration of progress. For other principles the potential for developing performance indicators to support effective management and communication is being explored further. The aim is to strike a balance between the desires of stakeholders for greater transparency about the operations of GlaxoSmithKline, and the realities and costs of running the business. Further information on these issues may be found in the Corporate Responsibility Report 2003. An overview of three of the key corporate areas of Environment, health and safety, Access to healthcare and Community investments follow. Responsibility for environment, health and safety Environment, health and safety (EHS) is a key element of corporate responsibility for the Group and has a high priority. Responsibility for EHS is at the highest level. There is a corporate group reporting to the General Counsel that has overall responsibility for providing governance and leadership on EHS issues. The head of this group makes regular reports to the Corporate Executive Team (CET) and the Audit Committee. Within operations, line managers are responsible for EHS and are supported by site-based EHS and occupational health professionals. Description of business GlaxoSmithKline 27 EHS management GlaxoSmithKline takes a systematic approach to managing EHS risks and impacts. A framework of information and programmes based on the global EHS standards guides the management of key aspects, impacts and risks throughout the organisation. EHS assurance and improvement As part of its governance responsibility, GlaxoSmithKline conducts EHS audits of its sites, key contract manufacturers and suppliers. The processes are based on assessing performance against the EHS standards and include quantitative performance measurement. In 2003, 31 sites were audited and three follow-up reviews were performed. As part of the continuous improvement process, progress was monitored on actions arising from issues raised on all audits. In 2003, a pilot exercise was conducted with Global Manufacturing and Supply to investigate obtaining Group wide third party certication to the international standards on environmental and health and safety management systems (ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001). Five sites achieved certication to both standards as part of this process. This is in addition to the 12 sites that had previously been individually certied to ISO 14001. The pilot conrmed the feasibility of the approach and the programme will continue on a voluntary basis. Global certication should be achieved in three to four years. As part of the commitment to corporate social responsibility and the pro-active management of the GlaxoSmithKline manufacturing and supply base, 16 of the key contract manufacturers and suppliers were also assessed. This process evaluated the management of EHS risks and impacts based on the Group's EHS requirements for contract manufacturers. Generally good performance was identied and recommendations were made where improvements were needed. Objectives and targets Objectives for 2003 focused on the theme of reducing key risks. The risks identied as most signicant, based on past performance, were driver safety, ergonomics, chemical exposures, process safety, resilience and well being and emergency response. Progress was made on all issues and work will continue into 2004. Objectives for 2004 will centre around emerging issues such as pharmaceuticals in the environment, chemicals policy and climate change, with a theme of responding to external EHS challenges. Numerical targets for EHS improvements set in 2001 are to be accomplished over ve years. The health and safety target is a reduction in lost time injury and illness rate by 15 per cent per year. Environmental targets include reductions in energy usage and associated greenhouse gas emissions, reductions in solvent emissions and the amount of waste and wastewater disposed. Progress toward meeting these targets is tracked every year and will be published on www.gsk.com. To date signicant progress has been made towards achieving all EHS targets. Performance improvement measures GlaxoSmithKline measures the impact on the health and safety of people who work at its sites and the impact on the environment. The measure of impact on people is the lost time injury and illness rate, enough to result in lost time per 100,000 hours worked. The impacts on air, water and land are measured as metric tonnes of material emitted, waste disposed and the impact on natural resources is measured as cubic metres of water used and gigajoules of energy consumed. 28 GlaxoSmithKline Description of business Description of business GlaxoSmithKline 29 GlaxoSmithKline selects its measures of performance improvement based on the risk. Risks are determined, in part, through evaluation of impacts. The impacts considered were those with the potential for adverse impact on people or the environment, business continuity or business reputation. Most of the measures selected are similar to those reported by other companies and are recommended by the Global Reporting Initiative, a long-term, multi-stakeholder, international undertaking to develop and disseminate globally applicable sustainability reporting guidelines. Product stewardship GlaxoSmithKline has a global standard for product stewardship that establishes requirements for responsible and ethical management of EHS aspects of products throughout their life cycles. Product stewardship provides a systematic way to identify product or process risks early, so that they may be mitigated, managed and ultimately eliminated. Integrating product stewardship into business activities protects people and the environment, enhances compliance with local regulatory requirements and avoids interruption of product supply. Environmental sustainability The concept of sustainable development is central to the Group's environmental programmes. Work has started towards eventual environmental sustainability by mitigating environmental impacts and looking at ways to improve production efciency. The use of renewable resources and the overall balance of the consumption of resources with the generation of waste will be investigated in the future. The Group has a standard on sustainable development that denes the approach from discovery through manufacturing to sales. Environmental sustainability starts with R&D. As part of the support for R&D, a toolkit has been developed to assist in the selection of green chemistries and processes. Access to healthcare in the developed world GlaxoSmithKline plays an active part in improving healthcare of people who have limited access to medicines. Our Orange Card scheme has helped more than 150,000 senior American citizens on low incomes to save on the medicines they buy. In 2003, the group reinforced its commitment to this programme until at least 2006. This brings company-sponsored savings programmes into a single card, extending the possible savings at the pharmacy counter to more than 170 widely prescribed medicines with this easy to use card. Together Rx participants are able to save up to 40 per cent off the usual amount paid for prescriptions. By the end of 2003 approximately 1.2 million people had joined this programme. Access to healthcare in the developing world Access to healthcare in developing countries remains a unique challenge to the global community. The problem, which is rooted in poverty, demands a significant mobilisation of resources and a true spirit of partnership. It must be tackled as a shared responsibility by all sectors of global society. The Group does not have the mandate, expertise or resources to address the underlying problems that exist. However, GlaxoSmithKline continues to play a vital role, through its commitment to R&D into diseases particularly prevalent in the developing world, through its programme of preferential pricing for its anti-retrovirals (ARVs), anti-malarials and vaccines, and through its community investment activities and partnerships. R&D for diseases of the developing world Growing anti-infective resistance to current treatments, inadequate healthcare infrastructure and poor patient compliance to complex treatment regimens continues to drive the need for investment in R&D into new drugs and vaccines for diseases that affect the developing world. GlaxoSmithKline believes that it has the industry's most extensive portfolio of products and R&D projects for diseases of the developing world. It undertakes R&D into the prevention and treatment of all three of the World Health Organization's (WHO) priority diseases in the developing world - HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB) and malaria. In addition to the R&D on HIV/AIDS, GlaxoSmithKline has an R&D team (based in Spain and the UK) dedicated to treatments for Diseases of the Developing World. Projects are prioritised primarily on their socio-economic and public health benets rather than on their commercial returns. The Group currently has over 19 R&D projects and programmes of relevance to the developing world, nine of which are aimed at producing vaccines and medicines for diseases that disproportionally affect developing countries. The Group is increasingly involved in public-private partnerships to enable a wide range of projects to be undertaken. 2003 saw one of the rst tangible outputs of such partnerships with the launch of the anti-malarial, Lapdap. The result of a collaboration between the WHO, the UK government, the University of Liverpool and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, with support by an initial grant from the Wellcome Trust, Lapdap has already been launched in a number of African countries. Preferential pricing arrangements GlaxoSmithKline has offered its vaccines to public health programmes at signicant discounts for over 20 years. The Group also sets a single, sustainable, not-for-prot price for each of its ARVs and anti-malarials to a wide range of customers in the least developed countries and sub-Saharan Africa, as well as projects fully-funded by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria. This means that the not-for-prot prices are offered in a total of 100 countries. GlaxoSmithKline is committed to contributing to health improvements in a sustainable manner. The preferential prices for GlaxoSmithKline ARVs and anti-malarials are therefore set at levels at which no prot is made, but direct costs are covered, allowing supply to be sustained for as long as required. The Group has undertaken to reduce these prices whenever possible and was able to meet this commitment twice in 2003. Preferential pricing is improving access. The Group has 175 arrangements, covering 56 of the world's poorest countries, to supply ARVs at preferential prices. Customers include governments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), hospitals, academic institutions and private employers. The offer of not-for-prot prices requires a sustainable framework, combining the Group's commitment to preferential pricing with commitments from governments to avoid price referencing against preferentially priced medicines and to help prevent product diversion. GlaxoSmithKline has taken steps to minimise the threat of diversion and is now able to supply 57 countries with Combivir in a special access pack. Similar efforts are underway to secure widespread regulatory approval for T rizivir and Epivir access packs and to colour differentiate the product, not just the packaging. However, this alone will not fully deter illegal traders who are experts in the repackaging of medicines. GlaxoSmithKline therefore welcomed the political commitment to prevent diversion that arose from the G8 Summit in June 2003, and the European Union Anti-Diversion Regulation of May 2003. Other countries should be encouraged to take similar steps and ensure the introduction, and strict enforcement of, measures to counter this trade, the main beneciaries of which are the illegal importers. In October 2003, GlaxoSmithKline extended the voluntary licence granted to Aspen Pharmacare, sub-Saharan Africa's largest generics company, for the manufacture and sale of Combivir, Epivir and Retrovir. The licence was previously limited to only the public sector in South Africa and Zimbabwe. The Group has now extended the licence to cover both the public and private sectors across all of sub-Saharan Africa. Success through partnership GlaxoSmithKline continues to build on its history of community investment programmes and support for better healthcare delivery and education in under-served communities in the developing world. The Group does this through active engagement with other external stakeholders. During 2003, it consulted and worked with governments of both the developed and developing world, the UN, the WHO, NGOs and with the investment community. Much was achieved in 2003, specically around HIV/AIDS funding, thanks to initiatives such as the Global Fund and President Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. However, a signicant increase in resources is still needed and it is also important to maintain incentives for R&D through protection of intellectual property. There is, for example, neither a cure nor a vaccine for HIV/AIDS. GlaxoSmithKline will continue with its vital contribution to improving healthcare in the developing world. However, real progress will only occur if the signicant barriers that stand in the way of better access to healthcare are tackled as a shared responsibility by all sectors of global society - governments, international agencies, charities, academic institutions, the pharmaceutical industry and others. Global community investment GlaxoSmithKline's global community investment activities in 2003 were valued at \u00a3338 million. This included \u00a3125 million for the Group's Patient Assistance Programs and other medicine donations for low income groups in the USA, and \u00a3105 million of humanitarian product donations. This total was equivalent to 5.3 per cent of Group prot before tax and included \u00a317 million in costs to manage and deliver community programmes in more than 100 countries. Many of the programmes are long term commitments that help bring about sustainable change in underserved communities. The Group's community investment activities are mainly focused on health and education and include: Public health programmes The Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis GlaxoSmithKline's flagship community programme aims to eliminate this disguring mosquito-borne disease from the world by 2020. The company has committed to provide as much of the anti-parasitic drug albendazole as required (an estimated 5-6 billion preventative treatments) to treat the one billion people at risk in 80 countries. GlaxoSmithKline and WHO were founders of the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF), a unique partnership which includes Ministries of Health in endemic countries, non\u00ad governmental organisations, community-based organisations, academic institutions, international organisations and the private sector. In 2003, the fth year of the programme, 94 million tablets, worth almost \u00a311 million at wholesale acquisition cost, were donated to 34 countries. As part of this ongoing preventative programme, GlaxoSmithKline shipped 10 million albendazole tablets to the Sri Lanka Ministry of Health, which mobilised 50,000 healthcare workers and volunteers to treat 10 million people in a single day in July. It was one of the largest community treatment programmes of its type to take place in the developing world. In addition, the Group gave grants of almost \u00a31 million and staff expertise to support the activities of the Global Alliance to Eliminate LF, including advocacy, research, community mobilisation and educational initiatives. GlaxoSmithKline's Positive Action on HIV/AIDS 2003 marked the 11th year of Positive Action, GlaxoSmithKline's pioneering global programme of HIV education, care and community support. During 2003 Positive Action supported 38 programmes in 34 countries with 28 partners. Positive Action has a focus in sub-Saharan Africa because of the magnitude of the HIV/AIDS pandemic there, but the programme also supports affected communities in other countries around the world. Support included a grant of \u00a320,000 to the Movement of Men Against AIDS in Kenya (MMAAK) to encourage men's engagement and involvement with all aspects of the HIV/AIDS crisis, since men are commonly the decision-makers in the workplace, government and religious institutions. Another example of support of vulnerable communities was a grant of \u00a350,000 to +VE, a UK-based NGO, to develop a low-cost health education resource on HIV, hepatitis and sexual health for use in UK prisons. 30 GlaxoSmithKline Description of business Description of business GlaxoSmithKline 31 To help address the growing HIV/AIDS problem in China, the Group provided \u00a3300,000 to the British Red Cross and Australian Red Cross for a three-year programme to prevent the spread of HIV through training young people and drug users in HIV prevention and life skills. In Russia and Ukraine, where there is a rapidly increasing incidence of HIV/AIDS, GlaxoSmithKline has provided funding to establish and support national networks of positive people to help them advocate for HIV education, prevention, care and treatment services. In addition, the Group granted $1.6 million over two years to support the work of two HIV/AIDS clinics in Malawi and Uganda. The GlaxoSmithKline African Malaria Partnership The GlaxoSmithKline African Malaria Partnership supports three behavioural development programmes working in seven African countries. During 2003, the Group disbursed the rst grants of a $1.5 million commitment to its partners; Freedom From Hunger, AMREF and Plan International. The programmes are expected to benet nearly two million people and focus particularly on young children and pregnant women, encouraging effective prevention measures, prompt treatment and antenatal malaria management. Regional community initiatives United Kingdom GlaxoSmithKline contributed \u00a34 million in 2003 to its continuing corporate programme of charitable activities in the UK. These support over 200 projects within the areas of health, medical research, science education and the arts and the environment. In addition GlaxoSmithKline companies in the UK provided a further \u00a37.1 million for community purposes, giving a combined total of \u00a311.1 million in support of projects in the UK. To further medical research, a total of \u00a3354,000 was provided to Epilepsy Research Foundation, International Spinal Research Trust, National Osteoporosis Society and Tommy's, the baby charity. GlaxoSmithKline's annual UK Impact Awards recognise excellence in the work of voluntary community health organisations across the UK. In 2003, 10 UK charities each received an unrestricted award of \u00a325,000, for their work dealing with issues as diverse as sexual abuse, mental health, elderly day care and disability. A donation of almost \u00a3170,000 was made to the charity Beating Bowel Cancer for a national awareness campaign about bowel cancer, the UK's second most deadly cancer, aimed at highlighting the symptoms and promoting early diagnosis to save lives. GlaxoSmithKline hopes to encourage the next generation of scientists through supporting science education programmes that give science context and enhance science teaching. The Group has committed \u00a31 million over four years in support of Phase Two of the new Darwin Centre at the Natural History Museum in London. GlaxoSmithKline continued to support the INSPIRE (INnovative Scheme for Post-docs in Research and Education) scheme, developed in partnership with Imperial College London and the Specialist Schools Trust, with a \u00a31 million donation over four years. INSPIRE aims to raise achievement in science by placing post-doctoral researchers in specialist science schools to assist with science teaching and to study for a teaching qualication. Other 2003 education programmes included \u00a3100,000 for Science Across the World, an international education programme that uses web based resources to promote discussion of science issues within and between schools in almost 100 countries. For the seventh year, the Group sponsored the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures broadcast by Channel Four television, which give young people the opportunity to be inspired by eminent scientists. As part of GlaxoSmithKline's commitment to the environment, the Group sponsored 'Go-Wild', a one-off 'living' festival at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, which received over 500,000 visitors from May to September 2003. Europe Corporate programmes in Europe in 2003 focused on improving children's health with total funding of \u00a31 million supporting a range of long-term programmes. In addition, GlaxoSmithKline companies in Europe provided a further \u00a312 million for regional community activities. The European Forum for Families and Children Living with HIV/AIDS received \u00a3150,000. This three year programme works with young people in Italy, Portugal, Romania, Russia and Spain to alleviate HIV-associated stigma and discrimination. Barretstown in Ireland and L'Envol in France, which support European children with cancer and life-threatening illnesses to rediscover their own inner strength and self-esteem, received \u00a3300,000 and \u00a3100,000, respectively. GlaxoSmithKline continued to support the charity HealthProm and the Azerbaijan Health Ministry, investing \u00a383,000 in 2003 for the fourth year of a safe childbirth initiative to benet 228,000 refugees. Zippy's Friends, a school programme run by Partnership for Children to teach coping skills to young children in Denmark and Lithuania, continued to receive funding of \u00a3200,000, and extended its reach to the UK and India. North America Corporate programmes in North America focused on improving public education and access to better healthcare for children and seniors with funding of $15 million. A further $62.3 million was donated by the Group's US based businesses to regional community activities. Examples of GlaxoSmithKline's contribution to improving healthcare include a three-year grant of more than $2 million which has helped expand The Children's Health Fund's Referral Management Initiative (RMI) into seven US states, ensuring continuity of specialist medical care for high-risk children who are often homeless. The GlaxoSmithKline SHARE Recognition Awards have recognised the work of small community-based organisations that aim to improve the health of older people across diverse cultures. In 2003, six organisations received a total of $450,000, providing extra support to launch new programmes or to strengthen ongoing initiatives. The annual USA Impact Awards acknowledge and reward excellence in the non-prot healthcare sector, in the Greater Philadelphia area. In 2003, nine charities each received an unrestricted award of $40,000 for their work dealing with issues as diverse as child abuse, breast cancer and sexual and reproductive health. The Group's efforts to improve public education included a grant of $383,000 for 'Science in the Summer', a free library-based science education programme in the Philadelphia area teaching basic scientic concepts to children. Now in its 17th year, more than 60,000 children have participated in the programme. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill received $250,000 as part of an overall $1.25 million grant for a travelling science laboratory to help improve science teaching and encourage underserved students to pursue careers in science. The US pharmaceuticals group launched GlaxoSmithKline Healthy Communities in 2003, a health education and outreach programme to advance healthy living among African Americans. The Congressional Black Caucus Foundation has to date received $250,000 as part of a $500,000 grant over a four year period to help support high school graduates and college students interested in pursuing careers in science or medicine. International Over and above the Group's corporate public health programmes in developing countries, other corporate programmes in the International region addressed health education and mobilisation, providing funding of \u00a31 million in 2003. The Group provided \u00a3244,000 to the PHASE initiative (Personal Hygiene and Sanitation Education) in Kenya, Zambia, Nicaragua and Peru. During the last four years, PHASE has provided education to 150,000 school children to reduce diarrhoea-related disease and death. In Ethiopia the Group provided \u00a3100,000 for the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) in partnership with WHO and Unicef. This enables families to improve key household practice and behaviours that will have a signicant impact on child survival rates, and their growth and development. In Pakistan, the National Commission for Human Development (NCHD) received \u00a348,000 to focus on improving maternal health in rural areas. Product donations GlaxoSmithKline donates essential products, such as antibiotics, for humanitarian relief efforts. Donations are made at the request of governments and major charitable organisations and may be manufactured specically to meet these requirements. GlaxoSmithKline works in partnership with charitable organisations who deliver relief, including AmeriCares, InterChurch Medical Assistance, MAP International and Project HOPE, and ensure the right product reaches the right person at the right time. For example, the Group donated vital medicines for the rst airlift into Iraq in April and for an aid flight to Kosovo, organised by AmeriCares. GlaxoSmithKline also provided relief following earthquakes in India and flooding in Nicaragua. In 2003, the total value of the Group's international humanitarian product donations was \u00a3105 million. This excludes albendazole donated as part of the Group's commitment to the lymphatic lariasis elimination programme. Product donations are valued at wholesale acquisition cost which is the wholesale list price, not including discounts, and is a standard industry method. Employee involvement GlaxoSmithKline employees are encouraged to contribute to their local communities through employee volunteering schemes. Support varies around the world but includes employee time, cash donations to charities where employees have completed voluntary work and a matching gifts programme. In many countries, GlaxoSmithKline offers tax-efcient options for employee giving in accordance with local taxation guidelines. In 2003, in the USA, the Group matched more than 14,660 employee gifts at a value of $3.8 million. The Group also matched the $1.3 million of employee donations to the federal United Way campaign in the USA, giving a combined contribution of $2.6 million. In addition, GlaxoSmithKline's Investment in Volunteer Excellence (GIVE) programme provided over 1,000 grants to charitable organisations in the USA where employees or their partners have volunteered at least 50 hours in the year. GlaxoSmithKline's Making a Difference programme in the UK provided grants of \u00a3286,000 to over 450 non-prot organisations or registered charities based on employee involvement. Foundations GlaxoSmithKline does not operate a single charitable foundation for its community investment programmes but has a number of country-based foundations in Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Italy, Romania, Spain and the USA. Over the last ve years, the GlaxoSmithKline France Foundation has supported 32 programmes in 13 African countries to improve HIV/AIDS prevention education, training and care. By 2005 over 240,000 people are expected to have beneted. In 2003, the Foundation provided \u00a3506,000 or \u20ac733,000 in funding to 17 ongoing initiatives as part of this ve year commitment. The North Carolina GlaxoSmithKline Foundation in the USA is an endowed, self-funding organisation which operates as a separate entity. The Foundation publishes its own Annual Report, which is available on request, and uses its asset base to support mathematics, science and health education in North Carolina. In 2003, this Foundation made donations totalling just over $2 million which is included in the Group's total community investment gure. 32 GlaxoSmithKline GlaxoSmithKline 33 Corporate governance This section discusses GlaxoSmithKline's management structures and governance procedures.

The Board is responsible for the Group's system of corporate governance and is ultimately accountable for the Group's activities, strategy and nancial performance. The Board comprises three Executive and eleven Non-Executive Directors. Whilst the Board considers all its Non-Executive Directors to be independent in character and judgement in accordance with the 1998 Code, it has determined that four Non-Executive Directors - the Chairman, Dr Barzach, Mr McHenry and Dr Shapiro -should not be considered as 'independent' under the 2003 Code. In the case of the Chairman and Mr McHenry this is due to their length of service with GlaxoSmithKline and its predecessor companies and, in the case of Drs Barzach and Shapiro, due to remuneration that they have received from the Group in other capacities. These four Non-Executive Directors have resigned their positions on the Board Committees where independence is required under the 2003 Code. The Board considers that Mr McArthur, Dr Schmitz, Mr Culp, Mr Davis, Sir Peter Job, Sir Ian Prosser and Sir Robert Wilson are independent under the 2003 Code. The Board noted that Dr Schmitz and Mr McArthur are associated as Non-Executive Directors of other public companies, Rohm and Haas Company and Cabot Corporation, but did not consider the associations to be of sufcient economic signicance to compromise their independence. At the date of publication, a majority of the Board members, excluding the Chairman, were independent Non-Executive Directors, in accordance with the recommendations of the 2003 Code. Dr Barzach, Mr McArthur and Mr McHenry will be retiring from the Board at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 17th May 2004. Following their retirement (and assuming that the other Directors seeking election or re-election at the AGM are elected or re-elected), the Board will comprise three Executive Directors and eight Non-Executive Directors with a majority of the The Board reviews the company's internal controls and risk management policies and approves its governance structure and code of ethics. The Board reviews and also approves major nancing, investment and contractual decisions in excess of dened thresholds. In addition to these items, the Board evaluates and monitors the performance of the Group as a whole. This includes: engaging at Board meetings with the CEO, the other Executive Directors and members of the CET as appropriate, on the nancial and operating performance of GlaxoSmithKline and external issues material to the Group's prospects evaluating progress toward the achievement of the Group's nancial and business objectives and annual plans monitoring, through reports received directly or from various committees, the key signicant risks facing the Group. The Board has overall responsibility for succession planning for the CEO position. The Board has given the CEO broad authority to operate the business of the Group and the CEO is accountable for, and reports to the Board on business performance. The Board met six times in 2003 and each Director attended every meeting held during their tenure. The Board recognises that there may be occasions when one or more of the Directors feel it is necessary to take independent legal and/or nancial advice at the company's expense. There is an agreed procedure to enable them to do so. The Company Secretary is responsible to the Board and is available to individual Directors in respect of Board procedures. The Company Secretary is Simon Bicknell who was appointed in May 2000. He is a barrister and joined the Group in 1984. He is secretary to all the Board Committees. Board Committees The Board has established a number of Committees and provides sufcient resources to enable them to undertake their duties.

The Committee meets as Evaluation of the Board, Board Committees and Directors In 2003 the Board initiated a systematic approach to evaluation. The performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees and Directors was undertaken by the Chairman and implemented in collaboration with the Committee Chairmen and with the support of the Company Secretary. The evaluation was conducted by way of private discussion between the Chairman and each of the Directors. The Chairman was assisted in preparing and conducting the evaluation by an external adviser, who conducted separate interviews with each of the Directors. This enabled Directors' perspectives on the Chairman's performance to be fed back to the Chairman and the full Board. Performance evaluations of Board Committees were conducted on behalf of the Chairman by the Chairmen of the respective Board Committees.

Although the company does not and has not intended to make donations to political parties, within the normal meaning of that expression, the denition in the legislation of 'EU Political Organisation' can extend to bodies including those concerned with policy review, law reform, the representation of the business community and special interest groups such as those concerned with the environment in which the company and its subsidiaries might wish to support. The Group made donations to non-EU Political Organisations totalling \u00a3353,000 during 2003. No donations were made to EU Political Organisations.

Internal control framework The Board recognises its responsibility to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group's position and prospects. The structure of accountability and audit operated in GlaxoSmithKline is as follows. The Board has accountability for reviewing and approving the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls operated by the company, including nancial, operational and compliance controls and risk management. The Board has delegated responsibility for such review to the Audit Committee which receives reports from those individuals identied in the Committee's Report on page 40. It is the responsibility of management through the CET to implement Board policies on risk and control. The CET is responsible for identifying, approving and enforcing key policies that go to the heart of how the Group conducts business. The internal control framework includes central direction, resource allocation, and risk management of the key activities of research and development, manufacturing, marketing and sales, legal, human resources, information systems, and nancial practice. As part of this framework, there is a comprehensive planning system with an annual budget approved by the Board. The results of operating units are reported monthly and compared to the budget. Forecasts are prepared regularly during the year. Extensive nancial controls, procedures, self-assessment exercises and risk mitigation activities are reviewed by the Group's internal auditors. Commercial and nancial responsibility, however, is clearly delegated to local business units, supported by a regional management structure. These principles are designed to provide an environment of central leadership coupled with local operating autonomy as the framework for the exercise of accountability and control within the Group. The Group also attaches importance to clear principles and procedures designed to achieve appropriate accountability and control. A corporate policy, 'Risk Management and Legal Compliance', mandates that business units establish processes for managing risks signicant to their businesses and the Group. In a number of risk areas, specic standards that meet or exceed requirements of applicable law have been established. Specialist audit and compliance groups (for example Corporate Environment, Health and Safety and Worldwide Regulatory Compliance) assist in the dissemination, implementation and audit of these standards. The internal control framework also relies on the Risk Oversight and Compliance Council (ROCC), which reports to both the CET and the Audit Committee, as well as other business unit Risk Management and Compliance Boards (RMCB), to help identify risks and to provide guidance to the risk management and compliance initiatives at the corporate and business unit levels. The ROCC is chaired by the Corporate Compliance Ofcer (CCO) and meets regularly to review and assess signicant risks and mitigation plans directed against those risks. While the ROCC has oversight of the risks deemed signicant to the Group, each RMCB oversees risks important to its business or function, thus increasing the active management of risks across the Group. The Corporate Ethics and Compliance Department (CEC), is responsible for supporting the development and implementation of practices that facilitate employees' compliance with laws and Group policy. The CCO, who also manages the CEC, assists in the coordination of the risk management activities among the various compliance and audit functions across the Group. For details of risks affecting the Group, see Note 30 to the Financial statements, 'Legal proceedings' and 'Risk factors' on pages 74 to 76. Areas of potentially signicant risk that are subject to regular reporting to and by the ROCC include the following. Human resources The legal requirements regarding discrimination and harassment, the integrity of the workforce, including pre-employment screening, and the control and use of contractors and temporary staff are risks inherent in a Group with over 100,000 employees. Research and development Safety of marketed products is a potentially signicant risk and a matter of great concern to GlaxoSmithKline, as is the conduct of laboratory practices and clinical practices trials in R&D. These must be in accordance with applicable laws and regulations as well as with corporate standards that may exceed such requirements. All pharmaceutical products bring with them benets and risks, including potential side effects. Pre-clinical and clinical trials are conducted during the development of potential products to determine the safety and efcacy of products for use by humans following approval by regulatory bodies. In spite of these efforts, when drugs are introduced into the marketplace, unanticipated side effects may become evident. The Group views the use of animals and human tissue in the testing required to develop new products as another risk. Marketing and sales The Group operates globally in complex legal and regulatory environments that often vary among jurisdictions. The Group's policy is to conduct marketing in accordance with applicable laws and regulations as well as with corporate standards that may exceed such requirements. Any failure to observe applicable marketing codes, rules regarding government pricing, management of samples, and legal restrictions on sale and marketing practices may create signicant risks to the commercial sectors and the Group. Failure to comply may result in legal proceedings. Legal and intellectual property Product liability, intellectual property and antitrust litigation, government investigations and related private litigation are signicant potential risks to GlaxoSmithKline, and the Group is involved in various legal and administrative proceedings in these areas. The outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with any level of certainty. There is also a potential risk that third parties may allege that the marketing of the Group's own products will infringe the intellectual property rights of those third parties. Finance There are potential risks and uncertainties surrounding the Group's ability to forecast the future and thus to meet its nancial targets. The Group invests in new products and ventures based on assumptions about their success which may prove to be inaccurate. There are also potential risks around the Group's treasury operations including tax liabilities, transfer pricing, and the possibility of trading losses and counterparty fraud. Compliance with evolving nancial disclosures and other legal reporting requirements constitute risks including the appropriateness and effectiveness of controls in place to support nancial statement reporting. The Group's pension liabilities represent a further area of potential risk, which are discussed in Note 33 to the Financial statements, 'Employee costs'. Manufacturing Maintaining supply of key GlaxoSmithKline products is a potentially signicant risk. The Group's policy is to take reasonable measures to ensure uninterrupted supply of product, including manufacturing in accordance with applicable laws and regulations as well as with corporate standards that may exceed such requirements. The Group takes efforts to minimise the single sourcing of key products. Rationalising the supply chain and balancing manufacturing capacity present other risks that could potentially disrupt the supply of important products. Information technology Protecting information technology assets is an increasing risk as businesses extend networks, systems and data to third parties, and as dependency on the internet for communications increases. Ensuring proper systems validation and electronic records and signatures are key regulatory issues and matters of potential risk for the Group. Web systems accessible to the public must comply with legal and regulatory requirements and represent potential risks. Other potential risks include use of personally identiable information, electronic record retention, outsourced business applications, and susceptibility to viruses and outside incursions. With much of the Group's business dependent upon electronic means, disaster recovery also poses a potential risk. Security, environment and safety Threats to the security and well being of the Group's employees, property and the environment present signicant risks for which appropriate safeguards and precautions are continually reviewed and upgraded. Employee injury, ill health due to occupational conditions and plant management and the potential impact of plants on the environment are potential risks the Group addresses through a process that sets targets and provides guidance on how results may be achieved. 40 GlaxoSmithKline Corporate governance Corporate gover nance GlaxoSmithKline 41 Effectiveness of controls The Audit Committee receives regular reports on these areas of signicant risk to the Group and on related internal controls. Following consideration of these reports, the Committee reports annually to the Board on the effectiveness of controls. Such controls may mitigate but cannot eliminate risks. In addition, there are areas of the Group's business where it is necessary to take risks to achieve a satisfactory return for shareholders, such as investment in acquiring new products or businesses. In these cases it is the company's objective to apply its expertise in the prudent management rather than elimination of risk. The Directors' review relates to the company and its subsidiaries and does not extend to material associated undertakings, joint ventures or other investments. Having considered the Audit Committee report on the effectiveness of controls, the Board believes that the system of internal controls provides reasonable although not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The process accords with the guidance on internal control issued by the Turnbull Committee in 1999. Committee reports Audit Committee Report The Audit Committee's role flows directly from the Board's oversight function and it is authorised by the Board to investigate any activity within its terms of reference. The Committee has written terms of reference which have been approved by the Board. The Committee reports regularly to the Board on the performance of the activities it has been assigned. The Committee's main responsibilities include reviewing the corporate accounting and nancial reporting process, monitoring the integrity of the company's nancial statements, evaluating the system of internal control and the management of risks, and overseeing compliance with laws, regulations and ethical codes of practice. The Committee's oversight role requires it to address regularly the relationships between management and the internal and external auditors, and understand and monitor the reporting relationships and tiers of accountability between these parties. The Committee is entirely composed of independent Non-Executive Directors. Sir Christopher Hogg resigned as a member of the Committee with effect from 1st January 2004 and Sir Robert Wilson was appointed in his place from that date. Committee members bring considerable nancial and accounting experience to the Committee's work. Members have past employment experience in either nance or accounting roles or comparable experience in corporate activities. The Board has determined that the combined qualications and experience of the Committee members, when taken together with its modus operandi, gives the Committee collectively the nancial expertise necessary to discharge its responsibilities. Accordingly the Board has chosen not to nominate any one committee member as having recent and relevant nancial experience. In arriving at its conclusion the Board considered the following points. Dr Ronaldo Schmitz has been the Chairman of the Committee since April 2001. Prior to his appointment as a Non-Executive Director of the company he was a Non-Executive Director of Glaxo Wellcome plc where he served on the Audit Committee. Dr Schmitz has also been a member of the Executive Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank AG. He retired from that Board in 2000 having been in charge of investment banking. Dr Schmitz was formerly a member of the Executive Board of Directors of BASF from 1980 to 1990, including CFO from 1985 to 1990. He holds an MBA from Insead. Sir Peter Job was CEO of Reuters plc from 1991 to 2001 and brings considerable industrial experience to his role as a member of the Committee. Sir Ian Prosser was CFO and later CEO of Six Continents PLC and is a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Sir Robert Wilson began his professional career as an economist. He held senior management positions at Rio Tinto plc culminating in his appointment as Executive Chairman. The Committee is supported by the Company Secretary, who attends the Committee's meetings, and it has available to it nancial resources to take independent professional advice when considered necessary. Meetings of the Committee are attended by the Chairman, CEO, CFO, General Counsel, Head of Global Internal Audit (GIA), CCO and the external auditors. In 2003 the Committee worked to a structured programme of activities, with agenda matters focused to coincide with key events of the annual nancial reporting cycle, together with standing items that the Committee is required to consider at each meeting: the external auditors reported to the Committee on all critical accounting policies and practices used by the company, alternative accounting treatments which had been discussed with management and the resultant conclusion by the external auditors, material written communications with management and any restrictions on access to information the CFO reported on the nancial performance of the company and on technical nancial and accounting matters the General Counsel reported on material litigation the Company Secretary reported on corporate governance the Head of GIA reported on the effectiveness of the system of internal controls and the steps taken to improve the company's risk management framework the CCO reported on the activities undertaken by the ROCC the Company Secretary is the Chairman of the Disclosure Committee and reported on matters that affect the quality and timely disclosure of nancial and other material information to the Board, to the public markets and to shareholders. This enabled the Committee to review the clarity and completeness of the disclosures in the published annual nancial statements, interim reports, quarterly and preliminary results announcements and other formal announcements relating to nancial performance prior to their release by the Board. The Audit Committee, management, internal audit and the full Board all work together to ensure the quality of the company's corporate accounting and nancial reporting. The Committee serves as the primary link between the Board and the external and internal auditors. This facilitates the necessary independence from management and encourages the external and internal auditors to communicate freely and regularly with the Committee. In 2003, the Committee met both collectively and separately with the external auditors and the Head of GIA. The Committee has primary responsibility for making a recommendation to shareholders on the appointment, reappointment and removal of the external auditors by annually assessing the qualications, expertise, resources and independence of the external auditors and the effectiveness of the audit process. In making its assessment, the Committee considers papers which detail the relevant regulatory requirements required of external auditors and evaluates reports from the external auditors on their stated compliance with the requirements. Where the external auditors provide non-audit services, the Committee ensures that auditor objectivity and independence are safeguarded by a policy requiring pre-approval by the Audit Committee for such services. Expenditure on audit and non-audit services is set out on page 102. The guidelines set out in the company's policy on engaging the external auditors to provide non-audit services, include ascertaining that: the skills and experience of the external auditors make them a suitable supplier of the non-audit services; adequate safeguards are in place so that the objectivity and independence of the audit are not compromised; the fee levels relative to the annual audit fee are within the limits set by the Committee; and the criteria which govern the compensation of individuals performing the annual audit are appropriate. The company also has well-established policies, including a Code of Ethics, which is available on the website, and a help-line facility for the reporting and investigation of unlawful conduct. The Committee met in full session four times in 2003 and four times on a quorate basis. Each full session was attended by all members. Nominations Committee Report The Nominations Committee's terms of reference include responsibility for proposing the appointment of Board and Committee members. During 2003 three new Non-Executive Directors and one Executive Director were appointed. In the case of the Non-Executive Directors the Committee considered the particular skills, knowledge and experience that would benet the Board most signicantly for each appointment. The broad selection criteria focused on achieving a balance between the representation of UK and US markets, and having individuals with CEO experience and skills developed in various sectors. The Board engaged a professional search agency specialising in the recruitment of high calibre Non-Executive Directors. A dossier of potential Non-Executive appointees was provided to the Committee and candidates were short-listed for interview after considering their relevant qualications. The new Non-Executive Directors were selected and appointed and will offer themselves for election at the company's 2004 AGM. Their appointments were announced publicly. A customised induction process was conducted for each of the new Non-Executive Directors focusing on their particular experience and taking account of their different backgrounds. This process included meeting key members of the CET and, other key executives and, in some cases, visiting particular operational facilities of the Group. The Committee also recommended that the Board consider appointing Dr Tachi Yamada, the executive responsible for pharmaceutical R&D within the Group, as an Executive Director. Dr Yamada was subsequently appointed to the Board with effect from 1st January 2004. The Committee met once during 2003 in full session and once on a quorate basis. All members were present at the full meeting. Remuneration Report The Remuneration Report can be found on pages 43 to 58. The Combined Code Throughout 2003 the company complied with the code provisions of the 1998 Combined Code except as follows: A.2.1 - The Board should appoint one of the independent Non-Executive Directors to be the Senior Independent Director. Sir Roger Hurn was Senior Independent Director from 1st January 2003 until 5th June 2003. For the remainder of the year all Non-Executive Directors remained available to shareholders to raise concerns which could not be addressed through the Chairman, CEO or CFO. In December 2003, following the Nominations Committee review of the Board's structure and composition, the Board announced the appointment of Sir Ian Prosser as Senior Independent Director, with effect from 1st January 2004 B.1.6 - In schemes of performance related remuneration, neither annual bonuses nor benets in kind should be pensionable. Pension contributions are not solely determined on the basis of basic salary. The company's position is described in the Remuneration Report on pages 43 to 58 B.1.7 - Notice or contract periods for service contracts to be one year or less. The company's position is described in the Remuneration Report on pages 43 to 58 B.1.9 - Compensation commitments in the event of early termination of a director's contract. The company's position in respect of Mr Coombe's previous contract is described in the Remuneration Report on pages 43 to 58. The company is required to comply with the 2003 Combined Code from 1st January 2004 and report on compliance in its 2004 Annual Report which will be issued in 2005. In this regard the measures described below have been implemented: A.1.1 and A.6.1 - The Annual Report contains a statement of how the Board operates and the decisions taken by it and those which are delegated to management, and the manner in which the performance of the Board, its committees and individual directors are evaluated A.2.1 - The Board has also recorded the division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the CEO A.3.1 - The company has determined the independence of its Non-Executive Directors and stated reasons for their independence notwithstanding the existence of relationships or circumstances that are likely to affect, or could appear to affect their independence A.3.3 - The Board appointed with effect from 1st January 2004 one of the independent Non-Executive Directors as a senior independent director A.4.6, B.1.4 and C.3.3 - The Annual Report contains the required statements on the work of the Nominations, Remuneration and Audit Committees A.5.1 - New directors received a full, formal and tailored customised induction on joining the Board 42 GlaxoSmithKline Corporate governance GlaxoSmithKline 43 B.2.1, C.3.1 and A.4.1 - The composition and positions held For accounting periods ending after 15th April 2005, Sarbanes- Remuneration Report by the members of each of the Remuneration, Audit and Oxley requires that the company's Annual Report contain a report Nominations Committees now comply with the 2003 Combined stating the responsibility of management for establishing and Code.

It represents a major change to the method hitherto applied for pay comparison, which had been based solely on estimated present value using a mathematical model. The Committee believes that the new approach will moderate the impact of market fluctuations in the short term and greatly strengthen the focus on performance. 46 GlaxoSmithKline Remuneration Report Remuneration Report GlaxoSmithKline 47 Individual elements of remuneration The balance between the xed (base salary) and variable (annual bonus and long-term incentive) elements of remuneration changes with performance. The chart below shows the normal range of variability for the CEO, Dr Garnier, and salary Annual bonus Long-term incentives Base salary Base salaries will be set by reference to the median for the relevant market. For Executives this is the pharmaceutical pay comparator group. Actual salary levels are reviewed annually and may vary depending on an Executive's experience, responsibility and market value. Any changes usually take effect from 1st April. No increase arose out of the independent review. Annual bonus All bonuses are determined on the basis of a formal review of annual performance against stretching nancial targets based on business performance prot before interest and tax and are subject to detailed assessment of individual, business unit and group achievements against objectives. No bonus is payable if nancial performance is less than 96 per cent of the target performance. Bonuses are subject to upper limits, which for the Executives other than the CEO range between 100 per cent and 200 per cent of base salary. The CEO's limit is 200 per cent. An annual bonus paid on the basis of on target business performance together with base salary provides annual cash in line with the median of the pay comparator group. In the case of the CEO, the bonus targets are set by the Committee. Following the end of the nancial year, the Committee reviews the CEO's performance and determines the bonus payable. The CEO makes recommendations to the Committee regarding the performance level achieved against objectives for the other Executives. These recommendations are then considered by the Committee to determine the resultant bonus. Executives can also choose to invest their bonus in GlaxoSmithKline shares for a minimum of three years under the Annual Investment Plan. At the end of the three-year holding period Executives are entitled to a matching award of 10 per cent of their deferred shareholding. The match is not subject to further performance conditions. This plan is open to approximately 700 senior executives on the same terms. The Committee believes that these arrangements encourage shareholding amongst senior executives and considers it appropriate for the Executives to participate on the same terms. Bonus awards for 2003 reflected the Committee's belief that the company produced superior results during the year, after taking account of factors outside the control of management, notably exchange rate changes and the launch of generic competition to Paxil in the USA. Long-term incentives Executives are eligible for performance share awards and share options. The remuneration policy provides that annual long-term incentive awards will normally be made up of a performance share award and a share option award. The new remuneration policy increases the emphasis on the use of performance shares. The Committee considers that performance shares provide a stronger alignment to shareholder value and therefore, the new remuneration policy increases the emphasis on the use of performance shares. Long-term incentive awards are determined such that for on target performance more than half of the long-term incentive reward is derived from performance shares. The grant of annual awards using more than one plan is consistent with the practice of the pay comparator group and other leading UK companies. Long-term incentives for the CET will be on the same basis as that for the Executive Directors. From 2003, in a departure from the previous policy, share options granted to CET members are subject to the same performance conditions as are applied to share options granted to the Executive Directors. This provides a closer alignment to UK best practice and represents a major step change in the global pharmaceutical pay practice, which typically does not apply performance conditions to the vesting of options. As part of the review process, the Committee considered what performance conditions should be applied to the long-term incentives. The Committee concluded that it was appropriate to measure performance using a combination of absolute nancial results (based on Earnings per Share - EPS) and the delivery of superior value to shareholders (based on Total Shareholder Return - TSR). The Committee concluded that EPS was the key measure of performance of the business and was also fully reflected through the business measures extended throughout the Group, ensuring organisational alignment. Comparative performance was previously measured by reference to the FTSE 100 but the Committee concluded that the measurement of performance against the performance comparator group of pharmaceutical companies (see page 45) would provide a better assessment of the company's performance. TSR was chosen as the most appropriate comparative measure since it focuses on the return to shareholders, is a well understood and tested mechanism to measure performance, and allows comparison between companies operating in different countries. Performance share awards and share options will be delivered to US resident executives in the form of ADSs. Awards are delivered in the form of Ordinary Shares to executives resident in the UK and other countries. All awards are made under plans which incorporate dilution limits consistent with the guidelines provided by the Association of British Insurers, the National Association of Pension Funds and other shareholder representative bodies. Current estimated dilution from existing awards made since the merger is approximately four per cent of the company's share capital at 31st December 2003. a) Performance shares For the Executives, the level of performance shares vesting is based on the company's TSR relative to the performance comparator group over a three-year measurement period. TSR will be measured in sterling over the performance period and is the change in the value of a share together with the value of reinvested dividends paid. In order to remove the impact of the varying tax treatments of dividends in different jurisdictions, all dividends will be reinvested gross. If GlaxoSmithKline is ranked at the median of the performance comparator group, 35 per cent of the shares will vest. Only if GlaxoSmithKline is one of the top two companies will all of the shares vest. When determining vesting levels, the Committee will have regard for the company's underlying nancial performance. TSR rank with 14 companies & Percentage of GlaxoSmithKline award vesting* 1 100% 2 100% 3 90% 5 6 7 50% Median 35% Below median 0% * TSR is measured on a pro-rata basis. Where GlaxoSmithKline's performance falls between two of the comparators, the level of vesting will be determined by the actual relative level of TSR rather than simple ranking. To provide a closer link between shareholder returns and payments to the Executives, from 2003, notional dividends will be reinvested and paid out in proportion to the vesting of the award. The receipt of dividends has been incorporated into the benchmarking of award levels. In addition, from 2003, performance shares earned by the Executives cannot be sold, except to meet related tax liabilities, for a further two years following the end of the vesting period. The Committee believes that this further aligns the interests of the Executives with the long-term interests of shareholders. Prior to 2003, performance share awards were in two parts: half could be earned by reference to GlaxoSmithKline's TSR performance compared to the FTSE 100, of which the company is a constituent, and the other half of the award was deliverable if the company's business performance EPS growth, excluding currency and exceptional items, was on average at least three percentage points per annum more than the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the three-year performance period. For these pre-2003 awards, if GlaxoSmithKline delivers returns which would rank in the top 20 of the FTSE 100 based on TSR performance, then all of the shares, in this part of the award, will vest. For the 50th position in the FTSE 100, 40 per cent of the shares will vest. If GlaxoSmithKline is ranked below 50th position, none of the shares, subject to this part of the award, will vest. Between the 20th and 50th positions, vesting will occur on a sliding scale. b) Share options Share options allow a holder to buy shares at a future date at the share price prevailing at the time of grant. Share options are granted to more than 11,000 managers at GlaxoSmithKline including the Executives. The share options granted in 2003 to the Executives are linked to the achievement of compound annual EPS growth over the performance period. When setting EPS targets the Committee will consider the company's internal projections and analysts' forecasts for GlaxoSmithKline's EPS performance as well as analysts' forecasts for the pharmaceutical industry. The Committee agreed the following key principles to govern the use of EPS as a performance measure: adjustments will only be considered for major items adjustments will be for the judgement of the Committee the purpose of the adjustments is to ensure that the performance measurement is fair and reasonable to both participants and shareholders any discretion exercised by the Committee will be disclosed to shareholders in the Annual Report. The Committee will set out the basis of its decision if it considers it appropriate to make any adjustment. Prior to 2003 only those share options granted to Executive Directors were subject to a performance condition. In order for the options to vest in full, business performance EPS growth, excluding currency and exceptional items, had on average to be at least three percentage points per annum more than the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over any three-year performance period. For the 2003 grant, vesting increases on a straight line basis for EPS performance between the hurdles set out in the table below. Annualised Percentage of growth in EPS award vesting > RPI 5% 100% + 3% 0% This performance condition is substantially consistent with UK shareholder guidelines and expectations and is considerably more demanding than any operated by other global pharmaceutical companies. This change is consistent with the new policy of providing pay for performance and only for performance. For the Executives, from 2003 onwards, performance will be measured over the three nancial years following the grant of an option. The Committee has decided for the 2003 grant that if the performance condition is not met in full after the three year period, performance will be measured again over the four nancial years following the date of grant of the option. To the extent the option performance conditions have not been met at the end of four years, the option will lapse. The Committee considers re-measurement to be an important feature for the 2003 grant in the light of the imposition of performance conditions in an industry where most of the major competitors do not apply them to options. The Committee will consider prior to each annual grant of options whether a re-measurement will be permitted. Pensions The Executives participate in GlaxoSmithKline senior executive pension plans. The pension arrangements are structured in accordance with the plans operated for Executives in the country in which the Executives are likely to retire. Benets are normally payable at age 60.

The amendments relate to the following aspects: on termination by the company for poor performance, the notice period and related severance payments are reduced from 24 to 12 months the entitlement to post-notice long-term incentive grants has been removed on termination by the company, performance share awards made 12 months prior to the termination notice date will lapse. For new CET members, the same standard contractual terms as outlined above for Executive Directors will apply. Non-Executive Directors terms, conditions and fees Non-Executive Directors of GlaxoSmithKline do not have service contracts but instead have letters of appointment. The company aims to provide Non-Executive Directors with fees that are competitive with other companies of equivalent size and complexity. Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to compensation if their appointment is terminated. To enhance the link between Directors and shareholders and as set out in the table below, GlaxoSmithKline requires Non-Executive Directors to receive a signicant part of their fees in the form of shares allocated to a share account and offers the opportunity to invest part or all of the balance of fees in a share account. These shares are not paid out until the Director's retirement from the Board, or at a later date, and are paid on the basis of dividends reinvested in the interim. The Chairman and the chairmen of the Board Committees receive higher fees.

Following retirement they received the value of their shares and ADSs as awarded under the Non-Executive Directors' share arrangements (page 53) and equivalent SmithKline Beecham arrangements. As at 5th June 2003 they had been awarded shares and ADSs with a total value at the date of award, as indicated: Sir Roger Hurn \u00a3184,771 and Mr Allaire \u00a351,817. On 5th June 2003 the value of these shares and ADSs due to them was: Sir Roger Hurn \u00a3156,401 and Mr Allaire \u00a341,338. The change in value is attributable to dividends re-invested and the change in share price between the dates of awards and 5th June 2003. Sir Roger has elected to receive the value of his shares as at 5th June 2003 in quarterly instalments over 10 years and, accordingly, received \u00a37,894 in 2003. Mr Allaire elected to receive the 1,627 ADSs due to him on retirement. Mr Young has elected to receive the value of his shares as at 20th May 2002 in three annual instalments and accordingly, received \u00a348,307 in 2003.

The deferred fees are now indexed to the total return on G laxoSmithKline shares and are payable over seven years following Mr McHenry's retirement as a Non-Executive Director of GlaxoSmithKline. The total accumulated value of deferred fees on 31st December 2003, r estated to reflect the merger and fully provided for, was equivalent to 22,563 GlaxoSmithKline ADSs. d Includes shares and ADSs received as part or all of their fees as described under Non-Executive Directors' share arrangements above. Dividends received on these shares and ADSs were converted to shares and ADSs as at 31st December 2003. These are also included in the Directors' interests above. The interests of the above-mentioned Directors at 27th February 2004 reflect changes between the end of the nancial year and that date.

An initial grant was made following completion of the merger in March 2001. The measurement period for the options granted in March 2001 commenced on 1st January 2001. The measurement periods for options granted in November 2001, 2002 and 2003 commenced on 1st January 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively. The Directors hold these options under the various share option plans referred to in Note 34 to the Financial statements, 'Employee share schemes'. None of the other Directors had an interest in any option over the company's shares. Following the merger, each of the Directors above elected to exchange their outstanding options in the legacy share option plans for options over GlaxoSmithKline shares. These Directors and all other participants in those legacy schemes who made such an election, will receive an additional benet of a cash sum equal to 10 per cent of the grant price of the original option. This additional benet will be given when the new option is exercised or lapses, provided the exercise or lapse is on or after the second anniversary of the e ffective date of the merger (or, as in the case of Sir Richard Sykes, on cessation of executive employment, if earlier). 2003 2002 Grant Market Options exercised Date Number price price Gain Gain Dr J - At the average exchange rate for the year, the above gain made by Dr Garnier amounted to \u00a33,097,260. On 19th February 2004, Dr Garnier exercised 231,052 options with an exercise price of $14.53 giving rise to a gain of $6,621,049. Dr Garnier also received $335,730 in respect of the Exchange Offer Incentive benet arising on the exercise of these options. Mr Coombe did not exercise any share options during 2003 or 2002. The highest and lowest closing prices during the year ended 31st December 2003 for GlaxoSmithKline shares were \u00a313.90 and \u00a310.0 0, respectively. The highest and lowest prices for GlaxoSmithKline ADSs during the year ended 31st December 2003 were $47.64 and $ 31.85, respectively. The market price for a GlaxoSmithKline share on 31st December 2003 was \u00a312.80 (31st December 2002 - \u00a311.92) and fo r a GlaxoSmithKline ADS was $46.62 (31st December 2002 - $37.46). The share price on 27th February 2004 was \u00a311.21 per GlaxoSmithKline share and $42.62 per GlaxoSmithKline ADS. 56 GlaxoSmithKline Remuneration Report Remuneration Report GlaxoSmithKline 57 Incentive plans Granted ADSs Market ADSs Performance Share Plan - ADSs at 31.12.02 Number price at 31.12.03 Dr J P Garnier - 2001 award 70,000 - - 70,000 2002 award 70,000 - - 70,000 2003 award 70,000 - - 70,000 2004 award - 200,000 $44.57 200,000 Granted Shares Market Shares Performance Share Plan - shares at 31.12.02 Number price at 31.12.03 Mr J D Coombe - 2001 award 40,000 - - 40,000 2002 award 40,000 - - 40,000 2003 award 40,000 - - 40,000 2004 award - 120,000 \u00a312.70 120,000 The Performance Share Plan (PSP) is a medium-term incentive scheme introduced during 2001. The PSP replaces the Long-Term Incen tive Plan and the Mid-Term Incentive Plan operated respectively by Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. Under the terms of the PSP the number of shares actually vesting is determined following the end of the relevant three year mea surement period and is dependent on GlaxoSmithKline's performance during that period as described on pages 46 and 47. The share awards a re granted annually in November or December and the measurement period commences on the following 1st January, ending after three years on 31st December. The three year measurement period for the 2001 award ended on 31st December 2003. Based on the performance of GlaxoSmithKline during that period, 50 per cent of the 2001 award vested in February 2004.

The plan closed to new entrants upon completion of the merger and no further grants have been made. The award made to Mr Coombe in February 2000 vested in February 2003 on completion of the measurement period. In connection with the merger the performance conditions in respect of the grant m ade in February 2000 were waived.

The plan closed to new entrants upo n completion of the merger and no further participations have been granted. In connection with the merger, the performance condit ions in respect of grants made in 1999 were waived. The measurement period ended on 31st December 2002. The participations that vested in 2003 were awarded to Dr Garnier on 24th November 1999 when the ADS price was $59.88. The ADS price at the time of vesting was $35.85. Where a nal award of ADSs is made, receipt of the award may be deferred by a Director. Dr Garnier deferred receipt of the full amounts awarded in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003. The deferred awards, together with any additional ADSs subsequently received through dividend reinvestment, are not included in the Directors' interests table on page 54 since technically they are retained in the MTIP until paid out. Average Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) - ADSs At 31.12.02 At 31.12.03 grant price Dr L Shapiro 1,487 1,487 $50.34 All SARs held by Dr L Shapiro have a grant price above the market price of a GlaxoSmithKline ADS at year end. Dr Shapiro is a member of GlaxoSmithKline's Scientic Advisory Board (SAB). Dr Shapiro was a member of SmithKline Beecham's SAB from 1993 until the completion of the merger with Glaxo Wellcome. Along with other members of the SAB, she received annual grants of SmithKline Beecham SARs which, in general, vested three years from the date of grant and will expire 10 years from the date of grant. Grants of SARs to SAB members ceased in 1999. SARs entitle the holder to a cash sum at a future date based on share price growth between the date of grant and the date of ex ercise. Full provision is made in the nancial statements for accrued gains on SARs from the date of grant. In connection with the merger, all previously granted SARs became immediately exercisable. Pensions The accrued annual pension benets and transfer values for Executive Directors on retirement are set out below. The regulations require disclosure of: the accrued benet at the end of the year; the change in accrued benet over the year; the transfer value at both the beginning and end of the year, and the change in the transfer value over the year. The Listing Rules require a dditional disclosure of the change in accrued benet net of inflation and the transfer value of this change. Change in Change in Change accrued Transfer value Accrued Accrued accrued Transfer Transfer over year benet over of change benet benet benet value value in transfer year net in accrued at 31.12.02 at 31.12.03 over year at 31.12.02 at 5,636 676 (313) 291 317 26 4,723 6,436 1,713 21 438 * The change in transfer value is shown net of contributions made by the individual. Dr Garnier is a member of the all employee US cash balance pension plan, under which GlaxoSmithKline makes annual contributions calculated as a percentage of the employee's base salary and bonus. The fund increases at an interest rate set annually in advance based on the 30 year treasury bond rate to provide a cash sum at retirement. This cash sum is used to purchase a pension at retirement based on the annuity rates applicable at that time. Dr Garnier has no entitlement to a spouse's pension or to pension increases, other than by reducing his own initial pension. The normal retirement age under this plan is 65 years of age. Dr Garnier's pension arrangements have been bought into line with the terms of his service agreement and the assumed retirement age reduced to 60. The effect of this has been to reduce Dr Garnier's accrued benet by \u00a3295,184 per annum (\u00a3313,427 per annum excluding the effects of inflation) as the cash balance available under Dr Garnier's plan is now required to purchase an annuity for ve more years than previously assumed. The transfer value, or cash sum, of Dr Garnier's plan has increased by \u00a3676,261 over the year as a result of phased transfers froma previous scheme, the further accumulation of interest and contributions paid by the Company of ve per cent of base salary plus bonus. Dr Garnier's accrued benet and transfer value have been translated at the year-end exchange rate of \u00a31/US$1.79 (2002 - \u00a31/US$1.61). The change in accrued benet and transfer value have been translated at the average exchange rate of \u00a31/US$1.64 (2002 - \u00a31/US$1.50). Accordingly the changes in accrued benet and transfer value stated above exclude exchange losses as follows: change in accrued benet over year \u00a368,701; change in accrued benet over year net of inflation \u00a369,041 and change over year in transfer value \u00a3617,565. Dr Garnier is also a member of the US Retirement Savings Plan, a money purchase scheme open to all US employees. Contributions a re invested in a range of funds and the value of the accumulated funds are paid at retirement. During 2003 contributions of \u00a388,609 were paid into this scheme by the company in respect of Dr Garnier, of which \u00a32,439 was invested in GlaxoSmithKline shares in a stock ownership account. The shares held in this account are included within the Director's interests tables on page 54. Mr Coombe's transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 .T h e transfer value represents the present value of future payments to be made under the pension plan. Whilst Mr Coombe's annual accrued benet has increased by \u00a326,377 (\u00a321,433 excluding the effects of inflation), the transfer value has increased by \u00a31.7 million over the year. This increase has arisen primarily as a result of the following factors: The method of calculating the transfer value is reviewed following the completion of each formal valuation of the pension scheme to ensure that the assumptions used continue to be reasonable. Following the 31st December 2002 valuation, various assumptions were updated including increasing the allowance for the life expectancy of members after retirement which led to an increase in the transfer values of all pension fund members. The assumptions used will continue to be reviewed following each valuation and adjusted as and when appropriate Annual increases to transfer values become larger the closer an individual is to retirement. Under the terms of Mr Coombe's service agreement he will retire at the age of 60. As Mr Coombe approaches retirement the transfer value of his pension will further increase to reflect the level of funds required to meet the annual accrued benet payments The yield of gilts, to which the underlying assets are linked, has declined therefore leading to an increase in the market value of the gilts required to meet the annual accrued benet. 58 GlaxoSmithKline Remuneration Report GlaxoSmithKline 59 Operating and nancial review and prospects Directors and Senior Management For US reporting purposes, it is necessary to provide information on compensation and interests of Directors and Senior Management as a group ('the group'). For the purposes of this disclosure, the group is dened as the Directors, members of the CET and the Company Secretary. In respect of the nancial year 2003, the total compensation paid to members of the group for the periods during which they served in that capacity was \u00a316,106,911, the aggregate decrease in accrued pension benets was \u00a3174,219 and the aggregate paymen t to dened contribution schemes was \u00a3318,480. During 2003 members of the group were granted options over 845,500 shares and 1,149,250 ADSs and awarded 355,500 shares and 499,500 ADSs in the Performance Share Plan. At 27th February 2004, the then-current members of the group (comprising 26 persons) owned 460,939 shares and 451,034 ADSs, constituting less than one per cen t of the issued share capital of the company. The group also held, at that date: options to purchase 4,788,785 shares and 6,744,234 ADSs; 619,500 shares and 841,310 ADSs awarded under the Performance Share Plan, including those shares and ADS's that are vested and deferred; 4,188 shares and 227,262 ADSs under the legacy SmithKline Beecham Mid-Term Incentive Plan, including those shares and ADSs that are vested and deferred, and 1,487 ADSs awarded under the legacy SmithKline Beecham Stock Appreciation Right s. These holdings were issued under the various executive share option plans described in Note 34 to the Financial statements, 'Employee share schemes'. Directors' interests in contracts Except as described in Note 35 to the Financial statements, 'Related party transactions', during or at the end of the nancial year no Director or connected person had any material interest in any contract of signicance in relation to the Group's business with a Group company. The Directors' Remuneration Report has been approved by the Board of Directors and signed on its behalf by Sir Christopher Hogg Chairman 3rd March 2004 The Operating and nancial review and prospects discusses the operating and nancial performance of the Group, the nancial outlook and the nancial resources of the Group, under the following headings: 60 Financial trends and ratios 61 2003 Year - results for the year to 31st December 2003 compared to the year to 31st December 2002 70 Financial position and resources - at 31st December 2003 74 Outlook and risk factors Additionally, in accordance with US requirements: 77 2002 Year - results for the year to 31st December 2002 compared to the year to 31st December 2001 83 Selected nancial data UK/US GAAP The results for each year are compared primarily with the results for the preceding year. Reference is made also to quarterly and half-yearly trends within the results, where appropriate. Exchange The Group, as a multinational business, operates in many countries and earns revenues and incurs costs in many currencies. The results of the Group, as reported in sterling, are therefore affected by movements in exchange rates between sterling and overseas currencies. The Group uses the average exchange rates prevailing during the period to translate the results and cash flows of overseas Group subsidiary and associated undertakings and joint ventures into sterling and period end rates to translate the net assets of those undertakings. The currencies which most influence these translations are the US dollar, the Euro and the Japanese Yen. During 2003 average sterling exchange rates were stronger against the US dollar and the Japanese Yen by nine per cent and two per cent respectively, and weaker against the Euro by nine per cent, compared with 2002, giving an overall adverse currency impact on the results for the year. Business performance and constant exchange rates Business performance, which is the primary performance measure used by management, is presented after excluding merger items, integration and restructuring costs and the disposal of businesses. Management believes that exclusion of these items provides a better reflection of the way in which the business is managed and gives an indication of the performance of the Group in terms of those elements of revenue and expenditure which local management is able to influence. This information, which is provided in addition to the statutory results prepared under UK GAAP , which appear on pages 88 and 89, is given to assist shareholders to gain a clearer understanding of the underlying performance of the business and to increase comparability for the periods presented. In order to illustrate underlying performance, it is the Group's practice to discuss its results in terms of constant exchange rate (CER) growth. This represents growth calculated as if the exchange rates used to determine the results of overseas companies in sterling had remained unchanged from those used in the previous year. CER% represents growth at constant exchange rates. \u00a3% represents growth at actual exchange rates. 60 GlaxoSmithKline Operating and nancial review and prospects Operating and nancial review and prospects GlaxoSmithKline 61 Financial trends and ratios 2003 Year Statutory results 2003 Growth 2002 Growth 2001 World economy World market - pharmaceuticals \u00a3m CER% \u00a3% 5 4 1 1 17,995 3,217 8 2 5 (2) 17,205 3,284 Fears of terrorism, SARS and the war in Iraq, including uncertainties of the war's aftermath, held the headlines in 2003.

These were partly offset by increased selling costs to support new product launches, charges relating to cost saving programmes and increased pension costs. Without the merger integration costs SG&A grew four per cent driven by selling cost increases, which accounted for a three percentage point increase. The charges relating to operational excellence and pension cost increases each individually added one percentage point, while cost savings reduced growth by one percentage point. Together these produced a reduction of 2.5 percentage points relative to 2002 for the expenses expressed as a percentage of turnover. Research and development R&D declined one per cent reflecting reduced merger integration costs, partly offset by increased clinical trial and in-licensing activity and the reinvestment of merger synergies.

A small pricing benet was more than offset by an adverse exchange impact. Selling, general and administration Selling, general and administration (SG&A) costs grew four per cent reflecting increased selling costs to support new product launches, charges relating to operational excellence cost saving programmes and increased pension costs, partly offset by cost saving initiatives. These cost saving initiatives were relatively small restructuring activities in 2002 and 2003. It is estimated that without the operational excellence charges SG&A would have grown three per cent, driven principally by selling cost increases. Pension cost increases added one percentage point, but these were offset by cost saving initiatives. Together these produced a reduction of 0.2 percentage points expressed as a percentage of turnover. Research and development Research and development (R&D) increased four per cent reflecting claims, partially offset by higher 2003 proceeds from product disposals and equity investment sales.

Merger items, restructuring costs and disposal of businesses Merger and manufacturing restructuring GlaxoSmithKline has made good progress with its merger and manufacturing restructuring plans. The merger programmes are substantially complete at the end of 2003. Combined these programmes have now produced annual savings which exceeded the published target of \u00a31.8 billion. The focus of operational excellence is on value creation and the elimination of waste and bureaucracy. This programme has become an integral part of the way the business is managed and so any charges are booked to business performance. Costs of \u00a3369 million were incurred in the year in respect of merger and manufacturing restructuring. After tax relief of \u00a391 million, the net charge was \u00a3278 million. The costs in 2003 include severance, asset write-downs, professional fees and site closure. 68 GlaxoSmithKline Operating and nancial review and prospects Operating and nancial r eview and prospects GlaxoSmithKline 69 Block Drug Company, Inc. GlaxoSmithKline uses the best advice in determining its transfer Critical accounting policies Impairment of xed assets GlaxoSmithKline acquired Block Drug in January 2001. The costs incurred in integrating this business were \u00a326 million in 2003 including redundancies, asset write-downs and site closures. Disposal of businesses The prot on disposal of businesses in 2003 of \u00a35 million reflects the nal settlements regarding the disposal of the Healthcare Services businesses in 1999. Taxation 2003 2002 \u00a3m \u00a3m pricing methodology and in seeking to manage transfer pricing issues to a satisfactory conclusion and, on the basis of external professional advice, continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from open assessments. However, there continues to be a wide difference of views between the Group and the IRS. The ultimate liability for such matters may vary signicantly from amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings and negotiations with the relevant tax authorities. The credit for taxation on merger and restructuring items amounting to \u00a3109 million reflects the actual tax rate applicable The consolidated nancial statements are prepared in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting principles, following the accounting policies approved by the Board and described in Note 2 to the Financial statements, 'Accounting policies'. Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in the nancial statements. Actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates. The following are considered to be the critical accounting policies adopted. Turnover The carrying values of xed assets subject to depreciation and amortisation are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that the values of the assets might be impaired. Impairment is determined by reference to the higher of net realisable value and value in use, measured by reference to risk-adjusted future cashflows discounted using appropriate risk-free interest rates. These future cashflows are based on business forecasts and are therefore inherently judgemental. Future events could cause the assumptions used in these impairment reviews to change with a consequent adverse effect on the future results of the Group. Business performance (1,848) (1,760) Merger, restructuring and disposal of subsidiaries 109 299 Total (1,739) (1,461) The integrated nature of the Group's worldwide operations, involving signicant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets, gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the prots on which individual Group companies are liable to tax. Disagreements with, and between, revenue authorities as to intra-Group transactions, in particular the price at which goods to the transactions in the territories in which they arise. Earnings 2003 2002 Statutory earnings (\u00a3m) 4,484 3,915 Basic earnings per share 77.2p 66.2p ADS $2.53 $1.99 Adjusted 4,765 4,627 Adjusted earnings 82.1p 78.3p Adjusted earnings per ADS $2.69 $2.35 Weighted of shares (millions) 5,806 5,912 Growth CER% \u00a3% 20 15 23 17 23 27 8 3 10 5 10 14 Gross turnover is reduced by discounts and allowances which vary by product arrangements and buying groups. These arrangements with purchasing organisations are dependent upon the submission of claims some time after the initial recognition of the sale. A provision is made at the time of sale for the estimated discount or allowance payable based on historical experience. These amounts are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the types of buying group and product sales mix. The level of provision is reviewed regularly in the light of historical experience of actual discounts or allowances given and any changes in arrangements. Future events could cause the assumptions on which the discounts are based to change, which could affect the future results of the Group. Investment in own shares GlaxoSmithKline has invested in its own shares through Employee Share Ownership Trusts in order to meet obligations arising from certain of the company's employee share option schemes. These shares are held at cost, less a provision to recognise any shortfall in the proceeds receivable from the employee on exercise, unless management believes there to be a permanent impairment in their value in relation to the period of time over which the related share options may be exercised. Any impairment would have an adverse effect on the results of the Group in that accounting period. In 2004, following a change in UK accounting requirements, these shares will be shown as a deduction from equity shareholders' funds and will no longer be subject to should be transferred between Group companies in different tax jurisdictions, can produce conflicting claims from revenue authorities as to the prots that fall to be taxed in individual territories. Resolution of such issues is a continuing fact of life for GlaxoSmithKline. The Group has open issues with the revenue authorities in the USA, UK, Japan and Canada, but by far the largest relates to Glaxo heritage products in the USA. In the USA, for a number of years, GlaxoSmithKline has had signicant open issues relating to transfer pricing. GlaxoSmithKline has attempted to settle the dispute, rst through direct discussion with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and subsequently through discussions between the USA and UK authorities under the terms of the double tax convention between the two countries. GlaxoSmithKline understands that the views of the two tax authorities were so different that they were unable to reach agreement, and discussions were terminated in July 2003. The Group has now received a claim for additional taxes that the IRS asserts legacy company Glaxo Wellcome owes for the years 1989 to 1996. This statutory notice of deciency for $2.7 billion (\u00a31.5 billion) in tax principally relates to the allocation of prots for Glaxo heritage products between the USA and other countries. To the extent that the IRS were successful in its claim, interest would be payable. GlaxoSmithKline estimates the interest on the full claim to date would be approximately $2.5 billion (\u00a31.4 billion), net of federal tax relief. As similar tax issues remain open for 1997 to date, GlaxoSmithKline expects to receive further claims by the IRS for these years. Since GlaxoSmithKline has exhausted all administrative remedies open to it, the company plans to contest this claim for additional taxes by ling a petition in the US Tax Court, where a trial is not expected until sometime in 2005 or 2006. GlaxoSmithKline continues to believe that the prots reported by the US subsidiaries for the period 1989 to date, on which it has paid taxes in the USA, are more than sufcient to reflect the Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share are presented above in order to illustrate business performance which is the primary measure used by management. Adjusted earnings increased by eight per cent. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 10 per cent reflecting the reduction in the weighted average number of shares resulting from the Group's share buy-back programme. The interest cost of this programme also impacts the Group's earnings. At actual rates of exchange, adjusted earnings per share increased ve per cent in sterling terms, compared with 10 per cent in CER terms. The adverse currency impact on EPS of ve per cent in the year reflected the signicant weakening of the US dollar relative to 2002 and compares with a four per cent adverse currency impact on turnover. This difference principally arises from a different mix of currencies in prots compared with turnover. Taken together with other expenses, taxation and business disposals this resulted in a basic EPS of 77.2 pence compared with 66.2 pence in 2002 and a diluted EPS of 77.0 pence compared with 66.0 pence in 2002. Merger and manufacturing restructuring costs were lower in 2003 than in 2002 and as a result, the sterling based growth in basic EPS of 17 per cent was signicantly higher than the CER based growth in adjusted EPS despite the overall negative impact of currencies in 2003. Dividend The Board has declared a fourth interim dividend of 14 pence per share making a total for the year of 41 pence per share. This compares with a total dividend of 40 pence per share for 2002. In 2004, GlaxoSmithKline expects a similar increase in the total dividend as has been declared in 2003. The allocation of the quarterly dividends will be rebalanced in 2004. GlaxoSmithKline intends to increase the rst three interim dividends from nine pence to 10 pence, with the remainder of the total dividend for the year being allocated to the fourth quarter dividend. Legal and other disputes GlaxoSmithKline provides for anticipated settlement costs and associated expenses arising from asserted claims against the Group where a reasonable estimate may be made of the likely outcome of the dispute. The company's Directors, having taken legal advice, have established provisions after taking into account insurance and other agreements and having regard to the relevant facts and circumstances of each matter and in accordance with accounting requirements. No provisions have been made for unasserted claims or for claims for which no reasonable estimate of the likely outcome can yet be made. The ultimate liability for pending and unasserted claims may vary from the amounts provided, if any, and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations. Intangible assets Where intangible assets are acquired by GlaxoSmithKline from third parties the costs of acquisition are capitalised. Licences to compounds in development are amortised over their estimated useful lives, but not exceeding 15 years. Estimated useful lives are reviewed annually and impairment reviews are undertaken if events occur which call into question the carrying values of the assets. Brands acquired with businesses are capitalised independently where they are separable and have a long-term value to the Group. Brands are amortised over their estimated useful lives, not exceeding 20 years, except where the end of the useful economic life cannot be foreseen. Where brands are not amortised, they are subject to annual impairment reviews. Impairment reviews are based on risk-adjusted future cash flows discounted using appropriate risk-free interest rates. These future cash flows are based on business forecasts and are therefore inherently judgemental. Future events could cause the values of these intangible assets to be impaired and this would have an adverse effect on the future results of the Group. potential impairment. Pensions and post-retirement benets The costs of providing pensions and other post-retirement benets are charged to the prot and loss account in accordance with SSAP 24 over the period during which benet is derived from the employee's services. The costs are assessed in accordance with advice received from independent actuaries on the basis of assumptions selected by management. These assumptions include future earnings and pension increases, discount rates and expected long term rates of return on assets and are disclosed in Note 33 to the Financial statements, 'Employee costs'. The expected long term rates of return on assets are determined based on long term government bond rates adjusted for risk and current market expectations. This Note also gives the additional disclosures required by FRS 17 'Retirement Benets'. The selection of different assumptions could affect the future results of the Group. Product rights and goodwill In addition to the critical accounting policies outlined above, the accounting policy for product rights and goodwill is deemed to be important in respect of the balance sheet prepared in accordance with US accounting principles. Under US GAAP the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham in 2000 was accounted for as an acquisition which gave rise to product rights of \u00a324 billion and goodwill of \u00a316 billion being recognised. Goodwill and those product rights determined to have indenite lives are not amortised but rather reviewed annually for impairment. These impairment reviews assess business projections prepared as part of the Group's annual budgeting and planning process to determine whether or not an impairment in the value of the goodwill has occurred. The business projections include assumptions about future events. Changes in future events could cause the assumptions in the business projections to change with a consequent adverse effect on the future results of the Group as reported under US GAAP . activities of its US operations. 70 GlaxoSmithKline Operating and nancial review and prospects Operating and nancial r eview and prospects GlaxoSmithKline 71 Financial position and resources Financial position Debtors Commitments and contingent liabilities It is the Group's policy to provide for the settlement costs of 2003 2002 Debtors increased in 2003 reflecting the timing of year-end Financial commitments are summarised in Note 26 to the Financial asserted claims and environmental disputes when a reasonable \u00a3m \u00a3m receipts, a higher deferred tax asset, insurance receivables and statements, 'Commitments'.

Contractual obligations and commitments The following table sets out the Group's contractual obligations and commitments as they fall due for payment. GlaxoSmithKline uses the best advice in determining its transfer pricing methodology and, on the basis of external professional advice, continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from open taxation assessments. The ultimate liability for such matters may vary signicantly from amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings and negotiations with the relevant tax authorities.

Under the transitional provisions of FRS 17 the disclosed pension assets and liabilities of the Group at 31st December 2003 show a net decit after allowing for deferred taxation of \u00a31,300 million (2002 - \u00a31,262 million). In the fourth quarter of 2003 special cash contributions of \u00a3314 million were made to reduce the funding decit. The company will review this position annually and will make further contributions as appropriate. The terms of these arrangements can include up-front fees, equity investments, loans and commitments to fund specied levels of research. In addition the Group will often agree to make further payments if future 'milestones' are achieved. As some of these agreements relate to compounds in the early stages of development, milestone payments will continue for a number of years if the compounds move successfully through the development process. Generally the closer the product is to marketing approval the greater the possibility of success. The payments shown above represent the maximum that would be paid if all milestones are achieved.

Own shares At 31st December 2003 the ESOTs held 177.8 million GlaxoSmithKline shares, at a carrying value of \u00a32,775 million and market value of \u00a32,276 million, against the future exercise of share options and share awards. This valuation shortfall is not considered to represent a permanent diminution in value in the context of the length of the future period over which the related share options may be exercised. Accordingly no provision has been made. 2003 2002 \u00a3m \u00a3m At beginning of year 6,581 year 4,484 3,915 Dividends (2,374) (2,346) Shares issued on exercise of share options 41 56 Shares purchased and cancelled (980) (2,220) Exchange movements 30 (154) UK tax: exchange movements and unrealised gains (69) (67) Unrealised gain on equity investments 7 7 At end of year 7,720 6,581 Equity shareholders' funds increased from \u00a36,581 million at 31st December 2002 to \u00a37,720 million at 31st December 2003. The increase arises from retained earnings and positive exchange movements on overseas net assets partly offset by own shares purchased and cancelled. Contingent liabilities The following table sets out contingent liabilities, comprising discounted bills, performance guarantees and other items arising in the normal course of business and when they are expected to expire.

A provision is made where a reasonable estimate can be made of the likely outcome of the dispute and this is included in Note 23 to the Financial statements, 'Provisions for liabilities and charges'. Net increase in long-term loans (1,023) (1,005) Net repayment of short-term loans 442 542 Exchange and other movements (41) (124) Net debt at end of year (1,648) (2,335) The net cash inflow from operating activities was \u00a37,005 million, a decrease of \u00a3250 million over 2002, arising from the timing of trade and other receipts over the year-end period and higher payments for legal and other provisionable items, partly offset by reduced restructuring and integration payments. Capital expenditure on tangible and intangible xed assets amounted to \u00a31,062 million (2002 - \u00a31,226 million). Disposals realised \u00a346 million (2002 - \u00a359 million). Equity investments costing \u00a363 million (2002 - \u00a375 million) were purchased in the year and sales of equity investments realised \u00a3125 million (2002 - \u00a365 million). 72 GlaxoSmithKline Operating and nancial review and prospects Operating and nancial r eview and prospects GlaxoSmithKline 73 No shares of GlaxoSmithKline plc were purchased by the ESOTs in 2003 to satisfy future exercises of options and awards under employee share incentive schemes (2002 - nil). A total of \u00a367 million (2002 - \u00a3114 million) was received on employees' exercise of share options. Of this, option exercises satised from shares previously purchased by the ESOTs yielded \u00a326 million (2002 - \u00a358 million) and option exercises satised from the issue of new shares yielded \u00a341 million (2002 - \u00a356 million). The Group purchased its own shares in the market for cancellation amounting to \u00a3980 million (2002 - \u00a32,220 million). In the period 1st January 2004 to 27th February 2004 a further 5 million shares had been purchased and cancelled at a cost of \u00a355 million. Future cash flow The Group expects that future operating cash flow will be sufcient to fund its operating and debt service costs, to satisfy normal levels of capital expenditure, to meet obligations under existing licensing agreements and to meet other routine commitments including tax and dividends, subject to the risk factors discussed on pages 74 and 76. The Group may from time to time have additional demands for nance, such as for acquisitions. The Group has access to other sources of liquidity from banks and other nancial institutions, in addition to the cash flow from operations, for such needs. Payment policies Group companies are responsible for monitoring and managing their working capital. The terms of sales collections and supplier payments will reflect local commercial practice. In the UK, the company and each of its UK subsidiaries have policies to ensure that suppliers are paid on time. In particular, the UK companies seek: to settle terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of the transaction to ensure that suppliers are made aware of the agreed terms of payment to abide by the terms of payment. The policy includes arrangements for accelerated payment of small suppliers. Payment performance At 31st December 2003, the average number of days' purchases represented by trade and xed asset creditors of the company was nil days (2002 - nil days) and in respect of the company and its UK subsidiaries in aggregate was 21 days (2002 - 18 days). Treasury policies GlaxoSmithKline plc is a UK based business, reporting in sterling and paying dividends out of sterling pr ots. The role of Corporate Treasury in GlaxoSmithKline is to manage and monitor the Group's external and internal funding r equirements and nancial risks in support of Group corporate objectives. Treasury activities are governed by policies and procedures approved by the Board and monitored by a Treasury Management group. GlaxoSmithKline maintains treasury control systems and procedures to monitor foreign exchange, interest rate, liquidity, credit and other nancial risks. Liquidity The Group operates globally, primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which the Group trades. Due to the nature of the Group's business, with patent protection on many of the products in the Group's portfolio, the Group's products compete largely on product efcacy rather than on price. Selling margins are sufcient to cover normal operating costs and the Group's operating subsidiaries are substantially cash generative. Operating cash flow is used to fund investment in the research and development of new products as well as routine outflows of capital expenditure, tax, dividends and repayment of maturing debt. The Group will, from time to time, have additional demands for nance, such as for share purchases and acquisitions. GlaxoSmithKline operates at relatively low levels of net debt. In addition to the strong positive cash flow from normal trading activities, additional liquidity is readily available via its commercial paper programme. The Group also has an uncommitted Euro Medium Term Note programme of \u00a35 billion, of which \u00a32,833 million was in issue at 31st December 2003. Treasury operations The objective of treasury activity is to manage the post-tax net cost/income of nancial operations to the benet of Group earnings. Corporate Treasury does not operate as a prot centre. GlaxoSmithKline uses a variety of nancial instruments, including derivatives, to nance its operations and to manage market risks from those operations. Financial instruments comprise cash and liquid resources, borrowings and spot foreign exchange contracts. A number of derivative nancial instruments are used to manage the market risks from Treasury operations. Derivative instruments, principally comprising forward foreign currency contracts, interest rate and currency swaps, are used to swap borrowings and liquid assets into the currencies required for Group purposes and to manage exposure to funding risks from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. GlaxoSmithKline balances the use of borrowings and liquid assets having regard to: the cash flow from operating activities and the currencies in which it is earned; the tax cost of intra-Group distributions; the currencies in which business assets are denominated; and the post-tax cost of borrowings compared to the post-tax return on liquid assets. Liquid assets surplus to the immediate operating requirements of Group companies are invested and managed centrally by Corporate Treasury. Requirements of Group companies for operating nance are met whenever possible from central resources. External borrowings, mainly managed centrally by Corporate Treasury, comprise a portfolio of long and medium-term instruments and short-term nance. GlaxoSmithKline does not hold or issue derivative nancial instruments for trading purposes and the Group's Treasury policies specically prohibit such activity. All transactions in nancial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities, not for speculation. Funding, maturity and counterparty risk The Group invests centrally managed liquid assets in Government bonds, short-term corporate debt instruments with a minimum short-term credit rating of A-1/P-1, money market funds with a credit rating of AAA/Aaa and preference share investments fully collateralised with highly rated bonds. Credit ratings shown are from Standard and Poor's and Moody's Investors' Services respectively. The Group manages its net borrowing requirements through a portfolio of long and medium-term borrowings, including bonds, together with short-term nance under the US dollar commercial paper programme. In 2003, a \u20ac1 billion, 3.375 per cent coupon bond and a \u20ac500 million, 3.25 per cent coupon bond were issued under the European Medium Term Note programme. The Group's medium-term borrowings mature at dates between 2004 and 2009, the private nancing matures in 2032, and the long-dated sterling bond matures in 2033. The private nancing may be redeemed by GlaxoSmithKline at any time and, in particular, on the occurrence of any event that would increase the cost of funding for the Group. During 2003 the Group also had $500 million of Flexible Auction Market Preferred Stock (Flex AMPS) and $400 million of Auction Rate Preference Stock (ARPS) originally issued in 1996. Notice to redeem the Flex AMPS and the ARPS was given in February 2004, with redemption expected to be completed in March and April 2004. GlaxoSmithKline's long-term debt rating is AA from Standard and Poor's and Aa2 from Moody's Investors' Services. The agencies' short-term rating for paper issued under the Group's commercial paper programme is A-1+ and P-1 respectively. Foreign exchange risk management In GlaxoSmithKline, foreign currency transaction exposure arising on normal trade flows both in respect of external and intra-Group trade is not hedged. GlaxoSmithKline's policy is to minimise the exposure of overseas operating subsidiaries to transaction risk by matching local currency income with local currency costs. For this purpose, intra-Group trading transactions are matched centrally and intra-Group payment terms are managed to reduce risk. Exceptional foreign currency cash flows are hedged selectively under the management of Corporate Treasury. A signicant proportion of Group borrowings, including the commercial paper programme, is in US dollars, to benet from the liquidity of US dollar denominated capital markets. Certain of these and other borrowings are swapped into other currencies as required for Group purposes. The Group seeks to denominate borrowings in the currencies of its principal overseas assets. Borrowings denominated in, or swapped into, foreign currencies that match investments in overseas Group assets are treated as a hedge against the relevant net assets. Based on the composition of net debt at 31st December 2003 a 10 per cent appreciation in sterling against major currencies would result in a reduction in the Group's net debt of approximately \u00a3128 million. A 10 per cent weakening in sterling against major currencies would result in an increase in the Group's net debt of approximately \u00a3156 million. Interest rate risk management GlaxoSmithKline's policy on interest rate risk management requires that the amount of net borrowings at xed rates increases with the ratio of forecast net interest payable to trading prot. The Group uses a limited number of interest rate swaps to redenominate external borrowings into the interest rate coupon required for Group purposes. The duration of these swaps matches the duration of the principal instruments. Interest rate derivative instruments are accounted for as hedges of the relevant assets or liabilities, where possible. The Group manages centrally the short-term cash surpluses or borrowing requirements of subsidiary companies and uses forward contracts to hedge future repayments back into the originating currency. Sensitivity analysis considers the sensitivity of the Group's net debt to hypothetical changes in market rates and assumes that all other variables remain constant. Based on the composition of net debt at 31st December 2003 a one percentage point (100 basis points) increase or decrease in average interest rates would result in a negligible change in the Group's annual interest expense. Equity risk management Equity investments classied as current assets are available for sale and the Group manages disposals to meet overall business requirements as they arise. The Group regularly monitors the value of its equity investments and only enters into hedges selectively with the approval of the Board. Financial assets and liabilities An analysis of net debt is given in Note 25 to the Financial statements, 'Net debt'. An analysis of nancial assets and liabilities at carrying value and fair value and a reconciliation to net debt are given in Note 32 to the Financial statements, 'Financial instruments and related disclosures', together with a discussion of derivative nancial instruments and quantitative disclosures about market risk in accordance with the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 13. The Group continues to benet from strong positive cash flow. Group net debt would have decreased signicantly in the year to 31st December 2003, but for the Group's purchase of its own shares in the market of \u00a3980 million. The nancial assets and liabilities at 31st December 2003 are representative of the treasury policies and strategies of GlaxoSmithKline, applied consistently during the year. There were no signicant changes in such policies throughout the year. ESOT share purchases and shares purchased for cancellation Shares are held by the Trusts to satisfy future exercises of options and awards under the Group share option and award schemes. A proportion of the shares held by the Trusts are in respect of awards where the rules of the scheme require the company to satisfy exercises through market purchases rather than the issue of new shares. The shares held by the Trusts are matched to options and awards granted and diminish the dilutive effect of new share issues on shareholders' capital and earnings. At the 2003 Annual General Meeting, shareholders renewed approval for GlaxoSmithKline to make market purchases of its own shares. On 23rd October 2002, GlaxoSmithKline announced a second share repurchase programme of \u00a34 billion. The exact amount and timing of future purchases, and, following changes in UK company law, whether repurchased shares will be held as Treasury shares rather than being cancelled, will depend on market conditions and other factors. 74 GlaxoSmithKline Operating and nancial review and prospects Operating and nancial r eview and prospects GlaxoSmithKline 75 Outlook and risk factors Outlook Pharmaceutical sales growth of existing products is a key driver of GlaxoSmithKline's current business performance. 2004 will be a year of transition for GlaxoSmithKline. The rst nine months will be challenging as the Group absorbs the full erosion from generics. However, starting in the fourth quarter it is expected that there will be a return to growth as the impact of generics diminishes and the underlying business strength shows through. GlaxoSmithKline is engaged in legal proceedings regarding validity and infringement of the Group's patents relating to many of its products; in particular those relating to Paxil/Seroxat and Wellbutrin. These are discussed in the risk factors below and in Note 30 to the Financial statements, 'Legal proceedings'. GlaxoSmithKline's published earnings guidance for 2004 is to deliver EPS (at constant exchange rates) at least in line with business performance EPS in 2003. As the impact of generics becomes less signicant, the Group looks forward to a return to EPS growth in 2005. The Group has net debt of \u00a31.6 billion, which is low relative to its market capitalisation and this positions it to take advantage of any opportunities that might arise to build the business. There are risks and uncertainties inherent in the business which may affect future performance including expected earnings growth. These are discussed in 'Risk factors' below. Risk factors There are risks and uncertainties relevant to the Group's business. The factors listed below are among those that the Group thinks could cause the Group's actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Risk that R&D will not deliver commercially successful new products Continued development of commercially viable new products is critical to the Group's ability to replace sales of older products that decline upon expiration of exclusive rights, and to increase overall sales. Developing new products is a costly, lengthy and uncertain process. A new product candidate can fail at any stage of the process, and one or more late-stage product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval New product candidates may appear promising in development but, after signicant investments, fail to reach the market or have only limited commercial success as a result of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, difculty or excessive costs to manufacture, infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others or inability to differentiate the product adequately from those with which it competes. The successful development of the Group's research and development pipeline is of particular importance in light of the recent and anticipated expiration of patent or data exclusivity for a number of the Group's largest selling products. Risk of loss or expiration of patents or marketing exclusivity Patent infringement litigation Efforts by generic manufacturers may involve challenges to the validity of a patent or the assertions that their products do not infringe the Group's patents. If the Group is not successful, during the patent protection period, in maintaining exclusive rights to market one or more of its major products, particularly in the USA where the Group has its highest margins and most sales for any country, the Group's revenues and margins would be adversely affected. See Note 30 to the Financial statements, 'Legal proceedings' for a discussion of patent-related proceedings in which the Group is involved. Generic drug manufacturers are seeking to market generic versions of many of the Group's most important products, including Wellbutrin, Seretide/Advair, Avandia, Imitrex, Valtrex, and Zofran, prior to the expiration of the Group's patents, and have exhibited a readiness to do so for other products in the future. Generic products competitive with Augmentin and Paxil were launched in the USA in 2002 and 2003, respectively, and had a signicant adverse impact on the Group's overall sales and earnings. Following patent expiry, the ability of generic manufacturers to obtain regulatory approval for generic versions of the Group's products is also relevant. For example, one manufacturer has indicated that it expects approval for a generic version of Flonase following patent expiry in the USA in mid-2004. If approved a generic launch could adversely affect the Group's sales and earnings. Weakness of intellectual property protection in certain countries In some of the countries in which the Group operates, patent protection may be signicantly weaker than in the USA or the European Union. In addition, in an effort to control public health crises, some developing countries, such as South Africa and Brazil, have considered plans for substantial reductions in the scope of patent protection for pharmaceutical products. In particular, these countries could facilitate competition within their markets from generic manufacturers who would otherwise be unable to introduce competing products for a number of years. Any loss of patent protection, including abrogation of patent rights or compulsory licensing, is likely to affect adversely the Group's operating results in those national markets but is not expected to be material to the Group overall. Absence of adequate patent protection could limit the opportunity to look to such markets for future sales growth. Risk of substantial adverse outcome of litigation and government investigations See Note 30 to the Financial statements, 'Legal proceedings' for a discussion of proceedings and governmental investigations in which the Group is currently involved. Unfavourable resolution of these and similar future proceedings or investigations may be material to the Group's nancial results. The Group has made material provisions in 2002 and 2003 related to legal proceedings and investigations which reduced its earnings. The Group may also make material provisions related to legal proceedings or investigations in the future, which would reduce its earnings. In many cases the practice of the plaintiff bar is to claim damages - compensatory, punitive and statutory - in amounts that bear no relationship to the underlying harm. Accordingly it is potentially misleading to quantify the potential exposure to claims, proceedings and investigations of the type described in Note 30. Recent insurance loss experience, including pharmaceutical product liability exposures, has increased the cost of insurance coverage for pharmaceutical companies generally, including the Group. In order to contain insurance costs in 2003 and 2004 the Group has adjusted its coverage prole, accepting a greater degree of un-insured exposure. Product liability litigation The Group is currently a defendant in a number of product liability lawsuits, including class actions, that involve substantial claims for damages related to the Group's pharmaceutical products. Litigation, particularly in the USA, is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts that are not justied by the evidence can occur. Class actions that sweep together all persons who were prescribed the Group's products can inflate the potential liability by the force of numbers. Claims for pain and suffering and punitive damages are frequently asserted in product liability actions and, if allowed, can represent potentially open-ended exposure. Anti-trust litigation In the USA it has become increasingly common that following an adverse outcome in prosecution of patent infringement actions, the defendants and direct and indirect purchasers and other payers initiate anti-trust actions as well. Claims by direct and indirect purchasers and other payers are typically led as class actions and the relief sought may include treble damage and restitution claims. Governmental investigations The Group is responding to federal and state governmental investigations in the USA into pricing, marketing and reimbursement of a number of prescription drug products. These investigations could result in related restitution or civil false claims act litigation on behalf of the federal or state governments and related proceedings initiated against GlaxoSmithKline by or on behalf of consumers and private payers. Risks of competition, price controls and limitations on sales Third party competition The Group operates in highly competitive businesses. In the pharmaceuticals business, it faces competition both from proprietary products of large international manufacturers and producers of generic pharmaceuticals. Signicant product innovations, technical advances or the intensification of price competition by competitors could adversely affect the Group's operating results. Continued consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry could adversely affect the Group's competitive position, while continued consolidation among the Group's customers may increase pricing pressures. The Group had eight products with over \u00a3600 million ($1 billion) in annual global sales in 2003. Among these products are Paxil/Seroxat and Augmentin, with respect to which the Group now faces generic competition, and W ellbutrin SR, Zofran, Imitrex and Avandia, with respect to which the Group is currently defending its intellectual property rights in the USA. If these or any of the Group's other major products were to become subject to a problem such as loss of patent protection, unexpected side effects, regulatory proceedings, publicity affecting doctor or patient condence or pressure from competitive products, or if a new, more effective treatment should be introduced, the impact on the Group's revenues and operating results could be signicant. In particular, the Group faces intense competition from manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products in all of its major markets. Generic products often enter the market upon expiration of patents or data exclusivity periods for the Group's products. Introduction of generic products typically leads to a dramatic loss of sales and reduces the Group's revenues and margins for its proprietary products. The expiration dates for patents for the Group's major products are set out on page 24. Governmental and payer controls Pharmaceutical products are subject to price controls or pressures and other restrictions in many markets, including Japan, Germany, France and Italy. Some governments intervene directly in setting prices. In addition, in some markets major purchasers of pharmaceutical products (whether governmental agencies or private health care providers) have the economic power to exert substantial pressure on prices or the terms of access to formularies. The Group cannot predict whether existing controls will increase or new controls will be introduced that will reduce the Group's margins or affect adversely its ability to introduce new products protably. For example, in the USA, where the Group has its highest margins and most sales for any country, pricing pressures could signicantly increase upon implementation of the pharmaceutical benet under Medicare, or in the event that state programmes to control the cost of pharmaceuticals, are adopted. Once the Medicare programme initiates outpatient pharmaceutical coverage for its beneciaries, the US government, or the private insurers which will offer coverage, through their enormous purchasing power under the programme, could demand discounts that may implicitly create price controls on prescription drugs. Additionally, a number of states have proposed or implemented various schemes to control prices for their own senior citizens' drug programmes, including importation from other countries and bulk purchasing of drugs. The growth in the number of patients covered through large managed care institutions in the USA, which would be likely to increase with implementation of the Medicare amendments, also increases pricing pressures on the Group's products. These trends may adversely affect the Group's revenues and margins from sales in the USA. Until the terms of implementation of the Medicare pharmaceutical benet have been nalised, it is not possible to quantify the impact of that benet on the Group's nancial results. 76 GlaxoSmithKline Operating and nancial review and prospects Operating and nancial r eview and prospects GlaxoSmithKline 77 2002 Year Regulatory controls Global political and economic conditions In accordance with US SEC disclosure requirements, the following Sales of W ellbutrin, for depression, grew 42 per cent to The Group must comply with a broad range of regulatory controls The Group conducts a substantial portion of its operations outside discussion compares results for the year to 31st December 2002 \u00a3882 million, reflecting increased physician awareness of the on the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of many the UK.

Concentration of sales to wholesalers In the USA, in line with other pharmaceutical companies, the Group sells its products through a small number of wholesalers in addition to hospitals, pharmacies, physicians and other groups. The Group is exposed to a concentration of credit risk to these Group's reported nancial results. The Group believes that it complies with the appropriate regulatory requirements concerning its nancial statements and disclosures. However, other companies have experienced investigations into potential non-compliance with accounting and disclosure requirements that have resulted in signicant penalties. up the impact of possible war in Iraq, tensions with North Korea and fears for the US economy. Pharmaceutical sales Total pharmaceutical sales in 2002 were \u00a317,995 million compared to \u00a317,205 million in 2001, an increase of eight per cent. Less than one per cent of this overall growth came from price increases. Growth in sterling terms of ve per cent was signicantly impacted by the weakness of the US dollar and other currencies. Sales of Seretide/Advair, GlaxoSmithKline's second largest product, grew 96 per cent to \u00a31.6 billion although this contributed to declines in Serevent and Flixotide, its constituent products. Advair became the US asthma market leader in new prescriptions after less than two years on the market. Seretide also continued to perform strongly in Europe, up 36 per cent, and International markets up 92 per cent.

Pharmaceutical sales by therapeutic area Anti-bacterials Reliance on information technology The Group is increasingly dependent on information technology systems, including internet based systems, for internal communication as well as communication with customers and suppliers. Any signicant disruption of these systems, whether due to computer viruses or other outside incursions, could Across the Group's portfolio of products, six major therapeutic areas experienced good growth for the year, including the fast growing franchises: CNS (\u00a34.5 billion) up 17 per cent, respiratory (\u00a34.0 billion) up 16 per cent, anti-virals (\u00a32.3 billion) up 12 per cent and vaccines (\u00a31.1 billion) up 16 per cent. Anti-bacterial sales declined 12 per cent worldwide and 22 per cent in the USA. Augmentin's US sales were down 20 per cent in the year as a result of generic competition that began in the third quarter.

Cardiovascular and urogenital In 2002, Coreg sales grew 27 per cent to \u00a3306 million, beneting throughout the year from its new indication for the treatment of severe heart failure. Europe Europe region contributed 26 per cent of pharmaceutical sales. Although overall sales growth in the region was only two per cent, good growth was recorded in several markets including Spain and Central and Eastern Europe, but government healthcare reforms, including pricing and reimbursement restrictions, adversely affected sales in Italy. International A four per cent sales growth in the International region reflected a mixture of good growth in the Middle East and Africa, Canada and Asia Pacic and a decline in sales in Latin America, principally because of poor economic conditions in Mexico and Brazil. In addition, Mexico suffered from a re-alignment of wholesaler stock levels.

Regional analysis In Canada growth was driven by Seretide, Paxil, Avandia and anti-virals partly offset by lower sales of anti-bacterials. USA The USA reported 13 per cent sales growth in the year and this Consumer Healthcare sales business currently represents 54 per cent of total pharmaceutical sales. Sales growth in the central nervous system products of 21 per cent was driven by W ellbutrin, reflecting increased prescribing by primary care physicians and psychiatrists, and Paxil following the launch of the CR formulation in April 2002. Lamictal, indicated for epilepsy, recorded sales growth of 44 per cent. Advair maintained its strong growth with sales of \u00a3876 million driving the overall respiratory sales growth of 28 per cent.

To illustrate GlaxoSmithKline's business performance in 2002, the analysis below of trading prot and the subsequent discussion excludes merger items, integration and restructuring costs and the disposal of businesses. Management believes that exclusion of these items provides a better reflection of the way in which the business is managed.

Other operating expenses were \u00a3111 million in the year compared with \u00a337 million income in 2001. The year on year movement reflects higher provisions in 2002 for product liability and other claims, and lower 2002 proceeds from disposals and equity investment sales.

Pharmaceuticals R&D expenditure represented 14.6 per cent of pharmaceutical sales in the year. Trading prot Business performance trading prot was \u00a36,694 million with a growth of 15 per cent, stronger than sales growth of seven per cent, demonstrating an improved trading margin of 2.1 percentage points to 31.6 per cent compared with 2001.

Prot on ordinary activities before taxation - business performance Other operating income/(expense), together with the disposal of part of the interest in an associate in 2001, reduced prot by \u00a3111 million in 2002, but added \u00a3133 million to prot in 2001. Taking account of the contribution from associates and net interest payable, business performance prot before tax was \u00a36,517 million, compared with \u00a36,169 million in 2001, an increase of 11 per cent. reflecting increased merger integration costs, higher clinical trial and in-licensing activity and the reinvestment of merger synergies.

No provision is made for unasserted claims or where an obligation exists under a dispute but it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate. Costs associated with claims made by the Group against third parties are charged to the prot and loss account as they are incurred. Employee share plans Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under share option and share award schemes. In respect of award schemes and certain share option grants, the company provides nance to ESOTs to purchase company shares on the open market to meet the company's obligation to provide shares when employees exercise their option or award; any excess of the purchase price of the shares above the exercise price of the options and awards is charged to the prot and loss account over the periods of service in respect of which the options and awards are granted. In respect of other share option grants, share options when exercised are accounted for as share issues at exercise price. Additional employer costs in respect of options and awards are charged to the prot and loss account over the periods of service. Assets and liabilities of the ESOTs are included in the Group balance sheet. Costs of running the ESOTs are charged to the prot and loss account. Shares held by the ESOTs are accounted for as xed asset investments held at cost less a provision to recognise any shortfall in the proceeds receivable from employees on exercise unless there is deemed to be a permanent impairment in value. Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost less a provision for amortisation. Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost in equal annual instalments over its expected useful life. The useful life is not normally expected to exceed 20 years. Intangible xed assets Intangible assets are stated at cost less a provision for amortisation. Acquired licences, patents, know-how and marketing rights are amortised over their estimated useful lives in equal instalments, but no longer than 15 years. Items capitalised are restricted to those related to specic compounds or products which are being developed for commercial applications. The estimated useful lives for determining the amortisation charge are reviewed annually, and take into account the estimated time it takes to bring the compounds or products to market as marketable products. Any development costs which are incurred by the Group and are associated with an acquired licence, patent, know-how or marketing rights are written off to the prot and loss account when incurred. Brands are valued independently as part of the fair value of businesses acquired from third parties where the brand has a value which is substantial and long-term and where the brands can be sold separately from the rest of the businesses acquired. Brands are amortised over the estimated useful lives but no longer than 20 years, except where the end of the useful economic life of the brand cannot be foreseen. Prior to 1998, acquired minor brands and similar intangibles were eliminated in the Group balance sheet against reserves in the year of acquisition. Tangible xed assets Tangible xed assets are stated at cost less provisions for depreciation or impairment. The costs of acquiring and developing computer software for internal use and internet sites for external use are capitalised as a tangible xed asset where the software or site supports a signicant business system and the expenditure leads to the creation of a durable asset. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of tangible xed assets, excluding freehold land, in equal annual instalments over their expected useful lives. The normal expected useful lives of the major categories of tangible xed assets are reviewed annually and are: Freehold buildings 20 to 50 years Leasehold land and The shorter of lease term and 50 buildings years Plant and machinery 10 to 20 years Fixtures and equipment 3 to 10 years ERP systems software 7 years Other computer software 3 to 5 years ERP systems software generally involves signicant customisation prior to implementation and is expected to have a useful economic life of seven years, rather than the maximum ve years of other computer software. On disposal of a tangible xed asset, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the nancial statements and the net amount, less any proceeds, is taken to the consolidated prot and loss account. Leases Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group substantially all the benets and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as nance leases, as if the asset had been purchased outright. The assets are included in tangible xed assets and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as obligations under nance leases. Assets held under nance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and the useful lives of the assets. The interest element of the lease rental is charged against prot. All other leases are operating leases and the annual rentals are charged against prot on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Impairment of xed assets The carrying values of xed assets are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that the assets might be impaired. Any provision for impairment is charged against prot in the year concerned. First year impairment reviews are conducted for acquired goodwill and intangible assets. Certain intangibles are considered to have an indenite life and are therefore not amortised. Such intangibles are subject to annual impairment tests. Impairment is determined by reference to the higher of net realisable value and value in use, which is measured by reference to discounted future cash flows. The value of shares held by the ESOTs is reviewed quarterly to determine if there is any permanent impairment. 2Accounting policies continued Investments in joint ventures and associates Investments in joint ventures and associated undertakings are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at the Group's share of their net assets at date of acquisition and of their post- acquisition retained prots or losses together with any goodwill arising on the acquisition, net of amortisation. Stocks Stocks are included in the nancial statements at the lower of cost (including manufacturing overheads, where appropriate) and net realisable value. Cost is generally determined on a rst in, rst out basis. Taxation The Group accounts for taxation which is deferred or accelerated by reason of timing differences which have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are considered recoverable against future taxable prots. Deferred tax on the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries is only provided when there is a binding commitment to distribute past earnings in future periods. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not discounted. Current asset investments Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In the case of securities acquired at a signicant premium or discount to maturity value, and intended to be held to redemption, cost is adjusted to amortise the premium or discount over the life to maturity of the security. Floating rate bonds are stated at cost. Interest income is taken to the prot and loss account on a receivable basis. Equity investments are included as current assets when regarded as available for sale. Derivative nancial instruments The Group does not hold or issue derivative nancial instruments for trading purposes. Derivative nancial instruments are used to manage exposure to market risks from treasury operations. The principal derivative instruments are currency swaps, forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. The derivative contracts are treated from inception as an economic hedge of the underlying nancial instrument, with matching accounting treatment and cash flows. The derivative contracts have high correlation with the specic nancial instrument being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedge period. Derivative instruments no longer designated as hedges are restated at market value and any future changes in value are taken directly to the prot and loss account. Currency swaps and forward exchange contracts used to x the value of the related asset or liability in the contract currency and at the contract rate are accrued to the prot and loss account over the life of the contract. Gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges of forecast foreign exchange transactions are deferred and included in the measurement of the related foreign currency transactions in the period they occur. Gains and losses on balance sheet hedges are accrued and are taken directly to reserves, except that forward premium/discounts are recognised as interest over the life of the contracts. Interest differentials under interest swap agreements are recognised in the prot and loss account by adjustment of interest expense over the life of the agreement. Debt instruments Debt instruments are stated at the amount of net proceeds adjusted to amortise the issue cost of debt evenly over the term of the debt. 3New accounting policies and future requirements In December 2003 the Urgent Issues Task Force issued Abstract 38 and amended Abstract 17, both relating to the accounting for and presentation of ESOTs. These requirements are mandatory for 2004 reporting and will require the shares held by the ESOTs to be shown as a deduction in arriving at shareholders' funds. The charge to the prot and loss account for employee share options will be restricted to the intrinsic loss, the difference between the market price and exercise price, at the date of grant. In June 2002, the Council of the European Union adopted a Regulation requiring listed companies in its Member States to prepare their consolidated nancial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) from 2005. The rst GlaxoSmithKline Annual Report prepared under IFRS will be that for the year ending 31st December 2005. The rst nancial results announcement prepared in accordance with IFRS will be that for the rst quarter of 2005. The Group's project to convert its nancial reporting from UK GAAP to IFRS is progressing well. A training programme has been rolled out to all nance staff worldwide and preparations for the collection of historical data, which will provide the comparative information under IFRS in 2005, are well advanced. 4 Exchange rates The Group uses the average of exchange rates prevailing during the period to translate the results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated undertakings into sterling and period end rates to translate the net assets of those undertakings. The currencies which most influence these translations, and the relevant exchange rates, were: 2003 2002 2001 Average rates: \u00a3/US$ 1.64 190.00 98 GlaxoSmithKline Notes to the nancial statements Notes to the nancial statements GlaxoSmithKline 99 5 Merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham 6 Segment information continued The combination of Glaxo Wellcome plc and SmithKline Beecham plc was treated as a merger at 27th December 2000 under UK GAAP . 2003 2002 2001 Under merger accounting, the shares issued by GlaxoSmithKline plc to acquire Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham were account ed Turnover by location of subsidiary undertaking \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m for at par and no share premium arose; the shares acquired by GlaxoSmithKline in Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham were similarly USA 10,569 11,096 10,517 accounted for at the nominal value of the shares issued.

The business sectors consist of Pharmaceuticals (prescription pharmaceuticals and vaccines) and Consumer Healthcare (oral care, International (3,962) (3,090) (3,573) OTC medicines and nutritional healthcare). The geographical sectors reflect the Group's most signicant regional markets and are consistent with the Group's regional market management reporting structure. Business sector data includes an allocation of corporate costs to each sector. There are no sales between business sectors. Inter-segment turnover organised on a global basis. The geographical sector gures are therefore influenced by the location of the International 3,983 3,734 3,967 Group's operating resources, in particular manufacturing and research, and by variations over time in intra-Group trading and f unding arrangements. External turnover 21,441 21,212 20,489 Where the Group co-promotes a product and the third party records the sale, the Group records its share of revenue as co-promotion income within turnover. The nature of co-promotion activities are such that the Group records no costs of sales. Pharmaceutical turnover includes co-promotion income of \u00a335 million (2002 - \u00a3nil, 2001 - \u00a3nil).

The average Group tax rate has been determined by aggregating the local standard tax rates and weighting these in proportion to accounting prots. Prots arising from manufactur ing operations in Singapore, Puerto Rico and Ireland are taxed at reduced rates. The effect of this reduction in the taxation charge increased earnings per share by 4.2p in 2003, 3.6p in 2002 and by 2.7p in 2001. 104 GlaxoSmithKline Notes to the nancial statements Notes to the nancial statements GlaxoSmithKline 105 12 Taxation continued The integrated nature of the Group's worldwide operations, involving signicant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets, gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the prots on which individual Group companies are liable to tax. Disagreements with, and between, revenue authorities as to intra-Group transactions, in particular the price at which goods should be transferred between Group companies in different tax jurisdictions, can produce conflicting claims from revenue authorities as to the prots that fall to be taxed in individual territories. Resolution of such issues is a continuing fact of life for GlaxoSmithKline. The Group has open issues with the revenue authorities in the USA, UK, Japan and Canada, but by far the largest relates to Glaxo heritage products in the USA. GlaxoSmithKline has attempted to settle the US dispute, rst through direct discussion with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and subsequently through discussions between the US and UK authorities under the terms of the double tax convention between the two countries. GlaxoSmithKline understands that the views of the two tax authorities were so different that they were unable to reac h agreement, and discussions were terminated in July 2003. The Group has now received a claim for additional taxes that the IRS asserts legacy company Glaxo Wellcome owes for the years 1989 to 1996. This statutory notice of deciency for $2.7 billion (\u00a31.5 billion) in tax principally relates to the allocation of prots for Glaxo heritage products between the USA and other countries. To the extent that the IRS were successful in its claim, interest would be payable . GlaxoSmithKline estimates the interest on the full claim to date would be approximately $2.5 billion (\u00a31.4 billion), net of federal tax relief. As similar tax issues remain open for 1997 to date, GlaxoSmithKline expects to receive further claims by the IRS for these year s. Since GlaxoSmithKline has exhausted all administrative remedies open to it, the Group plans to contest this claim for additional taxes by ling a petition in the US Tax Court, where a trial is not expected until sometime in 2005 or 2006. GlaxoSmithKline continues to believe that the prots reported by its US subsidiaries for the period 1989 to date, on which it has paid taxes in the USA, are more than sufcient to reflect the activities of its US operations. GlaxoSmithKline uses the best advice in determining its transfer pricing methodology and in seeking to manage transfer pricing issues to a satisfactory conclusion and, on the basis of external professional advice, continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from open assessments. However, there continues to be a wide difference of views between the Group and the IRS. The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings and negotiations with the relevant tax authorities. Except as shown in these Financial statements, no provision has been made for taxation which would arise on the distribution of prots retained by overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings, on the grounds that no remittance of prot retained at 31st December 2003 is required in such a way that incremental tax will arise. At 31st December 2003, the Group had income tax losses of approximately \u00a3225 million (2002 - \u00a369 million) and capital losses estimated to be in excess of \u00a310 billion (2002 - in excess of \u00a39 billion) which are not recognised as deferred tax assets because there is insuf cient evidence that these losses will be used.

Business performance, which is the primary performance measure used by management, is presented after excluding merger items, integration and restructuring costs and the disposal of businesses. Management believes that exclusion of these items provides a better reflection of the way in which the business is managed and gives an indication of the performance of the Group in terms of those elements of revenue and expenditure which local management is able to influence.

At 31st December 2003, the Group owned 21 per cent of Quest (2002 - 23 per cent). The book value includes goodwill which is being amortised over 20 years; the amortisation charge for 2003 was \u00a36 million. The goodwill at 31st December 2003 amounts to \u00a385 million (2002 - \u00a3101 million). Goodwill of \u00a3103 million which relates to the continuing Group interest in Clinical Laboratories assets attributed to Quest, remains eliminated against Group reserves. Equity investments comprise listed investments of \u00a37 million (2002 - \u00a37 million) and unlisted investments of \u00a391 million (2002 - \u00a3118 million). The market value of listed investme nts at 31st December 2003 was \u00a39 million (2002 - \u00a311 million). Investments in own shares consist of shares held by Employee Share Ownershi p Trusts (see Note 34). The market value of own shares at 31st December 2003 was \u00a32,276 million (2002 - \u00a32,161 million). This valu ation shortfall is not considered to represent a permanent diminution in value in the context of the length of the future period over which the related share options may be exercised. Accordingly no provision has been made. 108 GlaxoSmithKline Notes to the nancial statements Notes to the nancial statements GlaxoSmithKline 109 19 Equity investments Total \u00a3m At 1st January 2003 161 Exchange adjustments (9) Additions 37 Impairments 7 Disposals (32) At 31st December 2003 164 Equity investments include listed investments of \u00a3111 million (2002 - \u00a3125 million).

The contribution relating to the US pension scheme is included within the amounts applied to the provision above; the contributions relating to the UK pension scheme have increased the pension prepayment amount shown under debtors in Note 21. The Group has recognised costs in 2003 in respect of plans for manufacturing and other restructuring initiated in 1998, 1999 and in 2001 following the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham and acquisition of Block Drug. These plans are largely completed. Costs recognised as a provision, principally in respect of identied severances at sites where it has been announced that manufacturing activities will cease, are expected to be incurred mainly in 2004. Costs of asset write-downs have been recognised as an impairment of xed assets. The Group has recognised costs in 2003, 2002 and 2001 in respect of plans for the integration of the Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKl ine Beecham businesses. Implementation of the integration following the merger is substantially complete. Costs recognised as a provision in respect of identied severances are expected to be incurred in 2004 and in respect of the programme to encourage staff to convert Glaxo Wellcome or SmithKline Beecham share options into GlaxoSmithKline share options when employees exercise these options up to 2010. This latter provision was discounted by \u00a328 million in 2003 using risk-free rates of return. Provisions for legal and other disputes and other matters include amounts relating to US anti-trust, product liability, contract terminations, self-insurance, environmental clean-up and property rental. The company's Directors, having taken legal advice, have established provisions after taking into account insurance and other agreements and having regard to the relevant facts and circumstances of each matter and in accordance with accounting requirements. These provisions were discounted by \u00a325 million in 2003 using risk-free rates of return. Reclassications include amounts receivable under insurance contracts which are now shown within Other debtors in Note 21. No provisions have been made for unasserted claims. The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations. GlaxoSmithKline is involved in a number of legal and other disputes (including notication of possible claims) where, because of the early stage of the matter, no reliable estimate of the outcome can be made. Accordingly no provision has been recorded for these matters or any unasserted claims. It is in the nature of the Group's business that a number of these matters may be the subject of negotiation and litigation over several years. The largest individual amounts provided are expected to be settled within three years. For a discussion of legal issues, refer to Note 30, 'Legal proceedings'. 24 Contingent liabilities At 31st December 2003 contingent liabilities, comprising guarantees, discounted bills and other items arising in the normal course of business, amounted to \u00a3236 million (2002 - \u00a3138 million).

Liquid investments include redeemable preference shares, which are fully collateralised with highly rated bonds, of \u00a31 billion (2002 - \u00a3nil). Loans and overdrafts due within one year Commercial paper comprises a US$10 billion programme, of which \u00a3836 million was in issue at 31st December 2003 (31st December 2002 - \u00a31,284 million), backed up by committed facilities of 364 days duration of \u00a3784 million (2003 - $1,404 million; 2002 - $1,404 million), renewable annually, and liquid investments of \u00a3708 million (2003 - $1,267 million; 2002 - $1,267 million). The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper borrowings at 31st December 2003 was 1.1 per cent (2002 - 1.3 per cent). Loans due after one year In 2003 two bonds were issued under the European Medium Term Note programme; a \u20ac1 billion, 3.375 per cent coupon bond and a \u20ac500 million, 3.25 per cent coupon bond. Loans due after one year are repayable over various periods as follows: 2003 2002 \u00a3m \u00a3m Between one and two years 562 423 Between two and three years 281 563 Between three and four years 2 311 Between four and ve years 1,199 2 After ve years 1,607 1,793 The Group has entered into a number of research collaborations to develop new compounds with other pharmaceutical companies. The terms of these arrangements can include up-front fees, equity investments, loans and commitments to fund specied levels of research in the future. In addition the Group will often agree to make further payments if future 'milestones' are achieved. As some of these agreements relate to compounds in the early stages of development, milestone payments will continue for a number of years if the compounds move successfully through the development process. Generally the closer the product is to marketing approval the greater the possibility of success. The Group also has other commitments of \u00a3144 million (2002 - \u00a3162 million) relating to revenue payments to be made under licences and other alliances, principally to Exelixis Inc. A number of commitments were made in 2003 under licensing and other agreements, principally with NeuroSearch A/S, Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. and POZEN Inc. 2003 2002 Commitments under operating leases to pay rentals for the next year \u00a3m \u00a3m Operating leases on land and buildings which expire: In one year or less 6 10 Between one and ve years 19 47 After ve years 35 56 60 113 3,651 3,092 The loans repayable after ve years carry interest at effective rates between 3.3 per cent and 5.3 per cent.

This follows the completion of the \u00a34 bil lion buy-back programme announced in 2001. A total of \u00a31,199 million has been spent on the new share buy-back programme, of which \u00a3980 million was spent in 2003. The exact amount and timing of future purchases, and whether some repurchased shares will be held as Treasury shares rather than being cancelled, will be determined by the company and is dependent on market conditions and other factors . In the period 1st January 2004 to 27th February 2004 a further 5 million shares have been purchased and cancelled at a cost of \u00a355 million. For details of substantial shareholdings refer to 'Substantial shareholdings' on page 162. 28 Non-equity minority interests SmithKline Beecham Holdings Corporation (SBH Corp), a subsidiary incorporated in Delaware, USA, has in issue $500 million of Flexible Auction Market Preferred Stock (Flex AMPS), comprising 5,000 shares of $100,000 each, issued in six series. The dividend on these shares was xed on issuance in 1996 for a seven-year period that ended in July 2003 for half of the shares and for a ve year period w hich ended during 2001 for the other half. The dividend for all these shares now varies, predominately with prevailing interest rates, and is set every seven weeks at an auction at which the shares are also traded. SBH Corp also has in issue $400 million of Auction Rate Preference Stock (ARPS), comprising 4,000 shares of $100,000 each, issued in ve series, the dividend on which also varies under conditions similar to the Flex AMPS described above. Together, the ARPS and the Flex AMPS constitute the preference shares, which represent the non-equity minority interests. Notice to redeem all eleven series was given in February 2004, with redemption expected to be completed in March and April 2004. SmithKline Beecham plc has, in certain circumstances, guaranteed payment of dividends declared on the preference shares. SmithKline Beecham plc has also agreed with SBH Corp that in certain circumstances it will provide support to SBH Corp in relation to the principal. However, any guarantee or support is limited so that in no circumstances could the holder of preference shares be in a more fav ourable position than had they been a holder of a preference share in SmithKline Beecham plc. The preference shares represent a long-te rm non-equity minority interest in the Group balance sheet in accordance with FRS 4 'Capital Instruments' and UITF 33 'Obligations in capital instruments'.

The goodwill written back in 2001 relates primarily to the disposals of Affymax and part of the Group's holding in Quest Diagnostics, Inc. Goodwill denominated in local currencies which is subject to revaluation amounted to \u00a3300 million at 31st December 2003. Goodwill on acquisitions after 1st January 1998 has been capitalised, in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 2. Exchange movements taken to reserves in 2003 include losses of \u00a3103 million (2002 - losses \u00a31,251 million, 2001 - losses \u00a3114 million) on foreign currency loans less deposits, gains of \u00a3133 million (2002 - gains \u00a31,097 million, 2001 - losses \u00a39 million) on the retranslation of net assets and \u00a37 million (2002 - \u00a3nil, 2001 - losses \u00a328 million) on goodwill eliminated against reserves.

Exchange adjustments debited to reserves cumulatively amount to \u00a31,415 million (2002 - \u00a31,452 million, 2001 - \u00a31,298 million). Other reserves include the merger reserve created on the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham amounting to \u00a31,561 million at 31st December 2003 (2002 - \u00a31,561 million; 2001 - \u00a31,561 million). Other reserves also include the capital redemption reserve created as a result of the share buy-back programme amounting to \u00a376 million at 31st December 2003 (2002 - \u00a356 million, 2001 - \u00a317 milli on). Total reserves amounted to \u00a35,969 million at 31st December 2003 (2002 - \u00a34,851 million, 2001 - \u00a35,677 million), of which \u00a38,981 million (2002 - \u00a310,879 million; 2001 - \u00a3718 million) relates to the company and \u00a386 million (2002 - \u00a376 million, 2001 - \u00a361 million) relates to joint ventures and associated undertakings. The prot of GlaxoSmithKline plc for the year was \u00a31,436 million (2002 - \u00a310,598 million, 2001 - \u00a34,331 million), which after dividends of \u00a32,374 million (2002 - \u00a32,352 million, 2001 - \u00a32,356 million), gave a retained loss of \u00a3938 million (2002 - prot of \u00a38,246 million, 2001 - prot of \u00a31,975 million). After the cost of shares purchased for cancellation of \u00a3980 million (2002 - \u00a32,220 million, 2001 - \u00a31,274 million) and an unrealised prot on capital reduction by subsidiary of \u00a3nil (2002 - \u00a34,096 million, 2001 - \u00a3nil), t he prot and loss account reserve at 31st December 2003 stood at \u00a38,905 million (2002 - \u00a310,823 million, 2001 - \u00a3701 million), of which \u00a34,096 million is unrealised (2002 - \u00a34,096 million, 2001 - \u00a3nil). 114 GlaxoSmithKline Notes to the nancial statements Notes to the nancial statements GlaxoSmithKline 115 30 Legal proceedings The Group is involved in numerous legal and administrative proceedings, principally product liability, intellectual property, antitrust, and governmental investigations and related private litigation. The most signicant of those matters are described below. Intellectual property USA Paxil In the USA a number of distributors of generic drugs have led applications with the FDA to market generic versions of Paxil/Seroxat (paroxetine hydrochloride) prior to the expiration in 2006 of the Group's patent on paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate. Apotex launched its generic version of Paxil in September 2003. The other distributors are looking to bring to market anhydrate or other versions of paroxetine hydrochloride and in one case paroxetine mesylate. In response the Group led actions against all those distributors for infringement of various of the Group's patents. The cases are complex but the Group believes that the generic anhydrate and other versions infringe because they contain and/or convert to the hemihydrate form and/or infringe other Group patents. In July 1998 GlaxoSmithKline led an action against Apotex in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois for infringement of the Group's patent for paroxetine hydrochloride hemihydrate. Apotex had led an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) with the FDA seeking approval to introduce a generic form of Paxil. Following a trial in February 2003 the judge ruled that GlaxoSmithKline's patent is valid but not infringed by Apotex's product. GlaxoSmithKline appealed the ruling of non- infringement to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC), which hears all appeals from US District Courts on intellectual property matters. The CAFC heard the appeal in January 2004 but as of the date of this report no decision has yet been announced. In June 1999 GlaxoSmithKline led an action against Geneva Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Novartis Pharmaceuticals, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for infringement of the Group's patents for paroxetine hydrochloride following notice of Geneva's ANDA ling. That case has been consolidated with similar infringement actions against other generic companies that subsequently led ANDAs. Additional infringement actions have been brought based on patents issued subsequent to the original ling against Apotex in the Northern District of Illinois. The Group also led an action against Apotex relating to those new patents in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In December 2002 the judge granted in part and denied in part summary judgement motions led by Apotex with the result that issues of validity and infringement of three of the four new patents will move toward trial. The Group has petitioned the District Court to permit an interim appeal to the CAFC. In June 2003 the Group requested the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to remove three patents related to Paxil from the register of pharmaceutical patents maintained by the FDA (the Orange Book). The delisting did not affect the validity of these patents or the related patent litigation. Following FDA approval of its ANDA, Apotex subsequently launched a generic version of Paxil in September 2003. The Group continues to pursue patent infringement claims in litigation in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against Apotex, Geneva, Alphapharm, Andrx, Teva Pharmaceuticals and Zenith, and bulk suppliers BASF and Sumika Fine Chemicals. Apotex Alphapharm, BASF and Sumika have led counterclaims in these actions alleging that the Group has violated anti-trust or unfair competition laws. In February 2003 the CAFC heard Apotex's appeal from a decision by the US District Court for the District of Columbia denying Apotex's request that the FDA be required to delist certain of the Group's patents for Paxil from the Orange Book. In October 2003 the CAFC afrmed the district court decision and dismissed the case. In March 2000 GlaxoSmithKline led an action against Pentech Pharmaceuticals in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois for infringement of the Group's patents for paroxetine hydrochloride. Pentech led an ANDA for a capsule version of Paxil, asserting that its compound and presentation do not infringe the Group's patents or that the patents are invalid. In April 2003 the Group reached a settlement with Pentech and Par Pharmaceuticals to which Pentech had granted rights under Pentech's ANDA for paroxetine hydrochloride capsules. The settlement allowed Par to distribute in Puerto Rico substitutable generic paroxetine hydrochloride immediate release tablets supplied and licensed from the Group for a royalty payable to the Group. Par became entitled to distribute the same product in the US market once Apotex's generic version of Paxil became available there in September 2003. In the settlement Par and Pentech acknowledge that the GlaxoSmithKline patent covering the hemihydrate form of paroxetine hydrochloride is valid and enforceable and would be infringed by Pentech's proposed capsule product. The Bureau of Competition of the US Federal Trade Commission reviewed the settlement. The review was voluntary and was conducted at the request of the Group, Par and Pentech. Pentech's former supplier Asahi Glass Co. led claims alleging that the settlement violated the anti-trust laws. The US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois dismissed these claims in October 2003. Asahi has appealed the decision to the CAFC. Similar claims brought by Apotex and Sumika are pending in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In October 2000 GlaxoSmithKline led an action against Synthon Pharmaceuticals in the US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina for infringement of the Group's patents for paroxetine hydrochloride and paroxetine mesylate. Synthon had led a 505(b)(2) (a 'paper NDA') with the FDA using paroxetine mesylate, a different salt form of paroxetine than that used in the marketed form of Paxil. In December 2003 GlaxoSmithKline and Synthon reached a settlement pursuant to which the Group has granted Synthon a royalty-bearing license to market its paroxetine mesylate product in the USA. Wellbutrin Five distributors of generic pharmaceutical products have led ANDAs for sustained release bupropion hydrochloride tablets (Wellbutrin SR and Zyban), accompanied in each case with a certication of invalidity and/or infringement of the Group's patents. The Group has brought suit for patent infringement against each of the ling parties. The Group led suit against Andrx Pharmaceuticals, the rst to le an ANDA, in the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida. In February 2002 the District Court Judge granted Andrx's summary judgement motion and ruled that its product does not infringe the Group's patents. In September 2003 the CAFC reversed that decision and remanded the case to the district court for trial. 30 Legal proceedings continued Actions have also been led against Watson Pharmaceuticals in the US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eon Labs Manufacturing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, IMPAX Laboratories in the US District Court for the Northern District of California and Excel Pharmaceuticals in both the US District Court for the District of New Jersey and the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The Watson case has been settled on terms involving a supply agreement referred to below. Judges granted summary judgement of non-infringement in the Impax and Excel cases and the Group appealed each of those decisions to the CAFC. In January 2004 the CAFC ruled in favour of IMPAX and afrmed the district court ruling that IMPAX's generic version did not infringe the Group's patents. The FDA had earlier granted tentative approval for the IMPAX generic version. The CAFC has not yet ruled on the Group's appeal of the summary judgement of non-infringement in the Excel case. Eon's motion for summary judgement for non-infringement was denied. The district court trial in the Eon case was concluded in December 2003 but as of the date of this report the decision has not yet been announced. In January 2004 the CAFC granted Eon's motion to stay the preliminary injunction against launch of Eon's 100 mg generic version that had been entered by the trial court at the conclusion of the trial. Under the terms of its supply agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, Watson Pharmaceuticals began shipping a second 100 mg generic version the same day that Eon began shipment of its generic version in January 2004. Zofran In August 2001 the Group commenced an action in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey against Reddy-Cheminor and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories. Dr Reddy had certied invalidity of three patents for ondansetron, the active ingredient in Zofran tablets, including the compound patent that expires in July 2005 and two method of use patents, the later of which expires in December 2006, in both instances taking into account an expected extension for paediatric exclusivity. The Reddy case is scheduled for trial in May 2004. In July 2003 the Group led an action against Dr. Reddy's Laboratories in the same district court for infringement of the Group's patents related to the orally disintegrating tablet presentation of Zofran. In October 2003 the Group led an action against West-ward Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the same district court for infringement of the Group's patents related to an injectable presentation of Zofran. Both the Dr. Reddy disintegrating tablet case and the West-ward case have been consolidated with the earlier Dr. Reddy case scheduled for trial in May 2004. In March 2002 the Group led a similar action against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. in the US District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of the two method of use patents for ondansetron. Teva had certied invalidity or non-infringement of the two method of use patents. Teva did not challenge the compound patent. The trial in the Teva case concluded in January 2004 but as of the date of this report no decision has been announced. In September 2003, November 2003 and January 2004 the Group led actions against Teva in the same court for infringement of the Group's patents related to the injectable and orally disintegrating tablet presentations of Zofran. An earlier ondansetron case, involving orally disintegrating Zofran tablets, was commenced by the Group in January 2003 against Kali Laboratories in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey. That case is still in the discovery phase. In June 2003 the Group commenced an action in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Faulding Pharmaceutical Company alleging infringement of the two method of use patents for ondansetron. Faulding did not challenge the compound patent. That case, as of the date of this report, has been stayed pending decisions in the Teva, Reddy and Kali cases. Lamictal In August 2002 the Group commenced an action in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., alleging infringement of the Group's compound patent for lamotrigine, the active ingredient in Lamictal oral tablets. That patent expires in July 2008. The defendant has led an ANDA with the FDA with a certication of invalidity of the Group's patent. FDA approval of that ANDA is stayed until the earlier of January 2005 or resolution of the patent infringement litigation. No trial date has been set for the case. Levitra In October 2002 Pzer Inc. led an action against Bayer AG and GlaxoSmithKline in the US District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that the manufacture and sale of Levitra (vardenal) would infringe a patent newly issued to Pzer and asking that Bayer and GlaxoSmithKline be permanently enjoined. In September 2003 the US Patent and Trademark Ofce initiated a re-examination of the Pzer patent based on questions of patentability in light of prior art. The Pzer action, including an additional suit led in the same court following the launch of Levitra in the USA, is predicated on the validity of that patent and has been stayed pending the outcome of the re-examination. Imitrex In December 2003 the Group commenced an action in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York against Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, alleging infringement of one of two primary compound patents for sumatriptan, the active ingredient in Imitrex. That patent expires in 2008. The defendant has led an ANDA with the FDA with a certication of invalidity of that compound patent but did not certify invalidity or non-infringement of the second compound patent that expires in December 2006. The case is in its early stages. Valtrex In May 2003 the Group commenced an action in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey against Ranbaxy Laboratories, alleging infringement of the Group's compound patent for valaciclovir, the active ingredient in Va ltrex. That patent expires in 2009. The defendant has led an ANDA with the FDA with a certication of invalidity of the Group's compound patent and non-infringement of two other patents expiring in 2016 that are listed in the Orange Book. FDA approval of that ANDA is stayed until the earlier of October 2005 or resolution of the patent infringement litigation. Discovery is underway in the case. Avandia In August 2003 the Group led an action in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. for infringement of the Group's patent relating to the maleate salt form of rosiglitazone, the active ingredient in A vandia, which expires in 2015. In September 2003 the Group led a comparable action in the same court against Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, alleging infringement of the same patent for the maleate salt form. 116 GlaxoSmithKline Notes to the nancial statements Notes to the nancial statements GlaxoSmithKline 117 30 Legal proceedings continued Both Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Teva led ANDAs with the FDA with certications of invalidity of the Group's maleate salt patent. FDA approval of those ANDAs is stayed until the earlier of November 2006 or resolution of the respective patent infringement actions. Teva subsequently led an additional certication challenging the validity of the Group's basic compound patent for rosiglitazone, and in January 2004 the Group commenced an action against Teva in the same court for infringement of that patent. The basic compound patent currently expires in 2008, although expiry is expected to be extended to 2011 after the US Patent and Trademark Ofce has granted patent term restoration. Augmentin In August 2002 the Group commenced proceedings against Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Biochemie GmbH and Biochemie SpA and their parent Novartis AG before the US International Trade Commission and in Colorado state court, alleging that the manufacture and sale in the USA of Geneva's generic Augmentin product using a production strain stolen earlier from GlaxoSmithKline constitutes misappropriation of the Group's trade secrets and unfair competition. Both proceedings sought to prevent the importation and sale in the USA of generic Augmentin containing clavulanate made using the stolen GlaxoSmithKline production strain; the Colorado action sought damages as well. An additional action was brought against Lek Pharmaceuticals, another Novartis afliate, in October 2002 in North Carolina state court. In July 2003 the Group reached a settlement agreement with Novartis and its afliate companies named in the Group's complaints over both the ITC complaint and related state court actions. Under the terms of the agreement, the Group is to receive single-digit percentage royalties on US sales of generic versions of Augmentin sold by Novartis or its afliate companies from July 2002 through to June 2006. Similar state court actions were initiated against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. and Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc. in August 2002 in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, and are not affected by the Novartis settlement. In November 2003 the CAFC afrmed the decision of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia holding the Group's patents covering Augmentin invalid. Ceftin The Group led an action for infringement of its patents for cefuroxime axetil, the active ingredient in the Group's Ceftin anti- infective product, against Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals in the US District Court for New Jersey. A preliminary injunction was granted in favour of the Group but the CAFC subsequently vacated that injunction and remanded the case to the District Court for a full trial on the merits. Thereafter Ranbaxy launched its generic version in March 2002. The trial was concluded in August 2003 but as of the date of this report no decision has been announced. Since the patent as to which the Group claims infringement expired in May 2003, the Group now seeks monetary damages based on Ranbaxy's sales. The Group has led a similar action against Apotex, a second distributor of generic pharmaceutical products, in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. A preliminary injunction was granted in favour of the Group in June 2002. Apotex subsequently obtained FDA approval for their generic product. At trial the judge ruled that Apotex willfully infringed the Group's patent and awarded attorney fees to GlaxoSmithKline. UK and Europe Seroxat Following the expiration of the data exclusivity period in Europe, a marketing authorisation was issued to Synthon BV/Genthon in October 2000 by regulatory authorities in Denmark for paroxetine mesylate, a different salt form of paroxetine than that used in the marketed form of Seroxat/Paxil. Marketing authorisations have since been granted in a number of other European countries the majority of which are based on the original Danish approval under the Mutual Recognition process. Generic products containing paroxetine mesylate have been launched in Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden, although the product in Austria and Denmark has been withdrawn following the award of patent interim injunctions. The Group has initiated litigation challenging the approval by the Danish Medicines Agency on grounds that an authorisation should not have been granted under the abridged procedure as paroxetine mesylate is not essentially similar to Seroxat and questions from that case were referred to the European Court of Justice in February 2003. Marketing authorisations have also been issued in eleven European countries for products containing paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate, another variant of the Group's product. Generic products containing the anhydrate are now on the market in Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK. GlaxoSmithKline believes that marketing of either a paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate product or a paroxetine mesylate product by third parties in European countries infringes its patents and is litigating its position in actions in many European and other countries outside the USA. In June 2002 the European Patent Ofce Opposition Division rejected an opposition led by Synthon against the Group's European patent covering a crystal form of paroxetine mesylate that is used in Synthon's product. That decision is under appeal. In the UK, following a revocation action initiated by Synthon, the Court of Appeal upheld the validity of the corresponding UK patent. This decision overturned the rst instance decision which had held that the patent was invalid. Synthon's petition for leave to appeal to the House of Lords has been accepted. In February 2003 the Dutch court revoked the corresponding Dutch patent. That decision has been appealed. In response to a challenge by BASF to the Group's UK patent for paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate in the UK High Court in July 2002 the Judge decided that the patent was partly valid and partly invalid. The claims held valid were asserted against Apotex, Neolab and Waymade Healthcare and an interim injunction preventing sale of their version of the product was granted in November 2002. In June 2003 the UK Court of Appeal upheld the rst instance decision which held the process claims of the patent to be valid. The infringement action against Apotex continued under the same patent and the UK High Court ruled in December 2003 in favour of Apotex and held the patent not infringed and also invalid. GlaxoSmithKline has led an appeal from that decision and a hearing has been scheduled for 22nd/23rd March 2004. In the interim Apotex launched their generic version of Seroxat in the UK in January 2004. Seretide In January 2003 Cipla and Neolab led an action in the UK High Court, seeking revocation of one of the Group's UK patents relating to the asthma treatment Seretide/Advair. 30 Legal proceedings continued This patent, set to expire in 2013, including supplementary protection certicate protection, relates to the combination of the active ingredients, salmeterol and fluticasone propionate, on which separate patents exist (which have not been challenged), providing patent protection in the UK until late 2005. Subsequently Generics (U.K.), IVAX and Arrow Generics led revocation actions with respect to the same patent. The trial for those revocation actions was completed in January 2004 and the judge's decision is expected shortly. Several other UK Seretide patents, for example those relating to the Diskus device and the CFC-free MDI device which expire in 2011 and 2012 respectively, have not been challenged. Product liability Paxil The Group has received both purported class action and individual lawsuits led in state and federal courts in the USA alleging that paroxetine (the active ingredient in Paxil) is addictive and causes dependency and withdrawal reactions. Plaintiffs seek remedies including compensatory, punitive and statutory damages and the cost of a fund for medical monitoring. In 2003 a federal judge in the US District Court for the Central District of California denied class action certications for a nationwide class and a California statewide class as to cases led in federal court in that district. Subsequently, on petition from plaintiffs' counsel all federal court cases have been transferred to that District Court for consolidation in Multidistrict Litigation (MDL). Most of the remaining lawsuits are in their early stages although certain state court trials are scheduled to start in May 2004. There has been no determination as to whether any of the lawsuits pending in the MDL or in state courts will be permitted to proceed as class actions. In the last decade there has been litigation against the manufacturers of Prozac and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) products such as Paxil for homicidal or suicidal behaviour exhibited by users of their products. The Group has received a number of such claims and lawsuits with respect to Paxil. None of these are or purport to be class actions. Phenylpropanolamine Following a report from the Yale Haemorrhagic Stroke Project that found a suggestion of an association between rst use of phenylpropanolamine ('PPA') decongestant and haemorrhagic stroke, the Group and most other manufacturers voluntarily withdrew consumer healthcare products in which PPA was an active ingredient. Since the PPA product withdrawal the Group has been named as a defendant in numerous personal injury and class action lawsuits led in state and federal courts alleging personal injury or increased risk of injury from use of products containing PPA and unfair and deceptive business practices. Plaintiffs seek remedies including compensatory and punitive damages and refunds. The federal cases have been consolidated in a multidistrict litigation proceeding in the US District Court for the District of Washington. The judge responsible for those proceedings has denied class certication and struck all class allegations in the federal personal injury and consumer refund class actions. A limited number of cases in which the Group or other manufacturers are defendants are now reaching trial in state courts. Class certication has been denied in California state court and a Pennsylvania state court putative class action has been dismissed, leaving no putative class actions pending against the Group in this litigation. Baycol In August 2001 Bayer AG withdrew Baycol (cerivastatin sodium) worldwide in light of reports of adverse events, including deaths, involving rhabdomyolosis. GlaxoSmithKline had participated in the marketing of Baycol in the USA pursuant to a co-promotion agreement with Bayer which was the license holder and manufacturer of the product. Following the withdrawal, Bayer and GlaxoSmithKline have been named as defendants in thousands of lawsuits led in state and federal courts in the USA on behalf of both individuals and putative classes of former Baycol users. A number of the suits allege that the plaintiffs have suffered personal injuries, including rhabdomyolosis, from the use of Baycol. Others claim that persons who took Baycol, although not injured, may be at risk of future injury or may have suffered economic damages from purchasing and using Baycol. Plaintiffs seek remedies including compensatory, punitive and statutory damages and creation of funds for medical monitoring. GlaxoSmithKline and Bayer Corporation, the principal US subsidiary of Bayer AG, have signed an allocation agreement under which Bayer Corporation has agreed to pay 95 per cent of all settlements and compensatory damages judgements with each party retaining responsibility for its own attorneys' fees and any punitive damages. The federal cases have been consolidated in a multidistrict litigation proceeding in the US District Court for the District of Minnesota. Numerous cases are scheduled for trial in state and federal courts during 2004. To date only one class action, in which GlaxoSmithKline was not named as a defendant, has been certied in Oklahoma. In September 2003 plaintiffs' class action certication motion in the consolidated federal multi-district litigation was denied. Fen-Phen In 1997 the FDA became aware of reports of cardiac valvular problems in individuals for whom fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine alone or in combination of phentermine was prescribed as part of a regimen of weight reduction and requested the voluntary withdrawal of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine from the market. The reports of cardiac valvular problems and the subsequent withdrawal of those products from the market spawned numerous product liability lawsuits led against the manufacturers and distributors of fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine and phentermine. As one of a number of manufacturers of phentermine, the Group is a defendant in thousands of lawsuits in various state and federal district courts in the USA. Most of the lawsuits seek relief including some combination of compensatory and punitive damages, medical monitoring and refunds for purchases of drugs. In 1997 the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order consolidating and transferring all federal actions to the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. That court approved a global settlement proposed by defendant Wyeth, which sold fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine. The settlement, subsequently conrmed by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, does not include any of the phentermine defendants, including the Group. Individual plaintiffs may elect to opt out of the class settlement and pursue their claims individually and tens of thousands of plaintiffs have elected to do so. Wyeth continues to settle individual state court cases before trial and the Group continues to be dismissed from lawsuits as they are settled by Wyeth. 118 GlaxoSmithKline Notes to the nancial statements Notes to the nancial statements GlaxoSmithKline 119 30 Legal proceedings continued Thimerosal GlaxoSmithKline, along with a number of other pharmaceutical companies, has been named as a defendant in numerous individual personal injury lawsuits and purported class actions in state and federal district courts in the USA and courts in Canada alleging that thimerosal, a preservative used in vaccines, causes neurodevelopmental disorders and other injuries. Plaintiffs seek remedies including compensatory, punitive and statutory damages and the cost of a fund for medical monitoring and research. The lawsuits are in their early stages and there has been no determination as to whether any of the purported class actions will be permitted to proceed as class actions. Lotronex Following the voluntary withdrawal of Lotronex in the USA in November 2000 a number of lawsuits have been led against the Group in state and federal district courts, including individual personal injury actions and purported class actions asserting product liability and consumer fraud claims. Plaintiffs seek remedies including compensatory, punitive and statutory damages. A substantial number of claims have been settled. Most of the remaining actions are in their early stages although tentative trial dates for some cases have been set for summer and fall 2004. To date a class has been certied in only one of the class actions. In that matter a West Virginia state court rejected plaintiffs' request to certify a national refund class, but did certify a class of West Virginia consumers who suffered 'only economic injury resulting from the individual purchase' of Lotronex and noted that damages, if proven, would be limited to the cost of the medication. Government investigations Colorado US Attorney subpoena In February 2004 GlaxoSmithKline received a subpoena from the US Attorney's ofce in Colorado regarding the Group's sales and promotional practices relating to a number of its largest selling products for the period from January 1997 to present. The Group is co-operating with the investigation which is in its early stages. Average wholesale price GlaxoSmithKline has responded to subpoenas from the Ofce of the Inspector General of the US Department of Health and Human Services, the US Department of Justice and the states of Texas and California in connection with allegations that pharmaceutical companies, including GlaxoSmithKline, have violated federal fraud and abuse laws such as the Federal False Claims Act (and, with respect to Texas and California, comparable state laws) as a result of the way certain drugs had been priced based on 'average wholesale price' (AWP) and the way the Medicare and Medicaid programmes reimburse for those drugs. Subsequently, the states of Nevada, Montana, New York and Connecticut through their respective attorneys general and several counties in New York state have led civil lawsuits in state and federal court against GlaxoSmithKline and several other drug companies. The actions claim - on behalf of the states as payers and on behalf of in-state patients as consumers - damages and restitution based on defendants' AWP-based pricing for an undened set of pharmaceutical products covered by the states' Medicaid programmes. In addition, private payer class action lawsuits have been led against GlaxoSmithKline in several federal district and state courts. All the federal cases have been consolidated in a multidistrict litigation proceeding in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts. All of the civil suits led in state court by state attorneys general and class action plaintiffs were initially removed to federal court and then conditionally transferred to the federal court in Massachusetts. Three of the attorney general cases (New York, Nevada and Connecticut) and one of the private payer class action cases have since been remanded to their respective state courts, and other remand motions are pending. All the actions are in their early stages. Cidra, Puerto Rico manufacturing site In October 2003 the FDA began an investigation of the Group's manufacturing facility in Cidra, Puerto Rico. The Cidra site is engaged in tableting and packaging for a range of GlaxoSmithKline products - primarily for the US market - including Paxil, Paxil CR, Coreg, Avandia and Avandamet. Subsequently, the FDA has issued two Forms 483 ('observations' of possible deciencies in manufacturing practices) to the Group. The FDA observations relate to certain aspects of production controls, process validation and laboratory investigations primarily in respect of activities that occurred between 2001 and 2003. The Group has responded to the observations contained in the Forms 483, but to date the FDA has not advised the Group as to whether any further action is indicated. The Group continues to work closely with the FDA to address any concerns and implement any changes required by the agency arising from the Forms 483 or the FDA investigation. The Group has received no indication that ongoing supply from the site will be affected. Anti-trust Paxil In November 2000 the US Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') staff advised the Group that they were conducting a non-public investigation to determine whether the Group was violating Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by 'monopolizing or attempting to monopolize' the market for paroxetine hydrochloride by preventing generic competition to Paxil and requested the Group to submit certain information in connection with that investigation. In October 2003 the FTC closed its investigation on the basis of its nding that no further action is warranted. Following public reference to the FTC investigation regarding Paxil, purported class actions have been led in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on behalf of indirect purchasers, including consumers and third party payers, and direct purchasers. The plaintiffs claim that the Group has monopolized a 'market' for Paxil by bringing allegedly sham patent litigation and allegedly abusing the regulatory procedures for the listing of patents in the FDA Orange Book. Treble damages are sought for alleged overcharges flowing from the conduct. The cases are scheduled for trial in December 2004. Motions for certications of classes of direct and indirect purchasers have not yet been decided. In patent infringement litigation with GlaxoSmithKline, several generic drug companies have led anti-trust counterclaims based on the same allegations. In October 2003, anti-trust claims led by Asahi Glass Co. were dismissed in US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Asahi has appealed the decision to the CAFC. GlaxoSmithKline's motions to dismiss portions of counterclaims led by Apotex and Sumika in US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania have not yet been decided. Relafen In August 2001 the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled the Group's patent for nabumetone (Relafen) invalid for anticipatory art and unenforceable on the grounds of inequitable conduct. 30 Legal proceedings continued In August 2002 the CAFC issued a decision afrming the District Court's judgement of invalidity but declining to rule on the judgement of inequitable conduct. Following the District Court decision, antitrust claims alleging competitive injury and overcharges were led by Teva and Eon Pharmaceuticals, generic manufacturers of nabumetone, by purported classes of direct and indirect purchasers and payers and by individual retail chains. The plaintiffs' claims are based on allegations of fraudulent procurement of a patent, wrongful listing of the patent in the FDA Orange Book and prosecution of sham patent infringement litigation. Those cases, which were originally led in the US District Courts for the District of Massachusetts and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, were all transferred to the District of Massachusetts. The Group has settled the cases led by Teva, Eon and a group of major retail pharmacy chains. In January 2004 the Group reached a settlement with the class of direct purchasers pursuant to which the Group has agreed to pay $175 million. That settlement is subject to approval of the US District Court. Litigation continues with a class of indirect purchasers in the same court. That trial is set for June 2004. Augmentin In 2002, the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia found various patents covering Augmentin invalid. That holding was subsequently afrmed by the CAFC. Immediately following the adverse trial court decision, purported antitrust class actions were led on behalf of consumers and third party payers in various federal courts, which have now all been transferred or consolidated in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Plaintiffs allege that the Group knowingly obtained invalid patents and engaged in other anticompetitive conduct to prevent entry of generic products in violation of the monopolization section of the US antitrust laws. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief as well as treble damages for the alleged overcharges. There has been no determination as to whether the putative class actions will be permitted to proceed as class actions. Two new complaints were led shortly after the CAFC decision. First is a complaint led in December 2003 in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia by Lek Pharmaceuticals, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Novartis, seeking lost prots, treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The second is a purported class action led in that same court on behalf of direct purchasers, primarily wholesalers. Wellbutrin Separately, the Group has prosecuted patent infringement suits against four companies that led ANDAs seeking permission to sell generic bupropion (W ellbutrin SR/Zyban) in the USA. In three of those cases, summary judgement was entered against the Group. Following those adverse rulings in the patent litigation, eight purported class actions were initially led on behalf of purchasers and third party payers in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that the Group engaged in anticompetitive conduct, including prosecution of sham patent infringement litigation, to prevent entry of generic products, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as treble damages for the alleged overcharges. Those cases were subsequently consolidated in a single action in that district court. All plaintiffs and the Group have entered into an agreement that plaintiffs will dismiss the consolidated case (without prejudice to reling). The dismissal papers are pending with the court. Commercial matters Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. initiated arbitration proceedings in December 2001 concerning the Group's unilateral withdrawal of grepafloxacin (Raxar/V axar) in October 1999 for safety reasons. Otsuka alleges that the product withdrawal and simultaneous public announcement constituted material breaches of the license and supply agreements. The Group believes the underlying product withdrawal was consistent with the terms of the agreements and that valid defences exist to the claims. A UK arbitration panel concluded its hearing on liability in December 2003 but to date has not yet issued its determination. In the event that the panel nds in favour of Otsuka on liability a separate hearing would be held later in 2004 to determine damages. Environmental matters GlaxoSmithKline has been notied of its potential responsibility relating to past operations and its past waste disposal practices at certain sites, primarily in the USA. Some of these matters are the subject of litigation, including proceedings initiated by the US federal or state governments for waste disposal site remediation costs and tort actions brought by private parties. GlaxoSmithKline has been advised that it may be a responsible party at approximately 27 sites, of which 14 appear on the National Priority List created by the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act ('Superfund'). These proceedings seek to require the operators of hazardous waste facilities, transporters of waste to the sites and generators of hazardous waste disposed of at the sites to clean up the sites or to reimburse the government for cleanup costs. In most instances, GlaxoSmithKline is involved as an alleged generator of hazardous waste although there are a few sites where GlaxoSmithKline is involved as a current or former operator of the facility. Although Superfund provides that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for cleanup costs, these proceedings are frequently resolved on the basis of the nature and quantity of waste disposed of at the site by the generator. GlaxoSmithKline's proportionate liability for cleanup costs has been substantially determined for about 20 of the sites referred to above. GlaxoSmithKline's potential liability varies greatly from site to site. While the cost of investigation, study and remediation at such sites could, over time, be substantial, GlaxoSmithKline routinely accrues amounts related to its share of liability for such matters. Legal charges and provisions Legal expenses incurred, relating to the defence of the Group's intellectual property, and litigation costs and provisions related to product liability claims on existing products, are charged to selling, general and administration costs. Litigation costs and provisions relating to legal claims on withdrawn products and anti-trust matters are charged to other operating income/expense. Provisions are made, after taking appropriate legal advice, when a reasonable estimate can be made of the likely outcome of the dispute. Information on provisions taken in 2003 and payments from provisions is set out in Note 23. The ultimate liability for legal claims may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations.

These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned. Pension benets can be pro vided by state schemes; by dened contribution schemes, whereby retirement benets are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee, or by dened benet schemes, whereby retirement benets are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service. Some dened benet schemes now also include dened contribution sections and are described as 'hybrid' schemes in the table. In the majority of cases the contributions to dened benet schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent , professionally qualied actuaries. Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Group's main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years. The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts or are insured. Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return. Investments are diversied to limit the nancial effect of the failure of any individual investment. 33 Employee costs continued Pension costs for accounting purposes have been assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice, generally using the pr ojected unit method and by spreading surpluses or decits over the average expected remaining service lives of the respective memberships. In certain countries pension benets are provided on an unfunded basis, some administered by trustee companies. Where assets are not held with the specic purpose of matching the liabilities of unfunded schemes, a provision is included within provisions for pensions and other post-retirement benets. Liabilities are generally assessed annually in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries. The market value of the assets of the Group's funded dened benet pension funds at the dates of the latest actuarial valuations, some of which date back to 2000, was \u00a34.5 billion and the actuarial value of assets was sufcient to cover approximately 82 per cent of the benets that had accrued to members after allowing for future salary and pension increases. The UK dened benet pension schemes account for approximately 65 per cent of the Group's plans in asset valuation and projected benet terms and the US dened benet pension schemes account for approximately 25 per cent of the Group's plans in asset valuation and projected benet terms. During 2003, the Group made special funding contributions to the UK and US pension schemes totalling \u00a3368 million. The Group has agreed with the trustees of certain of the pension schemes to make additional contributions dependent on the funding status of those schemes. Pension costs are expected to be approximately the same in 2004 as in 2003. UK In the UK the dened benet pension schemes operated for the benet of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate. These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled t o join a dened contribution scheme. The relevant assumptions used in calculating the pension costs of both the former Glaxo Well come and former SmithKline Beecham UK dened benet schemes for accounting purposes are as follows: 2003 2002 % pa % pa Rate of increase of future earnings 3.75 4.00 Discount rate 7.75 8.00 Expected long-term rate of return on investments 7.75 8.00 Expected pension increases 2.25 2.50 UK equity dividend growth n/a 5.00 The regular cost for the Glaxo Wellcome pension arrangements in 2003 was \u00a360 million, which reduced to an accounting cost of \u00a354 million, after allowance was made for spreading the surplus disclosed as a level percentage of salary over the expected future working lifetime of the existing members (some 11 years). The most recent triennial actuarial valuations for funding purposes were carried out as at 31st December 2002. At that date the assets of the schemes represented 92 per cent of the actuarial value of all benets accrued to members after allowing for future salary and pension increases. The total market value of the assets held by the schemes at 31st December 2002 was \u00a32,093 million. The regular cost for the SmithKline Beecham schemes in 2003 was \u00a315 million, which increased to an accounting cost of \u00a359 million after allowance was made for the spreading of the decit over the expected future working lifetime of current employees in the scheme (some 11 years). The latest valuation was carried out at 31st December 2002 and at that date the scheme assets represented 56 per cent of the actuarial value of the accrued service liabilities based on the 2003 assumptions. The total market value of assets held by the scheme at 31st December 2002 was \u00a3856 million. USA In the USA the former Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham dened benet and hybrid schemes were merged during 2001. The relevant assumptions used in calculating the pension costs for accounting purposes are as follows: 2003 2002 % pa % pa Rate of increase of future earnings 5.50 5.50 Discount rate 8.50 9.50 Expected long-term rate of return on investments 8.50 9.50 Cash balance credit/conversion rate 5.75 6.50 US equity dividend growth n/a 7.75 The regular cost for the main US scheme in 2003 was \u00a358 million, which increased to an accounting cost of \u00a378 million after allowance was made for the spreading of the decit over the expected future working lifetime of current employees in the schemes. The latest valuation was carried out at 1st January 2003 and at that date the actuarial value of scheme assets represented 94 per cent of the actuarial value of the accrued service liabilities. The total market value of assets held by the scheme at 1st January 2003 was \u00a31,362 millio n. Post-retirement healthcare The Group operates a number of post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the USA. The cost of the US scheme has been assessed using the same assumptions as for the US pension scheme, together with the assumption for future medical inflation of 11 per cent reducing by one per cent per year to ve per cent. The total provision for post-retirement benets at 31st December 2003 amounted to \u00a3569 million (2002 - \u00a3577 million). 128 GlaxoSmithKline Notes to the nancial statements Notes to the nancial statements GlaxoSmithKline 129 33 Employee costs continued 33 Employee costs continued FRS 17 disclosures UK USA Rest of World Group Average The Group continues to account for pension arrangements in accordance with SSAP 24 'Accounting for Pension Costs'.

The Group and Quest Diagnostics are parties to a long-term contractual relationship under which Quest Diagnostics is the primary provider of clinical laboratory testing to support the Group's clinical trials testing requirements worldwide. In 2003, both the Group and Shionogi & Co., Ltd. entered into transactions with their 50/50 US joint venture company in support of the research and development activities conducted by that joint venture company. During 2003, GlaxoSmithKline provided services to the join t venture of \u00a31 million (2002 - \u00a37 million). At 31st December 2003 the balance due to GlaxoSmithKline from the joint venture was \u00a33 million (2002 - \u00a38 million). Dr Barzach, a Non-Executive Director of GlaxoSmithKline plc, received fees of \u20ac72,268 (2002 - \u20ac66,369) from a subsidiary of the company for healthcare consultancy provided. These are included within 'Annual remuneration' in the Remuneration Report. Dr Shapiro, a Non-Executive Director of GlaxoSmithKline plc, received fees of $85,000 (2002 - $85,000) of which $30,000 (2002 - $30,000) was in the form of ADSs, from a subsidiary of the company, for the membership of the Scientic Advisory Board. These are included within 'Annual remuneration' in the Remuneration Report. 36 Reconciliation to US accounting principles The analyses and reconciliations presented in this Note represent the nancial information prepared on the basis of US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) rather than UK GAAP . Summary of material differences between UK and US GAAP Acquisition of SmithKline Beecham The combination of Glaxo Wellcome plc and SmithKline Beecham plc was accounted for as a merger (pooling of interests) in accordance with UK GAAP . Under US GAAP , this business combination did not qualify for pooling of interests accounting and Glaxo Wellcome was determined to be the accounting acquirer in a purchase business combination. Accordingly the net assets of SmithKline Beecham were fair valued as at the date of acquisition. As a result of the fair value exercise, increases in the values of SmithKline Beecham's inventory, tangible xed assets, investments and pension obligations were recognised and fair market values attributed to its intangible assets, mainly product rights (inclusive of patents and trade marks), assembled workforce and in-process research and development, together with appropriate deferred taxation effects. The difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of SmithKline Beecham has been recorded as goodwill. Capitalised interest Under UK GAAP , the Group does not capitalise interest. US GAAP requires interest incurred as part of the cost of constructing xed assets to be capitalised and amortised over the life of the asset. Computer software Under UK GAAP , the Group capitalises costs incurred in acquiring and developing computer software for internal use where the software supports a signicant business system and the expenditure leads to the creation of a durable asset. For US GAAP , the Group applies SOP 98-1 'Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use' which restricts the categories of costs which can be capitalised. Goodwill and intangible xed assets Under UK GAAP , goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1998, accounted for under the purchase method, has been eliminated against shareholders' funds. Additionally, UK GAAP requires that on subsequent disposal or closure of a business, any goodwill previously taken directly to shareholders' funds is then charged against income. Beginning in 1998, the Group changed its accounting policy for goodwill and intangible assets under UK GAAP in respect of acquisitions from 1998. Under UK GAAP , goodwill arising on acquisitions from 1998 is capitalised and amortised over a period not exceeding 20 years. Under US GAAP , goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 30 June 2001 was capitalised and amortised over a period not exceeding 40 years. In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 142 'Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets'. SFAS 142 requires that goodwill no longer be amortised over its estimated useful life. The Group must instead identify and value its reporting units for the purpose of assessing, at least annually, potential impairment of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit. Additionally, the Group reassesses the useful lives of existing recognised intangible assets. Intangible assets deemed to have indenite lives are no longer amortised, instead they are tested annually for potential impairment. Separable intangible assets with nite lives continue to be amortised over their useful lives. The Group adopted SFAS 142 as of 1st January 2002. The implementation of SFAS 142 resulted in no impairment of the Group's goodwill and an initial impairment of \u00a3173 million (\u00a3127 million net of tax) on indenite-lived assets. This is shown as a cumulative effect of an accounting change. Under UK GAAP , costs to be incurred in integrating and restructuring the Wellcome, SmithKline Beecham and Block Drug businesses following the acquisitions in 1995, 2000 and 2001 respectively were charged to the prot and loss account post acquisition. Under US GAAP , certain of such costs were considered in the allocation of purchase consideration thereby affecting the goodwill arising on acquisition. Under UK GAAP certain intangible assets related to specic compounds or products which are purchased from a third party and are developed for commercial applications are capitalised. Under US GAAP , payments made for these compounds or products which are still in development and have not yet received regulatory approval are charged directly to prot and loss until such time that they receive regulatory approval. Restructuring costs Under UK GAAP , restructuring costs incurred following acquisitions were charged to the prot and loss account post acquisition. For US GAAP purposes, certain of these costs were recognised as liabilities upon acquisition in the opening balance sheet. Other restructuring costs are recorded as a provision under UK GAAP when a restructuring plan has been announced. Under US GAAP subsequent to 31st December 2002, a provision may only be recognised when further criteria are met or the liability incurred. Accordingly, adjustments have been made to eliminate the UK GAAP provisions for restructuring costs that do not meet US GAAP requirements. Marketable securities Marketable securities consist primarily of equity securities and certain other liquid investments. Under UK GAAP these securities are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Under US GAAP these securities are considered available for sale under SFAS 115 'Accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities' and are carried at fair value, with the unrealised gains and losses, net of tax, recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Equity securities are reviewed at least annually for other than temporary impairment. The factors considered are: the investee's current nancial performance and future prospects the general market condition of the geographic or industry area in which the investee operates the duration and extent to which the market value (if available) has been below cost. Gross unrealised gains and losses on marketable securities were \u00a368 million and \u00a35 million respectively at 31st December 2003. 136 GlaxoSmithKline Notes to the nancial statements Notes to the nancial statements GlaxoSmithKline 137 36 Reconciliation to US accounting principles continued Pensions and other post-retirement benets The key differences between UK (SSAP 24) and US GAAP in relation to dened benet pension plans are: under UK GAAP the effect of variations in cost can be accumulated at successive valuations and amortised on an aggregate basis. Under US GAAP the amortisation of the transition asset and the costs of past service benet improvements are separately tracked: experience gains/losses are dealt with on an aggregate basis but amortised only if outside a 10 per cent corridor UK GAAP allows measurements of plan assets and liabilities to be based on the result of the latest actuarial valuation. US GAAP requires measurement of plan assets and liabilities to be made at the date of the Financial statements or up to three months prior to that date the pension adjustment also includes the impact of changes in minimum pension liabilities included within accumulated other comprehensive income. During 2002, the Group decided to align the measurement date for all of its pension and post-retirement benet plans to 31st December as certain of the Group's plans had a measurement date for assets and liabilities of 30th September. The impact, reflected as a cumulative effect of an accounting change, was a \u00a337 million credit, net of tax, to income. Stock-based compensation Under UK GAAP share options are accounted for as equity when exercised, valued at the issuance price. Under US GAAP , the Group applies SFAS 123 'Accounting for stock-based compensation' and related accounting interpretations in accounting for its option plans which require options to be fair valued at their grant date and included in prot and loss over the vesting period of the options. The Group is entitled to receive a tax deduction for the amount treated as compensation under US tax rules for employee stock options which have been exercised by US employees during the year. Under UK GAAP this is treated as a reduction of tax expense whereas under US GAAP a portion of this amount is credited to equity. Employee Share Ownership Trusts (ESOT) Under UK GAAP shares of the Group's stock held by the ESOTs are recorded at cost, less a provision representing the difference between the cost and the option exercise price, and accounted for as xed asset investments. Projected losses on the exercise of the options covered by the shares are recorded through the prot and loss account over the life of the options. Under US GAAP shares of the Group's stock purchased by the ESOTs are accounted for within shareholders' equity at cost. Gains or losses arising on subsequent issuance of the shares to employees to satisfy share options are recorded as adjustments to shareholders' equity. Guarantor obligations The Group adopted the FASB's Financial Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45) 'Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others' with effect from 1st January 2003. This requires that the Group recognises and measures, at fair value, on a prospective basis, certain guarantees issued or modied after 31st December 2002. Under UK GAAP such guarantor obligations are recognised when further additional criteria are met or the liability is incurred. Derivative instruments SFAS 133, 'Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities' as amended by SFAS 137 and SFAS 138 and as interpreted by the Derivatives Implementation Group, was adopted by the Group with effect from 1st January 2001. SFAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively, referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities. Under UK GAAP , some derivative instruments used for hedging are not recognised on the balance sheet and the matching principle is used to match the gain or loss under these hedging contracts to the foreign currency transaction or prots to which they relate. SFAS 133 requires that an entity recognise all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. Changes in fair value over the period are recorded in current earnings unless hedge accounting is obtained. The Group does not designate any of its derivatives as qualifying hedge instruments under SFAS 133. SFAS 133 prescribes requirements for designation and documentation of hedging relationships and ongoing assessments of effectiveness in order to qualify for hedge accounting. The Group also evaluates contracts for 'embedded' derivatives, and considers whether any embedded derivatives have to be bifurcated, or separated, from the host contracts in accordance with SFAS 133 requirements. If embedded derivatives exist and are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, they are accounted for separately from the host contract as derivatives. Gains and losses related to the fair value adjustments of all derivative instruments are classied in the consolidated statement of income and cash flows in accordance with the nature of the derivative. The fair value and book value of derivative instruments in respect of nancial assets and liabilities as at 31st December 2003 is disclosed in the 'Classication and fair value of nancial assets and liabilities' table in Note 32. Valuation of derivative instruments The fair value of derivative instruments is sensitive to movements in the underlying market rates and variables. The Group monitors the fair value of derivative instruments on at least a quarterly basis, with a formal review every six months. Derivatives including interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps are valued using standard valuation models, counterparty valuations, or third party valuations. Standard valuation models used by the Group consider relevant discount rates, the market yield curve on the valuation date, forward currency exchange rates and counterparty risk. All signicant rates and variables are obtained from market sources. All valuations are based on the remaining term to maturity of the instrument. Foreign exchange contracts are valued using forward rates observed from quoted prices in the relevant markets when possible. The Group assumes parties to long-term contracts are economically viable but reserves the right to exercise early termination rights if economically benecial when such rights exist in the contract. 36 Reconciliation to US accounting principles continued Dividends Under UK GAAP , dividends proposed are provided for in the year in respect of which they are recommended by the Board of Directors for approval by the shareholders. Under US GAAP , such dividends are not provided for until declared by the Board of Directors. Consolidated summary statement of cash flows The US GAAP cash flow statement reports changes in cash and cash equivalents, which includes short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Only three categories of cash flows are reported: operating activities (including tax and interest); investing activities (including capital expenditure, acquisitions and disposals together with cash flows from available for sale current asset investments); and nancing activities (including dividends paid). A summary statement of cash flows is presented on page 139. Cash and cash equivalents Under UK GAAP the cash balance includes only cash at bank and other cash balances. Under US GAAP cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and certain liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Comprehensive income statement The requirement of SFAS 130 'Reporting comprehensive income' to provide a comprehensive income statement is met under UK GAAP by the Statement of total recognised gains and losses (pages 88 and 89). Reclassications Certain prior year balances have been reclassied for comparative purposes. Certain amounts previously presented in aggregate in the reconciliation of prot under US GAAP to UK GAAP have been presented separately in the current year presentation to provide more information related to these adjustments. Sales incentives In accordance with UK GAAP , certain amounts paid by the Group to its customers are recorded as promotional expense included in operating income. Under US GAAP , these items are recorded as a reduction in revenue. While these items do not result in a net impact to the income statement under US GAAP , the amount that would be classied as a reduction in revenue in 2003 would be \u00a3324 million. Recent Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) pronouncements In January 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 106-1 'Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003' (Act). FSP 106-1 addresses the accounting implications of the Act to an entity that sponsors a post\u00adretirement health care plan providing prescription drug benets. The Act introduces in the USA a prescription drug benet under Medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of certain post\u00ad retirement health care plans. FSP 106-1 provides an election to defer accounting for the implications of this new law until specic authoritative guidance is issued to address the accounting treatment. As a result of the current absence of guidance as to the accounting treatment, any measures of the accumulated post-retirement benet obligation or net periodic post-retirement benet cost included in the reconciliation to US accounting principles and accompanying notes do not reflect the effects of the Act. Authoritative guidance, when issued, could require a change in previously reported information. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), 'Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities', and in December 2003 issued FIN 46R, a revision of this interpretation. Under the revised interpretation, certain entities, known as Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), must be consolidated by the 'primary beneciary' of the entity. The primary beneciary is generally dened as having the majority of the risks and rewards arising from the VIE. Additionally, for VIEs in which a signicant, but not majority, variable interest is held, certain disclosures are required. Certain measurement principles of this interpretation relating to newly formed VIEs are applicable to the nancial statements for the scal year ended 31st December 2003. The Group has evaluated all potential VIEs of such newly formed entities and did not identify any items which would require adjustment to the Financial statements. The remaining disclosure requirements in the interpretation are effective for subsequent Financial statements beginning in 2004. GlaxoSmithKline has not yet completed its assessment of the remaining relationships that could have an impact on the disclosures included in the subsequent Financial statements or on the results of operations or nancial position in those periods. 138 GlaxoSmithKline Notes to the nancial statements Notes to the nancial statements GlaxoSmithKline 139 36 Reconciliation to US accounting principles continued 36 Reconciliation to US accounting principles continued The following is a summary of the material adjustments to prot and shareholders' funds which would be required if US GAAP had been Equity shareholders' funds 2003 2002 Notes \u00a3m \u00a3m applied instead of UK GAAP .

Information for shareholders A summary of the main tax consequences for holders of shares and ADRs who are citizens or residents of the UK or the USA is set out below. It is not a complete analysis of all the possible tax consequences of purchase or ownership of these securities. It is intended only as a general guide. Holders are advised to consult their advisers with respect to the tax consequences of the purchase and ownership of their shares or ADRs, and the consequences under state and local tax laws in the USA and the implications of the new UK/US Income Tax convention. This statement is based upon UK and US tax laws and practices at the date of this report. The new UK/US Income Tax Convention came into force on 31st March 2003. The provisions of the new treaty apply for UK tax purposes from 1st April 2003 (UK Corporation Tax), 6th April 2003 (UK Income Tax and Capital Gains Tax) and 1st May 2003 (Withholding Taxes). For US tax purposes, the provisions of the new treaty apply from 1st May 2003 (Withholding Taxes) and 1st January 2004 (all other US taxes). However, holders of shares or ADRs have the ability to elect to continue to use the provisions of the previous treaty for 12 months following the new treaty's entry into force. An election must be made in advance of the first event to which the new treaty would apply. US holders of ADRs generally will be treated as the owners of the underlying shares for the purposes of the current USA/UK double taxation conventions relating to income and gains (Income Tax Convention), estate and gift taxes (Estate and Gift Tax Convention) and for the purposes of the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). The following analysis deals with dividends paid after 6th April 1999 when Advance Corporation Tax (ACT) was abolished. UK shareholders Taxation of dividends From 6th April 1999, the rate of tax credits was reduced to one ninth. As a result of compensating reductions in the rate of tax on dividend income, there is no increase in the tax borne by UK resident individual shareholders. Tax credits are, however, no longer repayable to shareholders with a tax liability of less than the associated tax credit. Taxation of capital gains UK shareholders may be liable for UK tax on gains on the disposal of shares or ADRs. They may also be entitled to indexation relief and taper relief on such sales. Indexation relief is calculated on the market value of shares at 31st March 1982 and on the cost of any subsequent purchases from the date of such purchase. Indexation relief for individual shareholders ceased on 5th April 1998. Taper relief is available to individual shareholders who hold or are deemed to hold shares for at least three years before they are sold. Inheritance tax Individual shareholders may be liable to inheritance tax on the transfer of shares or ADRs. Tax may be charged on the amount by which the value of the shareholder's estate is reduced as a result of any transfer by way of gift or other disposal at less than full market value. Such a gift or other disposal is subject to both UK inheritance tax and US estate or gift tax. The Estate and Gift Tax Convention would generally provide for tax paid in the USA to be credited against tax payable in the UK. Stamp duty UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) will, subject to certain exemptions, be payable on the purchase of shares at a rate of 0.5 per cent of the purchase price. There is a minimum charge of \u00a35 where a stamp duty liability arises. US shareholders The following is a summary of certain UK taxation and USA federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to a US holder of shares or ADRs. This summary only applies to a shareholder that holds shares or ADRs as capital assets, is a citizen or resident of the USA or a domestic corporation or that is otherwise subject to United States federal income taxation on a net income basis in respect of the shares or ADRs, and is not resident in the UK for UK tax purposes and does not hold shares for the purposes of a trade, profession or vocation that is carried on in the UK through a branch or agency. Taxation of dividends The gross amount of dividends received (including amounts in respect of associated tax credit and UK withholding tax) is treated as foreign source dividend income for US tax purposes. It is not eligible for the dividend received deduction allowed to US corporations. Dividends on ADRs are payable in US dollars; dividends on shares are payable in Sterling. Dividends paid in pounds Sterling will be included in income in the US dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate on the day the dividends are received by the holder. UK Taxes withheld from dividend distributions are eligible for credit against the holders' US Federal Income Tax liability, subject to generally applicable limitations. Each holder's own tax position will determine whether effective use can be made of special US foreign tax credits against the US tax liability. On 6th April 1999, the rate of tax credits was reduced to one ninth when ACT was abolished. Claims for refunds of tax credits on dividends paid on or after this date are of negligible benefit to US shareholders. Taxation of capital gains Generally, US holders will not be subject to UK capital gains tax, but will be subject to US tax on capital gains realised on the sale or other disposal of shares or ADRs. Estate and gift taxes Under the Estate and Gift Tax Convention, a US shareholder is not generally subject to UK inheritance tax. Stamp duty UK stamp duty or SDRT will, subject to certain exemptions, be payable on any issue or transfer of shares to the ADR custodian or depository at a rate of 1.5 per cent of their price (if issued), the amount of any consideration provided (if transferred on sale), or their value (if transferred for no consideration). No SDRT would be payable on the transfer of an ADR. No UK stamp duty should be payable on the transfer of an ADR provided that the instrument of transfer is executed and remains at all times outside the UK. Any stamp duty on the transfer of an ADR would be payable at a rate of 0.5 per cent of the consideration for the transfer. Any sale of the underlying shares would result in liability to UK stamp duty or, as the case may be, SDRT at a rate of 0.5 per cent. There is a minimum charge of \u00a35 where a stamp duty liability arises. 164 GlaxoSmithKline Glossary of terms Contact details Terms used in the Annual Report US equivalent or brief description INTERNET Accelerated capital allowances Tax allowance in excess of depreciation arising from the purchase of fixed assets that delay the charging and payment of tax.
