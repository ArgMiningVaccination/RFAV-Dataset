While there's no cure (yet), there are many Crohn's disease medications that can help reduce your symptoms, such as severe diarrhea and abdominal pain, so you can hopefully have more control over how you feel in your day-to-day life. In fact the right Crohn's disease treatment plan can help alleviate your symptoms to the point where you don't worry about your condition interfering with your plans. Even more importantly, working closely with your doctor can keep you healthier overall because untreated Crohn's disease can potentially lead to debilitating complications. \"The earlier you control Crohn's disease, the more likely you are to prevent long-term damage, disability, and hospitalization,\" [Peter D.R. Higgins, M.D., Ph.D.](https://www.uofmhealth.org/profile/4/peter-doyle-higgins-md-phd), professor of gastroenterology and director of the [IBD Program at the University of Michigan](https://www.med.umich.edu/ibd/), tells SELF. Ahead, experts break down the various Crohn's disease medications and treatments that can make a big difference. What is Crohn's disease, exactly? Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes chronic inflammation in the digestive tract, anywhere from your mouth to the opening of your rectum, according to the [U.S. National Library of Medicine](https://medlineplus.gov/crohnsdisease.html) (NLM). ( [Ulcerative colitis](https://www.self.com/story/symptoms-of-ulcerative-colitis) is another common form of IBD.) With IBD, your immune system mistakenly views healthy, harmless cells in your digestive tract as possible threats and attacks them. This reaction sets off long-lasting inflammation, which is responsible for hallmark [Crohn's disease symptoms](https://www.self.com/story/crohns-disease-symptoms-to-know) like painful bowel movement changes, abdominal cramping, fatigue, and even damage to your digestive tract if you don't get treatment, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304). People with severe Crohn's disease may drastically lose weight because their bodies can't absorb a sufficient amount of essential nutrients due to frequent [diarrhea](https://www.self.com/story/when-to-see-doctor-diarrhea). Some people often lose weight because they also feel too sick to eat enough. Experts aren't fully sure why only some people develop Crohn's disease but suspect that genetics may be a factor since the condition can run in families, according to the NLM. So far, researchers have found more than 100 genes associated with IBD, but further studies are needed to understand the connection1. Some people mistakenly believe that certain foods and stress can cause Crohn's disease\u2014but those factors may only make symptoms worse in certain people\u2014not directly cause the condition in the first place. What is a flare-up in Crohn's disease? With Crohn's disease, it's normal to go through periods of active disease and severe symptoms\u2014called flare-ups\u2014and periods of mild or no symptoms, according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9357-crohns-disease#management-and-treatment). You may discover that certain things such as emotional stress can trigger a flare-up, even when you're taking medication. However, it's important to mention that flare-ups are often triggered by not taking your medication as prescribed. The best way to avoid flare-ups is by finding a treatment that works well for you and sticking to it closely. But you'll also want to take note of anything that seems to trigger your symptoms and avoid it as best as you can. What are the best Crohn's disease medications? Working with a gastroenterologist, a gastrointestinal (G.I.) specialist, to find an effective Crohn's disease treatment plan can hopefully help you achieve remission, which is when you have very few to no symptoms2. Crohn's disease medications reduce bodily inflammation to not only make you feel better but also to minimize your chances of dealing with complications in the future, including long-term G.I. damage, according to the Mayo Clinic. There are many Crohn's disease medications to choose from, which means you have lots of options. However, because there are various possible routes in your healing journey, it may take a bit of trial and error to find the treatment (or combination of treatments) that work best for you. \"We used to consistently start people with the least potent medication with the thought that this would have the least side effects, and then escalate depending on how they responded,\" [Benjamin Lebwohl, M.D.](https://doctors.columbia.edu/us/ny/new-york/benjamin-lebwohl-md-180-fort-washington-avenue), gastroenterologist and associate professor of medicine at [Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons](https://www.vagelos.columbia.edu/), tells SELF. \"Now, we've turned towards an approach that takes into account how advanced the disease is.\" In other words, if your [Crohn's disease symptoms](https://www.self.com/story/crohns-disease-symptoms-to-know) have progressed to the point where you can't go to the grocery store without worrying about needing a bathroom, then you may start with a stronger medication, Dr. Lebwohl explains. Below are some Crohn's disease medications your doctor might recommend: Depending on your specific symptoms, you will likely benefit from pain relievers. Your doctor might recommend taking an over-the-counter drug like acetaminophen and avoiding non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)\u2014ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin\u2014since these drugs can cause flares and increase your risk of ulcers and stomach bleeding, which people with Crohn's are already susceptible to, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353309). It's worth checking in with your doctor before taking any pain reliever, even if it's sold at your local drugstore. These are commonly called steroids and are used to reduce inflammation quickly. \"They work really fast and are unbelievably cheap,\" Dr. Higgins says. \"Think of steroids like a fire extinguisher.\" In fact, some steroids can start relieving symptoms within three hours of use3. You'll most commonly be prescribed oral steroids such as tablets or targeted injections to deal with systemic or localized inflammation, but creams may be recommended if you have skin-specific symptoms. It's worth noting, though, that steroids aren't typically used for long-term disease management because they can potentially cause side effects in some people, such as increased mood swings or high blood pressure, if used for a longer period of time. Of course this depends on the specific steroid, the dosage, and your personal health history, according to the [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/crohns-disease/treatment) (NIDDK). Antidiarrheals can help you have more normal bowel movements if you're constantly dealing with diarrhea. Loperamide is one popular OTC option that helps slow down your bowel movements, per the [NLM](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682280.html). If needed you can talk to your doctor about prescription-strength antidiarrheal. They should also give you direction on how to use antidiarrheal meds as safely as possible. Aminosalicylates are a family of medications that help reduce inflammation in your intestines4. They were previously prescribed to treat mild Crohn's disease, in which you get diarrhea and some abdominal pain but your symptoms don't interfere with your daily life and ability to eat. However, newer research suggests that aminosalicylate4 is not as beneficial as other medications for some people, so they're no longer commonly prescribed but are still an option to be aware of. These are available as pills, liquids, and suppositories. These oral medications are also known as immune system suppressors because they do just that: suppress the immune system to try to prevent it from overreacting toward healthy cells, according to the NIDDK. Ultimately, this helps reduce inflammation in your digestive tract by preventing the inflammatory process in the first place. Immunomodulators can take up to three months to start working, however, so your doctor might recommend a steroid alongside one while you wait for it to take effect. These are most commonly taken as a pill. Biologics are a class of drugs that target the specific proteins in the immune system that are involved with creating inflammation, according to the NIDDK. [Biologics](https://www.self.com/story/how-do-biologics-work) are a newer type of medication and are recommended for people with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Further, there are numerous types of biologics available and they all target different proteins, so if one doesn't work for you, then there are others you can try. \"Generally, biologics are the most effective treatment,\" Dr. Higgins says. Some [biologics can be self-injected at home](https://www.self.com/story/how-do-biologics-work), while others are given as an intravenous infusion at an outpatient treatment center. Antibiotics, which are usually available in tablet or liquid form, aren't used to reduce bodily inflammation, but they may be given alongside other medications to help treat or prevent specific complications. For example, Crohn's disease inflammation can cause pockets of pus called abscesses, and antibiotics can help these heal, according to the Mayo Clinic. Malnutrition is a potential side effect of Crohn's disease and more than half of people with IBD wind up with a nutrient deficiency5, as damage to your digestive tract can impact how well your body absorbs essential vitamins and minerals. Plus, many people with Crohn's disease may have trouble eating regularly, possibly leading to both unintentional weight loss and nutrient gaps. People with Crohn's disease most commonly deal with low levels of iron, vitamins B1, B6, or B12, vitamin D, vitamin K, folic acid, selenium, or zinc. To diagnose you with a deficiency, your doctor will take a close look at your symptoms and order blood tests to see exactly what you're not getting enough of and the best way to go about supplementing your diet. For example, iron-deficiency anemia is extremely common in people with Crohn's disease, so your doctor might suggest an IV iron treatment,6 which can take effect more quickly than iron tablets. It's crucial to talk to your doctor before taking any supplements, because some oral supplements may irritate your stomach and worsen your symptoms7. Plus you want to make sure you aren't getting too much (or not enough) of a particular nutrient. What is bowel rest treatment? If your symptoms become especially difficult to manage, you might opt for bowel rest, and it is exactly what it sounds like: letting your bowel rest so that it's encouraged to heal, according to the NIDDK. \"Bowel rest is sometimes recommended for hospitalized individuals with severe Crohn's disease,\" Dr. Lebwohl says. Typically, bowel rest is done in preparation for surgery, or as a way to reign in severe symptoms when medications aren't helping. During bowel rest, you will not be able to consume regular foods or drinks in a medically supervised setting\u2014meaning you should never attempt to do this on your own. You'll receive nutrition one of three ways: by drinking a special liquid, through a feeding tube (enteral nutrition), or through an IV (parenteral nutrition). This can last for anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. What should you expect from Crohn's disease surgery? If the Crohn's disease treatments mentioned above don't work, surgery may be considered to remove the part of your GI tract most affected by inflammation, according to the NIDDK. It's important to note that surgery still doesn't cure Crohn's disease. The condition can affect another part of your GI tract even after the original portion has been removed, Dr. Lebwohl says. However, surgery for Crohn's disease may be needed to remove severely damaged parts of the digestive tract or to help heal other complications, such as a fistula. (These are small tunnels that connect two parts of the body that don't normally connect, such as between one intestine and another, according to [NLM](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002365.htm)). The type of surgery you have will depend on what part of the digestive tract is damaged or what the specific complication is. Can lifestyle changes help treat Crohn's disease? In addition to taking medication, your doctor might recommend making a few lifestyle changes as a part of your Crohn's disease treatment plan. Some of these can help you feel better during a flare-up or help you minimize flares: - Make diet changes if needed: There's no single \"Crohn's disease diet\" that is proven to minimize the condition's effects. But depending on the symptoms you're experiencing, your doctor may recommend making some changes. For instance, you might [limit some high-fiber foods](https://www.self.com/story/ulcerative-colitis-diet)during an active flare-up. \"High-fiber foods aren't bad Crohn's disease and they're often nutritious foods,\" Dr. Lebwohl says. \"But if someone is having an active flare, high-fiber foods can promote more bowel activity and cause more gas and cramps.\" On the flip side, your doctor may recommend a low-fiber diet if you have bowel damage and intestinal narrowing, called stricturing. It's crucial to talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian before making any major changes in your diet so you can avoid potential nutrient gaps. - Quit smoking cigarettes if you smoke: \"The most important lifestyle habit to keep in mind is to not smoke cigarettes,\" Dr. Lebwohl says. Research shows that people who smoke cigarettes may not only increase their risk of developing Crohn's disease but may also experience worsening symptoms if they're already diagnosed8. - Manage stress as much as possible: As we mentioned, stress is a common trigger for Crohn's disease flare-ups. Of course, it's impossible to just wave a magic wand and make all of your stress disappear (if only!). And it doesn't help that Crohn's and its symptoms can be a source of stress in itself. But finding coping mechanisms that work for you, such as [seeing a therapist](https://www.self.com/story/find-affordable-therapist-guide), [deep breathing](https://www.self.com/story/breathing-videos), or simply making more [time for self-care](https://www.self.com/story/winter-self-care-tips), can help make things feel more bearable. While Crohn's disease is a chronic condition, there are many different treatments that you can turn to. It might take some time and effort to find relief, but it'll be worth it in the end. In the meantime, Dr. Higgins says it's important to be kind to yourself. \"There are going to be good days and bad days,\" he says. \"It helps to try to accept where you are each day and know that that's okay.\" Sources: [Genes Immunology, Prioritizing Crohn's Disease Genes by With Gene Expression Response In Crohn's Disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6457996/) [Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition & Metabolic Care, Micronutrient Deficiencies In Inflammatory Bowel Disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26418823/) [Cochrane, Therapies for Treating Iron Deficiency Anaemia in Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis](https://www.cochrane.org/CD013529/GUT_therapies-treating-iron-deficiency-anaemia-crohns-disease-and-ulcerative-colitis) [Acta Haematologica, Anaemia in Inflammatory Bowel Disease](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/496728) [Journal of Crohn's and Colitis, Smoking in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Impact on Disease Course and Insights Into the "}
