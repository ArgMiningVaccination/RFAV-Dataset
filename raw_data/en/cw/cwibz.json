Functions of Liver in Western Medicine In Western Medicine, the liver is the biggest organ responsible for detoxification in the body. The liver is also a vital organ for [digestion](https://drxiangjun.com/tcmwellness/tcm-wellness-digestive-health). The liver is like a factory that receives, filters and then repackages all substances for use in the body or removes those that are harmful to the body. The former is the [digestive function](https://drxiangjun.com/tcmwellness/tcm-wellness-digestive-health) of liver, while the latter is the detoxification function of the liver. Whenever we are exposed to toxins in the environment such as from [smoking](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-smoking), fog, pesticides, or toxins in the form of alcohol, sugar, processed foods, artificial colourings, nail polish, toxic make up, chemical hair dyes, household chemicals, the liver will be working harder to remove these toxic substances from the body. Liver Detoxification Process in Western Medicine The detoxification process of the liver occurs in two stages. The first step of the liver detoxification is when the toxins are partially broken down into smaller components that can be dissolved by water for clearance from the body. The second step of the liver detoxification involves having these partially broken down toxins combine with amino acids so as to reduce their toxicity and then be removed in either the bile or urine. Both stages of detoxification are important and have to be in balance and working efficiently. This is because in Stage 1, free radicals are produced and if they are excessive, it can damage the liver cells instead. In Stage 2, if this process is inefficient or dysfunctional, the partially broken down toxins are not eliminated fully in the bile or urine and can result in accumulation in the body instead. The partially broken down toxins are free radicals in nature and if they accumulate in the body instead of passing out, it can cause for damage to the body than the original form of toxins. How Liver is Toxified When a person takes a high level of alcohol or has a high exposure to smoking, processed foods, body product toxins, environmental toxins, Stage 2 of Liver detoxification is burdened with a higher load and can become sluggish, leading to the toxins being built up systematically in the body, causing damage to the cells and also higher risk for more serious illnesses such as [fatty liver](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-fatty-liver) and cancer. Functions of Liver in Traditional Chinese Medicine In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the functions of Liver include those listed in Western Medicine above but also spans further beyond that. This is because concepts of organ systems in Traditional Chinese Medicine not only involves the physiological aspects but also the functional aspects. 1. Liver in charge of Digestion Just like Western Medicine, Liver in Traditional Chinese Medicine is responsible for [digestion ](https://drxiangjun.com/tcmwellness/tcm-wellness-digestive-health)and absorption of foods and nutrients. Liver is especially involved in [digestion](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-ibs) of fats due to bile production. 2. Liver in charge of Regulation Liver is responsible for the circulation of energy or qi, blood and bodily fluids. Liver also modulates [water metabolism. ](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/what-is-dampness) In other words, Liver regulates the whole body's [metabolism](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-chronic-fatigue-syndrome), circulation and homeostasis. Which means all kinds of imbalances in the body is as a result of Liver unable to bring the body back to a state of equilibrium through removing the unnecessary (example, toxins) or supplying the shortage (example, blood or energy). 3. Liver in charge of Emotional Modulation To have emotions is normal. But to have [emotions run out of control is abnormal](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/tcm-science-healing-importance-of-negative-feelings-and-emotions). Liver is responsible for the [regulation of emotions](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/scientific-proof-to-how-your-body-react-to-acupuncture-stress-management). In other words, it keeps all emotions in check. Any extremities in emotional upheaval are because Liver has failed to keep the emotion in control. Liver is especially closely related to Anger.

Liver in charge of Eyes Liver energy channels run through the [eyes](https://drxiangjun.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-eye-floaters-western-medicine-traditional-chinese-medicine-acupuncture) and nourishes them with blood and energy. 7. Liver in charge of Nails Nails are the surplus of tendons which are nourished by Liver. The conditions of the nails can say a lot about the conditions of the Liver. Pink nail beds and firm nail plates indicate a healthy Liver while dry, brittle and deformed nails indicate a dysfunctional Liver. 8. Liver in charge of Spiritual Dynamism Liver houses hun or [spiritual consciousness](https://www.drxiangjun.com/shop/inner-practice-book) of a person. It hence governs how motivated we are for life and the spark that drives our passions. It ignites the expression of our desires and ideas, the ability to exchange and communicate through interpersonal connections and relations. 9. Liver in charge of Compassion Liver is in charge of the virtue of being compassion. To be able to feel for others and [extend help to people](https://www.drxiangjun.com/blog/inner-practice-what-happens-when-you-help) in need requires the energy from the Liver.
