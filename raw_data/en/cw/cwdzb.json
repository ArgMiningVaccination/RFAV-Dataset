[Accelerating U.S. Clean Energy Deployment Through Investment-Grade Policies](https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Investment-Grade-Policy.pdf) Because of significant reductions in the cost of clean energy, economics are no longer the prime barrier to expanding clean energy: Solar, onshore and offshore wind, and battery power now cost the same or even less than fossil fuels. But significant non-financial barriers to wider deployment remain. Clean energy deployment is rife with uncertainties, most of them unnecessary. These uncertainties are constraining clean energy deployment right when it should be accelerating.
