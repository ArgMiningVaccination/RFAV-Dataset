Introduction The template for the Profiles was a survey designed to collect information from countries in order to collect structured information to be used as the basis for the GEM Regional Report analysis work. The survey respondents were specifically requested to not focus exclusively on children with disabilities, but include information on all of the groups considered to be vulnerable to exclusion or at risk of being marginalised, stereotyped or subject to discrimination, including for reasons such as gender, location, poverty, ethnicity, language, beliefs and religion, migrat ion or displacement status, sexual orientation or gender identity expression. The overall goal for the Profile was that the information provided in relation to each country identifies: 1. challenges (barriers and hinderances) and opportunities (support an d ways forward) for the implementation of inclusion in education policies; 2. the ways in which countries monitor inclusion and exclusion in education (at individual and system levels); 3. challenges (barriers and hinderances) and opportunities (support a nd ways forward) for supporting inclusion in education created by sectors other than education and arrangements needed to co - ordinate work among government sectors, tiers of government and with other stakeholders to overcome overlapping dimensions of exclu sion; 4. key policy solutions that are being implemented and key drivers of policy change. The Profile begins with background information on the people completing the template. The next section provides a short descriptive overview of the country's system of inclusive education. This is followed by main sections presenting quantitative and qualitative data linked to each of the seven themes for the report: 1. laws and policies; 2. governance and finance; 3. data; 4. curricula, learning materials and assessment; 5. teachers and support personnel; 6. schools; 7. communities, parents and students. Each section begins with a key guiding question (marked in italic text) that frames the overall information provided. This is followed by the specific questions on the main issues for the topic that should be answered. Sections 1 and 2 focus on information relating to legislation and policies. Section 3 focuses upon available data and the aims and procedures for data col lection. Sections 4 to 7 focus on information relating to policies and policy implementation in practice. The information provided focuses on compulsory education (i.e. potentially -pre -primary, primary and lower secondary, and possibly upper secondary ed ucation). Only specific issues related to inclusion in early childhood education and post -compulsory education were considered when necessary. 2.

Specifically, provide information about: a. the different types of schools, institutions and educational provision within the system and the age range / ISCED levels of learners they cater for Childcare for children from one year of age until the commencement of compulso ry schooling is provided for a child outside his or her home in a group of children not pre -primary education (unlike nursery schools). Children's groups can be established by employers (private, public and state organisations) for their employees and by v arious non -profit entities (municipalities, regions, church organisations, benevolent corporations). The service can be provided against payment by parents or free of charge, currently it is subsidised by the European Social Fund. Pre-primary education (ISCED 020) is carried out in nursery schools (matesk\u00e9 koly) designated for children from 3 to 6 years of age. They may be attended by children over 6 years of age as well (with postponement of the compulsory school attendance) and eventually by children under 3 years of age (no sooner than 2 years of age). From 5 years of age the pre -primary education is compulsory. Basic education covers primary (ISCED 1) and lower -secondary (ISCED 2) education and takes 9 years of compulsory schooling (usually from 6 to 1 5 years of age). After successfully completing the basic education programme the pupil acquires a level of basic education (z\u00e1kladn\u00ed vzdl\u00e1n\u00ed). Upper secondary schools (stedn\u00ed koly) provide mainly upper secondary education (ISCED 3) which may be general or vocational. This type of education is post- compulsory. It consists of two to four -year programmes, with pupils are usually starting these at the age of 15. Pupils (and children and students) with special education needs learn preferentially in mainstrea m schools using support measures . The Education Act in section 16, par. 9 lists the types of special education needs instead of the categories of pupils, and for pupils with special education needs it sets the inclusive education in a mainstream school as a priority. It also provides for setting up independent schools or classes for pupils with mental disabilities, visual disabilities, hearing disabilities, physical disabilities, serious developmental learning impairments or conduct disorder, serious speec h impediments, multiple impairment, autism. In conformity with the Education Act, the separate education of pupils takes place only if the school guidance and counselling facility has found that the support measures given in inclusive conditions are not sufficient to meeting the education needs of these pupils and their right to education and if a legal deputy of the learner or the adult learner signs informed consent with such education path. School establishments from nursery schools to tertiary professional schools and also basic art schools (z\u00e1kladn\u00ed umleck\u00e9 koly), language schools, and school facilities are governed by the Education Act. Higher education institutions are governed by the Higher Education Act.

EU Commission (DG Reform) - support from European Agency for addressing regional disparities in the Czech education system. The 2016 reform for inclusive education represented a major c oncerted effort by the authorities, with the support of the European Social Fund (ESF). The European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) cover the Operational Programme for Research, Development and Education (OPVVV) and call for action research. The OP VVV focuses on improving the quality of education, ensuring conditions for quality research, linking education and research with the labour market and strengthening the principle of equal access to education (ii) Are there specific features of the compulsory education system that impact on inclusion that should be kept in mind when reading the country response? Area Yes/No Description of the feature Early tracking of learners into a particular educational pathway Yes International comparative research studies (most recently PISA 2018,) repeatedly present evidence of a strong dependency of school performance on the pupils' family background and the quality of school they attend (i.e. tracking pupils into selective and non -selective schools based on family background). There is a growing trend, from as early as pre -primary education, towards offering above -standard educational services within public education that are provided for payment and therefore they are not acces sible on an equal basis (e.g. extended language teaching, alternative educational approaches, clubs and other extracurricular activities). Not even the admission procedures within the compulsory sector of schooling can ensure equal opportunities for all pu pils. The admission process to six - and eight- year grammar schools, in particular, puts pupils from less educated and lower income families at a major disadvantage. Their learning outcomes are determined by the educational attainment and the socioeconomic status of parents. Educated parents not only sign their child up for the entrance examinations, but are also able to prepare him/her for the exam. The Czech Republic, 2014.

(National Overview p 4) The relationship between socio -economic backgro und and grade repetition - often an early indication of early school leaving - is among the strongest in the EU. (European Commission, 2018. European commission Education and training Monitor 2018, Czech Republic. https://ec.europa.eu/education/resources -and- ) Multiple languages of instruction No Policies on access to compulsory education in local schools Yes According to the Constitution, everyone has equal opportunity to receive education, free of charge, at pre -primary, primary, lower secondary and upper- secondary level. Nurser y schools/kindergartens provide compulsory education from 5 years of age. It can take one year or two in cases of basic school attendance postponement. Basic schools provide nine years of compulsory education. Compulsory education is divided into two levels: First level (years 1 -5) corresponds to the primary level. Second level (years 6 -9) corresponds to the lower -secondary level. Depending on a child's needs, they may postpone starting compulsory education until they are eight or until the school year during which they turn eight. Compulsory education of pupils with special needs can last up to 10 years. (National Overview p 4) (others ... ) (iii) In the country's system which groups are considered to be vulnerable to exclusion from education? Who has identified these groups as being vulnerable to exclusion? The most vulnerable are those with unrecognised and either recognised special education needs and those from the socio -economically weaker communities. The special education needs are identified by the schools and by the regional school counselling facilities. (iv) Please provide a brief (maximum 1 page) narrative overview of the historical development of inclusion of vulnerable groups in education in the country. There have been progressive changes in the Czech educational system since 1989. All these changes have opened the way to greater differentiation and individualisation of educational possibilities. The most important changes concern children with special education needs (S EN), who had limited or even restrictive access to education before. New educational philosophy, which responded to the tendency and trends of society's democratic development and orientation, was first formulated in the National Programme of Education Dev elopment in the Czech Republic (White Book) by the Ministry of Education in 2001. The latest goals and priorities are being described in the document to be approved by the Czech Government in 2020: Strategy of the Educational Policy until 2030 +. The main changes concerning the access of pupils with SEN to education since 1989 are as follows: Mainstream schools were opened up to pupils with SEN. Education opportunities were made available for pupils with even the most serious complex needs. Diverse forms of individualisation of education were established to meet the needs of pupils with SEN. A counselling system has been developed for pupils with SEN to support their integration and inclusion in mainstream scho ols and for pupils who are educated at home for specific health reasons. A counselling system for pupils with behavioural difficulties (disorders) has been set up. A broad range of support provisions has been implemented to increase the participation of pupils with special needs in mainstream education. The role and the rights of the parents and the learners have been significantly emphasised. Special schools have been developed into resource centres and the special education itself is only possible if it i s based on a professional diagnostics provided by the school counselling facilities complemented with an informed consent signed by legal deputy of the learner or by the adult learner. Section 1: Laws and Policies What is the framework of legislation, policy and guidelines for supporting the development of an inclusive education system? 2.2. Have international/UN conventions/declarations to protect the rights of groups who are potentially vulnerable to discrimination and exclusion been integrated into national and/or regional law? Convention/declaration on Law Comments Child rights (UNCRC) Constitution of the Czech Republic (1993) The Education Act (2004) The Constitution states that everybody is equal in accessing the law and according to the law. Everyone has equal opportunity to receive education, free of charge, at compulsory and upper -secondary level. (European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education, 2018 . Czech Republic country information. https://www.european -agency.org/country - information/czech -republic ) The Act ensures equal access to education for all citizens of the Czech Republic or nationals of any other EU Member State without discrimination based on any ground, such as race, colour, gender, language, belief or religion, nationality, ethnic or social origin, property, kith or kin, health condition or any other status of a citizen (Education act, 2004, p.1, Art.2(1) (a)).

Act No. 561/2004 on preschool, primary, secondary, higher and other education (Education Act) . p. 13.) Education Act update 2014, enacted The update proposes stressing the inclusive approac h. It presents a new definition of the target group of pupils with special needs as pupils entitled to additional support to fulfil their right to education. The new definition does not use the terms 'impairment' and/or 'socially disadvantaged background' and is based on the 'need for support provisions', which are to be delivered to all pupils whose health and/or life conditions make their access to education difficult. (European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education, 2019. Country Dossier. Work ing Document for the Czech Republic SRSP Action). p. 9.) Major amendments to the Education Act of 2015 (Decree on the education of pupils with special education needs and talented pupils, and Decree on the provision of counselling services and facilities in schools), 2016, enacted The amendments removed the unreasonably strict definition of SEN, which took the form of a list of specific types of disabilities. This approach significantly restricted the support measures available to pupils who truly needed them. Furthermore, the new law safeguards against excessive use of support measures where they are no longer necessary, by both schools and statutory representatives. (European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education, 2018a . Czech Republic country information . https://www.european - agency.org/country -information/czech -republic ) Amendment of the Decree on Education of Pupils with Special Education Needs and of Gifted Pupils 2020, enacted It sets the highest number of teaching staff in mainstream basic school classes, offers additional options for setting up special classes, and regulates the conditions for recommending an individual educational plan. The list of claiming compensation aids and their prices in connection with the market development and the financial demands of the compensation aids and the teaching assistant are also newly defined. The aim of the amendment was to reduce the administrative burden for schools and school counselling facilities and to spend money effectively.

The Strategy focuses not only on formal equity in access to education, but also on the capacity of the education system to create conditions and offer effective ways to prevent and offset individuals' physical, social, cultural and other personal disadvantages, in order to ensure that inequality in performance is as little as possible determined by factors that they cannot influence and that all pupils and students achieve at lea st a basic level of knowledge and skills.

Other important objectives in the Long-term Plan include an effort to make the system of students and schools and the education system more effective and creating better conditions for teachers and teaching staff (Eurydice, 2019) Long -term Plan for Education and the Development of the Education System of 2019 Focuses on equal opportun ities in education, with an emphasis on the vulnerable children in socially -disadvantaged areas, on full implementation of the compulsory pre-school education and on the equalizing of the chances of all learners. the Czech Republic (2019-2023) , Action Plan for Inclusive Education 2019- 2020) 2018 It includes measures on information, data and open communication with experts, the public and other national and local stakeholders, and on involving schools, pedagogues and every pupil. Besides concrete measures and timings, it also states extra priorities based around: - the position and role of social pedagogues in schools; - analysis and supportive measures in pre -schools and basic schools with a high population of Roma minority pupils; - the pre-and post -graduate education of pedagogues targeted on inclusive education. Strategies are being prepared in each region (a total of 14regions in the Czech Republic are relatively independent in local education policy). (CPRA p8) 4.5 Is there a definition of inclusion in education? No No information available Yes If yes, please provide the definition and give the official source: The 2014 Education Act update proposes stressing the inclusive approach. It presents a new definition of the target group of pupils with special needs as pupils entitled to additional support to fulfil their right to education. The new definition does not use the terms 'impairment' and/or 'socially disadvantaged background' and is based on the 'need for support provisions', which are to be delivere d to all pupils whose health and/or life conditions make their access to education difficult. ( European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education, 2018a . Czech Republic country information . https://www.european -agency.org/country -information/czech )) 1.6 Is there a definition of vulnerable groups? No No information available Yes If yes, please provide the definition and give the official source: The Education Act ( https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2004-561 ) defines the types of special education needs (de facto types of handicaps). For example: \"A student who cannot hear speech by hear ing\" or \"a student with a mental, physical, visual or hearing disability\" and the like. These can be perceived as groups considered to be vulnerable. 1.7 Is there a definition of special education needs? No No information available Yes If yes, please provide the definition and give the official source: The Education Act regulating the whole education system in the Czech Republic was approved in September 2004 and came into force in January 2005. It has been updated several times since. This Act defines pupils with special education needs (SEN) and individual target groups: pupils with intellectual, sensory or physical disabilities; pupils with speech and language impairments; pupils with multiple disabilities; pupils with autism; pupils with specific learning and behavioural difficulties; chronically ill pupils; socially disadvantaged pupils. It also focuses on the education of gifted and talented pupils. The 2014 Education Act update stresses an inclusive approach. It presents a new definitio n of the target group of pupils with SEN as pupils entitled to additional support to fulfil their right to education. The new definition does not use the terms 'impairment' and/or 'socially disadvantaged background'. It is based on the 'need for support provisions', which are to be delivered to all pupils whose health and/or life conditions make their access to education difficult. The Education Act guarantees the availability of provisions and services required for supporting learners to access education a t all levels, no matter where they are educated (mainstream and/or special settings). Pupils with SEN have the right to be provided with additional support provisions free of charge. (National Overview, 2018) The Amendment to the Education Act of 2015 (whi ch came into force in 2016) is based on the presumption that everyone has the right to an education where the content, forms and methods reflect education needs and possibilities. Education should be enjoyed by everyone; it should not be the privilege of a narrowly defined circle of people with disabilities or disadvantages. The new definition of a child with SEN is: Every child who needs support measures with reflection of their educational possibilities and/or fulfilment of their rights with regard to health, cultural and/or life conditions (Parliament of the Czech Republic, 2004. Act No. 561/2004 on preschool, primary, secondary, higher and other education (Education Act). Art.16, par.1. / European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education, 2019. Country Policy Review and Analysis: Czech Republic .) In 2016 the Framework Education programme for Basic Education (FEP BE) was changed in line with the amendme nt to the Education Act from 2015, which legislatively anchors the so -called inclusive education and means the launching of a new way of supporting the education of children, pupils and students with special education needs and gifted pupils. Revision of t he FEP BE consists primarily in the removal of the Annex regulating the education of pupils with a mild mental disability and in the modifications of some chapters of the FEP BE in order to comply with the amendment to the Education Act and the implementing regulations. (For more information, see the website of the Ministerstvo kolstv\u00ed, ml\u00e1dee a tlov\u00fdchovy / Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports/.) (Eurydice, 2019.

Scrapping of the Annex to the Framework Education Programme for Primary Education governing the education of pupils with mild mental disability in 2016, and its incorporation into the inclusive curriculum. (UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, 2018. Combined Fifth and Sixth Periodic Report on Compliance with Obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child . p. 26, para. 132.) Commissioner for Human Rights, 2019. According to the Public Defender of Rights, there is still no decision by a national court stating that segregation is a form of discrimination in the Czech Republic - in reality that conclusion must be deduced from international conventions. European Commission, 2018. ( Civil society monitoring report on implementation of the national Roma integration strategies in Czech Republic . p. 29 -30.). Special classes can still be established for pupils with intellectual or physical impairment, severe speech impairment, serious developmental le arning disorders, severe developmental behavioural disorders, concomitant multiple disabilities, or autism. Human Rights Council, 2017. ( Compilation on Czechia A/HRC/WG.6/28/CZE/2 . p. 8, para. 50.) The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination remained concerned that Roma children continued to be segregated from mainstream education, with many of them ending in entirely or almost Roma-only schools owing to the deeply rooted negative prejudice against them and the reluctance of school authorities and non- Roma parents to enrol the ir children in a school with Roma children. It should be noted that there about 4,200 basic schools in The Czech Republic. The numbers of schools where Roma pupils are 90% or more of the total number of pupils was 13 (2018) and 16 (2019 ). 1.10 What are th e perceived main challenges (barriers and hindrances) and opportunities (support and ways forward) for inclusion in education in relation to laws and policies in the country? Opportunities: The School Act reinforces the trend towards inclusion of pupils w ith SEN in mainstream schools. It recognises that pupils with special needs should attend their local school unless their parents choose another school. Parents have a crucial role in making decisions about their children's education. ( (European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education (Website). Country Information for the Organisation of the system of inclusive educatio n). Challenges: The 2016 reform for inclusive education represented a major concerted effort by the authorities, with the support of the European Social Fund (ESF). ... The evaluation carried out by the Czech School Inspectorate in 2017 indicates the reform has improved sup port for pupils with special needs in mainstream education. The heavy administrative burden on schools was identified as a drawback and the funding requested by schools for support measures was higher than expected. Furthermore, on top of support measures teachers will need to be equipped with the right skills, training tools and teaching materials to meet the ambitions of the reform. So far the impact on the education of Roma pupils in mainstream education remains limited. ( European Union, 2018. Education and Training Monitor 2018 Czech Republic . p. 6-7.) Section 2: Governance and Finance How far are inclusive principles underpinning policies atnational and local levels effectively supported by governance and financing mechanisms? 5.1 Is there formal collaboration across ministries on inclusion in education? No No information available Yes If yes, in which areas does this take place and who is involved? Area Yes/No Description: what mechanism, who is involved and how Policy development, implementation and coordination Yes The Ministry of Finance is involved in the implementation of inclusive education in the form of ongoing cooperation to finance support measures for children with special education needs. This is vital for the whole implementation of an inclusive education policy. Colleagues from the Ministry of Finance are also very actively and constructively involved in the preparation of legislative changes. And again in the interests of an effective inclusive education policy. Identification of needs / referral for services - Data sharing - Monitoring and evaluation - Quality assurance and accountability = (others ... ) Support for learners with SEN, including learners with moderate or severe intellectual disabilities and others, comes (almost exclusively) from teaching staff. However, s ome activities are not primarily teaching. The MEYS aims to find an effective sharing model for staff within the education, social services and health care departments who work with learners with SEN. This would ensure that all learners' needs are met and that state budget funds are effectively spent on professional (teaching) positions in cases and activities where they are needed. (CPRA p 4) 5.2 Are there shared responsibilities between central and local governments on inclusion in education? No No information available Yes If yes, in which areas does this take place and who is involved? The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports is responsible for the concept and the state and development of the education system. The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports also secures financial resources for the support measures for each individual chid across the country. Local and regional authorities (regions and municipalities) are the most significant founders of schools and school facilities. Several responsibilities of the state administration are, through the delegation of power, referred to regional authorities (regional offices) and, alt hough to a much lesser extent, to bodies of municipalities with extended powers. (Eurydice 2020, 2.1 Fundamental Principles and National Policies) Area Yes/No Description: who is involved and how Policy development, implementation and coordination Yes The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports retained powers to create policies and strategies, while powers to establish schools and school facilities and administer them are exercised by regions and municipalities. (Eurydice, 2020) The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports secures, in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance the resources needed for the implementation. The part of the budget earmarked for support measures is still a new one among others within the overall education budget. Identification o f needs / referral for services Yes Policy is set centrally and implemented at regional and municipality level. The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports approves the framework education programmes for different levels and fields of education up to upper secondary education. Those programmes include the goals, forms, duration, and compulsory content of education, its organisation, a profes sional profile of the graduate, conditions for progress and the completion of education, principles for designing school education programmes on the basis of the framework education programmes, and conditions for the education of pupils with special educat ion needs (Eurydice, 2020) The Regions are responsible for running upper secondary schools ; conservatories ( lower and upper secondary, as well as tertiary professional education in the area of art) and tertiary professional schools. (Eurydice, 2020). The Regions are responsible for running school counselling facilities which are responsible for diagnostics and identification of the special education needs of the children - their incoming clients. The Municipalities are responsible for running nursery schoo ls, basic schools and ensuring compulsory schooling. Data sharing Yes The Action Plan for Inclusive Education 2019 -2020 includes measures on information, data and open communication with experts, the public and other national and local stakeholders, and on involving schools, pedagogues and every pupil. (CPRA p.8) The main source of the data is the statistics department of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports. One of the most important data sources is the Czech School Inspectorate which is providing the ministry with up -to-date data. Monitoring and evaluation Yes The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports executes regular statistical monitoring of inclusive measures, pedagogical staff and expenditures. The Czech School Inspectorat e complements the statistics with data on the results of education and with other qualitative data. Regions establish school counselling facilities. These facilities perform diagnostics of learners with SEN and issue recommendations for their educational support. The MEYS aims to ensure the unification of diagnostic procedures and outputs based on a unified methodology and a set of diagnostic tools used across the regions of the Czech Republic. This will also ensure the standardised quality of diagnostic procedures and consultancy services. Quality assurance and accountability Yes The Czech School Inspectorate (CSI) sets the evaluation criteria for conditions, education processes and the results. The inspectorate produces inspection reports on individual schools, as well as thematic reports, secondary analyses on the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), etc. The CSI is directly accountable to the Ministry. (others ... ) 5.3 Are non -governmental organisations and/or associations involved in governance processes? No No information available Yes If yes, please the describe their involvement: Strategies are being prepared in each region (a total of 14 regions in the Czech Republic are relatively independent in local education policy). Strategies must follow several criteria among which taking tar get groups such as NGO's into account (CPRA p. 17) 5.4 Are there any accountability mechanisms to promote the inclusion of learners from vulnerable groups? No No information available Yes If yes, what is the focus of the mechanisms? Area Yes/No Description of the focus/actors involved (e.g. state/non state) Appeal process for rights violations Yes Ombudsman\u00b4s office Government Council for Human Rights Government Council for Roma Community Affairs Government Agent for the Enforcement of Judgment D.H. Roma non -governmental organizations School inspection Yes The Czech School Inspectorate (CSI) produces inspection reports on schools, as well as thematic reports, secondary analyses on the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), etc. The introduction of a review authority directly accountable to the Ministry represents a significant step towards the standardisation and predictability of the activities underta ken by school counselling facilities. (CPRA p. 21) Other quality assurance processes (e.g. standards for teaching, support services etc) Yes The Education Act codifies the teaching of pupils with special needs through support measures that may be described in each pupil's individual education plan (CPRA p.16) Special Pedagogical Centres are part of the resource centres and deal with expert special needs assessment and support services for certain groups of pupils with regard to their type of impairment. M ost of these centres are now developing more complex areas of support provision (CPRA p.17) The CSI's quality standards have criteria on different areas of the school/school facilities. The system for school quality contains areas and indicators as follows : Concept and overall vision (strategies, education programmes, communication, interactions); Pedagogical leadership (monitoring and corrective measures, personnel management, material conditions, professional development) (CPRA p.21) Monitoring and eva luation (e.g. data collection on attendance, Yes The Action Plan for Inclusive Education 2016 -2018 (updated for 2019- 2020) stresses a clear database participation, achievement, funding) policy. The aim is to improve, stabilise, structure and publicly commu nicate a system of indicators of inclusive education. (CPRA p.20) (others ... ) 5.5 Please describe the general mechanisms for funding schools. Give details on: which institutions provide funding; what they provide; how they provide it and to whom, which mechanisms they use to allocate resources; and their respective roles and responsibilities. Funding mechanisms Description of who, what, to whom and how Standardised cost -based funding Public schools and school facilities obtain funds from the stat e budget and from the budgets of territorial administrative units - regions and municipalities, they can also acquire some funds through their economic activities and participation in international programmes. Tuition is only paid in nursery schools and tertiary professional schools, and its amount is determined by a decree. Since 1 January 2020, the amendment to the Education Act has fundamentally changed the way in which public nursery schools - kindergartens (matesk\u00e9 koly), basic schools (z\u00e1kladn\u00ed ko ly) and upper secondary koly), conservatoires (konzervatoe) and after -school clubs (koln\u00ed druiny) are funded. Newly, the financial means are allocated to schools directly from the state. The per capita amount per pupil (valid in the previous system) has been replaced by a per capita amount per pedagogical worker / one member of education staff. The new system guarantees the financing of the actual extent of teaching, i.e. according to the number of hours taught. Thus, the budget for sc hools is newly laid down directly by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports, not by regional authorities as before. When allocating the means, different size and structure of study fields in schools in regions, the financial costs of support measures, and the different salary levels of teachers in individual schools are taken into account. In case of basic art schools (z\u00e1kladn\u00ed umleck\u00e9 koly) and tertiary professional schools, the system of per capita amounts per pupil/student has been preserved. Howe ver, the per capita amounts are newly set centrally by the Ministry of Education. 5.6 Do schools have flexibility to use funding allocations to support the inclusion of learners from vulnerable groups? No No information available Yes If no, please give further information: Schools do not decide on the management of funds intended for support measures for pupils with special educational needs. Support measures are determined for each child by school counselling facilities, and the Ministry of Education finances each individual support measure from the state budget. Therefore, schools are not limited in the amount of funding. Funds are allocated in the amount and focus according to the needs of each individual child. The school where the child a ttends is then responsible for providing a support measure paid from the state budget. The cost based funding does not finance inclusion of learners from vulnerable groups. These are funded through other types of mechanisms as explained in 2.7. 5.7 Please describe the specific mechanisms for funding the inclusion of vulnerable learners and their families in education (e.g. benefits, cash transfers, scholarships). Give details on: which institutions provide funding; what they provide; how they provide it an d to whom, which mechanisms they use to allocate resources; and their respective roles and responsibilities. Funding mechanisms Description of the who, what, to whom and how Flat-rate funding for the cost of the support measure The state budget also provides schools and school facilities of all organising bodies (public, private and denominational) with targeted funding for the implementation of so -called \"support measures\" for the education of children, pupils and students with special education needs, both support measures of a personal nature (teacher assistant, pedagogical intervention, etc.), and material (special textbooks, materials and teaching aids etc.). The legal regulation stipulates for each support measure the so -called \"standardised fina ncial costs\", i.e. financial flat -rate expression for the \"cost\" of the support measure. A precondition for providing support measures with standardised financial costs is the recommendation of the school guidance and counselling facility and the informed consent of the child's or pupil's legal guardian. Direct support to schools Calls within the Operational Programme Research, Development and Education aim at the Inclusive education for socially excluded locations . The calls focus on providing direct support to schools, on educational activities for public and on realisation of the workshops for various stakeholders in education. The call encourages the regions and municipalities in their coordinating role and cooperation with other subjects. Th e applications can be submitted from 21 January 2019 to 30 June 2020 Development programmes Development programmes funded and administered by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports: Equipping school guidance and counselling facilities with diagnostic tools. Development programme Funding of teachers' assistants. Development programme to support an increase in the capacity of school guidance and counselling centres in 2019. Development programme to support school meals for socio - economically v ulnerable children. Development programme to support Roma integration. 5.8 Please provide information (main conclusions, reference and a link if available) on any recent reports, evaluations and/or reviews, since 2015 of funding and resourcing relating to inclusive education . Analysis of the implementation of the inclusive education: http://www.msmt.cz/file/46497/ The flat -rate funding system is based on the principle of rights of students, with a f ocus on students with special education needs, to receive adequate and timely professional support as deemed necessary by pedagogical and psychological professionals. However, it does not include any limitations on the potential claims by the schools for financial support to provide these services. Unfortunately, this rights -based system creates in this way an open liability for the central government, because it places complete trust in the individual decisions to be taken by pedagogical counselling servic es across the country. ( OECD, 2016. OECD Reviews of School Resources: Czech Republic 2016. p.108.) The implementation analysis linked above provides these requested information (with a focus on the respective period). Further data for the period up to September 2019 confirmed the following main conclusions: Benef its and challenges of implementing joint education By far the most significant benefit is the conceptual change in the approach to the specific educational needs of children and pupils. Pupils with SEN in mainstream schools have received structured support since September 2016, which is appreciated by both parents and schools. Unlike in the past, schools know what and under what conditions pupils are entitled. Problems with pupils with behavioural disorders and autism, which represent the greatest burden fo r schools in terms of the demands of the teacher's work, began to be detected and solved more. There was no step transfer of pupils with SEN from special schools to mainstream schools. Pupils whose disadvantages are made possible by education with support in a regular school have moved to mainstream schools. In a number of cases, pupils with SEN have been successfully integrated into mainstream schools - this applies to both pupils with MMD and the physically handicapped, or pupils with sensory disa bilities. There has been no weakening of special education. Paradoxically, the support measures system also supported pupils in special schools. Teachers in a number of schools, especially those where they have had experience in the education of pupils wit h SEN in the past, were able to meet the expectations of joint education in the interests of pupils. The implementation of joint education was complicated by the demanding administration associated with the demanding support measures. The regional authorit ies misunderstood the financing of special schools (or classes) through support measures, where systemic support for special education was replaced by significantly more expensive support through support measures, support intended primarily for joint education of pupils with SEN in mainstream schools for the period of increased standards. The readiness of ordinary school teachers in the field of special pedagogical skills was not sufficient, DVPP supporting the implementation of joint education focused only on partial issues. The fact that some license plates and some schools have the same founder was not resolved in time, which may significantly affect the conditions for granting support measures (own) pupils, which may lead to a significant \"increase\" in s pecial education in schools (and probably in classrooms) established under \u00a7 16 (9). In some regions, there has been increasing pressure on small schools to include pupils with moderate and severe mental disabilities or combined disabilities on the basis o f the provisions of Section 19, Paragraph 1 of Decree No. 27/2016 Coll., Although they cannot meet the conditions for their education. Significant differences persisted in the recommended support measures for the same types of disadvantage, where only the range of the number of support measures ranged from 19 per pupil to 0.75 support measures per pupil. 5.9 Overall, what are the perceived main challenges (barriers and hinderances) and opportunities (support and ways forward) for inclusion in education in relation to governance and finance issues in the country? In 2015, the amendment of the Education Act, stipulating that children and pupils have an enforceable right to adequate support at school. Most importantly, these amendments link the provision of additional funding to the specific needs of the child instead of basing it on a medical diagnosis. Under this new approach will be based on a catalogue of certified pedagogical measures, which must be undertaken by schools whenever a student is certified as in need of such a measure, irrespective of in which school she or he is enrolled. The catalogue includes also the specific established costs (prices) for each item on the catalogue. This allows, on the basis of available statistics regardin g students with special education needs, to make prognosis of the future necessary additional allocation of the required budget funds. (OECD, 2016. OECD Reviews of School Resources: Czech Republic 2016. p. 100.) There is a significant movement towards funding additional provisions based on categorising pupils' specific needs according to the 'level of needs'. (European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education. Country Information for the Organisation of the system of inclusive education. ) Interviews with the National Council for People with Disabilities and NGOs supports this statement, maintaining that a problem regarding inclusive education concerns the fact that parents of children with disabilities are required to contribute to the extra costs incurre d by the mainstream school when providing the child with education. According to the cases reported by stakeholders, this requirement is put forward by school principals or stems from the lack of financial support provided at the level of regional authorit y that is responsible for the financing of education. If the parents wish that their children are educated in a mainstream school, own financing from their side could be, in certain schools and regions, the only possibility. This demand transfers the burden from the State to the parents as they have to fund the education of their children in a public school that is otherwise free of charge ( European Parliament, 2013, European Parliament, 2013. European Parliament Directorate General for Internal Policies, 2 013. Country Report on the Czech Republic for the Study on Member States' Policies for Children with Disabilities. Brussels: European Union. http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2013/474418/IPOL - LIBE_ET(2013)474418_EN.pdf ) ) Prevailing challenges are: 1. The nee d to consistently methodically and financially manage school counseling facilities and the system of pedagogical- psychological counseling (entry level - diagnostics) - evaluate and unify diagnostic procedures - delegate responsibility for the financial management of school counseling facilities to the regions 2. Change the perception of the support system: from strictly individual support to shared support (where possible, especially for teaching assistants) 3. Reduce the administrative burden of schools an d school counseling facilities associated with the distribution of support - simplify existing forms - in the future, use an electronic system for administration - a shared environment Section 3: Data 6.1 Please indicate if the following frameworks are in place, provide a link and give a brief description of their aims and focus: Framework Yes / No Description For monitoring and evaluating the implementation of national -level inclusion in education policy Yes The main framework f or monito ring and evaluating the implementation of national -level inclusion is the statistical reporting provided by each individual school to the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports. The qualitative monitoring and feedback (both individual for the schools and systemic for the authorities) is executed by the Czech School inspectorate. This monitoring is based on quality indicators and evaluation criteria. The Action Plan for Inclusive Education 2016 -2018 (updated for 2019 -2020) stresses a clear database policy. The aim is to further improve and publicly communicate a system of complementary indicators of inclusive education. A regular working group is expected to be an informal advisory body on the results of data sources, recommendations, prevention of duplicati ons in investigations and, as a consequence, a reduction in the administrative burden on schools. For quality assurance across all levels of the system (national, regional, school) Yes The criteria and indicators set of the Czech school inspectorate is focused just exactly on the quality assurance across all levels of the system (national, regional, school) Providing guidance on the use of a range of different data sources for evaluation and self-review at different levels (national, reg ional, school) No 6.2 What data is collected on learners from vulnerable groups, how and why? The CSI further broadens the quality, extent and usability of international large -scale surveys through secondary analyses which show causal linkages in more detail. In May 2018, the CSI published two secondary analyses of TIMSS 2015 and PISA 2015, aimed at selected aspects of school education that may influence pupils' results (such as classroom composition, teacher's methods, use of technologies). Since the amendment of the Education Act in 2016, the CSI has been implementing evaluation of the inclusion implementation within the schools inspected. The CSI also prepares methodologies for the description of schools in terms of pupils' social backgrounds. There are not yet any rigorous outcomes. However, the analysis of possible systems is available as a partial outcome. At the beginning of December every year, the CSI publishes its Annual Report that analyses and interprets data from the previous school year. This Report is therefore always the first rigorous information about the Czech educational system . Each chapter contains the most important findings and recommendations in the breakdown for each school, for its founders and for the system level. (CPRA p 36) The Action Plan for Inclusive Education 2016 -2018 (updated for 2019- 2020) stresses a clear database policy. The aim is to improve, stabilise, structure and publicly communicate a system of indicators of inclusive education. A regular working group is expected to be an informal advisory body on the results of data sources, recommendations, prevention of duplications in investigations and, as a consequence, a reduction in the administrative burden on schools. The data should be quality, solid and collected in comparable time series. International data will be used to compare systems from abroad. According to the parameters of the survey, pupils' parents should be found and classified as a target group. The updated Action Plan for 2019 -2020 aims to stabilise systems of indicators; to structure annual reports on the implementation of inclusive education; to prepare a mechanism of data interpretation for school praxis purposes; to collect data for exact mapping of early school leaving. (CPRA, p 20) 6.3 Please provide the available data relating to all learners in the compulsory education system and where t hey are enrolled for their education. All questions can be answered using the country's own data sources as far as possible. Alternatively, the data can be provided from publicly available international sources e.g. UIS: http://data.uis.unesco.org/index.aspx?queryid=216 or UOE: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics - explained/index.php/Main_Page Please give a clear reference to the Source in the column provided. In the Learners column, as far as possible: - provide actual numbers as far as possible and not estimates. - only use 0 when the data is zero. - use M to indicate missing data. - use NA to indicate the question is Not Applicable (i.e. the country does not have that type of provisio n). All questions refer to ALL learners in the education system, not just those formally identified as belonging to a group that is vulnerable to exclusion. Please provide notes to clarify any issues with the data and include a specific note on the calendar year and/or school year the data refers to.

No information available 6.5 Overall, what are the perceived main challenges (barriers and hinderances) and opportunities (support and ways forward) for inclusion in education in relation to data collection issues in the country? No information available Section 4: Curricula, learning materials and assessment To what extent are curricula, learning materials and different assessment processes and procedures adapted to the principles of inclusive education? 7.1 Curriculum a. Does the curriculum content include and represent all learners? No No information available Partially Yes If yes or partially, please pro vide a description and available links, including to underpinning values and principles. The 2008 Framework Education programme for Basic Education is a national document covering both mainstream and special education. It serves as the basis for compiling the school curricula. Each school is responsible for developing this school-level document, which must also include a description of the provision for pupils with special needs. The school education programme also emphasises the school's learning environme nt and operational culture, the concept of learning, cross -curricular themes in teaching, individual support and guidance, and pupils' welfare. (CPRA p 29) Amendment to the Education Act 2016 introduced a priority of educating pupils with special education needs in mainstream schools and introduced a completely new complex system of support measures for all who need them due to their different culture or socio -economical status. Further, the amendment abolished the separate education program and curriculum for pupils with mild mental disabilities since 2016. The number of the Roma pupils educated under the curricula for the pupils with MMD has dropped from 2,631 (2016) to 953 (2018). Of the total number of Roma pupils in basic schools, 2.7 % were educated ac cording to the MMD curricula (last year, 5.6%). All the pupils finishing this programme was reassessed and offered mainsteam ed. Since 1st September 2020, no Roma and neither any other pupils will be educated in this program as it will be completely ended. After 1st September 2016 and after abolition of the MMD program there is only mainstream basic education curriculum for education within mainstream basic schools. The individual curricula for basic education are as follows: Mainstream curriculum a) Framework educational program for basic education; b) Framework educational program for basic education with reduced demands on selected learning outcomes, if the pupil needs it in some certain area; \"Special curricula\" c) Framework educational program for basic education - annex regulating the education of pupils with mild mental disabilities (MMD) - canceled, ends in the school year 2019/2020; d) RRFrame educational program for the field of education primary school special for pupils with more severe ment al disabilities. If no, please give further information: b. Does the process of curriculum development involve the participation and contribution of different stakeholders? No No information available Yes If yes, please provide information on stakeholder involvement. All types of stakeholders are involved - state authorities, schools, NGOs, employers, associations. None of the relevant partners is left aside the curriculum review process. The clear evidence that they are involved in the curricula design: minutes of meetings and negotiations, employment contracts, comment proceedings, written settlements to comment on partners, minutes of round tables and conferences. c. Is there guidance/procedures for schools to ensure that the curriculum content takes account of all learners (e.g. using flexibility to address differences due to gender, culture, religions, the ethnicities/nations living in the country, their history and culture, differences related to disability and socio -economi c background, LGBT community). No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description and examples of this flexibility. The Education Act implemented a curricular reform in January 2005. Since September 2007, all schools in the Czech Republic have been implementing their own school education programmes, which have to reflect the organisation of education in light of the diversity of pupils and their various individual needs in the class. The MEYS supports schools in this implementation process by training teachers and head teachers and providing guidance, counselling and the required resources. The co -ordinators of the implementation process at the school level receive training and schools are given guidance and support. (CPRA p 2 9) Schools are responsible for providing first -level support measures in the pedagogical field. It happens with ethical management according to the individual needs of children, in the form of individualized approaches. d. If individual education plans (IEPs) are used, please describe the procedure for developing (who is involved and how), what they focus on (specific curriculum areas; cross curricular competences; support strategies etc.) and how IEPs are implemented, used across the school? Individual ed ucation plans (IEPs) are widely used. Individual Education Plan (IEP) is a type of support measure. The Special Pedagogical Centres (SPC) and Educational and Psychological Counselling Centres (PPCC ) decide if a child needs an IEP because of their needs. Sc hools have a duty to elaborate on the IEP and to educate the child under it. The IEP sets educational objectives for the pupil, modifications to the organization and content of education, timing and distribution of the contents of subjects, way in which tasks are specified, ways of assessment and classification, pedagogical methods, exam and final examinations organisation, etc. It describes the type and scope of special pedagogical and psychological support for the pupil, its organisation, and the way the support and its provider are ensured (not only the institution but also the staff member). It defines compensation and teaching aids, ICT equipment, textbooks, learning texts, etc., fewer pupils in a class, taking on another teacher or a sign language interpreter or an additional worker in the class. In 2018, 19, 6 % of pupils followed an individual educational plan. (Eurydice 2020). e. Are there different curricula or programmes for specific groups of learners at risk of exclusion (e.g. ethnic minorities or minority language groups) No curricular Yes programmes If yes, please give a description of the main characteristics/organisation. There are no different curricula or programmes for specific groups of learners at risk of exclusion as one of the main priorities of the MEYS is inclusion and common mainstream education. However , Roma children represent a substantial group of pupils and increased attention is being paid to their education. Developmental programmes, entitled 'The support of Ro ma pupils at upper -secondary schools', 'The support of Roma community integration' and 'Schools with a full-day programme', are still in progress and a network of preparatory classes has been developed. Within these, a special training programme has been d eveloped for pedagogical assistants from the Roma community. Through their supportive work in the classroom, these assistants serve as school -family liaisons. ( European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education (Website ). Country Information for the Organisation of the system of inclusive education .) Regarding the integration of children with migr ant and ethnic minority background, the Czech MEYS has developed a programme to support integration policy. Its framework supports projects for the multi-cultural education of children and young people, the education of migrant foreigners and Czech as a fo reign language courses. Children with insufficient knowledge of the Czech language as an 'official' educational language take part in an additional language course in Educational and Psychological Counselling Centres (PPCC) and Special Pedagogical Centres (SPC) for special educational needs as a support measure for several hours per week. All types of programmes are thoroughly described and implemented by the National Institute for Further Education. (National overview p 4) 7.2 Learning materials a. Is there autonomy for schools and teachers to select learning material/textbooks etc? No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description. Schools and teachers are free to select learning materials/textbooks corresponding with the curriculum. Pupils with special needs have the right to be provided with support measures free of charge. Measures include adapted textbooks, specific teaching materials, compensatory and rehabilitation equipment and tools, and information and communicatio n technology tools. Braille print is available for pupils who cannot read regular print. Refer to Decree No. 27/2016 Coll., on the education of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) and talented pupils (CPRA p 14) b. Are there policies to ensure th e availability of textbooks/materials that promote the inclusion of learners from different vulnerable groups? (e.g. resources relevant to different ethnic groups etc.) No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description. Information for SEN pupils: textbooks/materials that promote the inclusion of learners are published by the ministry and its\u00b4 governed organizations. These are free for schools. Regarding other vulnerable groups like Roma, there are no special textbooks for Roma lear ners as the ethnic category is irrelevant because all people are equal. Pupils with special needs have the right to be provided with support measures free of charge. Measures include further adapted textbooks, specific teaching materials, compensatory and rehabilitation equipment and tools, and information and communication technology tools. Braille print is available for pupils who cannot read regular print. (CPRA p.14) c. Is there guidance/procedures to help schools to make learning materials accessible for all learners? (e.g. Braille/large print for learners with visual impairment, materials in other languages). No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description. Guidance to accessibility of learning materials is part of the support measures which free of any charge. Learners with SEN are legally entitled to receive compensatory aids, special textbooks and special teaching aids (e.g. the use of deaf and/or blind communication systems, Braille and supportive or alternative communication systems). (CPRA p 16) d. Is ICT used to improve access to materials for vulnerable groups? No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description. ICT tools and digital learning materials are used very widely for vulnerable learners. For teachers, MEYS operates a website with digital educational materials. The Czech School Inspectorate has prepared applications with databases of learning tasks (these are constantly being updated), computers and smartphones. It is verified by school principals that even economically endangered children have their own smartphones. e. Are there specific financial and practical resources available for textbooks/materials/ICT for different vulnerable groups? No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description. Yes, MEYS administers a grant title aimed at supporting textbooks and teaching materials and aids for vulnerable children every year. The possible causes of vulnerability are economic, social and cultural factors. All of the are considered to be special ed ucation needs by the Czech Education Act. There are support measures divided into 5 levels according to the financial and organisational demands involved. Levels 2 to 5 give access to financial support for special textbooks, teaching or compensatory aids. (Eurydice 2020. Educational Support and Guidance) 7.3 Assessment a. Is there a national/local assessment framework that includes all learners? No No information available Yes No further information is available. b. Is there guidance for teachers on how to use curriculum- based assessment to identify all learning needs in the classroom? No No information available Yes No further information is available. c. Is there guidance/procedures on providing acc ess to tests/examinations when learners need additional support/reasonable adjustments? (e.g. adapted materials, extra time etc.) No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description. Below is information on the type of support measure. However no relevant information was found about guidance or procedures on access to additional support. The Education Act describes the additional provisions and support measures that may be described in each pupil's individual educational plan. The support measures include, for example, additional teaching staff, additional teaching hours covering specific subjects such as sign language, speech therapy, reading and writing in Braille print, orientation and mobility training, guidance and counselling, a vailability of specific teaching materials, books, compensatory aids, specific assessment arrangements, etc. (National Overview p 3) a special education needs specialist (speci\u00e1ln\u00ed pedagog) who is particularly engaged in creating an inclusive climate at th e school, supporting the education of pupils with special education needs, especially pupils with health disadvantages, the timely identification of risk factors in the pupils development, performing pedagogical interventions in accordance with the recomm endations for pupils support, participating in the elaboration and fulfilment of the plans of pedagogical support, participating in the creation and fulfilment of individual educational plans, providing methodological help to school staff during the education of pupils with special education needs, and giving methodological assistance and support to pupils legal representatives in matters of education. (Eurydice 2020, Chapter 12. Counselling services at school) d. Are there specific arrangements and/or f ormal procedures to support the assessment of the specific needs of learners who need additional support in their learning? (e.g. those with disabilities) No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description, including clear informat ion on the focus of needs identification procedures and who is involved in the procedures (learners, parents, professionals): As a rule, it is the teacher who deals with a pupil's special needs, in co -operation with resource centres (special schools) and c ounselling services. Parents decide whether their child should undergo special needs assessment. Experts from the special educational and/or educational-psychological counselling centres consider the nature of a child's needs and make proposals for special support and provisions. According to the latest proposed amendment to the Education Act, the assessment bodies are responsible for indicating the degree/level of special educational support needed. The school's head teacher deals with developing the appro priate learning conditions for the pupil in need of additional support. (National overview, p 6 ) e. Is ICT used in the assessment of vulnerable groups? No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description. Not at the system level, not for all, but as mentioned above, the Czech School Inspectorate prepared applications for testing on computers and via smartphones. Of course, they also used vulnerable learners in schools. Every child has free access to downloa d the application and a wide database of tasks is accessible free of charge. Each task is evaluated automatically and feedback is widely available. Teachers can work freely with the application and with the database of tasks, it is especially important to provide the application to all students. Subsequently, it is possible to use this evaluation even in distance education. 7.4 Please provide information (main conclusions, reference and a link if available) on any recent reports, studies, evaluations and/o r reviews, since 2015 relating to issues around curricula, learning materials and assessment processes . Below are some selected main results from reports on literacies levels of pupils at primary and secondary schools from the school years 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. In the school year 2018/2019 was the subject of interest of the Czech School Inspectorate in the second evaluation of the development of language, science and information literacy in primary and secondary schools. The main goal of the evaluation was to assess the conditions, course and results of education in relation to the stated literacy, while the achieved level of selected aspects of language literacy was evaluated in pupils of the 4th year of elementary school, science literacy in pupils of the 8th year of elementary school and information literacy of pupils in the 3rd year of secondary school, including the corresponding years of multi-year grammar schools. Assessment is based on information from full -time assessment activities directly in s chools, from a sample survey of the achieved level of literacy of pupils carried out through an electronic inspection system testing. The average success rate of 8th grade pupils in the science literacy test was 43%, which was significantly less than the e xpected value of 60%. At the same time, about 5% of the tested students solved it a maximum of one fifth of the tasks. Difficulties faced them mainly in practice -oriented tasks requiring the application of scientific knowledge and skills in real situations . These reserves in knowledge and especially in the skills of students correspond to repeated previous ones findings of the Czech School Inspectorate, as well as with the findings obtained in the international PISA survey. The apprehension of science teaching proved to be the lowest in physics, especially in the case of primary schools, where it reached only about 70%. The highest average age of teachers given subjects was also recorded in physics, but this time in high schools (51 years). Although frequenc y of participation of science teachers in further education in the last two years (approx. 75 to 85%) can be assessed as positive, the presence of teachers in courses or seminars aimed at developing pupils 'skills is relatively infrequent. The lessons of t eachers approved for a given science subject are marked better organization, pupil interaction, work atmosphere, higher pupil activity or their better evaluation. Pupils in the 4th year of primary schools achieved a high average in the language literacy te st success rate of 92%, which indicates a very good mastery of the evaluated areas. He proves it too more than 90% of pupils whose result in the language literacy test falls into the category success rate 80 -100%. The most significant differences between t he groups of schools with the best and worst outcomes were observed in areas: the use of knowledge and skills from the real life of pupils and the connection of foreign language teaching with other educational fields; use of teaching aids in accordance wit h the objectives of teaching, including the use of interactive media and ICT technologies; creating a linguistically stimulating environment in which the pupil needs to actively use strangers language and in which the lesson is conducted in the target language; effective use of methods and forms of work in relation to the set goal of the lesson. Lessons in schools with better student outcomes were also more frequent observed higher level of assessment and feedback to pupils and a positive learning atmospher e. The proficiency in teaching English and German is relatively high in the case of secondary schools, on the contrary, the situation with approved foreign language teaching at the 2nd level of primary schools is worse, while in comparison with most other fields of education, the existing needs for ensuring approved foreign language teaching are slightly higher. Almost 85% of teachers and more than 90% of school heads consider social literacy as important as other skills that primary and secondary schools s eek to develop. They identified as at least as important a goal as the development of students' cognitive skills social literacy education even almost all principals and teachers. Pupils in the 9th grade of elementary school achieved an average success rat e of 54%, with a full 12% of pupils achieving a poor result (they solved less than two - fifths of the questions). One third of the pupils finished with an acceptable result (they managed over three fifths of the questions) and only 1% of the pupils with an excellent result (more than four fifths of the correctly answered questions). Pupils in the 2nd year of secondary school exceeded the limit of average success (63%), also only a relatively small group of pupils achieved a poor result (5%). Three -fifths of the pupils correctly solved more than three -fifths of the questions, 8% of the pupils achieved an excellent result. Pupils achieved the highest success in solving questions that presupposed knowledge of specific concepts and facts, or skills for solving the presented model situations. Less difficult were also tasks requiring knowledge of selected concepts and concepts related to the observed aspects of social literacy of students. On the contrary, the biggest problems for the students were the questions t hat required them to understand the content of a longer communication message or to recognize the essence of manipulative expression. When compared with the findings from the last survey of the Czech School Inspectorate in the field of reading literacy (sc hool year 2015/2016), it is clear that in many respects the situation has remained stable. Both 9th grade elementary school students and 2nd grade high school students solved the tasks requiring finding and understanding information in the text (average success rate per question 54% for elementary school students and 63% for high school students). Pupils were less successful in questions requiring the derivation of an answer based on their own judgment using the information in the given text (43% in primary schools, 52% in secondary schools). Pupils had the biggest problems in assessing the veracity of a particular statement in relation to the content of the text (20% in primary schools, 26% in secondary schools). The general idea of our society that mathema tics is not perceived as a predominantly popular subject was also confirmed by the thematic survey of the Czech School Inspectorate focused on for mathematical literacy in the school year 2017/2018. Over 60% of primary and more than 70% of high school stud ents disagree with the statement that they learn math because they enjoy it. And over 50% of elementary students and more than 60% of high school students take classes mathematics does not enjoy at all. However, the same survey showed that only 15% of prim ary school pupils do not consider mathematics to be important for their further study, while almost only a fifth of pupils. Primary schools believe that they will not learn much in mathematics to find a good job. In the case of secondary schools, however, it is already half of the addressed pupils. Also, the verification of the achieved level of mathematical literacy of pupils through tests of the Czech School Inspectorate brought results that sound better than the pupils' declared relationship to mathematics. The average success rate of pupils in the 9th grade of primary school was 69%, the set success rate was 60%. In addition, only 4% of pupils achieved a clearly poor result in the test (less than two - fifths solved questions). In contrast, 73% of pupils mastered more than three -fifths of the questions and more than one -fifth of the pupils achieved an excellent result (over four-fifths of the solved tasks). The average success rate of pupils in the 2nd year of secondary school was still 6 pp. bet ter, ie 75%. And only a very small group of high school students answered correctly less than two -fifths of the questions. On the contrary, more than four -fifths of pupils solved over three -fifths of the questions. At the same time, more than two -fifths of the pupils achieved an excellent result (more than four -fifths of the correct answers). Other details in inspection reports can be found at this site : https://www.csicr.cz/cz/DOKUMENTY/Tem aticke -zpravy 7.5 Overall, what are the perceived main challenges (barriers and hinderances) and opportunities (support and ways forward) for inclusion in education in relation to curricula, learning materials and assessment processes in the country? Challenges: The curriculum in the Czech Republic needs to be simplified, its requirements reduced and its focus on what is essential for the life and further education of pupils. The current curriculum overload (which arises mainly at the level of textbooks ra ther than at the level of the state curriculum itself) is the main challenge and it is important to manage this challenge very soon. Opportunities: The \"Long -Term Plan 2019-2023\" approved by the Government of the Czech Republic seeks to \"strive for the maximum development of potential of all children\". (Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, 2019. Long -term Plan for Education and the Development of t he Education System of the Czech Republic 23f.)

In order to support inclusion, teachers are supposed to participate in in -service training on acquiring the skills to deal with the diversity and various needs of pupils. (European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education (Website). Country Information for the Organisation of the system of inclusive education .) At present, all education staff is obligated to regularly undertake in - service professional learning over the course of their careers. Teachers are entitled to 12 days of leave fo r self- study purposes per year (Santiago et al., 2012). The cost of professional development may be covered by the school (fully or partly) or by the participating teachers themselves. (OECD, 2016. OECD Reviews of School Resources: Czech Republic 2016. p. 140.) The largest public training provider is the National Education Institute (since 2020 NPI, previously NIDV) which has 14 regional centres. It is funded by the ministry budget and the European Social Fund and many courses are provided to teachers at a low co st or free of charge. (OECD, 2016.

Others (please list add rows as required) a. If you answered no to any of the above, please provide further information: 8.3 Is education and training of teachers aligned with national policy goals on inclusive education? No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description. If no, please give further information: The Act on Educational Staff (563/2004) defines the qualifications of teachers working with children with special needs . University teacher training in special education or additional university training in special education is requested. All university teacher training programmes include modules on the education of pupils with special needs. Teachers who want to work as S EN counsellors and/or special teachers of pupils with special needs have to complete the five -year university master's programme in special education. (National Overview, p. 15) An amendment to the Education Act in force since September 2016 concerns the i ntegration of pupils with special education needs into mainstream schools (so called the inclusive education amendment). It emphasized the importance of the teacher's assistant profession. The teacher's assistant, who teaches personally in a class with children or pupils with special education needs or at schools providing education in the form of individual integration, must have at least a general secondary education with a Maturita examination (stedn\u00ed vzdl\u00e1n\u00ed s maturitn\u00ed zkoukou) and an appropriate ty pe of pedagogical education. (Eurydice, Chapter 9. Teachers and educational staff) 8.4 With respect to the main initial teacher education programmes, describe how inclusion in education is addressed in it (i.e. requirement for number of academic credits u nder European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS), subjects and topics covered, focus etc). The information available concerns only SEN and does not cover other skills in dealing with inclusion: Teachers who carry out direct educational activit y in classes or at schools for children or pupils with special education needs may obtain their qualification in the same way as other teachers of the given educational level and extend it through a Bachelor's degree, specialising in special education needs or through a lifelong learning study programme with the same focus. In the case of the first and the second stage of special basic schools (z\u00e1kladn\u00ed kola speci\u00e1ln\u00ed), teachers may obtain a qualification in a Master's study programme specialising in special needs pedagogy for teachers. Teachers at nursery schools (matesk\u00e9 koly) may qualify by studying special needs pedagogy at a higher education institution (studying programme focusing on the pre -school age also exists), however, a graduate of special ne ed pedagogy differently specialised can teach in the nursery as well). The content and scope of the curriculum of special needs training for teachers in classes or schools for children, pupils or students with special education needs (with disabilities) varies according to the type of a higher education institution (vysok\u00e1 kola) and the type of study. Compulsorily or optionally, it includes basic courses in patho - psychology, paediatrics, psychiatry, neurology, and in individual (etopaedia, logopaedia, surdopaedia, tyflopaedia, psychopaedia, and somatopaedia). Students can sometimes opt for a narrower area of specialisation. The curriculum generally also includes practical training in special classrooms/schools or at special needs facilities, and/or clinical training. (Eurydice; 9.1 Initial Education for Teachers Working in Early Childhood and School Education) 8.5 Please provide information (main conclusions, reference and a link if available) on any recent reports, evaluations and/or reviews, since 2015 relating to initial teacher education and/or professional development issues. The Czech Republic is faced with an aging population of school teachers, (with over 70% being 40 years or older), a shortage of qualified t eachers as well as teacher burn out and drop out. The teaching profession is not perceived as high status and is often the second career choice for students. Salaries are comparatively low. However, a new career system for teachers, linking professional de velopment, career and salaries was not adopted by parliament. Tom\u00e1 Dvo\u00e1k (Analysis of the challenges of education in the Czech Republic for the Educational Fu nd, the Educational Fund has been processed by Daniel Prokop S a VO (Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports educational Statistics, Analysis and Information Strategy Department Main deliverables from the emergency investigation the state of play of teaching teachers in M, Z, and VIP ) and Council of the European Union, 2018. Council Recommendation of 13 July 2018 on the 2018 National Reform Programme of the Czech Republic and delivering a Council opinion on the 2018 Convergence Programme of the Czech Republic (2018/C 320/03) . para. 13.) Low participation in continuous professional development is reportedly linked to a lack of incentives and low impact on careers as well as being of little relevance to teachers' needs. This relates particularly to differentiated types of teaching according to pupils' needs, poor (European Commission, 2019. Commission Staff Working Document: Country Report Czech Republic 2019 . SWD (2019) 1002 final. p. 30.) Teachers perceive the quality of the Czech teaching college as insufficient. They shall state the reasons why: Failure to prepare for real work with children and parents, teaching faculties rather demolition of future teach ers, excessive emphasis on general didactics, which have no practical application, and generally weak teaching practices at schools. Out of the current problems, teachers point out that teaching faculties do not prepare teachers to teach foreign nationals (for example: Meta) or the teaching of children with special learning needs (FG \u2014 teachers). (Daniel Prokop and Tom\u00e1 Dvo\u00e1k. Analysis of the challenges of education in the Czech Republic (Daniel Prokop and Tom\u00e1 Dvo\u00e1k. Analysis of the challenges of education the 11.) 8.6 Overall, what are the perceived main challenges (barriers and hinderanc es) and opportunities (support and ways forward) for inclusion in education in relation to teachers and support personnel in the country? Opportunities: The Act on Educational Staff (563/2004) defines the qualifications of teachers working with children w ith special needs. University teacher training in special education or additional university training in special education is requested. All university teacher training programmes include modules on the education of pupils with special needs. (CZ SRSP p 99 ) Significant opportunity is the implementation of system projects led by MEYS implemented within the ESIF (projects implemented between 2016 - 2022). Individual activities in these projects are implemented in the so -called K -L-I-M-A system (Learning Culture, Leadership, Inclusion, Mentoring, and Activating Forms of Learning). Projects contribute to setting pro -inclusive conditions in schools. They help pupils with special educational needs or the gifted to develop their full potential in act ively fulfilling tasks and solving situations that correspond to the level of their knowledge and skills (through activating forms of learning). The projects also include a significant component of capacity building (schools) across the regions of the Czec h Republic. Challenges: No evidence was found for a minimum requirement of inclusive education courses for teachers in mainstream education . Initial teacher education in the Czech Republic does not prepare teachers to work with learners with SEN. The MEY S aims to support existing teachers through effective career development programmes, to compensate for insufficient competencies in the area of support for learners with SEN. It will also be necessary to negotiate with teacher training faculties about reso lving the problem of teaching courses' syllabi and graduate teachers lacking in special education skills. (CPRA, p 4) The challenge is to ensure the sustainability of the funding system for support measures. The system is undergoing rationalization and it is necessary to ensure its greater addressability and sharing of available resources - use of the existing potential of services, tools, etc. Section 6: Schools How does the work of schools, school management and leadership impact on access, participation and provision of equitable opportunities for all learners? 9.1 Who is excluded from attending any form of school? Please give reasons for this group being excluded from attending school and describe any form of alternative provision made for them? The education system in the Czech Republic is set up so that no one is excluded from education. However, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities notes with concern in their 2015 report, that in spite of efforts made, significant numbers of boys and girls with disabilities, especially those with intellectual disabilities and autism and those who are deaf -blind, still receive their education in special schools and classes, outside of mainstream schools (Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2015, p.6). Additionally, international comparative research studies (PISA 2012, PIAAC and REFLEX 2013) present evidence of a strong dependency of school performance on the pupils' family background and the quality of s chool they attend (i.e. tracking pupils into selective and non-selective schools based on family background). According to the 2020 Strategy this has also been increasingly noted by the general public. ( Country Dossier. Working Document for the Czech Repub lic SRSP Action. p 17) 9.2 Are there issues around the over - and under -representation of different vulnerable groups in different school settings? No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description and provide any data/evidence that is available The Government of the Czech Republic is making effective efforts to ensure exceptionally fair access to quality education and support to fairly support the chances of all pupils through a significant allocation from the stat e budget, and that overall progress towards full enforcement in the case of D.H. and more vs. Czech Republic. In recent years, the Czech Republic has been systematically striving to reduce inequalities in school education. It focuses in particular on adequate and effective compensation of all forms of disadvantage of pupils with an emphasis on the individualization of the support provided and on strengthening the inclusive elements of the school system. Measures to support the education of Roma pupils, although they have some specifics, are an integral part of this approach. The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports carries out a survey of qualified estimates of school principals about the number of Roma pupils, and the Ministry has been implementing it at all primary schools since the 2016/17 school year. In 2019, there were a total of 952,946 pupils in primary schools, which is 44,758 more than in 2016 (906,188 pupils). In 2019, a total of 33,768 Roma pupils were counted by qualified estimates, ie 977 Rom a pupils more than in 2016 and 999 less than in 2018. Numbers of schools with significant proportions of Roma pupils In schools with more than 34% of Roma pupils, the number of these schools decreased year -on-year from 147 (2018) to 133 (2019) and the nu mber of Roma pupils in these schools decreased by 3.2%. The highest share of Roma pupils educated in these schools was in the \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem Region (4,127), the Moravian-Silesian Region (2,927) and the South Moravian Region (1,044). In schools with mor e than 50% Roma pupils, the number of these schools decreased year -on-year from 70 (2018) to 69 (2019) and the number of Roma pupils in these schools increased by 1.8%. The highest share of Roma pupils educated in these schools was in the \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem Region (2,633) and the Moravian-Silesian Region (2,061). In schools with more than 75% Roma pupils, the number of these schools increased year -on-year from 31 (2018) to 34 (2019) and the number of Roma pupils in these schools decreased by 4.4%. The hig hest share of Roma pupils educated in these schools was in the \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem Region (1,991) and the Moravian-Silesian Region (1,876). In schools with more than 90% Roma pupils, the number of these schools increased year -on-year from 13 (2018) to 16 (2019) and the number of Roma pupils in these schools increased by 14.1%. The highest share of Roma pupils educated in these schools was in the \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem Region (1,451) and the Moravian-Silesian Region (1,355). In the above -mentioned categories of sch ools with more than 34% and more than 50% of Roma pupils, the number was reduced by a total of 15 schools. In the above -mentioned categories of schools with more than 75% and with more than 90% of Roma pupils, the number increased by a total of 6 schools . According to the 2015 Analysis of Socially Excluded Localities, 606 socially excluded localities were identified in a given year. The total number of localities thus almost doubled compared to 2006 (from 310 to 606). In absolute numbers, the \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem and Moravian-Silesian regions have long dominated in the number of socially excluded localities. As part of the preparation of the Report on the Status of the Roma Minority for 2018, the regional coordinators for Roma affairs provided estimates of the development of the number of socially excluded localities in their region. According to these estimates, in 2018 there were over 830 socially excluded localities in the Czech Republic. According to the estimates from the Czech Agency for Social Inclusion, approximately 80 -85% of Roma live in socially excluded localities. Estimates of the number of Roma pupils in individual schools and in individual regions cannot therefore be responded to in the future only by instruments of educational policy, but a supra-m inisterial coordinated approach will be necessary. 9.3 Please give details on the main admissions criteria for schools. a. Highlight any issues with the national polices. The Education Act requires the municipality to ensure a place in a nursery school for a child with a permanent residence in the municipality who reaches at least 3 years before the beginning of the school year. Where schools set their own admissions criter ia, please outline any impact on inclusion. The compulsory pre -primary education applies to a child from the beginning of the school year (September) following the child's 5th birthday until the commencement of the compulsory school attendance. In general, it takes on year, in case of postponement of the compulsory school attendance two years. The legal guardian of a child is obliged to register the child. The enrolment proceeding takes place between 2nd and 16th May. It is up to the school head as a stat e administration body (an organising body must not intervene) whether he/she admits the child to the school. Admission is realised through administrative proceedings. Children are admitted on the basis of written consent by the legal guardian, which is submitted to the school head together with reference to the health state of a child and confirmation about proper vaccination by a general practitioner for children and the youth (for children being registered to compulsory education the confirmation is not r equired). The school head admit preferentially children listed in the Education Act, i.e. children older than 3 years (for more see above). For other children, he/she may specify certain criteria which must not be in contradiction to generally binding regulations, must not be discriminatory and must not violate children's rights. For example, the criterion disadvantaging children whose parents are on maternity (parental) leave with a younger sibling is regarded discriminatory. General rejection on acceptanc e of a disabled child to a nursery school is regarded as direct discrimination (for more see also below). The decision not to accept the child must be properly and thoroughly justified. The school head decides on the admission of a child with a disability on the basis of a written report of a school guidance and counselling facility and on the basis of signing an informed consent by legal deputy of the child or by an adult pupil. (Eurydice, 2020. Early Childhood Education and Care). Admission to compulsory basic education is decided by the school principal under the following conditions: 1. The place and time of enrolment in the first year of basic education shall be determined by the school principal, in accordance with \u00a7 36 par. 4 of the Education Act, and shall be announced in the usual manner in the place. Admission to basic education is decided by the school principal under the following conditions: Fulfilment of the obligation of school attendance 2. School attendance is compulsory for a period of nine school years, but not later than the end of the school year in which the pupil reaches the age of seventeen (hereinafter referred to as \"compulsory school attendance\"). 3. Compulsory school attendance applies to citizens of the Czech Republic and to citizens of another Member State of the European Union who have resided in the Czech Republic for more than 90 days. Furthermore, compulsory school attendance applies to other foreigners who are entitled to stay in the Czech Republic permanently or te mporarily for a period longer than 90 days, and to participants in proceedings for granting international protection11). 4. Compulsory schooling begins at the beginning of the school year following the day on which the child reaches the age of six, unless he or she is granted a deferral. A child who reaches the age of six between September and the end of June of the relevant school year may be admitted to compulsory school attendance already in that school year, if he / she is reasonably physically and ment ally advanced and if his / her legal representative so requests. The condition for the admission of a child born in the period from September to the end of December to fulfil compulsory school attendance according to the second sentence is also a recommendation of the school counselling facility; representative. 5. The legal representative is obliged to register the child for compulsory school attendance in the period from 1 April to 30 April of the calendar year in which the child is to start compulsory sc hool attendance. 6. A pupil fulfils compulsory school attendance at a primary school established by a municipality or association of municipalities with a seat in the school district (\u00a7 178 para. 2) in which the pupil has a place of permanent residence, in the case of a foreigner the pupil's place of residence (hereinafter \"catchment school\") , unless the legal representative chooses a school other than the catchment area for the pupil. If a child is admitted to a school other than the catchment school, the principal of this school shall notify the principal of the catchment school no later than the end of May of the calendar year in which the child is to start compulsory schooling. 7. A pupil placed in a school facility for institutional or protective education or in a school facility for preventive educational care fulfils compulsory school attendance in a primary school established at this school facility or in a primary school established by a municipality or association of municipalities located in the s chool district, in where the relevant school facility is located, or in another school established by the state, region, municipality or association of municipalities. 8. The headmaster of a catchment school is obliged to give priority to pupils with a pla ce of permanent residence in the relevant school district and pupils placed in this district in a school facility for institutional education, protective education or in a school facility for preventive educational care, up to the permitted number of pupil s. listed in the school register. 9. The municipal authority of the municipality in whose territory the school district of the primary school is located shall provide the school with a list of children for whom this school is a catchment and to whom the ob ligation under paragraph 4 applies. , or names, and surname, date of birth and address of the child 's place of permanent residence, in the case of a foreigner, the child' s place of residence. 9.4 Please provide information on the different forms of supp ort that are available to learners in schools. a. Inclusive pedagogy, personalised learning and universal design approaches No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description. The Education Act guarantees that the provisions and services required for supporting the access to education of pupils with special needs are available to children and/or pupils at all levels of education, no matter where the child is educated (mainstream and/or special settings). Pupils with special needs have the right to be provided with additional support provisions free of charge. A child, pupil and student with special educational needs is a person who needs to be provided with support measures to fulfil his or her educational opportunit ies or to exercise his or her rights on an equal basis with others. Support measures are necessary adjustments in education and school services corresponding to the health, cultural environment or other living conditions of a child, pupil or student. Children, pupils and students with special educational needs have the right to free support measures by schools and school facilities. According to the law, the support measures consist of a) counselling assistance of the school and school counselling facility, b) adjustment of the organization, content, evaluation, forms and methods of education and school services, including the provision of teaching subjects of special pedagogical care and including the extension of the length of secondary or higher vocational education by up to two years, c) adjustment of the conditions of admission to education and completion of education, d) the use of compensatory aids, special textbooks and special teaching aids, the use of communication systems for the deaf and deafblind11a), Braille and supporting or alternative communication systems, e) adjustment of expected educational outcomes within the limits set by framework educational programs and accredited educational programs, f) education according to an individual education al plan, g) use of a teaching assistant, h) the use of another pedagogical worker, Czech sign language interpreter, transcriber for the deaf or the possibility of working for persons providing support to a child, pupil or student during his / her stay in a school or school facility according to special legal regulations, or (i) the provision of education or school services in construction or technical premises. Support measures are divided into five levels according to organizational, pedagogical and financial demands. Additional staff are available, as well as individual educational plans which describe the conditions necessary for successful learning when dealing with a pupil with special needs. The education process of pupils with special needs is differentiated, individualised and adapted so that it is tailored to meet pupils' needs and their diversity. (National Overview p 2) b. counselling and mentoring possibilities No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description. The in-service teacher training, counselling and guidance system has an important role in developing inclusive education. The multi-disciplinary teams in pedagogical and psychological counselling centres provide counselling and guidance support. These teams consist of psychologists, special education teachers, speech therapists and social workers. They co -operate with professionals from other sectors, such as medical doctors and professionals from the area covering the family/child social care. Close co -opera tion with parents and class teachers is essential. (National Overview p 2) School counselling facilities are an integral part of the education system in the Czech Republic. School counselling facilities provide for children, pupils and students and their legal representatives, for schools and school facilities information, diagnostic, counselling and methodological activities, provide professional special pedagogical and pedagogical- psychological services, preventive educational care and assist in choosing appropriate education for children, pupils or students and preparation for future occupations. School counselling facilities cooperate with social and legal protection bodies for children and youth and family care bodies, health care providers, or with other bodies and institutions. c. input from specialist teachers/therapists No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description. The involvement of specialist teachers / therapists is within the competence of the school principals. See 6.4.a above d. input from learning support assistants No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description. Inputs from learning support assistants are continuously widely used. On the basis of the recommendation of a school guidance and counselling facility, an additional teacher may be taken on - a teachers assistant (asistent pedagoga ) - who works in classes, where there is (are) a pupil (s) with special education needs. The teaching assistant is part of the suppo rt measures that help in the integration of pupils with special education needs into the educational process and activities in and outside the classroom. The assistant also works with the other pupils in the class, following the instructions of the teacher . Teachers assistant can support a pupil or more pupils at the same time, but at most 4 pupils in class with regard to special education needs of these pupils. Pupils are eligible to a teachers assistant from the third support measure. In case the school s are established for specified type of health disability (according to section 16, paragraph 9 of the Education Act), the number of pupils per teachers assistant can be greater. A higher number of pupils per teachers assistant can also be the case if fo r legal reasons there are more than 5 pupils in mainstream class with granted support measure from the second to fifth level. (Eurydice 2020, 12- Education support and guidance) e. availability of ICT / assistive technology No No information availab le Yes If yes, please give a description. The individual educational plan is a binding document for ensuring pupils special education needs. It defines among other things compensation and teaching aids, such as ICT equipment. (Eurydice 2020, 12 - Educa tion support and guidance) f. Please describe any other forms of support available. The support measures cover a wide range of pedagogical, organisational, and content modifications to education and the provision of school services. They include: reinforcing of the education staff - one more teacher, teachers assistant, sign language interpreter, transcriber consulting assistance and support for schools and school counselling facilities modifications of conditions assessment and fo rms and methods of education adjustment of conditions for admission to schools and completion of education subjects of special pedagogical care additional special educational or educational interventions the use of Braille, alternative forms of communication, sign language, compensatory aids and ICT assistance extension of the duration of education education according to a plan of pedagogical support, education following an individual educational plan fewer pupils in the class The support measures are divided into 5 levels according to the financial and organisational demands involved. (Eurydice 20 20, 12- Education support and guidance) 9.5 Please give a description of the strategies in place for practically supporting mainstream school staff teams to increase their capacity to be inclusive and to improve access, participation and achievement for a ll learners. Strategy Description of the focus Long -term Plan for Education and the Development of the Education System of the Czech Republic (2019- 2023) Has one objective in relation to support mainstream school staff: more money for quality teachers' work Targeted development grant programmes ap proved in 2019 They focus on Equipping school guidance and counselling facilities with diagnostic tools in 2019 Funding of teachers' assistants Support an increase in the capacity of school guidance and counselling centres in 2019 (Eurydice 2020, Ongoing reforms and policy developments) Strategy of Education Policy until 2030+ The deepest problem in Czech education is inequality. The forthcoming Strategy of Education Policy until 2030+ responds to this. One of the two main strategic goals is to reduce educational inequalities and increase equity in access to education. So far, a working document Main Guidelines for the Educational Policy of the Czech Republic 2030+ has been prepared, which is to define the vision, priorities and goals of educatio nal policy in the period beyond 2030. In the course of 2020, it should be approved by the Government of the Czech Republic. 9.6 Please provide information regarding school buildings and infrastructure. a. Are there schools that face infrastructure issues that are barriers to inclusion? No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description and provide information on what barriers, how they are monitored and any data/evidence that is available. Data from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2014 show that special classes or schools often have substandard infrastructure. ( European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2014. Roma survey - Data in focus. Education: the situation of Roma in 11 EU Member States . p. 46 .) Schools are continuously being rebuilt to meet the spec ial education needs of physically handicapped pupils. Investments by the state and school founders in this infrastructure have enabled real systemic change. b. Are there strategies and/or initiatives to improve school buildings and infrastructure? No No information available Yes If yes, please describe the strategies, their aim and focus. Strategy Description of the focus The Integrated Regional Operational Programme (IROP) - governed by the Ministry of Regional Development - Provides a system for investments and infrastructure (extra calls for schools in regions with high risk of social exclusion; capacity -building within pre-schools and leisure -time centres; calls for schools to support mainstream education and social inclusion). (CPRA p 24) ... 9.7 Please provide information (main conclusions, reference and a link if available) from any recent reports, systematic evaluations and/or reviews, since 2015 of the school system, potentially drawing on information from school inspections and / or school self -review work. In 2016, the Czech Republic implemented amendments to the Education Act of 2015 (Act No. 82 /2015 Coll.) (European Agency, 2018a). The 2016 reform for inclusive education was supported by the European Social Fund (ESF). The reform was generally welcomed by NGOs and experts, although less by teachers and the public. An evaluation carried out by the Czech School Inspectorate in 2017 indicated that the reform has improved support for pupils with special needs in mainstream education. However, the heavy administrative burden on schools was identified as a drawback and the funding requested by schools for support measures was higher than expected. A 2018 amendment of the implementing decree may put the spirit of the law at risk by enabling special schools to open classes for children without mental disabilities but with behavioural/learning difficulties . This could, according to the report, create new forms of social segregation (European Commission, 2018a, p.7). In accordance with the Education Act, the Czech School Inspectorate publishes an annual report for the school year 2018/2019, which contains su mmary information on the state of education and the education system in the Czech Republic. Conclusions and recommendations for basic education: Positive findings Very good material conditions prevail, supporting the effectiveness of the educational proc ess and the fulfilment of the SEP. The constant effort to improve them with the investments of the founders is confirmed, as well as the use of other financial resources, such as the use of grant and project programs. Public spending on basic education i s increasing. The average number of pupils per class in primary schools is favourable in the long run, it varies with around 20 pupils, which is a good precondition for the individualisation of education. The joint education of pupils of different talents and pupils with SEN in mainstream is supported classes. Most schools follow the recommendations of school counselling facilities and implement plans pedagogical support for pupils with SEN to the necessary extent. Based on the knowledge and evaluation of the composition of school pupils and their needs, schools determine and implement a system of their own support activities. Effective cooperation with the founder and other partners has a positive impact on development pupils' affiliat ion with the community and to support leisure activities. Further education of pedagogical staff is focused on subjects provided by teachers they teach. The exchange of information on teaching methods and forms is improving, including awareness of didact ic materials for teaching within schools. The cooperation of a teacher and a teacher's assistant during teaching is usually beneficial and supports the effectiveness of classroom teaching. Schools implement project activities, thus strengthening interdisciplinary relationships. They support participation of pupils in competitions. In schools that seek to work together within the teaching staff, efficiency is improving and the effectiveness of methods and forms of education. The inc reasing variety of forms of work is evident especially in the first stage of elementary school. Negative findings Spatial and material conditions in some schools do not allow full education due to insufficient equipment of vocational classrooms and physi cal education equipment (eg gym, playground, sports ground). Schools are usually not equipped with barrier -free access. The number of schools whose SEP has been assessed at a level requiring improvement has increased. Formal the method of processing conc eptual documents of the school does not allow efficiently and systematically identify means and tools for fulfilling the set goals. The average age of school principals is increasing. In 10% of auditions, the founders did not respect the competition fo r the position of primary school principal recommendation of the bankruptcy commission. The number of schools in which the pedagogical management of the school needs to be improved is increasing. Self - evaluation mechanisms are not implemented comprehensively and effectively, adequate measures are not taken to improve the conditions, course and results of education at the school level. There is a lack of professional guidance of individual teachers, systematic feedback on the quality of teaching with any appropriate support measures for its improvement. It is not consistent the quality of work of methodological bodies and counselling workplaces in the school is evaluated. The number of schools in which methodological bodies function only formally and do not strengthen is increasing professional communication between teachers within the school. The accumulation of the functions of the school prevention methodology and the educational counsellor, or the performance of these activities by the school management, has a negative impact on the quality of work and creating a favourable environment within the school. The trend of declining professional qualifications and providing teaching by certified teachers continues. At the same time, the gap between the regions with the highest and lowest share of qualifications is widening. Insufficient inclusion of activating (eg cooperative, action) methods and forms of teaching, minimal use of visual aids, including didactic techniques negatively affects the quality of the educational process, especially at the 2nd level of elementary school. Missing effective conclusions of lessons with a summary of the curriculum and verification of the fulfilment of the educational goals reduce the effectiveness of teaching. Due to the low degree of individualisation and differentiation of the course of education, the potential of pupils, including gifted and exceptionally gifted pupils, is not used. Pupil motivation is not supported. Most teachers are not yet able to use the potential of evaluation to increase motivating students as owners of their learning (formative assessment) does not support students for self -assessment and mutual evaluation. Schools do not work well with the results of national and international surveys at the level schools 9.8 Overall, what are the perceived main challenges (barriers and hinderances) and opportunities (support and ways forward) for inclusion in education in relation to schools in the country? Opportunities: The Education Act implemented a curricular reform in J anuary 2005. Since September 2007, all schools in the Czech Republic have been implementing their own school education programmes, which have to reflect the organisation of education in light of the diversity of pupils and their needs in the class. The pro cess started with first grade classes. The MEYS supports schools in this implementation process by training teachers and head teachers and providing guidance, counselling and the required resources. The co -ordinators of the implementation process at the sc hool level receive training and schools are given guidance and support (CPRA p 29). The Czech Government adopted the Action Plan for Inclusive Education 2016 -2018 in 2015. The updated version for 2019- 2020 (AP 2019- 2020) contains: To support pedagogues in more broadly accepting and implementing inclusive and democratic principles in education -different forms of further education for pedagogues. To strengthen competencies of school management in the field of inclusive education implementation - redesign t he curricula for school management qualification. The system for further education of pedagogical staff (DVPP) aims to support school leaders in the application of legislation on inclusive education and its changes, to communicate with parents of pupils wi th SEN, to improve the accessibility of school environments and to work with hidden curricula. To raise competencies of teachers and school counsellors in the implementation of inclusive education - strengthen their capacity to accept and apply individualisation in education. (CPRA p 13) Challenges: The labour market in the Czech Republic does not offer enough special education teachers and psychologists to deal with learners' SEN. One possible way of providing professional support to learners with SEN is the professionalisation of a high number of teaching assistants. Initial teacher education in the Czech Republic does not prepare teachers to work with learners with SEN. The MEYS aims to support existing teachers through effective career development programmes, to compensate for insufficient competencies in the area of support for learners with SEN. It will also be necessary to negotiate with teacher training faculties about resolving the problem of teaching courses' syllabi and graduate t eachers lacking in special education skills. Support for learners with SEN, including learners with moderate or severe intellectual disabilities and others, comes (almost exclusively) from teaching staff. However, some activities are not primarily teaching. The MEYS aims to find an effective sharing model for staff within the education, social services and health care departments who work with learners with SEN. This would ensure that all learners' needs are met and that state budget funds are effectively spent on professional (teaching) positions in cases and activities where they are needed. (CPRA p 4) Section 7: Communities, parents and students How far does the wider school community support learners to access and benefit from education opportunities? 10.1 Have there been any campaigns to raise awareness of inclusion in education at national or local level? No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description. The call Inclusive education for KPSVL II (Co -ordinated approach to socially excluded areas) focuses on promoting inclusive education specifically on the territory of socially excluded localities. The call stresses awareness- raising activities aimed at the public and supports the development of platforms and or ganising workshops for various stakeholders in education (Eurydice, 2019. National Reforms in School Education.) The Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 aim at raising Roma parents' awareness of the opportunities and benefits of pre -school education (placement of the child in kindergarten as a priority before the preparatory year) and provide parents' support for the plac ement of children in early childhood education, both through systemic measures and through cooperation among non- profit organisations, municipalities and parents from an early age. (Government Office of the Czech Republic, 2015. Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020. (Strategie romsk\u00e9 integrace do roku 2020) . p. 48.) The preparatory phase for the Education Policy Strategy until 2030+ has so far included public conferences and round tables, including in individual regions. One of the two strategic goals of the overall strategy is to reduce educational inequalities and increase equity in access to education. 10.2 Does legislation/policy support parental involve ment in schools? No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description. Building parental relationships is an important part of educational policy. The latest Amendment to the Education Act guarantees the right of parents/learners to request that the result of the special needs assessment and recommendation of the support prov ision procedures be revised (National Overview, 2018). The system for further education of pedagogical staff (DVPP) aims to support school leaders in the application of legislation on inclusive education and its changes, to communicate with parents of pupils with SEN, to improve the accessibility of school environments and to work with hidden curricula. (CPRA p 13) Any support measures provided to a pupil with special educational needs must be accompanied by the informed consent of the child's legal guardian. It can then also be provided on the basis of informed consent. 10.3 Does legislation/policy support collaboration between schools and stakeholders in their local communities (e.g. services/employers)? No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description. The Action Plan for Inclusive Education 2019 -2020 establishes strategic methods for the implementation of inclusive education managed and granted by the MEYS. It includes measures on infor mation, data and open communication with experts, the public and other national and local stakeholders, and on involving schools, pedagogues and every pupil. The Strategy for Education Policy of the Czech Republic until 2020 states how each region will manage the implementation of inclusive education in particular areas. Each region should also have an action plan at the end. The document summarises the situation around equal opportunities in education, the main actors and stakeholders, a plan of key steps and a time schedule. Local Action Plans aim to support joint planning and sharing of activities in the local area. They encourage the cooperation of founders, schools and other actors in education, including non- formal education organisations. (CPRA p 19) 10.4 Does legislation/policy support the development of learning communities in local/regional areas e.g. support for schools to work together; involvement with universities, support services to provide research evidence and development of innovative practice? No No information available Yes If yes, please give a description. No evidence was found for clearly defined strategies, including working within wider learning communities, in order to increase the capacity of all schools to meet a greater diversity of needs. (Ongoing work of the SRSP project Addressing regional disparities in the Czech education system). Development of learning communities in local / regional areas e.g. support for schools to work together is stron gly supported by ESF funded projects, not by legislation. Schools are very autonomous in the Czech Republic. Networking of schools is stimulated by rather soft tools. 10.5 Does legislation/policy set out a role for NGOs, DPOs, or other organisations representing vulnerable groups? No No information available Yes If yes, please describe the role. Specify which non -governmental actors are particularly active in inclusion in education and how they operate. The Czech Government ado pted the Action Plan for Inclusive Education 2016 -2018 in 2015. The updated version for 2019 -2020 (AP 2019- 2020) stresses a multi- level policy framework. Concrete measures aim not only at national level, but also local. It therefore works with different actors - universities, non- government organisations (NGOs), state administration and its bodies. (CPRA p 24) Civil society organisations play a crucial role with respect to social inclusion of the Roma as well. Currently there are 47 civil organisations evidenced in the country which are dealing with Roma: 16 are active mainly in education, 10 in culture, 9 in human rights, 8 in leisure activities, 2 in counselling and 2 as political subjects/associations. In addition, many other NGOs and civil associations participate in practical activities of social Inclusion of the Roma - as coordinators or service providers in projects financed from EU funds or government resources. The civic associations play a pivotal role in promoting awareness of the issue of Roma social exclusion, in defending human and civil rights and in fighting against discrimination.\" (Promoting Soci al Inclusion of Roma. A Study of National Policies. Sirovatka (2011) p. 30 -31). The FXB Center for Health and Human Rights (2015) takes a much more critical approach stating that \"In an environment, such as the Czech Republic, in which the government education system lacks the political will to facilitate an environment of inclusive education, the NGO community practically is left as the sole actor in ensuring equality. As a result, NGOs often take a comprehensive approach to community development to addr ess the wide array of needs of the students and families.\" NGOs and DPOs are important partners of MEYS in the preparation of legislative changes. With NGOs and DPOs, MEYS discusses the substantive intentions of amendments to laws and decrees, takes into a ccount their suggestions and, in addition to the usual procedures, invites NGOs and DPOs to comment on the resulting draft amendments to laws and decrees and takes their suggestions into account in final texts. 10.6 Please provide information (main conclu sions, reference and a link if available) from any recent reports, systematic evaluations and/or reviews, since 2015 of parental and wider community involvement in the work of schools. The importance of co -operation with parents and other actors in education is recognised and encouraged at policy level and a European Social Fund (ESF) Programme supports local networking and co -operation. However, no evidence of guidelines that support formal or informal networks were found. Altogether the efforts to involve parents are low, compared with other OECD countries. (Addressing regional disparities in the Czech education system. (2019. Unpublished. p 167) School -based early school leaving policies should include collaborative approaches, the active involvement of parents, partnerships with external stakeholders and the community, measures to support the well- being of pupils and high- quality guidance and counselling, ensuring that each pupil has an equal chance to access, participate in and benefit from high- quality education and enabling all learners to reach their full potential. (Council of the EU and European Commission, 2015. 2015 Joint Report of the Council a nd the Commission on the implementation of the strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training . p. 28.) Various school councils reported little involvement in processes such as school development planning and external and internal school evaluations. Also, school councils did not always seem aware of their right to prevent the contract renewal of school principals or suggest their dismissal, and the school council's involvement in the selection of their school principal seemed weak. (OECD, 2016. OECD Reviews of School Resources: Czech Republic 2016. p. 181.) The Czech School Inspectorate evaluated 84.5% of the monitored schools as a friendly and safe place for children, their parents and teachers (Annual report, school year 2018/2019). The Czech School Inspectorate, for example, recommended that schools take timely preventive measures to reduce the high number of children with delayed school attendance through systematic and functional diagnostics, or early intervention in cooperation with parents and, if necessary, in cooperation with school counselling facilities. And further implement educational activities that effectively support the personal development of children before entering eElementary schools, for example: speech therapy prevention, implementation of educationally stimulating groups in cooperation with parents, experimentation and research learning, development of creativity, etc. With regard to primary schools, the Czech School Inspectorate found, for example, that the frequency of individual types of measures taken by schools to reduce overall high absences and unexcused absences shows that school principals, as in previous years, consider cooperation with pupils' parents to be the most effective contracts), an educational counsellor and prevention methodology, the Department of Social and Legal P rotection of Children and school counselling facilities. Cooperation with parents is therefore perceived as highly relevant. Schools were then advised to strive to create a communication platform for all relevant actors. Especially however, with an emphasis on the teacher, parents, and student. Furthermore, to prevent the occurrence of risky behaviour of pupils by early prevention. In the case of some Due to the social composition of pupils, schools also offer to motivate parents. Consider involving a schoo l assistant or social educator. At the system level, the Czech School Inspectorate recommended in its annual report for 2018/2019 to build capacity for the professional development of teachers, especially in structurally disadvantaged regions. Improve the offer of education for choirs in key topics, such as cooperation between teachers and teaching assistants, development of reading and mathematical literacy, development of pupils 'social skills, support of teachers' competences for respectful communication and coping with problem situations in dealing with parents , classroom management and education of pupils with behavioural disorders and gifted pupils. 10.7 Overall, what are the perceived main challenges (barriers and hinderances) and opportunities (support and ways forward) for inclusion in education in relation to communities, parents and students in the country? Opportunities: Parents are perceived as partners and co -workers and have the opportunity to become active participants in school life (National Programme for the Development of Education in the Czech Republic, White Paper, 2001). (European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education, 2019. Country Policy Review and Analysis: Czech Republic . p. 18.) Challenges: There are differences in the level of opportunities, the conditions for education and the aspirations for learning, significantly pre -determined in particular with the family environment and the very early, external differentiation of pupils in the education system. (Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, 2019. Long- term Plan for Education and the Development of the Education System of the Czech Republic 2019 2023). p. 73.) Schools are increasingly divided into school pupils from well- educated and motivated families, where pupils are performing well, and schools visited by pupils from a less challenging environment with poor results. This separate socialisation of the different groups of pupils can have a very negative impact on the cohesion of the whole of t he Czech society. (Czech School Inspectorate, 2018. Report on options for monitoring on inclusive access at school level ( Zpr\u00e1va o \u00farovni koly). p. 11.) "}
