Founded in 1947 by Sidney Farber, MD, Dana-Farber is renowned for its unique blend of basic and clinical research and for using its discoveries to improve the treat- ment of adults and children with cancer and related diseases. It is a founding member of the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center - one of 41 nationally designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers. A teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber is also one of 21 federal Centers for AIDS Research in the United States, and is consistently ranked one of the top cancer centers in the country by U.S. News & World Report. In addition, it has earned \"Magnet\" status for excellence in nursing. Dana-Farber partners with Brigham and Women' s Hospital to deliver care for adults with cancer through Dana-Farber/ Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center. It also has a long- standing alliance with Boston Children' s Hospital to care for pediatric cancer patients through Dana-Farber/Children' s Hospital Cancer Center. By bringing together the strengths of three world-class institutions, these partnerships provide an exceptional level of care for cancer patients and their families. ... and the Jimmy Fund The Jimmy Fund (www.JimmyFund.org) solely supports Boston' s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, raising funds for adult and pediatric cancer care and research to improve the chances of survival for cancer patients around the world. This year celebrates the 60th anniversary of the Jimmy Fund and Boston Red Sox relationship, and represents one of the most remarkable partnerships between a team and a charity in the history of professional sports. The Jimmy Fund is also the official charity of the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association, the Pan-Massachusetts Challenge, and the Variety Children' s Charity of New England. Since 1948, the generosity of millions of people has helped the Jimmy Fund save countless lives and reduce the burden of cancer for patients and families worldwide.

For too many patients, for too many years, that hope failed to materialize. Improved therapies didn't arrive quickly enough to help patients in need of them. In recent years, however, as we've learned more about the basic biology of cancer and moved ever more agents into clinical testing, that pattern has begun to change. Increasingly, when a drug fails to work or loses its effectiveness after a period of months or years, there are new treatments available, often as part of a clinical trial. It is in this regard that cancer is gradually changing from an acute disease to a chronic one - one that can be lived with, and carefully managed, for the long term. There may be no one in medicine whose career better exemplifies this trend than Dana-Farber' s Ken Anderson, MD, PhD, profiled in this issue of Paths of Progress. Specializing in the bone marrow cancer multiple myeloma - and leader of a lab with a prodigious scientific output - Ken has often told patients that if they aren't helped by a particular therapy, he' s working on new agents in the lab that may work better. His suc-cess has helped turn a disease that once was almost invariably fatal to one that is, for some patients, a chronic condition. Ken' s work is a model, and an inspiration, for researchers in many other types of cancer. One example is glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer which, as you'll read in this issue, is a focus of intense effort at Dana-Farber to identify molecular targets for new therapies. The search for new treatments also motivates scientists' efforts to distinguish \"driver\" genetic mutations, which propel the growth of cancer cells, from \"passenger\" mutations, which are bystanders to the cancer process - the subject of another article. Y our interest in, and support of, our work at Dana-Farber is what makes these advances possible. I hope you find this issue of Paths of Progress enlightening and intriguing.Dear Readers, Edward J.

The drug' s active ingredient (leup- rolide) blocks the body' s production of the male hormone testosterone and the female hormone estradiol. metabolite: A substance created by or used for metabolism (when the body breaks down food, drugs or chemicals to create energy and the materials needed for growth, devel-opment, and reproduction). osteosarcoma: A bone cancer that most often affects the large bones of the arm or leg. It tends to occur in young people and affect more males than females. CANCER DICTIONARY Garber Gets Nod from White House Judy Garber, MD, MPH, director of the Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center, was recently appointed to the National Cancer Advisory Board by President Barack Obama. She will serve a six-year term on the 18-member committee, which advises the Department of Health and Human Services secretary and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The committee reviews applications for grants and recommends approval of applications for projects that demonstrate potential for valuable contributions to cancer research and knowledge. In her work at Dana-Farber, Garber has helped develop national guidelines in genetics testing and medical oncology. Her research includes the study of breast cancer risk assessment, cancer genetics, and the treatment of triple- negative breast cancer.

The findings come from the latest Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer . Dana-Farber President and CEO Edward J. Benz Jr., MD, says that while improvements are needed, the results are encouraging. \"People are surviving more and we are getting better at pre- venting some cancers,\" said Benz. \"But we're not taking advantage of all the ways to detect cancers at an early stage when they can be the most curable.\" The overall cancer incidence rate decreased for men and remained stable for women. While cancer incidence rates among children age 14 or younger increased slightly (0.6 percent each year from 1992 through 2009), overall death rates for cancer among children have steadily declined since at least 1975. Noting that there is plenty of work to be done to continue this trend, Benz said that the good news is that prevention strategies such as vaccinations for human papillomavirus (HPV) can have a big effect on incidence and death rates. \"Many of the things that are still a problem in these statistics can be changed,\" said Benz. An Immunology 'Dream Team' Dana-Farber researchers Glenn Dranoff, MD, Stephen Hodi, MD, and Kai Wucherpfennig, MD, PhD, were recently named recipients of a scientific \"Dream Team\" grant in cancer immu- nology from Stand Up to Cancer. The team, which includes scientists at eight cancer centers nationwide, will receive $10 million over three years to explore two therapies that harness the immune system to combat cancer. One focuses on a drug that may help heighten the response at immune checkpoint block- ades - areas that maintain tight control over the body' s response to disease. The other involves transfusing disease-fight- ing T cells into patients with cancer. \"The hope is to accelerate the devel- opment of new and more potent cancer immunotherapies by bringing inves- tigators together through this Dream Team,\" says Dranoff, leader of cancer immunology at Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center.6 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2013 www.dana-farber .orgAround the Institute A Milestone for Young Survivors Twenty years ago, the idea of cancer survivorship was in its infancy. Only a handful of programs offered expert follow-up care and wellness programs for patients who had completed treatment. One of the first of these ground-breaking programs opened at Dana-Farber in 1993 in the form of the David B. Perini Jr. Quality of Life Clinic, the pediatric survivorship program at Dana-Farber/Children' s Hospital Cancer Center (DF/CHCC). \"Survivorship rates were starting to rise and we were just beginning to understand the specific long-term issues that our young survivors faced,\" says Holcombe Grier, MD, professor of pediatrics at DF/CHCC, who served as co-director of the Perini Clinic in 1993. \"We saw that we needed a more con-trolled, unified way to address specific long-term issues.\" Today, an estimated 13.7 million Americans are cancer survivors, and the demand for survivorship services is on the rise. Programs like those offered through the Perini Clinic and Dana-Farber' s Adult Survivorship Program give patients access to a range of experts, from psychologists to fertility and cardiac care experts, who help address post-cancer challenges and concerns. They provide childhood and adolescent cancer survivors access to the exper-tise, education, and support needed to manage key survivorship issues, includ-ing the long-term adverse effects of treatment, the risk of second cancers, and social and psychological concerns. Such services are an integral part of care at comprehensive cancer centers like Dana-Farber, and they have become an expectation for most patients today. \"It' s remarkable to see how the conversation has changed,\" Grier says. \"When I sit down with families and talk with them about a child' s new cancer diagnosis, it' s no longer just about treatment. While much of the conversation is 'will my child survive?', an almost equal amount is on 'how will this affect my child over the long term?'\" To learn more, visit www.dana-farber .org/perini-clinic.19,614 Combined number of hours donated last year by Dana-Farber volunteers 721 Number of clinical trials open to Dana-Farber patients in 2012 42 feet Length of new Blood Mobile introduced in 2013 and made possible by the Friends of Dana-Farber and Friends of Brigham and Women' s Hospital More than 3,000 Number of tumor samples now classified in Profile, an ambitious effort by Dana-Farber and Brigham and Women' s Hospital to scan tumor samples from all adult consenting patients and identify the sets of DNA mutations - or genotypes - that drive tumor growth $72,000 Amount donated by Dana- Farber staff to patients and families participating in the Institute' s Seasonal Giving Program, a program to help ease the financial burden of a cancer diagnosis 242 Registered nurses who staff inpatient units at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center 5,234 Number of bicyclists who par- ticipated in the 2012 Pan-Massachusetts Challenge (PMC), which raised more than $37 million for the Jimmy Fund.

Spring/Summer 2013 P a t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 7Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxsix Questions For ... What does the CMO job entail? My charge is to make sure we deliver high-quality, cost-effective, efficient, and patient-centered care. I engage physicians and collaborate with other departments such as Nursing, Human Resources, and Finance - as well as our satellite centers and partner institutions - to see that we meet our research and clinical care goals. How does your role support Dana-Farber' s goals, particularly those aimed at quality improvement? Quality improvement is a responsi- bility shared by all of us, and it affects every aspect of the work I do. Patients come here with the belief that they will have a quality experience. They expect their care at Dana-Farber to be better than what they would find elsewhere. We have to deliver on this. Describe your vision for effective patient care. This vision is for the best pos- sible care to be given by the right professional at the right time for the patient. For example, if administra- tive work is handled by an admin- istrative expert, then the program nurse is freed up to do clinical work, which in turn frees up the physician assistants, nurse practitio- ners, and physicians. Each person is doing what he or she does best, and this way of working is standardized across the Institute. In the end, the patient has a better experience. How do you work with patients to make improvements in care? At Dana-Farber, patients are an inte- gral part of the way we make chang- es. They are involved, as volunteers, on every committee. We also receive their feedback through surveys and other means. Even complaints are a way to learn. I write back to patients all the time, and I thank them for pointing out an opportunity for us to improve. Y ou have several degrees. How did these areas of study prepare you for your job? I pursued an MPH [master' s degree in public health] while in medical school because I was interested in health policy and clinical research design. Later on, when I became clinical director for breast oncology here, I discovered how much I liked organizational operations, so I went to business school and it really ener - gized me. Now I know how much we can learn from other industries. Do you still take care of patients? Y es, I see breast cancer patients two days a week. I love being a doctor, and I consider patient care a critical part of my role as CMO. This keeps Craig Bunnell, MD, MPH, MBA \"I love my job,\" says Craig Bunnell, MD, MPH, MBA, Dana-Farber' s Chief Medical Officer (CMO) since July 2012. Bunnell, a medical oncologist and a former clinical director of the Breast Oncology Center, has been a faculty member at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center since 1997. He is leading a major initiative aimed at making the experience of patients smoother and more efficient. Bunnell explains how his background in medi- cine, public health, and business prepared him Cleary me close to the patient experience. I only ask other clinicians to do what I am willing to do myself. 8 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2013 www.dana-farber.orgBench to Bedside by rObert levy Resea Rche R PRofile A thletes caught using performance-enhancing drugs are betrayed by their own blood, which carries chemical evidence of substances they've ingested or injected. That evidence isn't the drug itself, but bits and pieces of it that have been split off and reas- sembled by the body in a process known as metabolism. At Dana-Farber, Massimo \"Max\" Loda, MD, and his colleagues are conducting equivalent exams on prostate cancer cells, trying to discover how metabolism differs in tumor cells and normal cells, and what those differences can tell scientists about genes behind the disease. \"Metabolism is the process by which cells and tissues break down nutrients and use them to grow, reproduce, and perform their function within the body,\" says Loda. \"My lab uses metabolism as a window into the genes that cause and drive prostate cancer.\" His focus on metabolism was inspired by a discovery about an enzyme, a protein that speeds chemical reac- tions in the cell. Half a dozen years ago, he and his associates found that a long-overlooked enzyme known as fatty acid synthase, or FAS, is essential for prostate cancer cell survival. Blocking the enzyme in laboratory cultures of prostate cancer cells caused the cells to die. As an enzyme, FAS is deeply involved in cell metabo- lism. \"The discovery of FAS' s role in prostate cancer led us to the broader field of metabolic pathways - the chain of events by which compounds are modified to produce other products within the cell,\" Loda says. His team began making \"metabolic profiles\" of normal and cancer - ous prostate cells, identifying the molecules created as metabolism proceeds and the levels at which they're produced. \"We focus on the molecules - or metabolites - that result from enzymes' action within cells,\" Loda explains. He and his associates found stark differences in the metabolic profiles of normal prostate cells and prostate cancer cells - differences that may hold clues to better treatments. \"We can see which metabolic pathways are altered in prostate cancer cells and which are not,\" Loda explains. \"We apply that information to what we've learned from genomic research into the disease. We know, for example, that prostate tumors driven by certain mutated genes have distinct metabolic profiles. By combining the two approaches, we hone in not only on cancer-causing genes, but also on the metabolic pathways they change. Both the genes and pathways can be targets for new therapies.\" Loda' s research has also shown that metabolic pro- files can vary from one prostate tumor to another. Those differences may serve as biomarkers, indicating which prostate cancers are likely to respond to certain drugs, and which are not. \"We can see which metabolic pathways are altered in pros- tate cancer cells and which are not.\" Massimo Loda, MD, PhDSpring/Summer 2013 P a t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 9Bench to Bedside by rObert levy clinician PRofile Mary Ellen Taplin, MD Imagine trying to extinguish a fire that burns even after its oxygen supply has been cut off - a blaze with the ability to produce its own oxygen. For doctors and patients who battle aggressive prostate cancer, the predicament is much the same. Prostate tumors fuel their growth with the male hor - mone androgen, which is produced in the testes, the adre- nal glands, and - most troublesomely - in the cancer cells themselves. Drugs that shut down production of androgen in the testes and adrenal glands can bring tumor growth to a halt. But without a way to stop tumors from making homegrown androgen, such remissions rarely last long. Mary Ellen Taplin, MD, has spent more than 20 years working to improve the options for men with prostate cancer treated at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center. Last year, she and her colleagues scored a major success with a clinical trial of a drug that ranges far and wide to stifle androgen production in the body. The trial involved 58 men with aggressive prostate cancer tumors likely to spread beyond the prostate gland. \"Such tumors are rarely cured by surgical re- moval of the prostate gland alone,\" Taplin says. \"Thera- pies that combine surgery with older, androgen-block- ing drugs haven't had much of a positive impact on those results. Research indicated a broader-acting anti-andro- gen agent might be more effective.\" Half of the trial participants received the standard hor - mone-blocking drug Lupron, and half received Lupron and the study drug abiraterone acetate, which handcuffs androgen production in the tumor as well as in the testes and adrenal glands. After three months, all participants began receiving the two-drug combination. Three months later, all the men' s prostate glands were surgically re- moved. Pathology exams showed that 34 percent of the participants had no or almost no tumor tissue left - a vast improvement over conventional hormonal therapy. \"This is the first trial to show that treating high-risk prostate cancer patients with neo-adjuvant therapy [in which participants receive hormone or chemotherapy prior to surgery] can have such a powerful clinical result,\" Taplin says. The next step will examine which dose and combination of androgen-blockers has the best result. The study results are, in a way, a vindication of the promise that Taplin saw in prostate cancer research when she entered the field in the early 1990s. \"At the time, much less was known about the role of the androgen receptor [a protein on cells that switches their growth on and off] in prostate cancer than about the role of estrogen receptor in breast cancer,\" she observes. \"This is the first trial ever to show that treating high-risk prostate cancer patients ... can have such a powerful clinical result.\"Photo Illustration by Jessica Walker 10 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2013 www.dana-farber.orgpicking out the genes that cause cancerTrouble Makers by rObert levy Spring/Summer 2013 P a t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 1112 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2013 TCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATC- GATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATC- GATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATC- GATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGA TCGATCGATCGTCGATCGATCGTCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATC- ot long ago, the task of linking a mu- tated gene to cancer could consume the better part of a scientist' s career. Today, it may take as long as a week. Advanced DNA-sequencing tech- nology can speedily deliver lists of the mutations within a set of tumor cells - the various mis- spellings, duplica- tions, and garblings of the genetic code that can send cell growth into over - drive. And impres- sive lists they can be. If the cancer being scanned is a lymphoma or leuke- mia, the number of muta-tions may be less than a dozen. If it' s a lung cancer or melanoma, the figure is apt to be in the hundreds, if not thousands. The challenge for scientists, then, has shifted from one of scarcity to surplus. In tumor cells with, say, 1,000 mutations, the number of mutations actually driving the cells' growth and survival may be rela- tively small (though no one knows how small). The remainder of the mutations, regardless of where or why they arose, have little influence on the tumor' s behavior and are, es- sentially, along for the ride - hence their name, \"passenger\" mutations. When designing new cancer drugs, investigators clearly want to aim at the mutations responsible for cancer cells' chaotic growth. The question then becomes how to dis- tinguish drivers from passengers, the legitimate targets from the decoys. The mutations themselves offer few clues: a typo in a single letter of DNA can sometimes wreak havoc; a gene copied multiple times over may have no negative impact. \"For lung cancer and many other cancers, we're drinking from a fire- hose, trying to select out the few gene mutations that matter amid the torrent of mutations that are less critical,\" says Kwok-Kin Wong, MD, PhD, scientific co-director of the Belfer Institute for Applied Cancer Science at Dana-Farber, which seeks to discover new treatments by understanding the mutations that make cancer go. The Likeliest Suspects Getting a bead on driver mutations wasn't difficult initially. \"There are a number of mutated genes that have been known for 20-25 years to be involved in cancer - genes such as ras, BCR/ABL, and Myc,\" says William Hahn, MD, PhD, Dana-Farber' s deputy scientific director and director of the Institute' s Center for Cancer Genome Discov- ery. \"The problem was that, other Of the many gene mutations within a cancer cell, only a relatively small number may be driving the cancer.n Spring/Summer 2013 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 13TCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATC - GATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATC- GATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATC - GATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGA TCGATCGATCGTCGATCGATCGTCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATC - laboratory specimens of cancer cells. Tumors are best understood within their natural surroundings, the layers of normal and near-normal tissue that enfold them within the body. A group of gene mutations that causes cell reproduction to go berserk in petri dishes may have an entirely different effect - or no effect - in actual organs and tissues. Laboratory techniques that simulate the living environment of tumors are critical to this research. \"When we look for driver muta- tions, we need to take into account all the different types of cells that are than these, we knew very little about which genes underlie different types of cancer.\" Researchers began by focusing on the mutations most clearly connect- ed to cancer. Scientists knew that enzymes known as kinases are often abnormal in cancer cells. So it was natural for kinase genes to be among the first considered as drivers. Another clue was how often a par - ticular gene is found to be mutated in cancer. \"If it happens at a high- enough frequency - if it occurs in, say, 30 percent of cancers of a certain type - we'll be pretty suspi-cious that it plays an important role,\" Hahn remarks. \"Researchers initially looked at the genes that had been extensively studied and described,\" Wong says. \"From that base of knowledge, you start building a picture of how they contribute to cancer. If you're interested in a gene about which little is known, you have to build that bio- logical understanding yourself. That is what the Belfer Institute and other labs at Dana-Farber are doing.\" The challenge of identifying the drivers goes beyond finding which mutations are troublemakers in For Belfer Institute leaders (from left) Jesse English, PhD, Pasi J\u00e4nne, MD, PhD, and Kwok-Kin Wong, MD, PhD, studying cancer's environment within the body is key to understanding the disease.14 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2013 www.dana-farber.orgInvestigators in Dana-Farber' s Center for Cancer Systems Biology (CCSB) have taken a novel approach to distinguish driver from passenger mutations. The key to their technique: viruses, the primal perpetrators of cellular havoc. After a virus infects a cell, proteins made from the virus' s genes begin interacting with the cell' s own proteins. These interactions can interfere with the cell' s normal functioning and the activity of its genes - so recklessly, sometimes, that the cell becomes cancerous. The disruptions produced by cancer-causing viruses often mimic those triggered by gene mutations. \"That led us to ask, 'What if we systematically examine the interac- tions between normal cell proteins and the proteins made from cancer cell viruses?'\" says Michael Cusick, PhD, of the CCSB, who helped lead the research. \"Because viral proteins and gene mutations cause cancer by similar mechanisms, could we use the viral proteins as stand-ins for identifying proteins - and the underlying gene muta- tions - associated with cancer?\" To find out, researchers from the United States and Canada collected 144 proteins from four viruses linked to cancer and screened them one by one against 20,000 different proteins in human cells, recording which ones interacted. The end tally was the identification of roughly 950 viral targets, cell proteins potentially associated with cancer.\"Viruses have spent millions of years perfecting the art of interacting with cells - of taking advantage of gene pathways that are essential for the cell and may therefore be essential to cancer,\" Cusick remarks. \"We're now using them as a guide to the mutations that are most important in cancer.\" -RLgenome research 'goes Viral' Electron micrograph of a negatively stained human papilloma virus (HPV) that occurs in human warts. Warts on the hands and feet have never been known to progress to cancer. However, after many years, cervical warts can become cancerous. around the tumor, that feed the tumor and promote its growth,\" says Jesse English, PhD, the Belfer Institute' s head of research. \"We've developed several strategies for studying the effect of mutations within the context of a tumor' s normal environment.\" Diving In Belfer Institute researchers use two main approaches - or platforms - to cull driver mutations from the throng of passengers. The first is context- specific screening (CSS). English explains: \"In any given tumor type, there are often baseline mutations - a small group of mutations that don't necessarily make a cell cancerous, but start it in that direction. The question is, which additional muta- tions will push the cell over the edge into cancer?\" Belfer Institute scientists have created such almost-cancer cells for a variety of tumor types. They slip suspected driver mutations into the cells' DNA and implant the cells in lab animals, in the same tissue where such cells might naturally be found. If the cells become cancerous, it' s an indication that the added mutations are indeed drivers. The second strategy is a \"depletion screen\" involving shRNA (the \"sh\" stands for \"short hairpin\" but might just as well stand for \"Shhh!\" as the technique involves silencing genes one at a time). \"We use viruses to carry shRNA into laboratory samples of tumor cells,\" explains Belfer Institute scientist Mark Bittinger. \"The RNA shuts down a specific gene, and we track whether the cells stop growing and die. It' s a system- atic way of determining whether a particular gene is necessary for tumor cell survival and proliferation. \"This approach, known as RNA interference, mimics the way a drug against an individual gene would work. It has become the workhorse of efforts to discover cancer-related genes that make good targets for new therapies.\"require a combination of these approaches to identify the most likely offenders. Also, driver mutations rarely work solo. In the vast majority of cancers, it isn't one mutation but a combination of them that are respon- sible for turning a cell cancerous and keeping it that way. Researchers are hard at work trying to determine which combination of mutations provides the formula for cancer, and which combination of therapies can undo the damage those mutations have produced.

Named after the mythical Trojan War hero who was killed by a wound to the weak spot in his heel, the project is con- cerned with vulnerabilities, specifi- cally the genes on which cancer cells depend for their growth and survival. \"We're screening at least 500 can- cer cells lines in which we know all of the genetic alterations and asking, if we turn off those genes one by one, can we identify which are critical? It' s our hope that the project will result in a global picture of how to find those vulnerabilities,\" Hahn comments. \"We're about halfway through the project [which began in 2010], but it' s already enabled us to begin exploring the links between certain mutations and cell survival.\" Hahn and other scientists em- phasize that no single approach - whether in laboratory cell cultures, tumor tissue samples, or animal studies - will be sufficient to decisively label a particular gene mutation as a driver.

In it, he stands with Robert Kraft, owner of the New Eng- land Patriots and patron and co-founder, with Anderson, of the Kraft Family Blood Donor Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women' s Hospital. The two are smiling as Anderson holds up a 2004 Super Bowl ring. Anderson, who is director of the Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center and LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center, says he counts Kraft as a \"friend for life, both personally and profes- sionally.\" Anderson, the Kraft Family Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Kraft have been close friends for 30 years. Anderson says it' s relation- ships like these - with colleagues and collaborators, trainees, and, most important, with patients and families he has cared for - that are the secret to his success. In his four decades of practice and research, including 32 years at Dana-Farber, Anderson has played a central role in transforming myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, from a near immediate death sentence to, in many cases, a chronic, manageable illness. From the 1970s through the '90s, not a single new myeloma drug made it into clinical practice. But during the last decade, Anderson, a slight man with kindly eyes and a ready smile, helped shepherd multiple new drugs from laboratory bench through regulatory approval and to the patient bedside. \"Partnership is absolutely key,\" says Anderson, who received a 2012 Medal of Honor in Science from the American Cancer Society for bringing his research into the clinic. \"We practice team science. We work with industry, regulatory authorities, and funding agencies. But most important, our patients are the heroes, inspiration, and reason for all we do.\"by elIzabeth DOugherty a Spring/Summer 2013 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 1718 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2013 www.dana-farber.orgAnderson arrived at Johns Hop- kins University in 1973 for medi- cal school, inspired by his mother, a nurse, to become a small-town general practitioner. He also had a keen interest in science. In his mind, however, blending science and the practice of medicine as he conceived it - \"on the front lines, taking care of people in the community\" - wasn't in the realm of possibility. Then he met Richard Humphrey, a multiple myeloma doctor who was growing myeloma tumor cells in the laboratory and testing them against conventional drugs. Humphrey intro- duced Anderson to clinical research, and also taught him the meaning of success: Make science count for patients, and treat patients as family. So imbued is Anderson with these two principles that he has, by word and example, passed them on to those he mentors. \"He always told me, as long as you keep the patient in mind, you'll never go wrong,\" says Noopur Raje, MD, who trained in Anderson' s lab a decade ago and now leads her own myeloma lab and practice. In the early 1970s, there were very few people working on myeloma and survival was measured in months. \"There was a glaring and urgent need to make things better for patients,\" says Anderson. Research into myeloma was also primed for improvement. Not only are myeloma tumor cells relatively easy to gather from patients, through bone marrow aspirations, they also grow readily in the laboratory, mak- ing it possible to model the disease and put science to work against it. The stage was set. Anderson began pursuing myeloma research immediately. Making Science Count Anderson attributes many of his subsequent discoveries to simply fol-lowing science trends. \"In the '80s, it was a Golden Age of monoclonal an- tibodies,\" he says, his eyes sparkling as he recalls treatment advancements that came from this work. Mono- clonal antibodies grab onto invaders such as viruses and cancer cells and allow the immune system to attack. Anderson used antibodies that tar - get myeloma tumor cells to improve the success of bone marrow trans- plants when patients self-donate mar - row. Even after chemotherapy, such marrow still contains some malignant cells. Anderson found that treating it with antibodies helps clear the tumor cells and delays relapse. Later, Anderson worked to trans- form bone marrow transplants into stem cell transplants. The method involves harvesting and reintroduc- ing a patient' s own blood stem cells to regenerate the blood and immune system after high-dose chemotherapy. Again, this improved survival. As science began to uncover the importance of cytokines - proteins that cue cells to grow and influence their behavior - Anderson' s research expanded in that direction. This led to a better understanding of the cel- lular circuitry that drives myeloma. In the mid-1990s, Anderson dis- covered that a switch inside myelo- ma cells, NF-kB, was important to myeloma cell growth and survival, making it a promising drug target. At about the same time, colleagues at Harvard Medical School were working on a new drug, an inhibi- tor that blocks the proteasome, the cell' s garbage collector. That drug, it turned out, worked by inhibiting NF-kB, Anderson' s prime target. Further research in Anderson' s lab confirmed the effectiveness of the drug against myeloma. Then, in a phase 1 clinical trial, a myeloma patient had a complete response. All signs of the disease vanished. Just three years later, in 2003, the FDA approved the drug, called Velcade, which today is standard treatment for newly diagnosed myeloma. \"It went from the bench to the bedside very quickly,\" says Anderson, who with his colleagues won the prestigious Warren Alpert Foundation Prize at Harvard Medi- cal School for this work in 2012. \"The whole concept of bench- to-bedside-and-back research was really new,\" says Faith Davies, MD, who joined Anderson' s lab in 1999 for a three-year fellowship. She is now a myeloma investigator at the Institute of Cancer Research in Lon- don. \"Others may have been doing it, but Ken really drove it.\" Around the same time, Anderson was investigating thalidomide, an- other promising myeloma drug. He modeled not just patient tumor cells but also, as he says, \"the neighbor - hood\" of the tumor, including non-\"I have been blessed to have colleagues here and around the world passionately committed to curing myeloma ...\" - Kenneth Anderson, MDSpring/Summer 2013 P a t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 19that will markedly improve outcomes and lead to potential cures,\" he says. Anderson' s influence is behind much of the progress made in my- eloma over the past four decades. Y et Anderson deftly passes the credit. \"I have been blessed to have colleagues here and around the world passion- ately committed to curing myeloma, and courageous patients who are a daily source of inspiration.\" \"He' s so humble about his achieve- ments,\" says Raje, who still attends Anderson' s weekly lab meetings and calls him regularly for input. When Anderson looks back on his 40-year journey, he shakes his head in disbelief. \"What a privilege it has been for me to watch the natural his- tory of myeloma change, see trainees become leaders, and watch patients share the joys of life with their fami-lies. It doesn't get any better than this!,\" he says. Nevertheless, when he looks ahead, he has the energy of a man just about to begin. see Dr. anDerson exPlain multiPle myeloma . Visit www.bit.ly/Z1WtwX.cancerous immune and other cells. The tumor' s neighborhood - or \"microenvironment\" - mattered in myeloma treatment because myeloma cells that adhere to the microenvironment don't respond to conventional chemotherapy drugs. These more life-like models allowed Anderson to discover that thalidomide and its close cousin lenalidomide (brand name Rev- limid) work as immunomodulators, drugs that recruit immune cells to fight cancer. Paul Richardson, MD, his colleague and clinical director of the Lipper Center, led the first human trials, setting the stage for the 2006 approval of lenalidomide to treat myeloma. Modeling the microenvironment has since proven to be a valuable tool in translational research. \"Ken' s work has shown that when drugs work in laboratory models of the tumor that include the context of the microenvironment, they tend to work better in patients,\" says Raje, who, along with Davies, collabo- rated on these findings. Myeloma Mixology Researchers now know that cancer is heterogeneous (many genetic mutations drive a single tumor) and must be treated with combinations of therapies that target different drivers. In some forms, such as testicular cancer and certain types of leukemia and lymphoma, such drug cocktails have led to cures. So Anderson is looking for syn- ergistic combinations of drugs and therapies for myeloma. Synergy can happen if, for example, one drug undoes the mechanisms that cause resistance to another drug. He also hopes to personalize treat-ment by categorizing patients based on the molecular pathways that are driving their cancer, as determined by tumor genomics, and to pre- scribe combinations of drugs based on those categories. \"The more we understand, the more we realize how complicated this disease is,\" says Anderson, who, along with colleague Nikhil Munshi, MD, is finding that myeloma tumors have many muta- tions even at the very start of the dis- ease. \"Hardly ever will it be enough to use just one targeted agent.\" One combination, Velcade, Rev- limid and Dexamethasone, shows promise in all patients, with all signs of myeloma vanishing in half. Given these unprecedented results, Mun- shi, Richardson, and Anderson have launched a trial to test this combina- tion in newly diagnosed myeloma patients. Half of the participants will receive stem cell transplants, testing whether the combination increases transplant success, and vice versa. \"My prediction is that science will inform the design of four- or even five-agent treatment combinations Kenneth Anderson, MD (right), has had a lifelong friendship with New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft (left), a passionate supporter of the fight against cancer. by rObert levy IllustratIOn by JessICa w alker anD JOhn DIgIannI he renegade behavior of cancer cells results from mutations or abnormali- ties in key sets of genes. As scientists have come to realize, these same mutations can leave the cells vulner - able to cleverly-designed therapies. One example involves a treatment for breast and ovarian cancer patients who have inherited mutations in the genes BRCA1 or BRCA2. As depicted here, the approach turns these otherwise dangerous changes to patients' advantage. 1) Everyday wear and tear or environmental hazards can damage cells, often producing a break in a single strand of DNA. Normally, a protein known as PARP helps fix such single-strand breaks. 2) Treating such patients with PARP-blocking drugs can prevent such breaks from being repaired in cancer cells. 3) With PARP sidelined, DNA damage accumulates, eventually producing breaks in both strands of the mol- ecule. In most people, the BRCA genes handle two-strand repair jobs, but patients who inherit BRCA1 or 2 muta- tions have only one functioning copy of these genes, rather than the usual two. In such patients' tumor cells, even that one good copy is lost. The result: mounting, irreversible DNA damage to tumor cells. 4) Its DNA irreparably broken, the tumor cell can no longer sustain itself and dies.

When a small bump on her leg rapidly grew in size, a succession of doctor visits ended with surgery to remove a tumor and, then, a diagnosis of a rare form of osteosarcoma - bone cancer. Suddenly, at age 29, Blumenfeld felt like the life she' d mapped out was contracting quickly. Instead of graduate school and wedding plans, she was faced with a second, more invasive surgery and a year of chemotherapy.

Children, despite mak- ing up just 2 percent of all cancer cases, get a disproportionate share of research fund-ing, clinical focus, and media attention. Middle-aged and older patients are the primary beneficiaries of clinical trials, research protocols, and support groups. For those caught in between, things can be confusing. Too old for the pediatric clinic and its playroom, too young to feel comfortable in an adult clinic alongside people their parents' age, young adults facing cancer often feel isolated. Just about 10 percent of outpatients at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Young Lives 22 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2013 www.dana-farber.orgSpring/Summer 2013 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 23Left to right: Divya Raju, Rebecca Blumenfeld, and Ben O'Clair were all forced to halt major life events during cancer treatment at Dana-Farber.24 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2013 www.dana-farber.orgRecent findings show that many young adult patients may respond best to a chemotherapy regimen designed for children.Center (DF/BWCC) are between ages 18 and 35. Peers don't under - stand what they are going through, and sometimes their own families are not sure how to help. Major milestones, such as going to college or beginning a career or family, are often disrupted. DF/BWCC' s Y oung Adult Pro- gram is designed to help these patients find their place and each other. It offers individual and group counseling, educational events, and peer support through face-to-face meetings and a secure website with online forums and information. \"Y oung adults can be taken off track by cancer, and it' s hard for them to transition back into regular life, for practical and existential rea- sons,\" says Karen Fasciano, PsyD, a clinical psychologist and director of the Y oung Adult Program. \"Their peer group hasn't experienced this, and their perspective on life and what they value may change.\" Blumenfeld says she suppressed her emotions for the year she was in active treatment, only to have them come flooding back after her Port- A-Cath device was removed last December - exactly one year after her first chemotherapy infusion. \"During treatment, I was con- cretely connected with the physical - and my body and pain and nausea and discomfort - that I didn't have time to feel anything,\" says Blumen- feld, who was a \"very part-time\" student during this period. \"Since treatment, I've been reflecting. I'm angry and frustrated that this was not the year it was supposed to be. I had to put off finishing school, my relationship was constantly chal- lenged, and I don't feel like my body belongs to me anymore.\" Blumenfeld credits the Y oung Adult Program with helping her through. After attending DF/BWCC' s annual young adult conference, she was \"amazed\" to meet so many pa- tients her age. She also met regularly with Fasciano, with whom she dis- cussed her relationship with both her husband and her parents - on whom this fiercely independent woman had to become largely dependent. Ben O'Clair faced several similar obstacles. He was a 21-year-old col- lege senior taking final exams when he learned he had Ewing sarcoma - another form of bone cancer - and had to leave school immediately. \"I had just gotten to the point where I was preparing for graduation and interviewing for jobs and intern- ships,\" recalls O'Clair, now 24. \"I had to stop and put it all on hold.\" Today O'Clair serves on the Y oung Adult Program advisory committee. \"We're giving people a chance to get the support they need and connect with others are out there,\" he ex- plains. \"I'm working on the website; my favorite feature is a chat room where people can arrange to meet up with fellow patients.\" 'Awakening' Research Changes in how young adults are treated at DF/BWCC are not limited to their unique emotional concerns. There is an increased focus on the clinical and scientific differences that can arise in tumors found in this age population, and on tailoring treat-ments to best address them. Stephen E. Sallan, MD, chief of staff emeritus and a pediatric oncologist at Dana-Farber/Children' s Hospital Cancer Center, says there are several key obstacles in identify-ing and treating young adults. \"These are among the most unin- sured and unemployed individuals in the country, so they are often not being seen regularly by a physician,\" says Sallan. \"They feel they are immortal and can't get sick, so they may initially ignore their symptoms. Many times we don't get to them until they show up in an emergency room, with or without their parents.\" Sallan says that it has long been known that some cancers - sarcomas, lymphomas, leukemias, some brain tumors, and some germ cell cancers - appear more often in young adults. Researchers recently found that a significant portion of these patients may respond best if given a chemo regimen designed for children. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common child- hood cancer, has a survival rate of 85 percent or higher when treated in patients age 15 and under. This rate was always worse in young adults until a pair of oncologists at the Uni- versity of Chicago - Wendy Stock, MD, and Jim Nachman, MD - found that putting patients ages 18-30 on a pediatric chemotherapy protocol led to much better outcomes. \"When I first heard their talk, it awakened me,\" says Sallan. In 2000, along with three other cancer centers, Dana-Farber began treating young adult ALL patients with pediatric protocols. Survival rates went from 40 percent to 70 percent.Spring/Summer 2013 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 25 The key now, Sallan and others agree, is to increase the number of young adults on clinical trials for all cancers so that physician-scientists can learn more about what makes their tumors respond differently. \"We want to develop clinical trials geared to the physiological and biological needs of this group,\" says Suzanne George, MD, clinical director of the Center for Sarcoma and Bone Oncology at DF/BWCC. \"If you look at sarcoma outcomes by age subtypes, which typically occur in the young adult population, patients over 18 typically do worse than younger patients, and yet are treated on the same protocol. There is an opportunity to better under - stand the disease biology.\" Adds Sallan: \"Diseases are sometimes identical regardless of age, and sometimes are not. We are learning the importance of recog- nizing these similarities and differ - ences. Some of the difficult thera-pies and their side effects that can be tolerated by children occasionally prove to be too toxic for those in their 20s and 30s.\"Back to Life Katherine Helming has an innate understanding of this situation. At age 23, while a Harvard Medical School doctoral student training in a cancer biology lab at Dana-Farber, she was diagnosed with leukemia. Like O'Clair, she had to take a full year off from her studies and, due to intensive chemotherapy treatments, spent many weeks of 2011 as an inpatient at Brigham and Women' s Hospital or in isolation to prevent infection. Nurses told Helming she had to \"stop being a scientist worrying about what was going on with my cells, and start being a patient.\" Easier said than done, until she joined the Y oung Adult Program. \"The most important thing the program did was connect me with other young adults in my situation,\" Helming says. \"If we didn't have the same type of cancer or weren't in the same treatment stage, we still had a lot in common - relating to our peers, becoming dependent again on our parents, and navigating the return to school or work.\" Helming had a difficult time returning to her doctoral program during her second year of treatment. From the windows in Dana-Farber' s Louis B. Mayer Research Laborato- ries, she could look across the street into the Y awkey Center for Cancer Care, where she was still receiving once-weekly chemotherapy. \"Sometimes that was too over - whelming to get my head around,\" Helming admits. \"I got tired very easily and I didn't want to push myself too hard in the lab, but I still wanted to contribute.\" Even after treatment, young adult patients like Helming face emotional challenges. They're often expected to bounce right back to their old lives. \"People will say to them, 'Aren't you lucky your cancer is gone?' at the same time they might really be struggling,\" says Ann LaCasce, MD, a hematologic oncologist and direc- tor of Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer - Care Hematology-Medical Oncology Fellowship Program. \"They don't have the support they need, and ev- ery time something happens to them medically, they'll be certain their disease is back - even if it isn't.\" Now these patients have that sup- port. Whether or not their cancer returns, they are better equipped to deal with it from an emotional and physical standpoint.

Experts have spent decades trying to find ways of controlling or killing glioblastomas, the most highly malignant of brain tumors, but progress has been slow. Now, scientists are discovering a growing list of molecular targets for \"smart\" drugs that might dent the tumors' resistance that has stymied conventional therapies, and could potentially lengthen survival and improve quality of life. Until glioblastomas yield to some future breakthrough, the best near-term bet for helping patients is to develop and test these targeted drugs - first one-at-a-time, then in combinations - say the researchers. Rather than aiming to destroy tumor cells by blasting them with radiation and DNA-damaging chemotherapy, the new agents are designed to block runaway growth signals that drive the tumors' aggressive spread. \"There is hope that over the next few years, new cocktails of drugs will be available to target the key molecular pathways involved in these tumors,\" says Patrick Wen, MD, director of the Center for Neuro-Oncology at Dana-Farber/ Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center (DF/BWCC). However, the road from promis- ing candidate to effective treatment is often fraught with detours and delays. Each new compound from pharmaceutical laboratories comes with a list of necessary questions: Can it reach its target within the brain? Will it be effective in disrupt- ing tumor growth? Does it have acceptable risks of side effects? Every new agent must pass these tests on its own, then again when combined with other drugs. The urgency of getting these answers runs up against the slow and deliberate pace of clinical trials, which require enrolling hundreds of patients - whose tumors have various genetic characteristics - and testing drugs for months or years to see if they are effective. \"If patients in clinical trials don't live longer, we say the drug failed but we don't know why it failed,\" notes Keith Ligon, MD, PhD, of DF/BWCC' s Center for Molecular Oncologic Pathology (CMOP). \"Maybe the drug killed off only half the cells, but in fact we did make some progress with the other part of the tumor. But we have no way to tell, other than crude measures that take months to demonstrate results.\" Determined to do better, inves- tigators are working on ways to shortcut the testing process, evaluate more quickly whether experimental drugs are reaching targets in the brain, and personalize treatments Cnew medical tools may offer better predictions and drug treatments for brain tumorsThe search for shortcuts28 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s / Spring/Summer 2013 www.dana-farber.orgfor patients who are racing against the clock. What if different drugs could quickly be tried in an exact animal model of a patient' s brain tumor, with results guiding the treatment of that patient? Could physicians remove a small number of cells from the tumor during surgery and rapidly screen a panel of drugs for their effectiveness? Are there better ways to predict whether a drug will cross the barrier that protects the brain, so that it can reach the tumor? Though none of these are ready for prime time, Center for Neuro-Oncology scientists and colleagues are hopeful that these strategies will prove valuable in the fight against stubborn glioblastomas. Using a Living Tissue Bank One of the newest and most advanced resources is on the second floor of Dana-Farber' s Jimmy Fund Building, where incubators and freezers contain cells taken from al- most every DF/BWCC patient who undergoes surgery for high-grade brain tumors, such as glioblastoma. Five years ago, Ligon, with the support of his colleagues in Neuro- Oncology, started this collection of brain tumor cells that survive indefinitely as a resource for the DF/ BWCC Brain Tumor Program. He calls it the \"Living Tissue Bank\" in contrast to conventional tissue banking, which has focused on freezing or storing tissue in a form where the cells are no longer alive. Not all brain tumors can be grown in laboratory dishes, but the bank currently has 50 or 60 permanently established cell cultures, or cell lines, they can mine for valuable information. The bank continually grows as new patients come to DF/ BWCC for treatment. \"We take out samples and try to establish a living model of that pa- tient' s actual tumor, so that instead of trying to guess from its genetic profile how the tumor will behave, we try to have a model so we can go after it in a more direct fashion,\" explains Ligon. \"These tumor lines are an invalu- able resource for preclinical testing, to make sure the drugs do what they are supposed to do,\" notes David Reardon, MD, medical director of the Center for Neuro- Oncology. Reardon, Wen, and Ligon are currently designing clinical trials based on evidence from such studies to help pick drugs with the most promise.Developing Patient 'Avatars' With brain tumor cells from the Living Tissue Bank, Ligon has begun work on another type of personal- ized cancer medicine known as patient \"avatars.\" In online gaming, an avatar is an image that represents a person. In medicine, an avatar is an exact animal model of a single individual' s disease - such as a brain tumor - created to enable personal- ized drug research for that patient. Scientists create avatars by injecting mice with tumor cells from the living tissue bank or even tissue fresh from the operating room. If all goes well, an exact copy of the patient' s tumor will develop in the mouse. Additional mouse models can be created from the initial avatar, so that a variety of drugs can be tested on MIT researchers designed this tiny microfluidic chip that can measure the mass and density of single cells, and how they respond to drugs.

Because tumors often have more than one type of cancer cell - tumor hetero- geneity - the ability to test cells from different parts of the cancer could be extremely valuable. \"Potentially we could take tumor cells right out of patients and ana- lyze them almost immediately to determine what kind of drug to give them,\" Ligon says. Such a shortcut may seem far-fetched, but Ligon is pursuing this vision in collaboration with Scott Manalis, PhD, a bioen- gineer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a member of the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. Manalis has created a microflu- idic system so sensitive that it can measure the mass of a single cell. Within a few minutes, the device can tell, from changes in the mass and density of the cell, whether the cell is dormant, growing, or shrink-ing. And it can even tell scientists how the cell' s growth varies at dif- ferent times - its \"growth profile.\" \"If the mass goes up, the cell is happy and growing,\" says Ligon, \"so if you apply the drug to a tumor cell and its growth profile doesn't change, you know the drug had no effect.\" If, however, the cancer cell' s growth stalls or shrinks, the drug is likely to be working. In a 2011 experiment at MIT, the system was tested on leukemia cells that were treated with an antibiotic drug. Less than an hour later, the weighing device detected a change in the cancer cells' density, signal- ing that they were beginning to die. To the scientists, this suggested the potential value of the system in screening cancer drugs. Ligon' s collaboration with Manalis has been under way only a few months, but he is excited about the possibilities of measuring drug effects in real-time. \"If we get the technology working, it would go into clinical trials to validate it; eventually it could be a diagnostic test.\" Funds for the research come from a special National Institutes of Health program to support sci- entists who are asking \"provocative questions\" rather than continuing incremental, \"safe\" research. In another slant on analyzing the genome of single brain tumor cells, Dana-Farber' s Matthew Meyerson, MD, PhD, and Ligon are col- laborating with chemical engineer Christopher Love, PhD, of MIT in a \"Bridge Project\" supported by the Koch Institute and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. \"We now are using technologies which can take a single cell from a patient' s tumor, amplify it to make more DNA, and sequence its entire genome,\" Ligon explains. With such precise information, scientists might be able to determine the genetic In neuro-oncology, many drugs fail because they can't breach the \"blood-brain barrier\" - tiny blood vessels that protect the brain. the tumors growing in the avatars. Ligon notes that this strategy is well-established in microbiology, where doctors take a sample of bac- teria from a patient with an infection and grow them in a petri dish, trying different antibiotics to find one that kills the bacteria that is causing disease in the patient. \"The ideal situation would be if we could do this fast enough - if we could test not just the drug the patient was prescribed, but all the drugs he or she could possibly be given\" to weed out those that would be ineffective, Ligon says. The model could evaluate new drugs fresh from pharmaceutical company laboratories. Many scientists are skeptical that mouse avatars will prove valuable and cost-effective; Ligon agrees that the method is a long way from being proven. One hurdle is that not all tumor samples grow well in mice. Also, the process in its current form may take too long to help patients with rapidly growing brain tumors dur - ing their lifetime. In addition, the expense of creating and maintaining the mouse models is high. Ligon notes, however, that patients are increasingly interested in having avatars made of their disease. He is optimistic that this concept, originally tried in the 1960s, has a future. \"Our models are more sophisticated and we have a lot more drugs to test than were avail- able back then,\" he says. A Cell-by-Cell Approach Ligon, who is also affiliated with the Neuro-Oncology Program of the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Cen- ter, has begun exploring a futuristic Photo courtesy of the Manalis Lab at MIT30 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2013 www.dana-farber.org 30 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2013 www.dana-farber.org Shown here is a \"patient avatar\" brain tumor (dark blue areas) within a mouse brain, created by implant-ing tumor tissue from a patient.makeup of the exact cells within a brain tumor found, in devices like those Manalis has developed, to use a specific mechanism for resisting drugs. And if the tumor is made up of several kinds of tumor cells, this technique could guide physicians in selecting multiple drugs - combina- tion therapy - for the attack. Crossing the Barrier The most potent anticancer drug is worthless if it can't reach its target. In neuro-oncology, many potentially effective drugs fail because they can't penetrate the \"blood-brain barrier\" - tight-fitting blood vessel cells evolved to protect the brain against bacteria and poisons. A new tool being developed by DF/BWCC researcher Nathalie Agar, PhD, can track a drug as it enters the body and flows through the brain' s circulation, revealing whether molecules of the drug are getting through the barrier. With the power of mass spectrom- etry, which detects molecules by their mass, Agar has created a plat- form that creates images of a drug' s distribution in the body and the brain after the compound has been infused into a research animal. What' s new about Agar' s method is that there is no need for the drug molecules to be tagged with fluorescent chemicals, which can change the drugs' struc- ture, she says. (See \"Tech Preview\" on page 31 for details.) Agar and Dana-Farber colleague Charles Stiles, PhD, are using her mass spectrometry technique to determine if experimental drugs are able to breach the blood-brain barrier and reach tumor targets within the brain. Stiles, who is co-leader of the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Neuro-Oncology Program, remem- bers the first time he saw Agar demonstrate her technique. \"She showed me what she was doing with the mass spec technology, allowing us to visualize the inside of a blood capillary and drugs getting into the interstitial space [of the brain], and I was just blown away,\" he says. \"An especially powerful feature of Nathalie' s technology is that it does not require any radioactive or fluorescent labeling of the drugs being tested,\" Stiles explains. \"She can image the exact forms of drugs that are intended for use in patients.\" Stiles and Agar discovered, in one experiment, that a drug did pen- etrate the barrier and could be seen on the computer display to have accumulated in the tumor. But the image also showed that the drug was confined mainly to the network of blood vessels that the tumor had created. \"So the drug was just sitting there,\" she says, \"rather than reaching the tumor tissue itself.\" Another interesting finding: The mass spectrometry system took 25 cross-section images of a mouse brain and created a 3-D representation. \"We found that there was one region of the brain where the drug crossed the blood- brain barrier more efficiently,\" says Agar, which might lead to a strategy for delivering the drug where it is most likely to reach a tumor. One way of using the method clini- cally, Agar says, would be to give a drug to a brain tumor patient prior to surgery. The mass spectrometry image could then be used to study the tumor tissue that' s been removed \"to see if the drug actually made it to the tumor.\" If so, it would be a good sign for further treatment with the drug. Agar says she and Stiles, together with Dana-Farber chemist Nathanael Gray, PhD, plan to use the system to test more drugs from pharmaceutical companies. If they can demonstrate that certain drugs do reach the brain, she says, it \"might be a very effective way to convince companies of the value of developing trials that could help us re-purpose existing drugs to treat brain cancer.\" Only time will tell what impact these innovations - mouse avatars, single-cell testing, mass spec stud- ies of drug penetration, and others - will have on the treatment of brain tumors. But one thing is certain: They reflect the power of collabora- tion among DF/BWCC investigators, both basic and clinical, to mount an intense effort against this stubborn form of cancer. see hoW the microfluiDic chiP Works.

With a mass spectrometry platform, Agar can trace the flow of cancer drugs given to research animals, noting whether they slip through the \"blood-brain barrier,\" tight-fitting blood vessels that keep chemicals from reaching the brain. For her studies of drug penetration in tumors and in classifying tumor types, the mass spec- trometry platform measures the distribution of proteins, lipids, and other specific tissue components. From these measurements, computers can construct vivid images, including 3-D views of the blood-brain barrier. In a clinical trial, mass spectrometry technology is enabling Agar, in collaboration with Dana-Farber researchers, to examine brain tumors removed from patients to deter - mine whether drugs given before surgery hit their tumor targets. She' s developing a GPS-aided mass spectrometry instrument that would guide neurosurgeons during an operation so that a brain tumor could be removed more extensively with ultimate preservation of healthy tissue.Agar directs the Surgical Molecular Imaging Labora- tory at Brigham and Women' s Hospital, and also has an appointment in Cancer Biology at Dana-Farber. A major goal of her research is to provide more and better data to personalize treatments for brain tumors and other cancers. Agar, who holds a PhD in chemistry, and Charles Stiles, PhD, a Dana-Farber cancer biologist, are testing potential brain tumor drugs for their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Agar' s technique allows researchers to track a drug' s location after it is administered, without the need for costly, cumbersome fluorescent or radioactive dyes. Agar is also collaborating in a study of brain tumors caused by the spread of malignant cells from breast can- cers. \"We'll use the mass spectrometer to examine tissue samples removed during surgery to see if the drug is get- ting into the tumor and how it' s distributed,\" explains Agar. Much of her research, she says, is aimed at designing better treatments by analyzing different tumor cells and matching them to the most effective drugs. \"But the first thing we need to determine is whether the drug makes it into the tumor - this is a fundamental question.\"B Nathalie Agar, PhD, uses an advanced mass spectrometry platform to create images of cancer drugs flowing in the brain. New tools aid brain tumor studies32 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s Spring/Summer 2013 www.Stacy Kennedy, MPH, RDWhy i Work here She is a fountain of nutritional advice, a fitness instructor and personal trainer, a self-proclaimed science nerd, and an advocate of healthful eating who walks the walk. \"I'm about 90-percent vegetarian,\" says Stacy Kennedy, MPH, RD, senior clinical nutritionist at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women' s Cancer Center (DF/BWCC). \"My diet is basically plant-based, but sometimes I'll make a big salad with a little bit of grass-fed beef, wild fish, or organic chicken.\" She' s long been a \"juicer,\" augmenting her fruit and vegetable intake with home-pressed juices. Despite this, Kennedy is not a fanatic: \"Y ou still have to have balance and be a normal person and enjoy a piece of cake once in awhile,\" she says. Kennedy, who holds a master' s degree in pub- lic health and is a registered dietitian and a certified special- ist in oncology nutrition, came to DF/BWCC 12 years ago. She is one of six nutritionists in the department of Nutrition Ser - vices, where she helps cancer patients and survivors who want to manage their weight, design a more healthful diet, and learn how to \"fight cancer with a fork\" - nutritional strate- gies for cancer prevention, to promote survivorship and symptom management. \"I spend a lot of time with patients trying to put it all into perspective,\" she notes. \"Nutrition can have a big impact on people with cancer, and it' s never really one thing - you need to find a system that works for you.\" DF/BWCC is a great fit for Kennedy, who helped take care of her grandmother as she was dying from lung cancer, and who has long been interested in the field. \"There is a lot of interesting science and research about nutrition and oncology, and I love that,\" she says. That' s an asset for Kennedy: When evaluating the ever-changing research findings on nutrition and cancer, as well as the claims put forth for all kinds of diets and herbs and supplements, she looks first and foremost to the scientific evidence. \"We're so inundated with these things, and every- one is interested in the most exciting, latest promise of a quick fix,\" she says. \"I tell my patients they don't need to be afraid to talk about these unproven diets - I want to be sup- portive and informative, but it' s got to be safety first, efficacy second.\" A project that Kennedy initiated several years ago - creating a nutrition information section on Dana- Farber' s website - has evolved and, in early 2013, spawned a new iPhone app called Ask the Nutritionist: Recipes for Fighting Cancer. The app offers searchable questions about diet and cancer, as well as hundreds of recipes for use by cancer patients, people on specialized diets, and anyone interested in healthy eating.STACY KENNEDY, Mp H, rD by rICharD saltus \"NuTRiTioN caN havE a big iMP acT oN PEoPLE WiTh caNcER , aND iT's NE vER REaLL y oNE ThiNg - you NEED To fiND a sysTEM Tha T WoRks foR you. \" Spring/Summer 2013 P a t h s o f Pr o g r e s s What i know TIMOTHY r OUrKE as tOlD tO naOMI FunkhOuser \"hE is a NoRMaL , haPPy kiD , iN ThE facE of soMEThiNg ExTRaoRDiNaR y.\"A sound on the baby monitor awoke Timothy Rourke and Mel Pepin at 6 a.m. on Father' s Day in 2006. The parents of then-15-month-old Declan Rourke rushed to find their child having a seizure. They sped their unconscious son to the hospital. Hours later, Declan was diagnosed with atypical teratoid rhab-doid tumor (AT/RT), a rare cancer that affects the brain and central nervous system. Just 32 American children under age 3 are diagnosed annually with AT/RT. Prior to 1997, mortality from such tumors was 100 percent within six months of diagnosis. Declan' s rigorous treatment at Dana-Farber/Children' s Hospital Cancer Center (DF/CHCC) included 52 weeks of cytotoxic chemotherapy agents delivered in adult doses, and six weeks of cranial radiation. He completed treatment in late 2007. Today, Declan is almost 8, with no evidence of disease. \"He is a normal, happy kid, in the face of something extraordinary,\" says his father. One of a handful of pediatric patients worldwide without a relapse or secondary cancer, Declan is one of the world' s only longtime survivors of AT/RT - a gift of life Rourke credits to \"his friends and partners\" at DF/CHCC. He gives this advice to those who face the prospect of being a parent of a cancer patient. Never regret any decision you make. Y ou are doing the best you can for your kid. It' s amazing what humans are capable of when you don't have a choice. For parents, you discover within you this drive that you will do any- thing for your child. Decide to not live with cancer. Once we were on the survivorship journey, we decided not to live with the \"what-ifs.\" We reclaimed a goal in our life [adopting a child] that we had been ready to walk away from. We got through. For a long time, we thought we' d never get there.Help your child guide the conversation. As a result of treatment, Declan suffers from hearing loss. He brought hearing aides to class for \"show-and-tell.\" We will equip Declan as his peer group dynamics change, to discuss his cancer, or not - his choice. Support and recognize the experience of being a caregiver. Mel quit her job to become Declan' s caregiver during treatment. We focused on patience, listening, and good communication. Y ou're a click away from a mom or dad who went through this. Log on and connect with other parents who also faced complicated choices. With a can- cer diagnosis, the whole world rallies around you. It can be uncomfortable to ask for help. Accept it with gratitude. People feel helpless. Be direc- tive in what you need. Celebrate. I feel lucky for every single day. Any-thing he does, I celebrate, because I almost didn't have it.

The new law has the potential to trim thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs for cancer patients receiving their chemo as a pill. \"The parity provided by this bill is a recognition that cancer treatment is changing,\" says Dana-Farber Presi- dent Edward J. Benz Jr., MD. \"Increasingly, pills are re- placing IV chemotherapy in the clinical setting, and some newer cancer drugs are only available in pill form. In fact, since 2012, eight of the 11 oncology drugs approved by the FDA are oral treatments with no IV equivalent.\" While chemotherapy pills and capsules have been around for years, they have become more common in the past decade, and experts see them as a critical part of can- cer treatment in the future. For example, the drug imatinib (brand name Gleevec), which is the most effective treat- ment for chronic myelogenous leukemia, is only avail- able in pill form, as is a newer medication, lenalidomide, which is used to treat multiple myeloma and myelodys- plastic syndromes. Oral medications account for around 25 percent of 400 cancer medicines currently in development, according to a 2008 report from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. And researchers are continuing to uncover new potential benefits that may be gained through the use of targeted medications available only in pill form. Passage of the Massachusetts legislation represents a victory for Dana-Farber' s Legislative Action Network, whose members have actively lobbied legislators to enact the bill since it was first introduced in 2009. \"It' s a real victory for those who support patient access and equity,\" says Anne Levine, Dana-Farber' s vice president of External Affairs. \"In a state that rightly prides itself as leader in ensuring health care access to all, this is a positive step forward, and I'm hopeful that our members helped sway legislators to make the right decision in passing this bill.\" To learn more about the Legislative Action Network or to join its ongoing advocacy efforts for legislation and policies that improve the lives of cancer patients, sign up for email action alerts at www.dana-farber.org/ legislative-action-network. New Massachusetts legislation makes it easier and cheaper for cancer patients to recieve oral chemotherapy and related anticancer medications.Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick signed an oral chemotherapy parity bill into law earlier this year, joining more than 20 states requiring health plans to cover oral cancer pills \"at a rate no less favorable\" than standard intravenous (IV) chemotherapy. The legislation ensures that patients who receive oral chemotherapy treatment will get the same insurance coverage as those who take it intravenously.by erIC sChullernew Law reflects the changing Face of cancer treatment oral chemotherapy law brings parity to massachusetts patientsAnnual Report 2012 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s 352012 an n ua l rePo rt/tr e a s u r e r 's rePo rt a nD Da na-fa r b e r gov e r na n c e Fiscal year 2012 was a very positive one for Dana-Farber, with the completion of the first full year of operations for our Y awkey Center for Cancer Care. We achieved an operating margin target of $15.3 million, or roughly 1.5 percent, compared to a budgeted gain of $5.9 million. This strong performance in 2012 continues our historic operating mar - gin performance after a one year deficit in 2011. Total cash and invest-ments grew by $93.9 million thanks to several factors: strong operating performance, strong fundraising activity, and a 12 percent return on our portfolio for the 12-month period ended Sept. 30, 2012. One other highlight: Our net assets grew to just over $1 billion this year. Strong growth in our patient care activities resulted in growth in patient care revenues of 11.5 percent. Thanks to the continued support of our donors, it was also a strong year for fundraising, which saw a 2.9 percent increase in unrestricted giving. Research revenues declined 8.4 percent, largely as a result of the expiration of government stimulus funds initiated in 2008. These stimulus funds created additional rev- enue that we expected to decline in 2012. This decrease brings research revenues back to our 2010 levels. Management this year entered into a lease for approximately 100,000 square feet of critically needed research space in the Longwood Center (near Dana-Farber, on the corner of Brookline and Longwood Avenues). The Longwood Center will open in 2015 and will give us the continued ability to recruit and retain world-class research faculty members. It also provides us with the unprecedented opportunity to reorganize the entire campus to accelerate the application of basic discovery and translational science to treatments that advance the basic and clinical science of cancer. Another exciting research advancement is Profile, our comprehensive personalized cancer medicine initiative launched in 2011 and operated in partnership with Brigham and Women' s Hospital and Boston Chil- dren' s Hospital. A key component of our broad personalized medicine initiative, Profile analyzes patients' tumor tissue for nearly 500 genetic mutations in 41 cancer genes. This strategic initiative will provide one of the most complete profiles of known cancer genetic abnormalities available anywhere in the world. In 2012, we consented well over 70 percent of our new patients for this study and, during fiscal year 2012, we invested just over $2.4 million in this important initiative. Management, faculty, and staff throughout Dana-Farber - guided by the oversight of several committees of the Board of Trustees - worked diligently to achieve these results. We are grateful to them, and also to the many donors and friends of Dana-Farber who continue to demon- strate their commitment to the organization with their valuable knowl- edge and generous contributions, even in these challenging times. We are proud of all of these efforts and grateful for your strong and ongoing support.a message from chief financial officer karen birD36 Pa t h s o f Pr o g r e s s / Annual Report 2012 www.dana-farber.orgFor the Fiscal Y ear Ended Sept. 30 2012 2011 (Dollars in thousands) Assets Current Assets 248,483 201,452 Investments 621,266 549,397 Debt Service Reserve and Construction Fund 13,209 9,173 Property, Plant, and Equipment, net 644,775 656,888 Contributions Receivable, less current portion 55,786 61,365 Other Assets 21,529 9,347 Total Assets $1,605,048 $1,487,622 Liabilities and Net Assets Current Liabilities 174,255 166,734 Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities 394,630 379,805 Net Assets Unrestricted 477,225 Total Liabilities and Net Assets $1,605,048 $1,487,622 Summary Statistical Information (unless otherwise noted, includes adult and pediatric patients) Infusion Treatments 123,440 117,974 Outpatient MD Visits 225,479 212,908 Number of Licensed Beds (as of year-end) 30 30 Adult Inpatient Discharges 1,134 1,060 Clinical Trials (open to patients at Dana-Farber, 721 694 including therapeutic and nontherapeutic trials)Da na-fa r b e r ca n c e r in s t i t u t e in c. a nD su b s i Di a r i e s * conDense D consoli DateD balance sheets * Subsidiaries include Dana-Farber Inc. and Dana-Farber Trust.
