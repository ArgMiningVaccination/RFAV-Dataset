CODE MOVEMENT Coro nary brachytherapy procedure codes were limited to the four lines with coronary stenting codes. Three diagnosis codes for exposure to various elements were moved to uncovered lines Several diagnosis codes for personal history of various types of cancer were moved to covered lines The HCPCPS code for electrostimulation of auricular acupuncture points was placed on the Excluded List. However, it is anticipated that the traditional electro acupuncture of the ear will continued to be covered with the exi sting CPT codes for acupuncture. Stereotactic radiosurgery was added as a treatment option for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Spinal en thesopathy was moved from a covered to an uncovered line Spinal injection procedures were added to one line wi th spinal diagnoses ITEMS CONSIDERED BUT NO CHANGES MADE No changes were made to the current lack of coverage for enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher's Disease Coverage of silver compounds for treatment of dental caries was not added No changes were made to the chronic otitis media guideline. This will be brought back to a future meeting for further discussion. GUIDELINE CHANGES A new guideline was adopted specifying that silver compounds are not covered for treatment of dental caries A new guideline was ad opted specifying that viscosupplemenation for osteoarthritis of the knee is not a procedure included on the Prioritized List A new guideline was adopted specifying when epidural steroid injections are covered and specifying what procedu res are not covered for treatment of low back pain A new guideline was adopted referring immunization coverage to the Oregon Immunization Program The Prevention Tables were modified to remove reference to immunizations The radiculopathy guideline was modified to specify that reflexes must be \"markedly\" abnormal to qualify as radicul opathy A new guideline putting therapies with high cost or low effectiveness on low priority lines was adopted Value -based Ben efits Subcommittee Minutes, 1/10/2013 Page 2 VALUE -BASED BENEFITS SUBCOMMITTEE Meridian Park Health Ed ucation Center January 10, 2013 9:00 AM - 1:00 PM Members Present: Lisa Dodson, MD, Chair (departed at 11:55 AM ); Kevin Olson, MD, Vice-chair (Chair Pro Tem from 11:55 AM - 1:05 PM) ; Chris Williams, MD.

Roll Call/Minutes Approval/Staff Report The meetin g was called to order at 9:00 am and roll was called. Minutes from the 12-13- 12 VbBS meeting were reviewed and approved. ACTION: HERC staff will post the approved minutes on the website as soon as possible. Coffman discussed moving the traditional Dec ember V bBS meeting to November to allow more time between the November and December meetings . For 2013, meetings will be scheduled for both November and December, with only one anticipated to be held, likely the November meeting. However, if the 2014 CPT codes are released later than expected, then the meeting will likely occur in December. Value -based Ben efits Subcommittee Minutes, 1/10/2013 Page 3 Straightforward Issues Topic: Coronary brachytherapy Discussion: Smits introduced a summary document limiting coverage of coronary brachytherapy to lines with coro nary stenting codes. There was no discussion. Actions: Remove 92974 (coronary brachytherapy) from all current lines except : i. 51 CORONARY ARTERY ANOMALY ii. 76 ACUTE AND SUBACUTE ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION iii. 108 HEART FAILURE iv. 195 CHRONIC ISC HEMIC HEART DISEASE New Discussion Items Topic: External elements exposure issues Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary document with proposed changes in placement of diagnosis codes for exposure to various elements. There was no discussion. Actions: 1) Move 992.9 ( Unspecified effects of heat and light) to line 688 DERMATOLOGICAL CONDITIONS WITH NO OR MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS OR NO TREATMENT NECESSARY 2) Move 994.5 ( Exhaustion due to excessive exertion ) to line 691 MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS WIT H NO OR MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS OR NO TREATMENT NECESSARY 3) Move 994.6 (motion sickness) to line 539 VERTIGINOUS SYNDROMES AND OTHER DISORDERS OF VESTIBULAR SYSTEM 4) For the ICD -10 Prioritized List: a. Place T67.9xxA ( Effect of heat and light, unspecifie d, initial encounter) on line 665 b. Place T73.3xxA ( Exhaustion due to excessive exertion, initial encounter) on line 668 c. Place T 75.3xxA (Motion sickness, initial encounter) on line 518 Topic: Stereotactic radiation therapy for intracranial AVMs Discus sion: Smits introduced a summary document with recommendations to add stereotactic radiation therapy as a treatment for ateriovenous malformations (AVMs). There was discussion about whether there should be a guideline or Value -based Ben efits Subcommittee Minutes, 1/10/2013 Page 4 other criteria to determine when an AVM should be treated at all. There is some morbidity associated with treatment. However, these lesions are generally seen as requiring treatment to prevent a catastrophic or fatal bleed in the brain. Gibson brought up that there is a trial currently underway comparing conservative treatment of AVM vs. interventions. Olson found the trial and noted that it may still be recruiting patients, and that there is no known date when the trial results are expected to be published. The decision was to have n o such guideline, but allow the individual patient and provider to decide when to treat. There was discussion about the relative cost of stereotactic radiation vs. other therapies such as embolization. Actual costs are not known precisely; however, radia tion treatment is outpatient, which lowers its overall cost. There was discussion about creating a guideline to define when radiation therapy should be done vs . other options; however, it was felt that this might be beyond the current evidence. Dodson noted that some treatments for AVMs are already on the Prioritized List and may need to be re -examined for efficacy. The group felt that this type of review may need to be conducted by HTAS. After debate , the group felt that other therap ies did not need to be reviewed at this time, but may be reviewed once the results of the RCT (the ARUBA trial) are known. The final decision was to add stereotactic radiation therapy to the line with AVM diagnoses. HERC staff was asked to monitor for trial results and b ring this topic back as needed. Actions: CEREBRAL ANEURYSM; COMPRESSION OF B RAIN Topic: Personal history of cancer V codes Discussion: Smits introduced a document proposing placement of various personal history of cancer diagnosis codes on funded lines. There was minimal discussion. Actions: 1) V10.09 (Personal history of mali gnant neoplasm of other gastrointestinal tract) was moved to lines 165 CANCER OF COLON, RECTUM, SMALL INTESTINE AND ANUS, 277 CANCER OF RETROPERITONEUM, PERITONEUM, OMENTUM AND MESENTERY, 341 CANCER OF PANCREAS, 459 CANCER OF GALLBLADDER Value -based Ben efits Subcommittee Minutes, 1/10/2013 Page 5 2) V10.29 (Personal h istory of malignant neoplasm of other respiratory and intrathoracic organs) was moved to lines 207 CANCER OF SOFT TISSUE , 276 CANCER OF ENDOCRINE SYSTEM, EXCLUDING THYROID; CARCINOID SYNDROME, 278 CANCER OF LUNG, BRONCHUS, PLEURA, TRACHEA, MEDIASTINUM AND OTHER RESPIRATORY ORGANS 3) V10.44 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of other female genital organs) was moved to line 311 CANCER OF VAGINA, VULVA AND OTHER FEMALE GENITAL ORGANS 4) V10.69 (Personal history of other leukemia) was moved to lines 181 ACUTE NON -LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIAS, 310 CHRONIC LEUKEMIAS; POLYCYTHEMIA RUBRA of other lymphatic and hematopoietic neoplasms) was moved to lines 221 NON -HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMAS, 249 ACUTE LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIAS LEUKEMIAS; VERA 6) V10.88 (Personal history of malignant neoplasm of other endocrine glands and related structures) was moved to line 207 CANCER OF SOFT TISSUE 7) V10.91 (Personal history of malignant neuroendocrine tumor) was mov ed to lines 209 CANCER OF SKIN, EXCLUDING MALIGNANT MELANOMA, 276 CANCER OF ENDOCRINE SYSTEM, EXCLUDING THYROID; CARCINOID SYNDROME, 622 SECONDARY AND ILL -DEFINED MALIGNANT NEOPLASMS Previous Discussion Items Topic: Other December follow up - Auricular acupuncture Discussion: Smits introduced a document with several possible placements for the HCPCS code for electrical stimulation of auricular acupuncture points . Testimony from several experts was introduced. Smits and Ocker both discussed that there appears to be confusion in the acupuncture community about the use of this code. The subcommittee felt that this code could be placed on the Excluded List, and if this causes problems with billing, then acupuncture providers can request that this code be re-reviewed. It is anticipated that acupuncturists can continue to use the current acupuncture CPT codes for in - office electrical stimulation of auricular points. The group did not feel that there was a need for a specific guideline prohibiting coverage of the proprietary ambulatory devices which stimulate these sites at this time. Actions: 1) Recommend p lacing S8930 Electrical stimulation of auricular acupuncture points; each 15 minutes of personal one -on-one contact with the patient on the Excluded List Value -based Ben efits Subcommittee Minutes, 1/10/2013 Page 6 Topic: Enzyme replacement therapy - Gaucher's disease Discussion: Livingston introduced a document summarizing the current evidence for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Gaucher's disease. Daniel Gruskin, from Medical Affairs at Genzyme , provided testimony that before ERT, individuals did not grow and gain weight. He provided comments on costs, and estimated that for a 65kg patient, the cost with perfect compliance would be approximately $250,000 a year. This price has been stable and not expect ed to go down in the future. There were questions about why it is so expensive , with the answer being that because it is a biologic product and it is a rare disease , the enzyme replacement therapy is very expensive to produce. Dr. Pramod Mistry gave test imony on behalf of G enzyme. Dr. Mistry is the founding director of the NHS Gaucher disease treatment center. Dr. Mistry provided the following disclosures \u2014he has received research grants from Genzyme Sanofi, funded by NIH , and the National Gaucher Founda tion (patient advocacy organization). He presented some clinical background and pointed out that the pattern of progression of the disease varies at different ages as well as there being a heterogen eous phenotypic presentation making it hard to predict natural history in any one individual, although disease is progressive. He presented two individual cases. The registry is a partnership between academia and industry and patient advocacy organizations. Splenectomies ha ve decreased since 1990. He indicat ed that there will be a Cochrane review published in a few mont hs. There is a new drug which is a substrate reduction therapy which will be tested in a placebo controlled trial with 60 patients in 12 countries and is also expected to be published in the n ear future . Dr. Koeller, OHSU, pediatric metabolic physician at OHSU. Director of OHSU Metabolic Clinic, gave testimony. He disclosed that he had no conflicts of interest. He argues that ERT for Gaucher's disease should be covered. This is a rare condi tion, there are no RCTs, and there is variability between patients. He indicated that there was interest in better understanding of the natural history of untreated disease. Questions were asked about the natural course of treatment. This is a lifelon g treatment, the enzyme half life is only a few days, so enzyme needs to be continually replenished. Standard of care is to reduce the dose in a stepwise manner to use minimally effective dose. Longer term treatment is much less than the starting dos e. Maintena nce therapy is once a month. Treatment has to be individualized due to heterogeneity of phenotypes. The treatment generally requires 15 -30 units/kg monthly . A question was asked about miglustat, a substrate reduction therapy. It is considered a second line agent for those that can't tolerate enzyme replacement. Therapeutic gains are signific antly less than ERT, and given the side effects profile, this treatment is not considered first line. New study by Cox in Journal of Value -based Ben efits Subcommittee Minutes, 1/10/2013 Page 7 Orphan Disease looking at long -term maintenance therapy with enzyme shows nearly half of patients on miglustat discontinued therapy due to side effects. It is non-inferior, but could be maintenance therapy for a small subset of patients. Subcommittee members discussed the c hallenges of a rare disease with heterogeneity and the types of evidence available. There is compelling information about the before and after data. A proposal was made to add coverage with a prior authorization process. Questions were asked about the prevalence of Gaucher's disease in Oregon. There is one pediatric Gaucher patient in the current OHP/Medicaid population. At the OHSU metabolic disease clinic there are a total of 10 -15 children with this disease. The symptoms can be debilitating and would disable people enough to not be gainfully employed. There are 15 patients in the US that receive completely free Cerezyme. The final decisio n was to revisit this topic once the Cochrane review and the other placebo -controlled trial are available. No change was recommended to current coverage. If the Cochrane review is going to be delayed for an extended period, the VBBS will consider this topic again earlier. HERC staff will plan on placing this topic on the May VBBS agenda pending those studies . Actions: 1) No changes were made to the current prioritization for enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher's disease Topic: Silver compounds for caries treatment Discussion: Livingston introduced a document with information regarding silver compounds for dental caries. Tyack shared that restoration of decayed teeth is the standard of care. He stated that he is opposed to having this replace standard of care. If evidence improves regarding the benefits of this type of therapy, then the VbBS could authoriz e utilization in a limited way with a strict guideline. Tyack sees the utility of this treatment primarily in third world environments. There may be limited situations in which this is a very good option (with additional data) including: medically comprom ised patients needing stabilization prior to dental care (people with recent MI), children waiting for hospital dentistry and don't want worsening of caries prior to restoration, and possibly primary posterior teeth close to exfoliation. Given that the va st majority of the costs of dental care are visit related, there are concerns about the costs of this given the need for frequent applications . It only makes sense if not going to do restoration, which is not standard of care. There are concerns that th is type of treatment could delay definitive treatment. Value -based Ben efits Subcommittee Minutes, 1/10/2013 Page 8 Dr. Gary Allen testified. He wished to clarify that the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry guideline allows for deferred care, one type of which is silver compound treatment. Dr. Allen testifi ed against adding a guideline to state that this is not covered if the CPT code is placed on the Excluded List. Coffman noted that there is no specific code for silver compound treatment and therefore it cannot be added to the Excluded List . Actions: 1) Coverage of silver compounds for treatment of dental caries was not adopted 2) A new guideline was adopted as shown in Appendix A specifying that silver compounds are not included on the Prioritized List for treatment of dental caries Coverage Guidances Topic : Viscosupplementation for osteoarthritis of the knee Discussion: Smits introduced a summary of changes recommended to bring the Prioritized List into agreement with the HERC Coverage Guidance on viscosupplementation for osteoarthritis of the knee. It wa s clarified that the CPT code is utilitized for a variety of procedures done on multiple joints and therefore could not be excluded. A guideline will be needed to exclude this particular procedure. Actions: 1. A new guideline was added to lines 384, 455, and 489 as shown in Appendix A. Topic: Percutaneous interventions for low back pain Discussion: Smits introduced a summary of changes recommended to bring the Prioritized List into agreement with the HERC Coverage Guidance on percutaneous interventions f or low back pain. Kirk advocated that the new guideline contain a very specific definition for radiculopathy, as these procedures are commonly requested and need specific criteria. The group felt that the definition of radiculopathy found in Guideline No te 37 would be sufficient. The group felt that the actual wording of this guideline should be incorporated into the new guideline to make it easier for readers to find the criteria and for administrative law judges to rule on the intent of the Commission. Note: Guideline Note 37 was modified at this meeting and the new wording will be reflected in the new guideline . The decision was made to follow the recommendations in the summary, with the guideline modified as shown in Appendix A. Value -based Ben efits Subcommittee Minutes, 1/10/2013 Page 9 Actions: 1) Move 720. 1 (Spinal enthesopathy) [M46.0 in ICD -10] from line 52 RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND OTHER INFLAMMATORY POLYARTHROPATHIES to lines 516 PERIPHERAL ENTHESOPATHIES --MEDICAL THERAPY and 531 PERIPHERAL ENTHESOPATHIES 62311, 64483, 64484) to line 400 DISORDERS OF SPINE WITH NEUROLOGIC IMPAIRMENT 3) Add a new guideline regarding coverage of percutaneous interventions for low back pain to lines with low back pain diagnoses as shown in Appendix A Topic: Manag ement of chronic otitis media in children Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary of changes recommended to bring the Prioritized List into agreement with the HERC Coverage Guidance on management of chronic otitis media in children. There was discussi on about when the co -morbidity rule should be applied for ear tubes. The group consensus was that the mentioned high risk groups (children with Down's syndrome, craniofacial anomalies, or cleft palate or children with documented speech and language delay with hearing loss and chronic otitis media) should have tubes covered. There was discussion about putting ear tube procedure codes on lines to pair with these diagnoses, but it was noted that providers would not pair the high risk condition, but rather ch ronic otitis media in these cases. The decision was that these high risk groups should have coverage explicitly called out in the guideline rather than using the co -morbidity rule. Various wording options were debated. Actions: 1) HERC staff to work with Drs. Kirk and Shaffer to refine guideline wording and bring back to a future meeting as a straightforward issue. Guidelines Topic: Immunization table/Prevention tables Discussion: Smits introduced a summary document recommending striking references to immunizations from the Prevention Tables and adopting a new guideline stating that immunizations are covered as recommended by the Oregon Immunization Program (OIP) . The committee wanted to specifically call out that the coverage is as recommended by the OIP, and this wording was added to the proposed guideline. There were questions about how the link would be updated, and staff responded that it would be checked with each new publication of a List. There was a question about why the Prioritized List si mply did not refer to ACIP guidelines. Staff responded that there may be occasion s when Oregon decides not to follow ACIP recommendations for a particular Value -based Ben efits Subcommittee Minutes, 1/10/2013 Page 10 vaccine or population group. Referring to OIP recommendations would allow statewide agreement on co verage. Actions: 1) A new guideline regarding immunization coverage was adopted as shown in Appendix A 2) The Prevention Tables were modified as shown in Appendix C Topic: Expensive/marginally effective drug guideline Discussion: Livingston introduced a docu ment outlining a proposed new guideline to not cover minimally effective or very expensive therapies, as determined by the Pharmacy and Therapeut ics (P&T) Committee. The committee asked for greater clarification about how the various HERC subcommittees an d other committees at other state agencies work together. Staff gave a summary of the various committees involved and their responsibilities and location. Staff discussed that by statute , the HERC cannot do evidence -based reviews of specific individual drugs, although the Commission can do review s of treatments that include drugs and classes of drugs . The HERC does have the authority to prioritize drugs, but historically the Commission has decided not to do this, based partially on the lack of ability to link NDC codes with diagnosis on prescriptions. Prescription drugs have been treated as an ancillary service. The P&T Committee is undergoing work to create a list of expensive/marginally effective drugs already. Questions were asked about whether a pr edefined definition for \"marginal or clinically unimportant benefit\" should be added to the proposed guideline. However, HERC staff felt that each therapy under consideration would need to be considered individually, in terms of the population affected, co st, alternate treatments available, and other factors. There was strong support for enabling the P&T Committee and HERC to conceptually work together. Pollack suggested changing the title of the proposed guideline to read \"marginal benefit or high cost\" rather than \"and/or\" to specify that the intent is to limit both marginally effective drugs and drugs that may or may not be effective but have very high cost. Similarly, it was suggested to strike the \"and\" after clause 2 to reflect that any of the claus es would be sufficient for low prioritization. The committee requested that staff bring back an organizational diagram of various state committees and commissions for greater member understanding. Actions: 1) Adopt a new guideline as shown in Appendix A Value -based Ben efits Subcommittee Minutes, 1/10/2013 Page 11 a. Note: see the HERC minutes for January 10, 2013 for final accepted wording b. Note: this guideline will not go into effect until October 1, 2013 2) Rename Line 692, \"Gastrointestinal Conditions and Other Miscellaneous Conditions with No or Minimally Effective T reatments or No Treatment Necessary.\" 3) Staff to add to the next biennial review consideration list: a. Consider adding a new line to January 2016 list that separates out miscellaneous conditions from Line 692. 4) Staff to create and share with the commission a n organizational diagram as requested. Topic: Guideline Note 37 abnormal reflexes radiculopathy Discussion: Livingston introduced a summary document with pr oposed modifications to the radiculopathy guideline. The group agreed to make the abnormal refle x clause stronger, and added the word \"markedly\" to this criteria rather than the proposed wording change. Actions: 1) Guideline note 37 was modified as shown in Appendix B Public Comment: No additional public comment was received Issues for next meeting : Guideline note 44 Menstrual Bleeding Disorders Prioritization of pseudobulbar affect Acupuncture for chronic pain diagnoses Uterine artery embolization Bilateral cochlear implants guideline Changes to the Prioritized List required for agreement with HERC coverage guidances on m anagement of recurrent acute otitis media in children, cervical cancer screening, t reatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, coronary artery oronary computed impingement syndrome surgery Modifications to the chronic otitis media treatment guideline Next meeting/Adjournment March 14, 2013, 9:00 am - 1:00 pm, Meridian Park Hospital, Room 117. The meeting was adjourned at 1:05 PM. Appendix A New Guidelines Value -based Ben efits Subcommittee Minutes, 1/10/2013 Appendix A, Page 1 New Guidelines Effective April 1, 2013 GUILDELINE XXX104, VISCOSUPPLEMENTATION OF THE KNEE Lines 384, 455, 489 Viscosupplementation of the knee (CPT 20610) is not covered for treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee GUIDELINE NOTE XXX105, EPIDURAL STEROID I NJECTIONS , OTHER PERCUTANEOUS INTERVENTIONS FOR LOW B ACK PAIN Lines 52, 400, 434, 562, 607, 638 Epidural steroid injections (CPT 62311, 64483, 64484) are covered for patients with persistent radiculopathy due to herniated disc, where radiculopathy is as defined in Guideline Note 37 as showing evidence of one or more of the following: A) Markedly abnormal reflexes B) Segmental muscle weakness C) Segmental sensory loss D) EMG or NCV evidence of nerve root imping ement E) Cauda equina syndrome F) Neurogenic bowel or bladder G) Long tract abnormalities It is rec ommended that shared decision -making regarding epidural steroid injection include a specific discussion about inconsistent evidence showing moderate short -term benefits, and lack of long -term benefits. If an epidural steroid injection does not offer benefi t, repeated injections should not be covered. Epidural steroid injections are not covered for spinal stenosis or for patients with low back pain without radiculopathy . The following interventions are not covered for low back pain, with or without radicul opathy: facet joint corticosteroid injection prolotherapy intradiscal corticosteroid injection injections botulinum toxin therapeutic medial branch Ben efits Subcommittee Minutes, 1/10/2013 Appendix A, Page 2 GUIDELINE NOTE XXX 106 IMMUNIZATIONS Lines 3,4 Immunizations are covered as recommended by the Oregon Immunization Program.

New Guideline Effective October 1, 2013 Note: the wording of this guideline was changed at the 1/10/13 HERC meeting. Please see the HERC 1/10/13 minutes for final accepted wording ANCILLARY GUIDELINE XXX, THERAPIES WITH MARGINAL BENEFIT OR HIGH COST It is the intent of the Commission that therapies that exhib it one or more of the following characteristics generally not be included in the funded region of the Prioritized List: i. Marginal or clinically unim portant benefit, ii. Very high cost in which the cost does not justify the benefit iii. Significantly greater cost compared to alternate therapies when both have similar benefit Where possible, the Commission prioritizes pairings of condition and treatmen t codes to reflect this lower priority, or simply does not pair a procedure code with one or more conditions if it exhibits one of these characteristics. As codes for prescription drugs and certain other ancillary services are not included on the Prioriti zed List, it is more difficult to indicate the importance of these services through the prioritization process. The Commission recognizes the evidence -based reviews being conducted by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee and hereby prioritizes those ser vices found in Table XX located at [website lin k to be determined] to be prioritized on the line listed below that corresponds with the condition being treated: Appendix A New Guidelines Value -based Ben efits Subcommittee Minutes, 1/10/2013 Appendix A, Page 3 684 280-289, V12.3, V18. 2-V18.3, V58.2 Diseases of the blood forming organs 685 290-319, V11, V17.0, V18.4, V67.3 Mental, -742, 779, V12.4, V17.2, V58.72 -744, V19.0 -V19.3, V57.4, 680-709, 757, 778, V13.3, V19.4, 7 72, 800 -999 Injury and poisoning 663 Appendix B Modified Guidelines Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 1/10/2013 Appendix B, Page 1 GUIDELINE NOTE 37, DISORDERS OF SPINE WITH NEUROLOGIC IMPAIRMENT Line: 400 Neurologic impairment or radiculopathy is defined as objective evidence of one or more of the following: A) Markedly abnormal reflexes B) Segmental muscle weakness C) Segmental sensory loss D) EMG or NCV evidence of nerve root impingement E) Cauda equina syndrome , F) Neurogenic bowel or bladder G) Long tract abnormalities Otherwise, disorders of spine not meeting these criteria (e.g. pa in alone) fall on Line 562 ACUTE AND CHRONIC DISORDERS OF SPINE WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC IMPAIRMENT Appendix C Prevention Tables Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 1/10/2013 Appendix C, Page 1 Birth to 10 Years _______________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________ _ Interventions Considered Leadin g Causes of Death and Recommended for the Conditions originating in perinatal period Periodic Health Examination Congenital anomalies Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) Unintentional injuries (non -motor vehicle) Motor v ehicle injuries _______________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________ _ Interventions for the General Population ___________________________________________________________________________________________ ____ ___________ _ SCREENING Height and weight Blood pressure Vision screen (3 -4 yr) Hemoglobinopathy screen (birth)1 infants4 Hearing, developmental, behavioral an d/or psychosocial screens5 Learning and attention disorders6 Signs of child abuse, neglect, family violence COUNSELING Injury Prevention Child safety car seats (age <5 yr) Lap-shoulder belts (age >5 yr) Bicycle helmet; avoid bicycling near traffic Smo ke detector, flame retardant sleepwear Hot water heater temperature <120 -130F Window/stair guards, pool fence, walkers Safe storage of drugs, toxic substances, firearms and matches Syrup of ipecac, poison control phone number CPR training for parents/car etakers Infant sleeping position Diet and Exercise Breast -feeding, iron -enriched formula and foods (infants and toddlers) Limit fat and cholesterol; maintain caloric balance; emphasize grains, fruits, vegetables (age >2 yr) Regular physical activit y* Substance User Effects of passive smoking* Anti-tobacco message* Dental Health Regular visits to dental care provider* Floss, brush with fluoride toothpaste daily* Advice about baby bottle tooth decay* Mental Health/Chemical Dependency Parent educat ion regarding: Child development Attachment/bonding Behavior management Effects of excess TV watching Special needs of child and family due to: Familial stress or disruption Health problems Temperamental incongruence with parent Environmental stressors such as community violence or disaster, immigration, minority status, homelessness Referral for MHCD and other family support services as indicated _________________________________________________________________________________________ ______ ___________ _ 1Whether screening should be universal or targeted to high -risk groups will depend on the proportion of high -risk individuals in the screening area, and other considerations . 2If done during first 24 hr of life, repeat by age 2 wk. 3Optimally between day 2 and 6, but in all cases before newborn nursery discharge. 4Parents with alcohol and/or drug use.
