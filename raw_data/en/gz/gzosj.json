Effective Date of an Eligible Employee's or Dependent's Insurance The Effective Date of an eligible employee's or Dependent's insurance will be the date the person becomes covered by Health Plan as a Point of Service for Member. Effective Date for a Newborn or Newly Adopted Child A newborn Dependent child is insured from the moment of birth for the first 31 days (including the date of birth). You must enroll the newborn dependent within 31 days of that dependent's birth in order for insurance to extend beyond the 31- day period. An adopted child is insured from the earlier of the date of adoption or the date of placement for adoption. You must enroll the adopted child for insurance and agree to pay the additional cost within 31 days of his eligibility date in order for insurance to extend beyond the 31- day period. If coverage terminates at the expiration of the 31- day period, the child will be considered a late enrollee and You must wait until the next annual Open Enrollment period to enroll the child for coverage. Age Limits for Dependent Children The age limit for Dependent children is under 26 years except for a full -time student who is on medical leave of absence as described below in this subsection, and for Disabled Dependent children, as described below under the \"Age Limits for Disabled Dependent Children\" subsection. If the Group Policyholder elected to make coverage available under Your plan beyond this age limit for Dependent children who are full -time students, then a Dependent child beyond this age limit who is a full-time student may be covered. The Dependent child must be of an age within the Student Age Limit as shown in your Schedule of Coverage. A \"full-time student\" is a Dependent child who is enrolled at a high school, college, university, technical school, trade school, or vocational school on a full-time basis. A \"full time student\" may also include, those who are on medical leave of absence from the school (or those who have any other change in enrollment in school) due to a medically necessary condition as certified by the attending Physician. Such student coverage shall commence on the earlier of: the first day of the medical leave of absence; or on the date certified by the Physician. Coverage for students on medical leave of absence is subject to a maximum of 12 months and shall not continue beyond the effective date of the termination of the Group Policy. Proof of status as a \"full time student\" must be furnished to KPIC at time of enrollment or within 31 days after attaining such status and subsequently as may be required by KPIC. The age limit for Dependent children does not apply to a \"full time student\" who is on medi cal leave of absence as described above, if, as a result of the nature of the sickness, injury, or condition, would render the dependent child incapable of self -sustaining employment and is chiefly dependent upon You for support and maintenance. Age Limit s for Disabled Dependent Children A Disabled Dependent child means Your child of any age who is both 1) incapable of self -sustaining employment by reason of a physically or mentally disabling sickness, injury or condition that occurred prior to the age limit and 2) chiefly dependent upon You for support and maintenance. Such child will continue to qualify as a Dependent until the earlier of the following dates: a) the date the child recovers from the physically or mentally disabling sickness, injury or condition; or b) the date the child no longer chiefly depends on You for support and maintenance.

KPIC shall determine whether the Dependent child meets that criteria before the child attains the limiting age. If KPIC fails to make the determination by that date, coverage of the child will continue pending our determination. Subsequently, proof of continued incapacity may be required by KPIC, but not more frequently than annually after the two- year period following the Dependent child's attainment of the limiting age. Proof of such incapacity and dependency must be submitted to KPIC within 60 days of KPIC's request.

The Cost Share incurred for the non- emergency service described above will apply to the Deductible and the Out of Pocket Maximum accumulation at the Participating Provider tier. No Deductible will apply if the Participating Provider Deductible has already been met. The Covered Person will not pay any amount if the Out -of-Pocket Maximum at the Participating Provider tier has already been reached. Exception to the above rule. For services subject to this section, the above rule does not apply and a Non- contracting Individual Health Professional may bill or collect from the Covered Person the out -of- network cost sharing, if applicable, if the Covered Person gave his or her written consent to the Non- contracting Individual Health Professional rendering the service and that written consent demonstrates satisfaction of all the following criteria: 1.

At the time consent is provided, the Non- contracting Individual Health Professional must give the Covered Person a written estimate of the Covered Person's total out -of-pocket cost of care. The written estimate shall be based on the professional's billed charges for the service to be provided. The Non- contracting Individual Health Professional must not attempt to collect more than the estimated amount without receiving separate written consent from the Covered Person or their authorized representative, unless circumstances arise during delivery of services that were unforeseeable at the time the estimate was given that would require the provider to change the estimate. 4. The consent must advise the Covered Person that he or she may elect to seek care from a contracted provider or may contact the Covered Person's insurer in order to arrange to receive the health service from a contracted provider for lower out -of-pocket costs. 5. The consent and estimate must be provided to the Covered Person in the language spoken by the Covered Person, if the language is a Medi -Cal threshold language, as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 128552 of the Health and Safety Code. 6.

Step therapy process Selected prescription drugs require step therapy. The step therapy program encourages safe and cost-effec tive medication use. Under this program, a \"step\" approach is required to receive coverage for certain high- cost medications. Refer to the formulary for a complete list of medications requiring step therapy. This means that to receive coverage You may first need to try a proven, cost -effective medication before using a more costly treatment. Treatment decisions are always between You and Your Provider. The step therapy program is a process that defines how and when a particular drug can be dispensed by requiring the use of one or more prerequisite drugs (1st line agents), as identified through the Covered Person's drug history, prior to the use of another drug (2nd line agent). Your licensed prescribing provider should prescribe a first -line medication appropriate for Your condition. If Your licensed prescribing provider determines that a first -line drug is not appropriate or effective for You, a second- line drug, may be covered after meeting certain conditions. Definitions specific to the Prior Authorization of Outpatient Prescription Drug and Step Therapy provisions: Exigent circumstances exists when a Covered Person is suffering from a health condition that may seriously jeopardize the Covered Person's life, health or ability to regain maximum function or when a Covered Person is using a drug while undergoing a current course of treatment.

Required by State Law For an explanation of continuation of medical benefit required by state law, refer to the Health Plan Point of Service for Evidence of Coverage. SAMPLE GC-POS -CA-LG (2023) 75 2023 COI (LG) NGF COORDINATION OF BENEFITS Application This Coordination of Benefits provision applies when the Covered Person has coverage under more than one Plan. If this provision applies, the benefit determination rules state whether this Plan pays before or after another Plan. The benefits of this Plan: 1. will not be reduced when this Plan is primary; 2. may be reduced when another Plan is primary and This Plan is secondary. The benefits of This Plan are reduced so that they and the benefits payable under all other Plans do not total more than 100% of the Allowable Expenses during any Calendar Year; and 3. will not exceed the benefits payable in the absence of other coverage. Order of Benefit Determination Rules This Plan determines its order of benefits by using the first of the following that applies: 1. General: A Plan that does not coordinate with other Plans is always the primary Plan. 2. Non- dependent \\Dependent: The benefits of the Plan which covers the person as a Covered Person, or subscriber (other than a Dependent) is the primary Plan; the Plan which covers the person as a Dependent is the secondary Plan. 3. Dependent Child--Parents Not Separated or Divorced: When This Plan and another Plan cover the same child as a Dependent of different parents, benefits for the child are determined as follow s: a. the primary Plan is the Plan of the parent whose birthday (month and day) falls earlier in the year. The secondary Plan is the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in the year. b. if both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the Plan which covered the parent the longer time is the primary Plan; the Plan which covered the parent the shorter time is the secondary Plan. c. if the other Plan does not have the birthday rule, but has the male\\ female rule and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the rule in the other Plan will determine the order of benefits. 4. Dependent Child: Separated or Divorced Parents: If two or more Plans cover a person as a Dependent child of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the child are determined as follows: a. first, the Plan of the parent with custody of the child; b. then, the Plan of the spouse or the Domestic Partner of the parent with custody of the child; and c. finally, the Plan of the parent without custody of the child. However, if the specific terms of a court decree state that one parent is responsible for the health care expenses of the child and the entity obligated to pay or provide the benefits of the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is the primary Plan. This paragraph does not apply with respect to any Calendar Year during which any benefits actually paid or provided before the entity has actual knowledge. Also, benefits for the child of a non- custodial parent who is responsible for the health care expenses of the child may be paid directly to the provider, if the custodial parent so requests. 5. Active/Inactive Service: The primary Plan is the Plan which covers the person as a Covered Person who is neither laid off or retired (or as that employee's Dependent). The secondary Plan is the Plan which covers that person as a laid off or retired Covered Person (or as that Covered Person's Dependent). If the other Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule does not apply. 6. Longer \\Shorter Length Of Coverage: If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits. the primary Plan is the Plan which covered a Covered Person, or subscriber the longer time. The secondary Plan is the Plan which covered that person the shorter time. SAMPLECOORDINATION OF BENEFITS GC-POS -CA-LG (2023) 76 2023 COI (LG) NGF Effect of Medicare This Plan will be primary to Medicare for an active employee and Dependent spouse or Domestic Partner of such active employee. This Plan will not be primary to Medicare if the Covered Person is eligible for Medicare as primary. Any such Covered Person may not continue enrollment under This Plan. Medicare is primary for an insured retiree or the Dependent spouse or Domestic Partner of a retiree age 65 or over; this applies whether or not the retiree or spouse or Domestic Partner is enrolled in Medicare. Members with Medicare and Retirees This plan is not intended for retirees and most Medicare beneficiaries. If, during the term of this Group Policy, You are or become eligible for Medicare or You retire, the following will apply: If You are the Insured Employee and You retire, Your coverage under this Policy will be terminated and You may be eligible to continue membership as described in Your Group Policy or in the Termination of Membership section of Your Point of Service Evidence of Coverage. If federal law requires that Your Group's health care plan be primary and Medicare coverage be secondary, Your coverage under this Policy will be the same as it would be if You had not become eligible for Medicare. If none of the above applies to You and You are eligible for Medicare, please ask Your Group's benefits administrator about Your membership options. Reduction in this Plan's Benefits When the benefits of This Plan are reduced, each benefit is reduced in proportion. It is then charged against any applicable Benefit Maximum of This Plan. Any benefit amount not paid under This Plan because of coordinating benefits becomes a benefit credit under This Plan. This amount can be used to pay any added Allowable Expenses the Covered Person may incur during the remainder of the Calendar Year, including any coinsurance payable under This Plan. Right to Receive and Release Information Certain facts are needed to coordinate benefits. KPIC may get needed facts from or give them to any other organization or person. KPIC need not tell, or get the consent of any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under This Plan must give KPIC any facts it needs to pay the claim. Facility of Payment A payment made under another Plan may have included an amount which should have been paid under This Plan. If it does, KPIC may pay that amount to the organization that made the payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under This Plan. KPIC will not pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes providing benefits in the form of services. In this case \"payment made\" means the reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services. Right of Recovery If the amount of the payments made by KPIC is more than it should have paid, KPIC may recover the excess from one or more of the following: 1. the persons KPIC has paid or for whom it has paid. 2. insurance companies. 3. other organizations. The \"amount of payments made\" includes the reasonable cash value of any benefits provided in the form of services. When a Covered Person's Injury appears to be someone else's fault, benefits otherwise payable under the policy for Covered Expense incurred as a result of that Injury will not be paid unless the Covered Person or his legal representative agrees: SAMPLECOORDINATION OF BENEFITS GC-POS -CA-LG (2023) 77 2023 COI (LG) NGF a. to repay KPIC for such benefits to the extent they are for losses for which compensation is paid to the Covered Person by or on behalf of the person at fault; b. to allow KPIC a lien on such compensation and to hold such compensation in trust for KPIC; and c. to execute and give to KPIC any instruments needed to secure the rights under a) and b).

Coordination of Benefits means the way benefits are payable under more than one medical or dental plan. Under Coordination of Benefits, the Covered Person will not receive more than the Allowable Expenses for a loss. Plan means any of the following which provides medical or dental benefits or services: 1. This Plan. 2. any group, blanket, or franchise health insurance. 3. a group contractual prepayment or indemnity plan. 4. a health maintenance organization (HMO), whether a group practice or individual practice association. 5. a labor -management trustee plan or a union welfare plan. 6. an employer or multi- employer plan or employee benefit plan. 7. any government progr am, including Medicare, as long as benefits under such program are not, by law, excess to this Plan; and they do expand the definition of \"Allowable Expenses, as set forth above. 8. insurance required or provided by statute.

For purposes of this Coordination of Benefit provision, Health Plan is not a separate Plan, and there shall be no Coordination of Benefits between the benefits provided by Health Plan under the Point of Service Evidence of Coverage and the benefits provided under the Group Policy. The benefits provided by a Plan include those that would have been provided if a claim had been duly made. Primary Plan \\Secondary Plan means that when This Plan is primary, its benefits are determined before those of the other Plan; the benefits of the other Plan are not considered. When This Plan is secondary, its benefits are determined after those of the other Plan; its benefits may be reduced because of the other Plan's benefits. When there are more than two Plans, This Plan may be primary as to one and may be secondary as to another.

Internal Claims and Appeals Procedures The Claims Process There are several types of Claims, and each has a different procedure for sending Your Claim to us as described below in this Internal Claims and Appeals Procedures subsection: Pre-service Claims (urgent and non-urgent) Concurrent care Claims (urgent and non-urgent) Post-service Claims SAMPLECLAIMS AND APPEALS PROCEDURES GC-POS -CA-LG (2023) 83 2023 COI (LG) NGF The Internal Appeals Process In order to afford You the opportunity for a full and fair review of an Adverse Benefit Determination, the Policyholder has designated KPIC as the \"named fiduciary\" for appeals arising under the Group Policy. In addition, there are separate Appeals procedures for Adverse Benefit Determinations due to a retroactive termination of coverage (rescission). If We deny Your Claim (Post Service, Pre- service or Concurrent Claims), in whole or in part, You have the right to request an Appeal of such decision. The internal Appeals process is described below. Additionally, our Adverse Benefit Determination notice will tell You why We denied Your claim and will include information regarding the mandatory appeal rights, including external review, that may be available to You. We must receive Your review request within 180 days of Your receiving Our Adverse Benefit Determination. Please note that We will count the 180 days starting 5 business days from the date of the notice to allow for delivery time, unless You can prove that You received the notice after that 5 business day period. Providing Additional Information Regarding Your Claim When You Appeal, You may send us additional information including comments, documents, and additional medical records that You believe support Your Claim.

Pre-service Claims and Appeals. Pre-service Claims are requests that we provide or pay for a Service that You have not yet received. Failure to receive authorization before receiving a service that must be authorized or precertified in order to be a covered benefit may be the basis of reduction of Your benefits or for our denial of Your pre- service Claim or a post -service Claim for payment. If You receive any of the Covered Services You are requesting before we make our decision, Your pre- service Clai m or Appeal will become a post -service Claim or Appeal with respect to those services. If You have any general questions about pre- service Claims or Appeals, please call 1-888-251-7052. Following are the procedures for filing a pre- service Claim, a non- urgent pre- service Appeal, and an urgent pre- service Appeal. Pre-service Claim o Send Your request in writing to us that You want to make a Claim for us to provide or pay for a Covered Service You have not yet received.

We will decide whether Your Claim is urgent or non- urgent unless Your attending health care provider tells us Your Claim is urgent. If we determine that Your Claim is not urgent, we will treat Your Claim as non- urgent. Generally, a Claim is urgent only if using the procedure for non- urgent Claims (a) could seriously jeopardize Your life, health, or ability to regain maximum function, or (b) would, in the opinion of a physician with knowledge of Your medical condition, subject You to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the Covered Services You are requesting. o We will review Your Claim and, if we have all the information we need, we will make a decision within a reasonable period of time but not later than 5 days after we receive Your Claim. We may extend the time for making a decision for an additional 5 days if circumstances beyond our control delay our decision, if we notify You prior to the expiration of the initial 5 day period.

Here are the procedures for filing a concurrent care Claim, a non- urgent concurrent care Appeal, and an urgent concurrent care Appeal: Concurrent care Claim o Tell us in writing that You want to make a concurrent care Claim for an ongoing course of covered treatment.
