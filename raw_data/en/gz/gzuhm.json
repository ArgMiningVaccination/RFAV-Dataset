Dr. Swaminathan added this is a \"dangerous trend,\" as there is very little data available about its health impact. 'We are in a data-free, evidence-free zone as far as to mix and match,' reported Reuters on July 12, 2021. She added, \"Studies are going on. We need to wait for that. Maybe it will be a very good approach. But, at the moment, we only have data on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, followed by Pfizer.\" \"It will be a chaotic situation in countries if citizens start deciding when and who will be taking a second, a third, and a fourth dose.\" She said, \"We are tracking policies in countries. We have four countries that have announced a booster program, and a few more are thinking about it.\" Previous studies focused on mixing COVID-19 vaccines include, but are not limited to, on May 19, 2021, researchers at the Carlos III Health Institute in Madrid announced results from the [CombiVacS](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01359-3) trial. This limited study found a robust immune response in people who received the BioNTech - Pfizer ( [Comirnaty](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/biontech-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine)) vaccine after initially being dosed with Oxford-AstraZeneca ( [Vaxzevria](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/vaxzevria-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca)) vaccine. As of July 2, 2021, the U.S. CDC's website states 'the safety and efficacy of a mixed-product series have not been evaluated. Therefore, both doses of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) series should be completed with the same product.'
