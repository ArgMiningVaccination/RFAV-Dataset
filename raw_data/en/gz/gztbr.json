Spirituality is defined and experienced differently by each person. Despite individual differences, there tends to be some overlap in what people experience when they have a spiritual practice. Spiritually can provide: purpose and direction a sense of connection and love encouragement for personal growth and self-imporvement answers to the \"BIG\" existential questions the foundation for a transcendent experience encouragement for serving others encouragement for the exploration of the mysteries of life A spiritual practice can include, but isn't limited to, mediation, prayer, inquiry and yoga. Why Meditate? Meditation helps to relieve feelings like stress, anxiety and fear while simultaneously bringing feelings of calm and clarity. There are a variety of meditation techniques, traditions, and technologies, but the essence of meditation is the same: the cultivation of mindful awareness and expanded consciousness. People are initially drawn to meditation for many different reasons. Some begin meditating because of a doctor's recommendation, seeking the health benefits of lowered blood pressure, stress reduction, and restful sleep. Others come to meditation seeking relief from the fearful, angry, or painful thoughts that constantly flood their mind. Still others come to meditation to find greater self-understanding, to increase their intuitive powers, or to improve their ability to concentrate. While what draws us to mediation varies, those with meditate regularly report improvement in their physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual lives. Here are just a few of the benefits Relief from stress and anxiety (meditation mitigates the effects of the \"fight-or-flight\" response, decreasing the production of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline) Decreased blood pressure and hypertension Lower cholesterol levels More efficient oxygen use by the body Increased production of the anti-aging hormone DHEA Restful sleep New research is also showing that meditation restores the brain. A landmark study conducted by Massachusetts General Hospital found that as little as eight weeks of meditation not only helped people feel calmer but also produced changes in various areas of the brain, including growth in the areas associated with memory, empathy, sense of self, and stress regulation.
