By Barbara Alden Wilson Updated on August 9, 2023 Medically reviewed by Natalie D. Muth, M.D. Trending Videos Paul Bradbury/Getty Images It's no fun when your child comes down with a cold or the flu. No one wants their kid to feel crummy, wake multiple times through the night, or miss school. So it's not surprising that many myths circulate about how parents can help their kids avoid or treat cold or flu viruses. There are some research-backed strategies to reduce your child's risk of getting sick and help them feel better faster. But there are just as many misconceptions. For example, can you get sick from being exposed to cold weather? (No, exposure to germs makes you sick.) Can you eat ice cream when you have a cold, or will it make cold symptoms worse? (Yes you can eat ice cream, and no, it won't make you feel word.) With experts' help, we set the record straight about 12 common cold and flu myths and share proven ways to help you and your family stay healthy all year long. 01 of 12 Myth: You Can Catch a Cold From Being Cold Most people know that only a cold virus causes a cold. But many believe that going outside not properly dressed (or with wet hair) on a cold day will worsen the symptoms of a cold virus. This is untrue. \"I think this comes from people noticing that more people get sick during the colder months, and that is true,\" says Susan Coffin, MD, medical director of infection prevention and control at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The real reason people get sicker in the winter? Proximity. People generally spend more time indoors and come in closer contact with people who are coughing and sneezing. So viruses tend to \"make the rounds\" and strike more people during the winter. You may also notice that your child's nose is runny when they are playing outside in the winter. That may be because cold, dry air can irritate the nasal lining, not because they have caught a virus. How to Protect Newborns in Cold Weather 02 of 12 Myth: If You Don't Have a Fever, You're Not Contagious Colds are highly contagious, whether you have a fever or not. Symptoms like a cough or runny nose might be present without an elevated temperature. And sometimes a fever shows up later in an illness, but the virus can spread before the thermometer registers it. Colds are most contagious two to four days into an illness, but people can continue spreading the virus up to two weeks after symptoms began. Adults and older children with colds generally have a low fever or no fever. Young children, though, often run a fever during a cold. The flu is contagious too, fever or no fever. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most healthy adults may be able to infect others from one day prior to showing symptoms and for five to seven days after that. Some young children with weakened immune systems may be contagious for longer than a week. The Do's and Don'ts of Fighting a Fever 03 of 12 Myth: Staying Away From Sick People Is the Only Way to Stay Well Staying away from sick people is one way to avoid getting sick, but it's not foolproof. After all, people can be contagious without showing any symptoms (see Myth #2). Experts point to the flu vaccine as the best preventive measure against the flu. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which advises the CDC on vaccine issues, recommends that all people age 6 months and older receive an annual flu vaccination. Unfortunately, no vaccines help protect against colds. But washing hands regularly will help you and your kids avoid both colds as well as the flu. 04 of 12 Myth: The Flu Vaccine Causes the Flu Flu vaccines do not cause the flu. The viruses in flu shots have been killed (or \"inactivated,\" as the pros say), which means they won't cause infection, according to the CDC. Getting a flu shot may cause mild symptoms that may feel a little like the flu, though. \"Most often, people misattribute the achy side effect that can sometimes follow the flu shot with the onset of the flu itself,\" says Dr. Coffin. Unlike the flu shot, the nasal spray flu vaccine (FluMist) does contain live viruses. The viruses are weakened, though, and don't cause the flu either. Mild reactions from the nasal spray flu vaccine may include a runny nose, sore throat, and headache. These side effects are mild and clear up quickly, especially compared to the symptoms of the flu. How to Explain Vaccines to Children 05 of 12 Myth: Getting Vaccinated Every Year Isn't Necessary The protection you received against the flu one year won't help you the next. For one thing, the primary flu strains that circulate change from year to year. That's why the flu vaccine is tweaked annually. Second, the protection you get from a flu vaccine declines over time, explains Dr. Coffin. Even if the flu vaccine you received the year before is a match for the virus strain you're exposed to, your body isn't likely to \"remember\" how to fend it off many months later. 06 of 12 Myth: If You Don't Get a Flu Shot by January, It's Too Late Get your annual flu vaccine is helpful whenever you get it. \"It's never too late,\" says Dr. Coffin. Flu season often peaks in February but can extend all the way into May. Because no one can accurately predict when the flu wanes in any given year, as long as a vaccine is available, you should get it for you and your children. Your state or local health department has a list of locations in your area where the vaccine is still available. That said, the earlier in flu season you get the vaccine, the better. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises that kids get their vaccines by Halloween. This Is The Best Time for Your Family to Get the Flu Shot 07 of 12 Myth: If You Hate Shots, You Can Just Get the Nasal Spray Instead The nasal spray flu vaccine (FluMist) is recommended for use in healthy people ages 2 to 49 who are not pregnant. But the CDC does not recommend FluMist for certain people, including: Children or teens receiving aspirinChildren younger than 5 years old with a history of recurrent wheezing or asthmaPeople at high risk for complications from influenza, including those with chronic heart or lung disease, such as asthma or reactive airways diseasePeople with medical conditions such as diabetes or kidney failurePeople with illnesses that weaken the immune system, or who take medications that can weaken the immune systemPeople who have a severe allergy to chicken eggs or who are allergic to any of the nasal spray vaccine componentsPregnant people Bottom line: Consult a doctor before deciding which vaccine is best for you or your children. 08 of 12 Myth: If You Get the Flu, You'll Be Immune After That There are many different strains of flu that circulate every year. While you may build up immunity against one strain for a few months after being infected, you are still vulnerable to catching other strains. It's possible to get the flu twice in one year. Not only that, but having one type of flu does not provide protection against colds, COVID-19, or a virus that causes pneumonia, says Dr. Coffin. 09 of 12 Myth: Your Cold Could Turn Into the Flu The flu and the common cold are caused by different viruses, so a cold can't \"morph\" into the flu. Because the two types of illnesses have similar symptoms, however, it can be challenging to tell the difference between these illnesses based on symptoms alone. Generally, a bout of the flu feels worse than a cold, with more intense symptoms such as fever, body aches, extreme tiredness, and a dry cough. People with colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose but less likely to develop serious complications pneumonia, bacterial infections, or hospitalization. Kids who are younger than 5, have asthma or other chronic health disorders, or have a weakened immune system themselves or in their family are all at high risk for flu complications and should get tested for the virus. Doctors can swab their nose or throat and detect whether they have the flu within minutes. Flu Symptoms in Babies and When to Call the Doctor 10 of 12 Myth: The Flu Isn't That Serious It's true that most people who get the flu will have a mild case and won't need medical care. Usually, they'll fully recover in less than two weeks. But make no mistake: The CDC warns that complications from the flu can be deadly. In fact, the CDC estimates that between 12,000 and 52,000 people die each year from the flu and up to 710,000 are hospitalized. Pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, and ear infections are examples of flu-related complications. The flu can also make chronic health problems worse. For example, people with asthma may experience asthma attacks while they have the flu. People at high risk for flu complications include children under 5, pregnant people, and people with chronic illnesses. 11 of 12 Myth: Flu Meds Will Clear Up Your Cold Too Antiviral drugs like Tamiflu work only against flu viruses. They won't reduce symptoms from the common cold, COVID-19, or any other flu-like illnesses. If you or your child has the flu, talk to a doctor about whether antiviral drugs are appropriate. The CDC recommends Tamiflu for patients who are under 2 or older than 65, who have certain chronic medical conditions, or who have severe flu symptoms. 12 of 12 Myth: You Should Avoid Dairy When You're Sick Phlegm is the thick, sticky mucus that drips down the back of the throat when a person has a cold. Eating dairy products like milk and ice cream might make mucus feel thicker, but it won't increase phlegm production. \"Drinking milk may make phlegm thicker and more irritating to the throat than it would normally be, but it doesn't cause the body to make more phlegm,\" says James Steckelberg, MD, professor of medicine at Mayo Medical School in Rochester, Minnesota. In fact, Dr. Steckelberg says that cold sufferers may benefit from consuming dairy products\u2014such as cream-based soups, ice cream, pudding, or milk\u2014since these can be soothing on sore throats and provide calories people otherwise might not get while feeling lousy. So, if the only thing your kid wants to eat when they're sick is ice cream, go ahead and let them! 5 Foods to Help Kids Fight Colds and the Flu Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback!
