Because the Catalogue must be prepared well in advance of the year it covers, changes in some programs inevitably will occur. Courses described in the Catalogue are subject to change without notice, and some listed courses are not of\u00ad fer~d each_ year. The quarterly Schedule of Classes, a publi\u00ad cation available from the Registrar's Office shortly before enrollment begins each quarter, provides information on classes to be offered, instructors, enrollment restrictions (for example, major only), class hours, room assignments, and examination schedules. Students should consult the appropriate academic unit for current information. Admis\u00ad sion to UCI does not guarantee admission to any particular course. Course Listings Undergraduate courses are classified as \"lower division\" and \"upper to courses num\u00ad bered 100-199. Courses numbered 200 and above are graduate courses. \"Lower division\" usually refers to fres_hman-sophomore courses, \"upper division\" to junior\u00ad seruor courses. However, junior and senior students may take lower-division courses, and freshmen and sopho\u00ad mores may normally take upper-division courses when upper-division standing is not a prerequisite. Prerequisites for courses should be noted carefully; a course has no pre\u00ad requisites unless indicated. Courses with sequential designations (for example, 1A-B-C) normally indicate multiple-quarter courses; except as noted, each course in a sequence is prerequisite to the one following. The letter L following a course number usu\u00ad ally designates a laboratory course. The \"(4)\" or \"(4-4-4)\" designation following the course title indicates the unit credits toward the 180 quarter units needed to graduate. Each \"4\" represents four quarter units. The letters F, W, or S after the course number and title . indicate the quarter(s) in which the course will be offered: fall, winter, or spring. The word Summer appears if the course is offered in Summer Session, 1980. While efforts have been made to provide information on when a course is offered, such information is not always available in time for inclusion in the Catalogue. The designation (4) F, W, S indi\u00ad cates a single course offered each quarter which can be ~ak~n only once for credit; a (4-4-4) F, W, S designation mdicates that credit may be earned in each quarter. When a course is approved for satisfaction of the UCI breadth requirement, the breadth category is indicated by a roman numeral at the end of the course description. A de\u00ad scription of the breadth requirement may be found on page 14.

Saxon President The University of California was chartered as the State's only Land Grant College in 1868. Throughout its first de\u00ad cades, the University's development was strongly influenced by leading educators and scholars from various parts of the country. Supported by the State and many generous bene\u00ad factors, the University was responsive to the needs of California while progressing on a steady climb toward emi\u00ad nence in academic and scientific achievement. Today the University system includes nine campuses\u00ad Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. All of the campuses adhere to the same admissions guidelines and high academic standards, yet each one has its own distinct character. Among the campuses there are five medical schools, three law schools, and a school of veterinary medicine, as well as professional schools of business ad\u00ad ministration, education, engineering, oceanography, and many others. The University's libraries are among the finest in the United States. In just over a century, the University has become one of the world's largest and most renowned centers of higher edu\u00ad cation. The faculty is internationally noted for its distin\u00ad guished academic achievements. On its nine campuses, the University has a total of 15 Nobel laureates. National Academy of Science membership on all campuses numbers 185-greater than the total for any other college or univer\u00ad sity system. The University maintains a variety of research facilities, ag\u00ad ricultural field stations, and extension centers in more than 100 locations throughout California. Public services include medical and dental clinics, information services for agri\u00ad cultural and urban populations, and a broad program of continuing education for adults in the arts, business, and professions. Under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy and with support from other agencies, the University operates three national research facilities: the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory adjoining the Berkeley campus, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory at Livermore, California, and the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Other major research facilities include Lick Observatory, White Mountain Research Station for high-altitude re\u00ad search, Laboratory of Radio Astronomy, Bodega Marine Laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Institute of Transportation Studies, Statewide Air Pollution Research Center, Space Sciences Laboratory, Hormone Research Center, and Philip L. Boyd Desert Research Center, among others. One of the University's unique resources is its roster of University Professors. The University Professor title is re\u00ad served for certain distinguished faculty members who are recognized nationally and internationally as scholars and teachers of exceptional ability. A University Professor may visit a number of University of California campuses during the academic year, holding conferences with students and staff and speaking before general public audiepces. A list of University Professors may be found on page 257. University Administration Under the State Constitution, governance of the University is entrusted to the Board of Regents. The Regents appoint the President of the University, and with the President's advice, appoint the Chancellors, Directors of major laboratories, Provosts, and Deans who administer the af\u00ad fairs of the individual campuses and other divisions of the University. Authority in academic matters is delegated by The Regents to the Academic Senate, which determines academic policy for the University as a whole. The Board of Regents includes seven ex officio board mem\u00ad bers, and 18 regular members who are appointed by the Governor for 12-year terms after consultation with an ad\u00ad visory committee. In addition, The Regents have the option of appointing a faculty Regent and/or a student Regent for a one-year term as voting Board members with full rights of participation. A constitutional amendment provides that \"Regents shall be able persons broadly reflective of the economic, cultural, and social diversity of the State, includ\u00ad ing ethnic minorities and women.\" They shall have \"full powers of organization and government, subject only to such legislative controls as may be necessary to insure compliance with the terms of the endowments of the Uni\u00ad versity and the security of its funds.\" The President is executive head of the total institution. Each of the nine campuses has a Chancellor as its chief adminis\u00ad trative officer. The Chancellor is responsible for the organi\u00ad zation and operation of the campus, including academic, student, and business affairs. For the names of University Regents, Officers, and Chancellors, see page 256. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981The Academic Senate, consisting of faculty and certain ad\u00ad ministrative officers, determines the conditions for admis\u00ad sion and degrees, subject to the approval of The Regents, authorizes and supervises courses and curricula, and ad\u00ad vises the University administration on the important mat\u00ad ters of faculty appointments and promotions and budgets. Students participate in policymaking at both the campus and Systemwide levels. The Irvine Campus Daniel G. Aldrich, Jr. Chancellor The University of California, Irvine has achieved distinction nationally and internatiofl:ally because of the high quality of its programs, faculty, and alumni. The campus challenges its students both academically and personally and relies on the commitment, curiosity, imagination, and judgment of The Irvine Campus 5 faculty and students to assure its continued intellectual and cultural vitality. Since the campus opened in 1965, enroll\u00ad ment has grown to approximately 10,000, including 7,700 undergraduate students, 1,300 graduate students, and 1,000 medical students and residents. ACADEMIC GOALS The University of California, Irvine gives students a foun\u00ad dation on which to continue developing their intellectual, esthetic, and moral capacities. The UCI faculty believes that a student's collective university experience should provide understanding and insight which are the basis for an intel\u00ad lectual identity and life-long learning. An important aspect of the educational approach at UCI is the emphasis placed on student involvement in independ\u00ad ent study, research, and the creative process as a comple\u00ad ment to classroom study. Independent research in labora\u00ad tories, field study, involvement in writing workshops, and participation in fine arts productions are normal elements of the UCI experience. In many departments special pro\u00ad grams and courses which involve students in original research and creative activities are integrated into the curriculum. UC IRVINE - 1980-19816 The Iroine Campus The Irvine campus provides an atmosphere conducive to creative work and scholarship at all levels, to the explora\u00ad tion of the accumulated knowledge of mankind, and to the development of new knowledge through basic and applied research. Along with these objectives, Irvine has a serious commitment to public service. The campus generates re\u00ad search expertise which may be applied to regional and national social issues, and seeks to provide humanistic understanding of the problems of society. ACADEMIC STRUCTURE Instruction and research programs at UCI take place in an academic structure which focuses on fundamental areas of knowledge, while at the same time providing for interdis\u00ad ciplinary and professional study. Five basic Schools repre\u00ad sent five fundamental areas of knowledge: Biological Sci\u00ad ences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences. Programs covering interdisciplinary and profes\u00ad sional studies are offered in the Department of Information and Computer Science, the Program in Social Ecology, the School of Engineering, the Graduate School of Administra\u00ad tion, and the Office of Teacher Education. The College of Medicine provides educational programs for medical and health sciences graduate students, medical residents, and practicing physicians. Programs in physical education, rec\u00ad reation, and intercollegiate athletics are provided by the Department of Physical Education. The Office of Academic Affairs has administrative respon\u00ad sibility for all programs of instruction and research. Matters of educational policy, including approval of programs, courses, and grades, are the responsibility of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate and its committees. The Irvine Division is part of the Academic Senate of the Uni\u00ad versity of California. Accreditation The University of California, Irvine is a member of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). The campus is fully accredited by the Senior Commission of WASC. This accreditation requires periodic review in ac\u00ad cord with WASC policies and standards. In addition, the undergraduate degree program of the Department of Chemistry is accredited by the American Chemical Society; the undergraduate Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical En\u00ad gineering options of the School of Engineering are accred\u00ad ited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology; the M.D. program of the College of Medicine is accredited by the Liaison Committee of the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical As\u00ad sociation; and the credential programs of the Office of Teacher Education are approved by the Commission for Teacher Preparation and Licensing. THE CAMPUS SETTING The campus is located 40 miles south of Los Angeles and five miles from the ocean. It is in the midst of one of the nation's fastest-growing regions. Residential areas are growing rapidly and are accompanied by the development of industrial and business centers. But even though some two million people live within a 20-mile radius, the sur\u00ad rounding hills and grazing lands give the campus a rural atmosphere. The general campus is planned in such a way that it will permanently retain an open feeling; the build\u00ad ings are arranged in a circle around a large central park. UCI includes 1,510 acres, the 202-acre San Joaquin Fresh\u00ad water Marsh Reserve, and the 31-acre University of Califor\u00ad nia Irvine Medical Center, located in Orange. Nearby beaches are lined by coastal communities including Newport Beach and Balboa Island, as well as State Park recreation areas. The climate is usually warm and dry; there is frequently a breeze from the ocean and occasionally fog. The Santa Ana, San Bernardino, and San Gabriel mountain ranges, Mexico, and popular desert resorts are within a two-hour drive. About 70 percent of the student body lives off campus and commutes daily. Student parking permits are valid for parking lots located throughout the campus, and all stu\u00ad dents may use the campus share-a-ride station located near Crawford Hall. Both the campus and the community are designed to encourage bicycle traffic, with bicycle trails connecting the University with the City of Irvine, the water\u00ad front areas of Newport Beach, and other communities. Bus service is available to major housing areas, shopping cen\u00ad ters, and beaches in the county. INSTRUCTIONAL AND RESEARCH FACILITIES University Library The UCI Library is a component of the extensive University of California Library system, whose libraries contain more than 14 million volumes. These libraries are committed to a resource sharing plan which will strengthen the resource base and usefulness of UCI's own library system. Estab\u00ad lished in 1963, the UCI Library collection has been carefully selected and developed in conjunction with the campus academic plan. The UCI Library system, which includes the Main Library, the Physical Sciences Library, the Biological Sciences Library, the Library of the Museum of Systematic Biology, the Medical Sciences Library, and the Medical Center Library, is an important resource for teaching and research, with a collection of over 900,000 volumes. Hold\u00ad ings include 18,000 serial titles of which 11,500 are currently active subscriptions. The Main Library is designed to provide maximum shelv\u00ad ing and reader space. With the exception of materials housed in special units, all periodicals and books are on open shelves and easily accessible to all readers. The fol\u00ad lowing Library departments provide specialized services to the users of the Main Library. The Reference Department contains an open-shelf collec\u00ad tion numbering some 25,000 volumes. Librarians in the Reference Department assist in the use of the reference tools and are prepared to find answers for a wide variety of library and campus questions. Informal instruction and guides designed for specific service areas are available. Formal instruction is offered through a course which intro\u00ad duces students to library research techniques (Humanities 75: Biblio Strategy). Bibliographical sessions for classes can be arranged by application at the Reference Desk. The Government Publications Department contains a col\u00ad lection of over 400,000 publications issued by the U.S. gov\u00ad ernment, Canada, the State of California, and international UC IRVINE - 1980-1981organizations. This department also contains the Orange County Public Affairs Collection, a resource of current documents on local affairs issued by both governmental and nongovernmental agencies. The Department of Special Collections contains noncirculat\u00ad ing holdings of rare books and early printed works, note\u00ad worthy or finely printed editions, exceptionally costly or fragile items, and manuscripts. Special subject collections include French literature of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Rene Wellek collection of the history of criti\u00ad cism, California history and literature, British naval history, contemporary poetry, dance, historical costume, and politi\u00ad cal pamphlet literature. The University Archives, which shares quarters with the Department of Special Collections, is the official repository for records having permanent value in documenting the history of the UCI campus. These include publications and other records of administrative and academic units, student organizations, and campus support groups. The Learning Resources Center collects, organizes, and makes available to library users nonprint materials which support campus academic programs. The Center also houses the DavidS. Saxon collection of recorded music which contains cassette tapes of classical and other music. The Center provides a playback area which allows for on\u00ad site consultation of materials in its collection. Terminals connected to campus computers are also available, along with an audio cassette tape duplication service and a media classroom. The Center provides a media reference and ad\u00ad visory service to the campus, and arranges for the rental of films used for instructional purposes on campus. The Serials Department includes a reading room in which current periodical and journal issues are on display. This department also provides reference service on microform collections housed in the microform room. This room is equipped with a variety of microform readers and has facilities for copying from microfilm and microfiche. The Main Library Copying Service, supplemented by coin-operated copying machines, makes it possible to ob\u00ad tain reproduction service at all times when the Main Library is open. Required or collateral reading materials are placed in the Reserve Book Room by faculty members for their students. Reserve materials circulate for short periods of time and are listed on computer-produced lists by course numbers. Other Main Library facilities include group study rooms, coin-operated typewriters, individual study seating, book lockers, and rooms containing study aids for blind and partially sighted students. When the University is in ses\u00ad sion, the Main Library is open 90 hours per week. Two branch libraries, the Physical Sciences Library and the Biological Sciences Library, are located in the Physical Sci\u00ad ences Building and the Science Lecture Hall, respectively. The Physical Sciences Library contains approximately 50,000 volumes on mathematics, physics, astronomy, and chemistry, and includes 900 current serial titles. An equal number of serial titles is held in the Biological Sciences Library. Hours of service are the same as the Main Library, and copying service is furnished in both branches. In addi\u00ad tion, the Library for the Museum of Systematic Biology, located in the Engineering Building, provides a reference collection on systematic biology and for the identification of plants and animals. The Irvine Campus 7 The Medical Sciences Library in the College of Medicine complex contains a collection of 98,000 volumes and sub\u00ad scribes to 1,600 current serial titles. Among the audio-visual services provided are microform reader/printers, video tape players, and slide projectors with tape players. Copying service is available here and in the Medical Center Library. The Medical Center Library is located at the University of California Irvine Medical Center. Its collection includes 22,000 volumes and 700 current serial subscriptions. This library serves primarily as the library for the Medical Center and is part of the campus library resources. Modern methods for increasing the speed and efficiency of library service have been or are being installed throughout the UCI Library system. The Main Library subscribes to a computer-based cataloging service which enables it to make books available much more rapidly than before. A computer-based circulation system is being installed in the Main Library and in the medical and physical sciences lib\u00ad raries which will greatly shorten the time required for loan transactions. On-line literature searching services are of\u00ad fered in a variety of machine-readable data bases. Informa\u00ad tion on this service may be obtained at the reference desks in the Main Library, branch libraries, and the Medical Sci\u00ad ences Library. Interlibrary loan service is available on a national and inter\u00ad national basis to all faculty, students, and staff. Bus service to UCLA is offered Monday through Saturday for faculty and students who need to use the UCLA libraries. Computing Facility The Computing Facility provides interactive and batch computing services to students, faculty, and staff on three multi-user computer systems (a Xerox Sigma-7, a Digital Equipment Corporation DECsystem-10, and a DEC PDP- 11/45) and a dozen microcomputer sys\u00ad tems (Terak 8510/a's). Computing at UCI is distinguished by the commitment to make computing an integral part of the academic programs at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, and by the commitment to extensive use of interac\u00ad tive computing. Approximately 40 percent of the students are involved with some form of instructional computing every year. The Facility can serve more than 140 interactive users simultaneously on its three multi-user systems. A wide variety of programming languages and applications packages is available to users. Limited capabilities are avail\u00ad able for remote computing at other campuses and labora\u00ad tories of the University. The Facility provides orientation sessions and instructional seminars on various aspects of using the local systems. Regular instruction in program\u00ad ming and other aspects of computing is provided by the Department of Information and Computer Science, other academic units, and University Extension. Information about campus computing services is available at the Computing Facility's Office of Production Services, 364 Computer Science Building.

Laser Microbeam Program The Laser Microbearn Program (LAMP) was established on the Irvine campus in 1979 as a national facility in the area of laser rnicrobearn biotechnology. LAMP will function as a research, training, and service facility, and will provide in\u00ad teraction between the laser industry and the academic biomedical research community. The facility will serve as a resource to promote research in cell biology, developmental biology, neurobiology, genetics, and oncology. Micro\u00ad surgery will be performed at subcellular, cellular, and tissue levels. The program is conducted in the School of Biological Sciences and is funded through a grant from the Biotechnology Resources Program of the National Institutes of Health. Natural Land and Water Reserves System The University of California manages and maintains a sys\u00ad tem of more than 20 reserves that are representative of the State's habitat and geographic diversity. These serve as outdoor laboratories for students, faculty, and staff, and are intended primarily for purposes of education: and research. The reserves are administered by local campus manage\u00ad ment committees who control their uses. The Irvine campus is responsible for two Reserves: the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve and the Burns Pinon Ridge Reserve. SAN JOAQUIN FRESHWATER MARSH RESERVE The San Joaquin Fresh water Marsh Reserve, one of the last remaining freshwater marshes of southern California, is a 202-acre reserve adjacent to the Irvine campus. The Marsh consists of a series of freshwater ponds and their attendant aquatic flora and fauna, and is especially known for its rich bird life, both resident and migratory. Researchers and ob\u00ad servers have recorded as many as 90 species of birds in the Reserve, a major stopping point on the Pacific Flyway. BURNS PINON RIDGE RESERVE The Burns Pinon Ridge Reserve is located near the town of Yucca Valley in San Bernardino County. It is a 265-acre parcel of high-desert habitat representing an ecotone be\u00ad tween montane and desert biota, with mixtures of Joshua tree, pinon pine, and juniper woodland. The Reserve has primitive camping facilities, and is used primarily for over\u00ad night field trips and research by faculty and students from the School of Biological Sciences. Irvine Arboretum The Arboretum is a botanical garden developed and man\u00ad aged by the School of Biological Sciences. Among its goals is the establishment of a habitat planted with the flora characteristics of the southern grassland-coastal ecosystem. When completed, the campus flora plus the botanical garden will serve as important scientific and educational resources for research and teaching. Museum of Systematic Biology The Museum of Systematic Biology is a scientific resource charged with cataloguing and maintaining specimens of local plants and animals. Its holdings, totaling over 120,000 specimens, provide environmental scientists and students of ecology with information dealing with the occurrence, identification, and distribution of the species living in our immediate environment. In addition to its general holdings, the Museum is custodian for three outstanding special collections: the Sprague Conchological Collection, the Cassady-Lewis Herpetological Collection, and the Rudkin Lepidopteran Collection. Educational Technology Center The primary focus of the Educational Technology Center (ETC) is the interactive use of the computer as an aid to learning in many different areas. Emphasis is on the small, inexpensive graphic personal computer just beginning to be available for schools and horne. The activities of the project range from fundamental research to the development of learning modules. The Center is particularly interested in developing production capabilities which will lead toward the efficient large-scale production of highly effective computer-based learning modules. UCI Medical Center and Community Clinics The UCI Medical Center (UCIMC) is a fully accredited gen\u00ad eral and emergency care hospital located in the City of Orange. UCI College of Medicine faculty and resident physicians are the professional staff for medical services at the Center; a full complement of inpatient and outpatient services in virtually all medical specialties is offered. The Center serves as a principal facility for teaching and re\u00ad search programs for medical students, providing them with direct involvement in patient care. Licensed for 493 beds, the Medical Center each year handles 15,000 inpatient ad\u00ad missions, 140,000 outpatient visits, and 47,000 adult and pediatric emergency visits. UCI clinical facilities also include the Community Clinic of Orange County (CCOC) in Santa Ana and the North Orange County Community Clinic (NOCCC) in Anaheim. Both clinics provide educational experiences and patient services in primary care. Important components of UCI's medical education andre\u00ad search programs are also conducted at affiliated hospitals and clinics, in particular, the Veterans Administration Medical Center, Long Beach; Memorial Hospital Medical Center, Long Beach; and Childrens Hospital of Orange County. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981For further information about University-operated clinical facilities and other facilities associated with the UCI Clinical Services System, see the College of Medicine portion of this Catalogue. RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS The University of California is the State's primary research institution. Most scholarly research and creative activities are supported by University funds or by grants from federal and state agencies, foundations, corporations, and indi\u00ad vidual sponsors. In addition to University funds, over 22 million dollars were granted to the University of California, Irvine in the 1978-79 fiscal year for basic and applied re\u00ad search, and other scholarly activity. While most research by faculty and students of the University takes place at the departmental level, the academic quality of many educa\u00ad tional programs is enhanced by Organized Research Units and Focused. Research Programs that extend beyond de\u00ad partmental or disciplinary boundaries. The Irvine Campus 9 Organized Research Units An Organized Research Unit (ORU) ordinarily consists of an interdepartmental group of faculty, students, and other researchers engaged in a continuing program of research, supported by both University and extramural funding. The work of some OR Us is directed toward the solution of com\u00ad plex contemporary problems, while others focus u~on basic research which is essential to our understandmg of natural or social phenomena, or of humanistic ideas and expressions. Organized Research Units established on the Irvine campus by The Regents of the University are the Developmental Biology Center, the Institute of Transporta\u00ad tion Studies (ITS), and the Public Policy Research Organiza\u00ad tion (PPRO). A Cancer Research Institute was approved by The Regents in early 1980. DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY CENTER Previously named the Center for Pathobiology, the Devel\u00ad opmental Biology Center is an Organized Research Unit UC IRVINE - 1980-198110 The Irvine Campus (ORU) that provides a focus within the School of Biological Sciences for research in several related areas of develop\u00ad mental biology and genetics. One of the goals of the Center is to understand the mechanisms responsible for the gener\u00ad ation of form and spatial patterns of differentiation during development. Experimental techniques from the fields of cell biology, embryology, genetics, and endocrinology are applied mainly to insects, hydra, and amphibians. The work carried out in the Center has potential implications in such areas as the control of growth and regeneration of lost body parts and the cause and prevention of both cancer and birth defects in humans. Research in the Center also in\u00ad volves the analysis of insect developmental hormones which may provide new methods to control agricultural pests and disease vectors. INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES The Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS) was estab\u00ad lished to foster research, education, and training in the field of transportation. The Institute has been an Organized Re\u00ad search Unit within the University of California since 1947, with its main branch located on the Berkeley campus. The Irvine campus branch was established in 1974. Emphasis at Irvine has been on the development of a strong interdisciplinary research capability. Completed and ongo\u00ad ing research projects have involved faculty and students from the Graduate School of Administration, the School of Social Sciences, the School of Engineering, the Program in Social Ecology, the College of Medicine, and the Depart\u00ad ment of Information and Computer Science. Research at Irvine focuses upon transportation systems planning and evaluation, fiscal and administrative management of public transit systems, labor relations in the transit industry, and energy and environmental issues. Current projects include \"Shared Ride Taxis as Community Transportation,\" \"Im\u00ad proving Transit Performance,\" \"The Cost of Transit Labor Work Rules,\" \"The Impact of Union-Management Relations on Productivity and Efficiency in Urban Mass Transit,\" \"Economic Structure, Community Development, and Transportation Systems: An Empirical Analysis of House\u00ad hold Activity Patterns,\" and\" Analysis of Trends in Califor\u00ad nia Port Development.\" A portion of Institute funding is used to sponsor postdoctoral research fellowships and visiting professorships. The Institute maintains an extensive research collection to support these activities. The 10,000-volume collection in\u00ad cludes books, journals, dissertations, and technical reports in the field of urban transportation. A wide range of ser\u00ad vices is offered including computer-based literature search\u00ad ing. Students and faculty are encouraged to meet with the Information Center's trained personnel to discuss research needs and strategies. PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH ORGANIZATION The Public Policy Research Organization (PPRO) is an Or\u00ad ganized Research Unit established to foster empirically grounded research into problems of public policy. In pursu\u00ad ing its broad policies studies mission, PPRO has focused its effort since 1973 on information technology and public pol\u00ad icy, and more recently has developed research programs concerned with public management and human cost accounting. As a campuswide research unit, PPRO draws its research expertise from the full faculty and student resources of the Irvine campus. Of the 35 faculty and students currently doing research in PPRO, the majority are from the School of Soda! Sciences, the Department of Information and Computer Science, the Program in Social Ecology, and the Graduate School of Administration. Among PPRO researchers are experts in law, public administration, economics, public finance, political science, sociology, psychology, planning, and public health. PPRO projects are multidisciplinary by nature. Among the 18 projects currently in progress are studies of the effec\u00ad tiveness of Federal Civil Service reforms; the use of infor\u00ad mation systems in U.S. and European local governments; the social and mental health impacts of economic change; the use of deadly force by police officers; the incidence of injuries to children in auto accidents; and case studies of the problems and costs faced by new users of computer technology. \u00b7 PPRO maintains extensive survey research, data analysis, and data archiving capabilities which support its research efforts and which serve researchers in various UCI schools and departments. The Organization also maintains a re\u00ad search collection, open to all students and faculty, which includes scholarly and practitioner-oriented journals, specialized reference material, and unpublished papers and dissertations. A limited number of graduate assistantships and work\u00ad study positions are available to qualified UCI students who wish to participate in PPRO research projects or in the preparation of research proposals. Focused Research Programs Focused Research Programs are established by the Chancel\u00ad lor for the purpose of developing and, for a limited period of time, sustaining interdisciplinary research that could not be carried out through individual effort or within a single academic unit. Because of the developmental nature of these programs, they ordinarily are approved for no more than three years and are supported primarily by University funds. If a research program develops successfully, it may continue with extramural and/or University support. Five groups of faculty, students, and other researchers have been recognized as Focused Research Programs. Chemistry and Physics of Crystal Surfaces Researchers from the Departments of Chemistry and Physics are investigating the nature of chemical reactions on surfaces, using the scattering of laser light from surfaces as the basic experimental technique, and exploring fundamental questions in the theory of vibrational motion of surfaces and absorbed atoms. Human Stress A series of collaborative, theory-based studies addressing key questions about human stress is being conducted by a group from the Program in Social Ecology and the Depart\u00ad ment of Community and Environmental Medicine. Oncology Scholars in basic and clinical sciences from several depart\u00ad ments of the School of Biological Sciences and the College of Medicine are focusing and coordinating their research UC IRVINE - 1980-1981toward understanding and controlling cancer. In early 1980 The Regents of the University established a Cancer Re\u00ad search Institute at UCI as an Organized Research Unit to carry out work in this important area. The Institute encom\u00ad passes substantially the same group of researchers as the Focused Research Program. Perception and Higher Mental Processes Faculty and students from the Schools of Social, Biological, and Physical Sciences, and the College of Medicine are in\u00ad vestigating the bases of and relationships between percep\u00ad tion, language, and higher cognitive functions. Social Network Analysis Substantive research problems in social history, social an\u00ad thropology, sociology, and psychiatry are being investi\u00ad gated by researchers from the School of Social Sciences, the Department of History, and the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior. The researchers are concerned with understanding group dynamics based on a network of in\u00ad dividual social relationships. In addition, they collaborate in the development and exchange of network methodologies and theoretical frameworks. SUPPLEMENTARY EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS Summer Sessions Two summer sessions will be held on the Irvine campus. Session I will be from June 22 to July 29, 1981. Session II will be from July 30 to September 4, 1981. Students may enroll in either session or both sessions. Those who enroll in both sessions and take an academic program equivalent to a reg\u00ad ular quarter may accelerate their progress toward a degree. A wide variety of courses from the regular sessions is planned, supplemented by experimental offerings available only during the summer. Admission is open to all univer\u00ad sity students, to high school graduates, to qualified appli\u00ad cants over 18 years of age, and to qualified high school students who have completed their junior year. Admission to Summer Session does not constitute admission to a regu\u00ad lar session of the University; therefore, official transcripts of educational records are not required. Fees for Summer Ses\u00ad sion are the same for out-of-state students as for California students. Information regarding Summer Session may be obtained from the Summer Session Office, (714) 833-5493. Applica\u00ad tion forms and course listings will be available in March. University Extension University Extension offers more than 1,200 courses and special programs each year, many of them innovative and experimental in content, format, and teaching methods. Ex\u00ad tension programs are designed for those adults in the community who wish to continue their education on a part-time basis for professional and career advancement, for expansion of cultural horizons, for development of sci\u00ad entific literacy, for growth in personal awareness and human interrelationships, and for enhanced understanding of the great issues of modern society. The Irvine Campus 11 Utilizing the resources of the University, Extension offers credit and noncredit courses, seminars, conferences, lec\u00ad ture series, and certificate programs. Educational and career counseling is available to men and women through the Extension-sponsored Women's Opportunities Center, (714) 833-7128. University Extension programs are sup\u00ad ported by fees charged to students. A free catalog may be obtained from the University Extension Office, (714) 833-5414. Air Force ROTC Through arrangements with the University of Southern California, two-, three-, and four-year Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps (AFROTC) programs are available to all qualified UC Ii:vine students. Academic units earned in this program are counted as elective units toward fulfill\u00ad ment of UCI graduation requirements. Successful comple\u00ad tion of the AFROTC program leads to a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the Air Force Reserve. Two-and three-year scholarships are available to qualified students on a competitive basis. Four-year scholarships for incoming students must be applied for before January 15 in the year prior to entering college. All scholarship recipients receive full tuition (UC Educational and Registration Fees), re\u00ad quired fees and books, and $100 a mori.th. All qualified cadets are provided 25 hours of flying lessons during their final year in the program.

Higher averages than this may be required only in honors programs. Stu\u00ad dents who fail to attain a C (2.0) average in courses required in the major program may, at the option of the major unit, be denied the privilege of pursuing a major program in that unit. (In this context, \"the courses required in the major program\" are defined as the courses required for the major and offered by the program of the student's major.) 6. Credit for the last three quarters of work immediately preceding graduation earned in residence on the Irvine campus (i.e., a minimum of one year full-time attendance at UCI). Exceptions to this rule may be allowed, with prior departmental approval, to students enrolled in the Educa\u00ad tion Abroad Program. 7. Students enrolled at UCI from their freshman year may elect to meet as graduation requirements (UC, UCI, school, and major requirements) those in effect at the time of en\u00ad trance or those subsequently passed after entrance. Stu\u00ad dents transferring from other collegiate institutions may elect to meet as graduation requirements those in effect at the time of entering the other collegiate institution, those in effect at the time of transfer to UCI, or those subsequently passed. A student who seeks readmission to UCI more than three consecutive quarters after withdrawing from student status must adhere to the graduation requirements in effect at the time of readmission or those subsequently passed. BREADTH REQUIREMENT 8. Effective with new freshmen entering UCI in fall quar\u00ad ter, 1980, and thereafter, a candidate for the bachelor's de\u00ad gree must satisfy the following UCI breadth requirement. Normally, three four-unit courses are required in each of the areas listed below: I. Writing II. Natural Sciences III. Social and Behavioral Sciences IV. Humanistic Inquiry V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, or Computer Science NOTE: In satisfying the breadth requirement, a student may count toward breadth no more than three courses taken within the discipline of the major. For example, a student majoring in Philosophy may count no more than three Philosophy courses toward breadth. I. Writing Requirement The Writing Requirement consists of three courses beyond the Subject A Requirement. Except where otherwise noted below, students must satisfy the Subject A Requirement prior to fulfilling the Writing Requirement. Two of the three courses required must be lower-division courses and normally should be successfully completed prior to the junior year. The third course must be an upper-division course, and it may be taken only after the successful completion of 84 quarter units (achievement of junior status) and completion of the lower-division re\u00ad quirement. Lower-Division Requirement: The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division requirement must be completed with a grade of C-(1.7) or better. Students may select from the courses specified below: 1. Writing 39A-B, Expository Writing. 2. Humanities 15-16, Humanities Writing Sequence, taken in conjunction with an associated course as designated in the quarterly Schedule of Classes. During the winter and spring quarters of the 1980-81 academic year, Humanities 15-16 will be associated with such courses as English 28, History 29, and Comparative Literature 50. Students must enroll concurrently in the associated course selected. NOTE: Students held for Subject A who have scored between 550 and 600 on the College Board English Composition Achievement Test may enroll in Writing 39A or Humanities 15 (see 1. and 2. above); completion of either course with a grade of at least C\u00ad (1.7) will simultaneously fulfill the Subject A Requirement. 3. Any two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course, Humanities lA-B-C. Students held for Subject A may begin this option provided they concurrently enroll in,the Writing Workshop. 4. Students who complete Writing 39A or Humanities 15 with a grade of B (3.0) or better may substitute as the sec\u00ad ond course of the lower-division Writing Requirement one of the following courses in creative writing, non-fiction, or journalism: Writing 30, 31, 32, or 38. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981Upper-Division Requirement: The course taken to fulfill the upper-division requirement must be completed with a grade of C (2.0) or better. The requirement may be satisfied by completing any one of the following: 1. Writing 139. 2. An upper-division course in creative writing, non\u00ad fiction, or journalism. Such courses frequently have special prerequisites. Students may not use such a course to satisfy the requirement unless they have attained a B or better in both courses taken to satisfy the lower-division Writing Requirement. 3. An upper-division course designated in the quarterly Schedule of Classes as approved for satisfaction of the requirement. Students who fail to attain the required grades in the courses taken in fulfillment of the Writing Requirement should refer to page 43 for further information. II. Natural Sciences Students must select a three-course sequence from one of the following areas: Biological Sciences: Students may select any three courses from Biological Sciences 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, plus one from 14, 15, 19, 20; 18A, B, C.

Linguistics: Linguistics 50 and two courses from Linguis\u00ad tics 110, 120, or Social Sciences SOA; Social Sciences 136A- 153F-151L. Logic and Mathematics: Prior to fall quarter, 1980, the UCI breadth requirement was met by students taking courses in three schools outside the school of the major (Schools of Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, or Social Sciences) or, upon approval of petition to their academic dean, by taking courses in Information and Computer Science, Social Ecol\u00ad ogy, Engineering, or the Graduate School of Administra\u00ad tion. Specifically, such students took 24 units in one school outside the major and 12 units in each of two other schools outside the major. Normally a student took six four-unit (standard or full) courses in one school outside the major and three four-unit (standard or full) courses in each of two other schools outside the major (referred to as the UCI 6-3-3 distribution). The requirement did not apply to students majoring in Engineering. All students planning to transfer to UCI should see page 33 for details on fulfilling the UCI breadth requirement, APPLICATION FOR GRADUATION In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student should file an Application for Graduation at the appropriate dean's office, preferably during the first quarter of the senior year, but no less than six months before the expected day of graduation. SCHOOL AND DEPARTMENTAL REQUIREMENTS In addition to the University requirements listed above, each undergraduate student must satisfy the degree re\u00ad quirements for the major selected. UCI, schooL and de\u00ad partmental or major requirements may overlap; courses taken to fulfill a school or departmental requirement (e.g., the physics course requirement in the School of Biological Sciences) may also help fulfill the UCI breadth require\u00ad ment. Information on specific school and departmental or major degree requirements, as well as courses offered, can be found elsewhere in this Catalogue. The student should have determined an area of concentra\u00ad tion no later than the beginning of the junior year, having made certain that the background and the preparation pre\u00ad requisite to junior and senior work in the major have been accomplished. New and continuing undergraduate stu\u00ad dents should read the section on Planning an Under\u00ad graduate Program; transfer students should also read the section on Planning for Transfer to UCI. UC IRVINE - 1980-198116 Planning an Undergiaduate Program CHOOSING A MAJOR Many students select their University major-the field of study which represents their principal academic interest\u00ad at the time they fill out their University of California Under\u00ad graduate Application. Some students, however, are not ready to choose a major at the time they apply, and still others may wish to change to a different major after they have enrolled. (Students interested in a major from the School of Humanities should be aware that students do not select a specific major within that School until late in the sophomore year, in order to assure that they have oppor\u00ad tunities to explore the various disciplines represented in the School.) In preparation for choosing a major, students need to familiarize themselves as much as possible with UCI and its many programs. Entering students are exposed to a wide range of areas of study, and it is not unusual for students to become enthusiastic about academic disciplines previously unfamiliar to them. Much depends on initia\u00ad tive---on how fully a student takes advantage of opportu\u00ad nities that come through suggestions for further study and through informal communication with faculty and students. All students are expected to choose a major by the begin\u00ad ning of the junior year. It is important to look well ahead to this decision and to think about it carefully during the freshman and sophomore years. When considering possi\u00ad ble majors, students need to keep in mind that some major programs require quite specific preliminary study. At the same time, excessive early concentration could reduce a student's options and prevent moving to a major in a dif\u00ad ferent field. Furthermore, courses required for graduation need to be considered. For these reasons, it is desirable for students to plan their programs carefully and thoughtfully, seeking a balance between exposure to a variety of academic areas and completion of courses which are pre\u00ad requisite to a major under consideration. A qualified stu\u00ad dent interested in two areas of study may graduate with a double major by fulfilling the degree requirements of any two programs. The General Catalogue is a good place to find specific in\u00ad formation about programs available, requirements for majors, and course offerings. At UCI a number of tradition\u00ad ally separate academic disciplines have strong interrelation\u00ad ships, so that.the academic environment is influenced by a wide range of interactions among disciplines. As a com\u00ad plement to classroom study, UCI encourages its students to UC IRVINE - 1980-1981Planning an Undergraduate Program 17 become involved in a variety of educational experiences In addition to consulting the Catalogue, students are en- such as independent study, laboratory research, field couraged to talk to academic counselors and faculty ad- study, writing workshops, computing, and fine arts pro- visors about the opportunities which are open to them. ductions.

While advisors may not be familiar with all fields, they can suggest ways to investigate other areas of study and be helpful in planning a lower-division program which will keep several options open. Once a student decides on a major, the actual procedure to formalize the decision is not complicated. A form called the \"Undergraduate Petition for Change of Major\" must be completed whenever a student who has no major is ready to declare one, or whenever a student wishes to change from one major to another. The form is available from academic counselors and the Registrar's Office. ACADEMIC ADVISING At the time of admission every undergraduate student at UCI is assigned for purposes of academic advising to the school or program that corresponds to the student's selec\u00ad tion of major or school. New students are encouraged to arrange appointments with an academic counselor as soon as possible after they have been admitted to plan their academic programs. Jurisdiction over all questions of academic regulations and academic standing rests with the dean or director of the school or program to which a stu\u00ad dent is assigned for purposes of academic advising. Thus, all requests to add or drop courses, waive or change gradu\u00ad ation or other requirements, and change area of academic concentration must be processed through the office of that dean or director. A student who has not indicated a choice of major or school on the application form (the \"unaffiliated student\") is placed in the General Studies Advising Program and, after an individual interview, is temporarily assigned to an academic unit for advising purposes. This assignment con\u00ad tinues until the student reaches a decision concerning a major, at which time the student completes a petition for a change of major and is transferred to the corresponding school or program. Each academic unit is responsible for maintaining a system which provides academic advising by faculty members. These systems differ among the academic units. In some, all of the faculty serve as advisors; in others, only certain members of the faculty are designated as advisors. In each instance, however, every student will have a faculty ad\u00ad visor. Responsibility for informing students of the identity of their advisors rests with the dean or director of the ap\u00ad propriate academic unit. This is normally done by letter, but students may obtain the information by telephone from the office of the appropriate dean or director (see the listing below). A student may request a change of advisor through the chief academic advisor or the dean of the unit. A change in area of concentration often involves a change in advisor. This will always be the case when the change of concentra\u00ad tion is to a different school or program; the new school or program will assign a new advisor and inform the student. In some schools and programs consultation between stu\u00ad dents and their faculty advisors is mandatory. Students are responsible for knowing the governing regulations of the school or program to which they are assigned for academic advising purposes. Irrespective of whether or not consulta\u00ad tion between student and advisor is required, the student is responsible for initiating and maintaining periodic contact with the assigned faculty advisor. An appropriate time for the initial contact is during the week prior to the beginning of the student's first classes at UCI, or earlier at the time of regis\u00ad tration if this is possible. Thereafter, consultation between student and advisor at the time of registration for each sub\u00ad sequent quarter is desirable. The actual frequency of these meetings will be determined by the desires of the student, the advisor, and the governing regulations. It is the obliga\u00ad tion of the faculty advisor to help the student plan an ap\u00ad propriate program of study and interpret the academic reg\u00ad ulations of the campus, but the student is solely responsible for meeting the academic regulations and remaining in good academic standing. In addition to faculty members, academic counselors are available in each unit to assist students with major selec\u00ad tion, program planning, and petitions. Also, peer academic advisors (trained upper-division and graduate students) can help students plan their programs, select or change majors, and arrange for tutoring as necessary. Besides fur\u00ad nishing counsel on such matters, these advisors dispense general campus information and refer students to the ap\u00ad propriate faculty and staff personnel for assistance with specific problems. In the fall, each new student is required to go to the ap\u00ad propriate academic dean's office prior to the beginning of classes during Academic Advising and Orientation Week for advice concerning class enrollment and to pick up a Class Verification and Identification Card. These plans for new students and provisions for continuing students are explained in detail in the Schedule of Classes. PREPARATION FOR GRADUATE OR PROFESSIONAL STUDY Undergraduate students ought to keep the possibility of future graduate or professional study in mind as they plan their academic programs, and they should discuss their career goals with their advisors. Students who have an idea of the direction in which they would like to go should familiarize themselves with the basic requirements for postbaccalaureate study and keep those requirements in mind when selecting courses. Further, students should supplement their undergraduate programs by anticipating foreign language requirements at major graduate schools and by intensive work in areas outside their major that are of special relevance to their intended graduate work. For information about graduate or professional study in a given field, students may consult the Graduate Advisor or an academic counselor in the academic unit corresponding to the area of interest. Also, the Career Planning and Placement Center frequently sponsors seminars on specific career areas and offers a number of services useful to those considering graduate or professional study. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981Graduate Division Jaime E. Rodriguez Dean Graduate study and research are vital and integral parts of academic life at the University of California, Irvine. Pro\u00ad grams leading to doctoral or master's degrees, or to educa\u00ad tion credentials, are offered in over 30 academic and profes\u00ad sional areas. Many UCI graduate programs and research activities have achieved national or international recogni\u00ad tion for excellence. Following a 15-year period in which many new programs were established and developed, the Graduate Division expects continued growth due to the at\u00ad tractive qualities of its programs and the continuing need for highly trained scholars and professionals. UCI graduate programs will continue to improve and to evolve in direc\u00ad tions that are consistent with the University's teaching, re\u00ad search, and public service missions. We believe there is a special atmosphere at UCI that springs from the discovery and dissemination of new knowledge, as well as from meet\u00ad ing new challenges. With the exception of programs conducted by the College of Medicine for the training of medical professionals, the general administration of graduate education is by the Dean of the Graduate Division in accordance with academic policies established by the Academic Senate and by the Graduate Division 19 Graduate Council, a standing committee of the Irvine Divi\u00ad sion of the Academic Senate. There is no separate graduate faculty at UCI; graduate work is supervised by academic units and faculties which have concurrent responsibility for undergraduate studies. Through our Graduate Affirmative Action Program, posi\u00ad tive steps are being taken to increase the number of under\u00ad represented and disadvantaged students (including minorities and women) participating in the graduate academic and professional programs of the University. Ap\u00ad propriate assistance is offered during the admission pro\u00ad cess, and we strive to ensure that all students will have a reasonable chance to attain their academic objectives. UCI does not discriminate against any applicant for admission, fellowships, or other student assistance on the basis of sex, ethnic origin, age, physical handicap, religion, or marital status. A great deal of information about graduate education at UCI is published in the UCI General Catalogue and in our an\u00ad nual Graduate Study announcement. The staff of the Graduate Division Office is ready to help answer your ques\u00ad tions about admission, academic policies and procedures, graduate programs and degrees, financial assistance, stu\u00ad dent services, and other matters of concern to graduate stu\u00ad dents or applicants. ADMISSION TO GRADUATE STANDING Applicants for admission to the Graduate Division at UCI must concurrently apply for acceptance into a specific UC IRVINE - 1980-198120 Graduate Division graduate program to work toward an advanced degree or California education credential. A general requirement for admission is that the applicant hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts, Letters, Philosophy, or Science (or an acceptable equivalent) from a recognized academic institution. A grade average of at least B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) or better is normally required. Applicants for programs leading to M.A., M.S., or Ph.D. degrees must submit scores from the Graduate Record Examination Aptitude Test; the Graduate Manage\u00ad ment Admission Test (GMAT) is preferred by the Graduate School of Administration. Most graduate programs have additional admission requirements. Each applicant's file is evaluated by the admissions commit\u00ad tee of the specific graduate program and by the Dean of the Graduate Division on the basis of such factors as academic subject preparation, scholarship, letters of recommenda\u00ad tion, Graduate Record Examination scores, and examples of previous work. A critical question is whether the appli\u00ad cant's academic objectives can reasonably be satisfied by the graduate programs on this campus. The University of California does not have the capacity to accommodate all applicants who meet the minimum admission require\u00ad ments. Prospective graduate students are encouraged to assess the professional placement opportunities that are anticipated in the field of interest. It is generally recognized that the number of traditional academic appointments in certain disciplines is limited. There are, however, other attractive career options, many of them as yet unrecognized, for highly motivated men and women who demonstrate intel\u00ad lectual strength, integrity, and discipline in earning an ad\u00ad vanced degree from a respected university. UCI is commit\u00ad ted to help graduate students develop, in addition to their academic training, the communication and problem-solving skills that also may be critical to future careers. How to Apply Application forms and the annual Graduate Study an\u00ad nouncement giving application deadlines for each program are available from the Graduate Division, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717. For fall quarter admission, application by February 1 is required by some programs and strongly encouraged for all others. Some academic units will accept applications for winter or spring quarter admission, for which the deadlines are October 15 and January 15, respectively. Two complete sets of official records covering all postsecondary academic work attempt\u00ad ed, regardless of length of attendance, are required. These must include official evidence of all college-level degrees conferred. To be official, records must bear the Registrar's signature and the seal of the issuing institution, and should be sent directly from the Registrar to the Graduate Division. University of California transcripts must be requested by the applicant, including those who are UCI under\u00ad graduates. A summary of credit transferred and recorded on the transcript issued by the institution granting the de\u00ad gree will not suffice, except in the case of graduates of the University of California. Until a complete official academic record including certification of degrees awarded has been received, final admission and registration will not be granted. One set of transcripts and all other credentials are retained by the Graduate Division, and they may not be withdrawn or used by students for any purpose. The sec\u00ad ond set is forwarded to the appropriate academic unit, re\u00ad tained there, and may be used by the student in conferring with faculty advisors. Three letters of recommendation are required. Letters from professors or instructors in disciplines related to the proposed course of study are preferred. The application must be accompanied by a nonrefundable $25 Application Fee in the form of a check, draft, or money order for the exact amount made payable to Regents-UC. In order for the applicant to receive full consideration, it is necessary that letters and official transcripts be received before the published deadlines. Where students have work in progress at the deadline dates, final transcripts covering such work must be received before a provisionally admitted student is officially enrolled. A formal notice of the admission decision is sent to each applicant by the Dean of the Graduate Division as soon as possible after the application and complete records are re\u00ad ceived, and after the department has made a recommenda\u00ad tion. All applicants are advised to await this official notifica\u00ad tion of admission before making definite plans or arrange\u00ad ments for attending UCI. Admission of Foreign Students All applicants who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. must submit a preliminary application form. This is intended to save time and expense for those who cannot be admitted. Foreign applicants are subject to the standard admission requirements and must provide satis\u00ad factory evidence of financial support in order to obtain necessary visa documents. As it normally takes much longer to obtain credentials and process foreign applica\u00ad tions, foreign students are urged to apply at least six months prior to the deadline dates. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981Every foreign applicant, except those from countries where English is the primary language, must take the TOEFL Examination (Test of English as a Foreign Language). Ordi\u00ad narily a score of 550 or better is required. Upon admission and prior to the first day of instruction, the spoken and written English communication skills of a student who has not attained a TOEFL score of at least 600 or who is being considered for appointment as a teaching assistant or reader will be evaluated. The primary purpose of this policy is to identify potential communication problems and to recommend an appropriate program for the development of language skills. LIMITED STATUS Under certain conditions, students holding a bachelor's de\u00ad gree are admitted to Limited Status in order to prepare for admission to a graduate or professional program by enroll\u00ad ing for a prescribed set of courses (usually undergraduate courses), or to pursue a specific academic program which does not lead to a recognized degree. Although Limited Status does not represent graduate standing, admission may be offered by the Dean of the Graduate Division upon the recommendation of an academic unit which has agreed to oversee the student's program. Limited Status students may enroll in graduate courses with the permission of the instructor, but courses taken while in Limited Status will not satisfy degree or residency requirements for any UC graduate program to which the student eventually might be admitted. Admission to Limited Status does not imply ad\u00ad mission to the Graduate Division at some later date. ACADEMIC ADVISING In each academic unit with an advanced degree program, there is at least one formally appointed Graduate Advisor or Director of Graduate Studies. The Graduate Advisor is a regular faculty member responsible for supervising graduate study in that unit, for monitoring the academic progress of graduate students, and for seeing that each graduate student is assigned a faculty advisor. The Graduate Advisor plays a key role in the academic lives of graduate students, advising students and other faculty members about program requirements and the academic policies of the Graduate Division, approving study lists, and evaluating academic petitions. In many academic units the Graduate Advisor is instrumental in the selection of students for assistantship and fellowship appointments, and in the supervision of graduate student teachers. In most schools there is also an Associate Dean for Graduate Studies who coordinates many of the functions which affect graduate students within that school. Both Graduate Ad\u00ad visors and Deans are important links between the student and the Graduate Division administration. Most graduate students also will have an individual faculty advisor or advising committee, especially after the first year of advanced study. When a student is advanced to candi\u00ad dacy for the Ph.D., the doctoral committee becomes the primary source of academic guidance, but the academic pe\u00ad titions of students must still be approved by the Graduate Advisor. / Graduate Division 21 ACADEMIC POLICIES The academic policies described in this section of the Catalogue apply to students enrolled in the Graduate Divi\u00ad sion. Other regulations and procedures of importance to graduate students are covered in the Academic Regulations and Enrollment and Other Procedures sections, and in the description of each graduate program. Scholastic Requirements A graduate student is expected to make satisfactory prog\u00ad ress toward an approved academic objective, as defined by the faculty of the program in accordance with policies of the Graduate Council, and to maintain a satisfactory grade point average for all work undertaken while enrolled in the Graduate Division. Satisfactory progress is determined on the basis of both the recent academic record and overall performance. A Graduate Division student normally is ex\u00ad pected to complete satisfactorily at least eight units of academic credit applicable to the graduate program in each regular academic session (unless on an approved Leave of Absence), and satisfy all requirements of the academic program according to an approved schedule. For a graduate student, only the grades A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship. However, a UCI course in which a grade of B-is earned may be accepted in partial satisfaction of the degree requirements if the student has a grade point average of at least 3.0 in all courses applicable to the degree. Graduate students may not apply courses graded Pass or Not Pass toward any degree or satisfactory progress re\u00ad quirements. A grade point average below the B level (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) is not satisfactory, and a student whose grade point average is below that level is subject to academic dis\u00ad qualification. A student's academic progress ordinarily is evaluated on the basis of the academic record. A few weeks after the end of a quarter, an updated copy of each enrolled student's permanent academic record is available from the Registrar. This record lists all UCI courses for which a Graduate Division student was enrolled (including courses taken through the Intercampus Exchange Program), the grades assigned, and the cumulative grade point average. Formal candidacy for an advanced degree, degrees conferred, cer\u00ad tain examinations passed, unit credit accepted from other institutions, and other important academic information is recorded also. A graduate student who has not demonstrated satisfactory progress is not eligible for any academic appointment, such as Reader, Research Assistant, or Teaching Assistant, and may not hold a fellowship or o,ther award which is based upon academic merit. Grading With the consent of the academic units involved, individual study and research courses at the graduate level may be graded Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory (S/U). Certain graduate courses are graded S/U only, with the approval of the Graduate Council. A grade of Sis equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit is given for a course in which a grade of U was assigned. UC IRVINE - 1980-198122 Graduate Division Graduate Division students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program; may not be applied to the requirements for an advanced degree; and do not count toward the minimum number of units for which a graduate student must enroll. The grade of Incomplete (I) may be assigned by an instruc\u00ad tor when the student's work is of passing quality, but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the student's control. Although Incomplete grades do not affect a graduate student's grade point average, they are an impor\u00ad tant factor in evaluating academic progress. The maximum amount of time that an instructor may allow for making up incomplete work is three quarters of enrollment, but stricter limits may be applied. When work is completed within the time allowed, the student should ask the instructor to sub\u00ad mit a change of grade notice to the Registrar, ordinarily through the dean of the school in which the course was offered. If not made up within the time allowed, an I grade is recorded permanently. IP (In Progress) is a transcript notation restricted to sequen\u00ad tial courses extending over two or more quarters, for which use of the IP notation has been approved. When the last quarter of the sequence is completed, the grade for the final quarter is then assigned for all quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. A student who received an NR (No Report) transcript nota\u00ad tion must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. After one quar\u00ad ter, an NR becomes an F wh1ch will remain permanently upon the student's record. A graduate student may repeat once a course in which a grade below B (3.0) or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade is used in computing the stu\u00ad dent's grade point average for the first eight units of re\u00ad peated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades are used. Additional information about grading may be found in the Academic Regulations section. Academic Disqualification After consultation with the student's academic unit, the Dean of the Graduate Division may\u00b7disqualify a student who has a grade point average in graduate and upper\u00ad division courses below 3.0 for two or more successive quar\u00ad ters; or fails to pass (or does not take) a required examina\u00ad tion within the time specified for that graduate program; or does not maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of an approved program of study. Ordinarily, a student whose work does not meet academic standards will be given written notice and a reasonable period of time in which to make up all deficiencies. Unsatis\u00ad factory academic progress may be determined on the basis of explicit requirements, but the professional judgment of the faculty upon review of all graduate work undertaken by the student is paramount. Prior to taking final action, the Dean of the Graduate Divi\u00ad sion ordinarily will notify a student who is subject to academic disqualification and will provide reasonable op\u00ad portunity for the student to correct erroneous or outdated academic records, to submit other information or comments in writing, or to request a second review of his or her academic performance. Upon written notice of academic disqualification by the Dean of the Graduate Division, disqualification will be noted on the formal academic record of that student. Fol\u00ad lowing the formal notice of disqualification, the student may appeal to the Dean of the Graduate Division only on the basis of procedural error. Academic Residence A graduate student is considered to be in residence during an academic quarter if at least four units of academic credit are earned in regular upper-division or graduate courses. Credit for one academic quarter of residence may be earned by completing at least two units of credit in approved courses in each of two Summer Sessions. In the case of Ph.D. students, these must be consecutive sessions. Course Load Limitations Full-time academic enrollment ordinarily is expected of graduate students at the University of California. Full-time study is defined as the completion of at least 12 units of upper-division or graduate academic credit per quarter, in\u00ad cluding credit for supervised research or teaching. Graduate students may enroll in lower-division courses with the approval of their academic advisors, but such courses are not considered to be part of any graduate program. Graduate students ordinarily may not receive credit for more than 12 units per quarter in graduate courses, or 16 units in upper-division courses, or a proportionate number in combination. Course loads in excess of 16 units must be approved in advance by both the student's Graduate Ad\u00ad visor and the Dean of the Graduate Division. With the approval of the academic unit and the Dean of the Graduate Division, a graduate student may enroll for fewer than 12 units of academic credit. However, payment of all regular student fees is required regardless of the number of units of credit earned. To be eligible for an appointment as a Research Assistant, Teaching Assistant, or Reader, and for most fellowships, a student must enroll full time. Satisfac\u00ad tory progress toward completion of the academic program is required of all students. Continuous Registration A graduate student is expected to enroll for each regular academic session (fall, winter, and spring quarters) until all requirements for an advanced degree or credential have been completed, including final examinations and the sub\u00ad mission of an approved thesis or dissertation. Enrollment is not official until all required fees have been paid, and the student's Enrollment in Classes Petition is completed cor\u00ad rectly, signed where necessary, and submitted to the Regis\u00ad trar. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollment is correct. For more information, see the En\u00ad rollment and Other Procedures section. A student engaged in study or research outside the State of California for an entire quarter ordinarily will register in absentia. Unless an official Leave of Absence (see below) has been granted, or a petition to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of registration has been approved by the Dean of the Graduate UC IRVINE - 1980-1981Division, a student who does not register by the final dead\u00ad lines for any regular quarter will lose graduate standing and candidacy for any advanced degree will lapse. Prior to re\u00ad suming graduate study in the University, a former student must successfully apply for readmission. A readmitted stu\u00ad dent must register and then be advanced or reinstated to candidacy at least one quarter before receiving an advanced degree. A degree cannot be conferred earlier than the sec\u00ad ond quarter following readmission. A graduate student who decides to leave the University after enrolling and paying fees for a quarter must file an official Notice of Withdrawal or Cancellation with the Dean of the Graduate Division. A graduate student in good academic standing who wishes to withdraw and intends to return within one year may submit both the Notice of Withdrawal and an application for a Leave of Absence. If the leave is approved, the student remains in good stand\u00ad ing and need not apply for readmission in order to enroll at the expiration of the leave period. Leave of Absence A graduate student who withdraws from the University with the intention of returning within one year and wishes to avoid a lapse of student status should request a Leave of Absence. A Leave of Absence of up to one year's duration may be granted by the Dean of the Graduate Division upon the recommendation of the student's academic unit, subject to the following guidelines: 1. The student must have satisfactorily completed at least one quarter in residence and be in good academic standing. The leave must be consonant with the student's academic objectives. 2. Leave ordinarily is approved in cases of serious illness or other temporary disability, or temporary interruption of the student's academic program for other appropriate reasons. 3. A student on leave is not eligible for assistance from a University fellowship, research grant, or financial aid pro\u00ad gram, and may not hold an academic appointment. During a period of leave, a student may not take comprehensive or qualifying examinations nor earn academic credit (except by an approved transfer of credit from another institution). Leave may not be granted to students who intend to make use of most University resources or facilities (including housing), and it may be revoked if they do so without authorization. 4. A student failing to register for the next regular academic session following the expiration of leave will lose graduate standing and will be subject to the readmission policy de\u00ad scribed below. Readmission A student who previously withdrew from the University, or who failed to meet the continuous registration requirement, may request readmission to the Graduate Division by sub\u00ad mitting an Application for Readmission with a nonrefunda\u00ad ble $25 fee. Readmission may be granted by the Dean of the Graduate Division, when recommended by the academic unit. If readmitted, a student's previous academic work will be applied toward the requirements for an advanced degree only with the approval of the Graduate Advisor and the Dean of the Graduate Division. A readmitted student must satisfy the academic requirements in effect at the time of Graduate Division 23 readmission and may be required to satisfy certain re\u00ad quirements a second time, including formal advancement to candidacy. A readmitted student will be expected to complete at least one additional academic quarter in resi\u00ad dence before receiving an advanced degree, which will be conferred no earlier than the second quarter following readmission. Intercampus Exchange Program A graduate student in good standing who wishes to take advantage of educational opportunities available only at another campus of the University of California may do so through the Intercampus Exchange Program. Ordinarily, an exchange student will have demonstrated a high level of scholarship during at least one year of graduate study at the home campus and have well-defined academic objectives. Approval of the faculty advisor, the host department(s), and the Deans of the respective Graduate Divisions is re\u00ad quired. Direct arrangements between faculty members on the two campuses are encouraged so as to ensure that the courses, seminars, or facilities will be available to meet the student's needs. Students may take courses on more than one campus of the University in the same academic session. The exchange student enrolls and pays fees on the home campus, and then enrolls at the host campus, following the procedures of that Registrar's Office. A report of academic work completed will be transferred to the student's academic record on the home campus. Although eligible for all normal student services, the exchange student is a vis\u00ad itor, not formally admitted to graduate study at the host campus. Application forms for the Intercampus Exchange Program may be obtained from the Graduate Division Office of the student's home campus, and should be filed with that Office at least four weeks before the beginning of the quarter. Transfers of Credit At least one-half of the course requirement for a master's degree must be completed while in residence in the UCI Graduate Division. Credit for up to one-fifth of the minimum number of units required for a master's degree may be allowed for graduate-level work completed at another institution or through University Extension prior to enrollment in the UCI Graduate Division, but such courses do not count toward the required number of units in 200- series courses. Up to one-half the units required may be accepted from another Graduate Division of the University of California. After enrollment, the student must initiate a formal petition for such credit. The acceptance of unit credit earned in another program must be recommended by the academic unit to which the student has been admitted and be approved by the Dean of the Graduate Division. No units of transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B (3.0) or equivalent was assigned. Under no circumstances will grade credit be transferred. A student currently enrolled in a master's degree program or ori a Leave of Absence may receive unit credit (not grade credit) for graduate-level work completed at another in\u00ad stitution or through University Extension only with the prior approval of the departmental Graduate Advisor and the Dean of the Graduate Division. No transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B or equiva\u00ad lent was assigned. UC IRVINE - 1980-198124 Graduate Division A student who enters the Graduate Division in the fall quarter will receive appropriate credit for courses taken in the preceding UCI Summer Session(s), provided that the formal date of admission precedes Summer Session enroll\u00ad ment. Continuing graduate students will receive credit for courses taken in an intervening UCI Summer Session .. GRADUATE DEGREES Master's Degrees The master's degree is conferred at the end of the academic quarter in which all requirements have been satisfied, sub\u00ad ject to the final approval of the Graduate Council. Prior to the beginning of the final quarter of enrollment the student must be advanced to candidacy for the degree. Therefore, an application for advancement to candidacy, initiated by the student and approved by the academic unit, should be submitted to the Dean of the Graduate Division at least 30 days before the opening of the quarter in which the degree is expected. The Master of Arts (M.A.) or Master of Science (M.S.) de\u00ad gree normally is attained by one of two routes: Plan I, a thesis; or Plan II, a comprehensive examination. Both re\u00ad quire a minimum of one year in residence, satisfactory completion of prescribed course work, and an appropriate demonstration of achievement. Plan I includes a minimum of seven courses (28 units), 20 units or more of which must be at the graduate level, a thesis, and a general examina\u00ad tion. Plan II requires at least nine courses (36 units), includ\u00ad ing 24 units or more at the graduate level, and a com\u00ad prehensive examination covering a broad range of subject matter in the discipline. Only approved 200-series courses completed while in residence at the University satisfy the minimum graduate course requirement. Some programs will have course requirements exceeding the minimums cited above, and may have additional or alternative degree requirements. Please refer to the description of the specific program for more information. Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) degrees are awarded by the School of Fine Arts (M.F.A. in Fine Arts) and by the Pro\u00ad gram in Writing (M.F.A. in English) upon successful com\u00ad pletion of the equivalent of two years of full-time study with an emphasis upon creative expression and profes\u00ad sional development. Special thesis or comprehensive examination requirements are established for these programs. Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) degrees are awarded upon successful completion of programs designed for the professional development of secondary school teachers and college instructors. A minimum of one year in residence is required, usually including Summer Session course work. A thesis project or other comparable evidence of profes\u00ad sional attainment is part of each M.A. T. program. Doctor of Philosophy Degree The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph. D.) degree is awarded on the basis of evidence that the recipient possesses knowledge of a broad field of learning and expert mastery of a particular area of concentration within it. The research dissertation is expected to demonstrate critical judgment, intellectual synthesis, imaginative creativity, and skill in written communication. The candidate for the Ph.D. is expected to be in full-time residence for at least six regular academic quarters. Four to six years of full-time academic work beyond the bachelor's degree typically is required to complete the degree. At the end of the first year or so of full-time study, many programs administer a preliminary examination on the student's mas\u00ad tery of fundamental knowledge in the discipline. Upon successfully demonstrating a high level of scholarship on this examination and after further study, the student will continue to a series of qualifying examinations which lead to formal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. Graduate students ordinarily attain candidacy status for the Ph.D. degree when all preparatory work has been com\u00ad pleted, when qualifying examinations have been passed, and when they are ready for the dissertation phase. Stu\u00ad dents are recommended for advancement to candidacy by unanimous vote of the candidacy committee appointed by the Dean of the Graduate Divison on behalf of the Graduate Council. The proposed candidacy committee must be sub\u00ad mitted to the Graduate Division Office (on the Ph.D. Form I) at least-two weeks before the final qualifying examination is to be given, so that the formal appointment can be made before the examination date. The Report on Qualifying Examination for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Form II) must be signed by the committee at the time the candi\u00ad dacy examination is concluded and submitted to the Dean of the Graduate Division. Following a favorable vote of the committee, the student will be advanced to candidacy upon payment of the standard $25 Candidacy Fee. Candidacy for the Ph.D. will lapse automatically if the student loses graduate standing by academic disqualification or failure to comply with the University policy on continuous registra\u00ad tion. A readmitted student who was a candidate for the Ph.D. must again advance to candidacy and thereafter en\u00ad roll as a candidate for at least one academic quarter before the Ph.D. will be conferred. Following advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D., a doc\u00ad toral committee appointed by the Dean of the Graduate Division (on behalf of the Graduate Council) supervises the student's program, approves the dissertation, and conducts the final oral examination if required. The chair of the doc\u00ad toral committee is the member of the faculty responsible for providing primary guidance of the student's dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examination will be given just prior to completion of the dissertation and while the student is in residence during a regular academic session, and will be open to all members of the academic community. Ph.D. degrees are conferred, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council, as of the last day of the regular academic quarter in which all requirements have been satisfied. THE IN-CANDIDACY FEE OFFSET GRANT By action of each academic unit, the Graduate Council, and the Academic Senate Coordinating Committee on Graduate Affairs, a Normative Time has been established for each Ph.D. program. This is the expected number of 12-month years from first enrollment to completion of the Ph.D. for students entering with normal preparation who are able to study without serious interruptions. The Normative Time established for UCI Ph.D. programs is five years in all fields except (years in parentheses): Administration (six), Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences (four or five), Comparative Culture (six), Com\u00ad parative Literature (six), Engineering (four), French (six), German (six), History (six), Information and Computer Sci\u00ad ence (four or five), Radiological Sciences (four). UC IRVINE - 1980-1981A Ph.D. student in good standing will be eligible for a quar\u00ad terly grant equal to the Educational Fee if: 1. the student is a formal candidate for the Ph.D., as of the first day of the quarter; 2. the student's accrued time since first enrollment is less 0 than the Normative Time for completion of the Ph.D. estab\u00ad lished for that graduate program (accrued time is equal to elapsed time from first enrollment in the Graduate Division less (1) up to three quarters of approved leave, and (2) any time between completion of a graduate program or formal withdrawal and readmission in a different field of study); 3. the student is not entitled to payment of the Educational Fee from a non-University fellowship, grant, or traineeship; and 4. satisfactory academic progress has been certified by the departmental Graduate Advisor or Director of Graduate Studies. Additional information about the In-Candidacy Fee Offset Grant program and application forms are available from the Graduate Division Office. Filing of Thesis or Dissertation Candidates for the Ph.D. and certain master's degrees must conduct an extensive research project and submit a thesis in order to fulfill degree requirements. Research expenses not supported by the University and the cost of preparing a thesis ordinarily range from $200 to $1,000 but may be con\u00ad siderably more. After a dissertation or thesis has been ap\u00ad proved by the doctoral or thesis committee appointed for that student by the Graduate Council, a copy of the disser\u00ad tation (two copies of a master's thesis) must be filed with the Manuscript Advisor in the University Library. The final copy must meet the University's requirements for style, format, and appearance before the degree can be conferred. Dissertations filed later than 30 days before the end of an academic quarter ordinarily cannot be reviewed and ac\u00ad cepted in time to confer the degree during that quarter. The Filing Fee Ordinarily, a graduate student will be registered for the quarter in which the dissertation or thesis is submitted and the degree is to be conferred, and no additional fees are required. If the manuscript is submitted and accepted be\u00ad fore the first day of the regular academic quarter in which the degree is to be conferred and the student was registered for the previous regular quarter, additional fees may not be necessary. Under certain circumstances, a student may be eligible to pay a Filing Fee equal to half of the Registration Fee in lieu of registration, as determined by the Dean of the Graduate Division. In general, all requirements for a degree must have been satisfied prior to the start of the quarter, except for the submission of the final version of the dissertation or thesis or the completion of a final oral or comprehensive examination. The student who intends to make use of any University resource or receive any student service for which official registration and payment of regular fees is a re\u00ad quirement is not eligible to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of registration. A Filing Fee will not be accepted immediately following readmission, and will be accepted immediately following a Leave of Absence only under exceptional cir\u00ad cumstances. The date for payment of the Filing Fee without Graduate Division 25 a late service fee is the same as that for the payment of other student fees. If the dissertation or thesis is not accepted during the quarter in which the Filing Fee is paid, the stu\u00ad dent must subsequently register and pay all applicable fees. Conferral of Graduate Degrees Prior to the beginning of the quarter in which an advanced degree is to be conferred, the student must have applied for advancement to candidacy and should have received for\u00ad mal notice confirming candidacy from the Dean of the Graduate Divison. The student should ask the departmen\u00ad tal Graduate Advisor to determine which degree require\u00ad ments, if any, have not yet been satisfied. No later than the beginning of the final quarter, students should file a Graduation and Diploma Information form with the Graduate Division Office and ask the departmen\u00ad tal office to be sure that their name is included on the tenta\u00ad tive degree list. If a master's thesis or doctoral dissertation is to be submitted, the Manuscript Advisor should be con\u00ad sulted well in advance about the final format and the dead\u00ad line for submission of the approved manuscript. Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are available, which is about 90 days after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS The University offers many types of financial assistance to graduate students. These include fellowships, teaching and research assistantships, grants-in-aid, student loans, work-study, and tuition fellowships for nonresident stu\u00ad dents. Fellowships and assistantships are awarded on the basis of recommendations initiated by the student's academic unit, and require satisfactory scholarship and full-time enrollment. Students applying for admission should indicate at the same time their desire to be consid\u00ad ered for these awards. Continuing students should contact the Graduate Advisor for their program. Most awards are made in April or May of the preceding academic year. Through the Graduate Affirmative Action Program, a number of fellowships and assistantships are awarded to disadvantaged first-or second-year graduate students on the basis of need and academic promise. Other University fellowships are offered to entering and continuing graduate students who qualify. Grants for doctoral research from the Chancellor's Patent Fund and a limited number of disserta\u00ad tion fellowships are awarded by the Dean of the Graduate Division. Additional information is available from the Graduate Division Office. The Office also provides informa\u00ad tion and assistance to students who wish to apply for fel\u00ad lowships from federal agencies, foundations, and other non\"University sources. The Fees, Expenses, and Financial Aid section contains in\u00ad formation about assistance based upon financial need that 0 is administered by the Financial Aid Office, including grants, loans, and work-study awards. A Graduate Financial Aid Prospectus is available from the Financial Aid Office. UC IRVINE - 1980-198126 Undergraduate Admissions The Office of Admissions welcomes inquiries on any aspect of becoming eligible for the University of California and on planning for transfer. Admissions counselors are available in 245 Administration Building, and inquiries may be ad\u00ad dressed to the Office of Admissions, University of Califor\u00ad nia, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717. General information on application filing is available by telephoning (714) 833-6703; for specific questions regarding admission or eligibility, telephone (714) 833-6705. The University's undergraduate admission requirements, which are the same on all campuses, are based on two principles. The best predictor of success in the University is high scholarship in previous work, and the study of certain subjects in high school gives a student good preparation for University work. The following information on admission to UCI is organized as follows: Categories of Application Admission to Freshman Standing Admission in Advanced Standing Nonresident Admission Requirements Admission of International Students Application Procedures Additional Information CATEGORIES OF APPLICATION An undergraduate applicant is a student who wishes to complete a program of studies leading to a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree. A freshman applicant is a student who has graduated from high school or has earned a California Certificate of Profi\u00ad ciency but has not enrolled since then in a regular session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer sessions immedi\u00ad ately following graduation are excluded. An advanced standing (transfer) applicant is a high school graduate who has been a registered student in a regular or extension session of a college or university other than a summer session immediately following high school graduation. An intercampus transfer applicant is an undergraduate student who is currently or was previously registered in a regular session at another campus of the University of California ang has not been registered in another collegiate institution. See page 48. A nonresident applicant is a student whose legal perma\u00ad nent residence (as determined by the University) is outside of the state of California. Nonresident applicants are gener\u00ad ally required to pay Nonresident Tuition and must also pre\u00ad sent a higher grade point average than is required of California residents. Refer to the Nonresident Admission Requirements section for further information. An applicant for readmission is a student who was formerly registered and enrolled on the Irvine campus and who has interrupted the completion of consecutive quarters of en\u00ad rollment. See page 48. A second baccalaureate applicant is a college graduate who because of a change of objective wishes to obtain a second bachelor's degree in a major different from that of the first degree. An international applicant is a student who holds or ex\u00ad pects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States. An Early Admission Experimental Program (EAXP) appli\u00ad cant is an accelerated high school student who wishes to register and enroll on a reduced fee basis in UC Irvine courses concurrently with high school courses. ADMISSION TO FRESHMAN STANDING The University defines a freshman applicant as a student who has graduated from high school or earned a California Certificate of Proficiency and who has not enrolled in a regular session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer sessions are excluded in the determination. Freshman applicants who are not residents of California should refer ahead to the section on Nonresident Admis\u00ad sion Requirements. NOTE: Applicants still of freshman level and who have completed more than 12 transferable units since high school graduation should refer to the section on Admission in Ad\u00ad vanced Standing. Advanced standing credit will be granted for an acceptable course from an accredited college or university taken while still in high school if completed after the tenth grade and if reported on a valid transcript issued by the college or com\u00ad munity college which conducted the course. Freshman applicants who have not yet decided on a major should refer to the section on Planning an Undergraduate Program. Requirements To be eligible for admission to the University as a freshman an applicant must meet the Subject, Examination, and Scholarship Requirements described below. SUBJECT (\"A THROUGH F\") REQUIREMENT Students must complete certain high school courses with at least a g\\ade of C in each semester of each course in the subject areas listed below. This course sequence is often called \"a through f\" pattern and must appear on a list of courses that high school principals certify meet University requirements. This list is called \"Courses to Meet Require\u00ad ments for Admission to the University of California\" and can be obtained from school counselors. The Office of Ad\u00ad missions will determine the equivalency of courses for graduates of out-of-state high schools. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981a. History - 1 year One year* of United States history, or one-half year of United States history and one-half year of civics or Ameri\u00ad can government. b. English - 3 years (4 years, beginning with applicants for fall 1981) Three years of English: composition and/or literature, uni\u00ad versity preparatory in nature. Not more than one year course will be accepted from the ninth grade. c. Mathematics- 2 years Two years of mathematics: algebra, geometry, trigonom\u00ad etry, calculus, elementary functions, and mathematical analysis. Courses such as arithmetic and business mathematics are not accepted. d. Laboratory - 1 year A year course in one laboratory science, taken in the tenth, eleventh, or twelfth grade. e. Foreign Language - 2 years Two years of one foreign language. Any foreign language with a written literature m_ay be used. f. Advanced Course - 1 or 2 years This requirement must be satisfied by one of the following: 1. Mathematics A total of one year of advanced mathematics: inter\u00ad mediate algebra, trigonometry, or other comparable mathematics courses; or, 2. Foreign Language Either an additional year in the same language used for \"e\" above or two years of a second foreign language; or, 3. Science A year course in any laboratory science completed in addition to the laboratory science used for \"d\" above. The subject requirement can be fulfilled with 10 or 11 high school units. Grades in these courses are the only grades used in calculating the grade point average. However, the University requires all applicants (except those with a Cer\u00ad tificate of Proficiency -see p. 32) to complete at least 15 units. Thus, 4-5 units can be taken in elective courses, which provide an excellent opportunity to strengthen preparation for the University. Additional courses in\u00b7 mathematics and science are essential in the preparation for majors in engineering, mathematics, the sciences, and many other fields of study. A fourth year of English, includ\u00ad ing composition skills, is highly recommended for all stu\u00ad dents -and will be required of applicants for fall 1981 and succeeding quarters. EXAMINATION REQUIREMENT All freshman applicants must submit test scores as de\u00ad scribed below. Applicants for admission to the fall quarter should take the tests by December or January of the senior year, if possible. The following tests are required: 1. One Aptitude Test-Either: A. The Scholastic Aptitude Test-SAT-(the verbal and mathematics scores submitted from this test must be from the same sitting); or B. The American College Test-ACT-composite score. 2. Three College Boar9. Achievement Tests, which must include (a) English Composition, (b) one from among the social studies or foreign languages, and (c) mathematics (level 1 or 2). A year course in high school is equivalent to one credit/unit. Undergraduate Admissions 27 ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION ALONE A student can qualify as a freshman by examination alone. The required total score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test is 1,100. Also, the student's total score on the three College Board Achievement Tests must be 1,650 or higher, or at least 1,730 if a nonresident of California, with no score less than 500 on any individual Achievement Test. High school graduation or a California Certificate of Proficiency is re\u00ad quired for students who qualify for admission by examina\u00ad tion. If test scores are available to UCI at a time earlier than the evaluation of an applicant's subject and scholarship re\u00ad quirements, and if they meet' the above totals, the campus may be able to expedite notification of admission. This op\u00ad tion does not apply to students who will have completed more than 12 transferable units prior to admission. The Col\u00ad lege Board Achievement Tests cannot be taken in academic subjects covered by transferable college courses a student may have taken. ELIGIBILITY INDEX Applicants are admissible if their a-f grade average and test score totals are higher than the combinations below: A-F ACT* SAT** A-F ACT* SAT** GPA Composite or Total GPA or Composite Total 35 1600 3.05 22 970 2.'79 35 1580 3.06 21 950 2.80 34 1550 3.07 21 92fl 2.81 34 1530 3.08 20 900 2.82 33 1510 3.09 19 880 2.83 33 1480 3.10 18 850 2.84 33 1460 3.11 18 830 2.85 32 1440 3.12 17 810 2.86 32 1410 3.13 16 780 2.87 32 1390 3.14 15 760 2.88 31 1370 3.15 14 740 31 1340 3.16 14 3fl 1320 3.17 13 1270 11\" 640 3.20 10; 620 2.94 28 1230 3.21 9 600 2.95 28 1200 3.22 9 570 2.96 27 1180 3.23 8 550 2.97 27 1160 3.24 8 530 2.98 26 1130 3.25 7 500 2.99 26 1110 3.26 7 480 3.00 25 1090 3.27 6 460 3.01 25 1060 3.28 6 430 24 1040 3.29 5 410 3.03 24 1020 3.30 5 400 3.04 23 990 SCHOLARSHIP REQUIREMENT Students who attain a grade point average of 3.30 in \"a-f\" courses taken after the ninth grade will be eligible to enter the University regardless of their scores on standardized tests. Students with grade point averages below 3.30 but greater than 2.77 will be admitted to the University if they achieve specified scores on the standardized test. (See the Eligibility Index.) ACT is scored in intervals of 1 point from a minimum of 1 to 35 maximum. **SAT is scored in intervals of 10 points from a minimum of 400 to 1,600 maximum. UC IRVINE - 1980-198128 Undergraduate Admissions Grades received in courses taken in the ninth grade or ear\u00ad lier are not used in determining the scholarship average, although subject requirements (except laboratory science) may be satisfied with grades of Cor better in these courses. If students successfully complete more than the minimum units within each required subject, only the best grades are used in calculating their grade point average. Grades are counted on a semester basis unless a school gives only year grades. Students may repeat up to a total of two semester courses (or one year course) in which they received a grade of D or lower in order to meet the subject and scholarship require\u00ad ments. The grades earned in repeated courses, however, will not be counted higher than C in determining the schol\u00ad arship average. If the courses students repeat were taken before the ninth grade, they will be treated as if the stu\u00ad dents were taking them for the first time. Admission to the Early Admission Experimental Program (EAXP) The opportunity to enroll in University classes concurrent with the junior or senior year of high school is available to certain accelerated students. Through the Early Admission Experimental Program (EAXP), qualified high school stu\u00ad dents may enroll in UC Irvine courses, receive grades based on the same standards as full-time students, and receive full University of California credit for their work. EAXP is designed to provide the high school student with an enriched education at a substantially advanced level. Students are given the opportunity to take courses of in\u00ad terest beyond those which their high schools offer. Along with the academic advantages, students have a chance to experience an early orientation to University life. To continue at UC Irvine after high school graduation, an EAXP student need only complete a change of major peti\u00ad tion and enroll as a full-time student. Also, EAXP status entitles students to Intercampus Transfer (ICT) privileges should they decide to attend another campus of the Univer\u00ad sity of California after high school graduation. High school students wishing more information about the Program should contact the Office of Admissions or their high school counselor. ADMISSION IN ADVANCED STANDING The University defines an advanced standing (transfer) applicant as a high school graduate who has been a regis\u00ad tered student in another college or university or in college\u00ad level extension classes other than a summer session im\u00ad mediately following high school graduation. An advanced standing applicant may not disregard the college record and apply for admission as a freshman. Advanced standing applicants who are not residents of California should refer to the section on Nonresident Ad\u00ad mission Requirements. Advanced Standing Admission Requirements The requirements for admission in advanced standing vary according to the high school record. Advanced standing applicants who have a California Certificate of Proficiency must also meet regular University entrance requirements. NOTE: Admission requirements for freshman applicants were changed for fall 1979 to include a combination of high school grades and examinations. (See the Eligibility Index.) High school eligibility for advanced standing applicants up to at least spring 1981 will be determined by either the new or the old requirements, whichever is appropriate or ben\u00ad eficial to the applicant. After spring 1981 the high school eligibility for advanced standing applicants will be deter\u00ad mined by one of the following, depending on the high school graduation date: 1) Students graduating from high school at the end of the 1978-79 academic year are eligible if they meet the Eligibility Index (p. 27). 2) Students gradu\u00ad ating from high school prior to the 1978-79 academic year are eligible if they have earned a 3.0 grade point average on the required high school subjects and appro\u00ad priate test scores if fewer than 12 college units have been completed. The transcript submitted from the last college attended must show, as a minimum, that the student was in good standing and had earned a grade point average' of 2.00 or better. If the grade point average fell below 2.00 at any one college attended, the student may have to meet additional requirements in order to qualify for admission. An advanced standing applicant must also meet one of the following conditions: 1. A student who met the Eligibility Index or whose high school scholarship average in the required subjects was 3.00 or better may be admitted any time after establishing an overall grade point average of 2. 00 or better. If a student has completed less than 12 quarter or semester units of transferable college credit since high school graduation, the student must also satisfy the examination requirement for freshmen. 2. A student who met the Eligibility Index or whose high school scholarship average in the required subjects was 3.00 or better but had not studied one or more of the re\u00ad quired courses in high school may be admitted after the student has: a. established an overall grade point average of 2.00 or bet\u00ad ter in another college or university; and b. completed, with a grade of Cor better, appropriate col\u00ad lege courses in the high school subjects lacked; and c. completed 12 or more quarter or semester transferable units, or met the examination requirement. 1The grade point average is determined by dividing the total number of acceptable units attempted into the number of grade points earned on those units. A student may repeat courses com\u00ad pleted with a grade lower than C up to a maximum of 16 quarter units without penalty. The scholarship standard is expressed by a system of grade points and grade point averages earned in courses accepted by the Uni\u00ad versity for advanced standing credit. Grade points are assigned as follows: for each unit of A, 4 points; B, 3 points; C, 2 points; D, 1 point; I and E no points; P/NP, no points but are included in the unit total. UC IRVINE - 1980-19813. A student who was not eligible for admission as a freshman because of low scholarship or a combination of low scholarship and a lack of required subjects may be ad\u00ad mitted after the student has: a. established an overall grade point average of 2.40 or bet\u00ad ter in another college or university; and b. completed 84 quarter units (56 semester units) of college credit in courses accepted by the University for transfer; and c. completed, with a grade of C or better, appropriate col\u00ad lege courses in high school subjects that the student lacked (high school deficiencies equivalent to two one-year courses may be waived) or completed, with a grade of Cor better, 1) one college course in mathematics at least as ad\u00ad vanced as the equivalent of two years of high school algebra or one year of algebra and one year of geometry, 2) one course in English of a level transferable to the University of California, and 3) one course in U.S. history, a laboratory science, or a foreign language which is transferable to the University of California. Students considering admission in advanced standing should refer to page 32. Admission for a Second Bachelor's Degree Some students may wish to obtain a second bachelor's de\u00ad gree in a major different from that of the first degree. Ad\u00ad mission as a candidate for a secondbachelor's degree re\u00ad quires that the applicant be fully eligible for admission to the University and have strong promise of academic success in the new major. All such admissions are subject to the approval of the dean or director of the UCI school or pro\u00ad gram in which the second degree will be earned. Students who have not attended UCI as undergraduates during a regular academic quarter should complete an Ap\u00ad plication for Undergraduate Admission and a Supplemen\u00ad tary Information for Second Baccalaureate Applicants form, available from the Office of Admissions. Students who have attended UCI as undergraduates during a regular academic quarter should obtain and complete a Second Baccalaureate Application form through the Registrar's Office. NONRESIDENT ADMISSION . REQUIREMENTS NOTE: Admission requirements for applicants who are not California residents vary slightly from requirements for California residents. Nonresident Freshman Applicant A nonresident freshman applicant must (1) graduate from a regionally or state-accredited high school; (2) complete satisfactorily the \"a through f\" pattern of subject require\u00ad ments listed under requirements for California residents; (3) earn a grade point av~rage of at least 3.40 or higher in the required high school subjects (3.00 is equal to a Baver\u00ad age); and (4) meet the examination requirement: one Ap\u00ad titude Test-either the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) (ver\u00ad bal and mathematics scores must be from the same sitting) or the American College Test (ACT) composite score -Undergraduate Admissions 29 AND three College Board Achievement Tests which must include English Composition; Social Studies or Foreign Language; and Mathematics (Ievell or 2). Please note that the Freshman Eligibility Index applies to California resi\u00ad dents only. To be admitted by examination alone, an applic\u00ad ant must score at least 1,100 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), and the total score on the three College Board Achievement Tests must be 1,730 or higher with a score of at least 500 on each test. Nonresident Advanced Standing Applicant A student who met the admission requirements for freshman admission as a nonresident must have a grade point average of 2.80 or higher in college courses that are accepted by the University for transfer credit. A nonresident applicant who graduated from high school with less than a 3.40 grade point average in the subjects required for freshman admission must have completed at least 84 quarter units (56 semester units) of transferable work with a grade point average of 2.80 or higher. Upon successful completion of that work, two units of the re\u00ad quired high school subjects may be waived. A student who lacked any of the required subjects in high school must complete, with a grade of Cor better, appropriate college courses in those subjects, or 1) one college course in mathematics at least as advanced as the equivalent of two years of high school algebra or one year of algebra and one year of geometry, 2) one course in English of a level trans\u00ad ferable to the University of California, and 3) one course in U.S. history, a laboratory science, or a foreign language which is transferable to the University of California. Exceptions to Nonresident Admission Requirements For admission purposes only, a person residing outside of California may be determined by the Office of Admissions to be a bona fide resident and may be considered under California resident admission requirements if the applicant: is a spouse of a University of California faculty member; is a spouse of military personnel assigned to California; is a military dependent who has been granted a nonresident fee waiver; is an immigrant who has lived in California for a year and has chosen California as place of residence; is a minor applicant whose parent or legal guardian appears to be a legal resident of California (as determined by the Uni\u00ad versity for tuition purposes); has spent any two years or at last term enrolled in a California high school; has spent the last term (in at least 12 transferable units) enrolled in an accredited California college or university; hasbeen physi\u00ad cally present in California continuously for at least one year prior to the quarter for which registration is requested; or if one parent has received a degree from the University of California or is a full-time employee of the University of California. Nonresident Tuition Fee Refer to page 36 for information regarding residence clas\u00ad sification for tuition purposes and the Nonresident Tuition Fee. Bona fide residents are still held for Nonresident Tuition. UC IRVINE - 1980-198130 Undergraduate Admissions ADMISSION OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS The credentials of an international undergraduate applicant - a student who holds or expects to hold a student, ex\u00ad change, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to at\u00ad tend school in the United States -are evaluated in accor\u00ad dance with the general regulations governing admission. An application, official certificates, and detailed transcripts of records should be submitted to the Office of Admissions early in the appropriate application filing period. This will allow time for exchange of necessary correspondence and, if the applicant is admitted, will help the student in obtain\u00ad ing the necessary passport visa. International applicants whose native language is other than English will be required to demonstrate their English proficiency. This is most often accomplished by achieving a minimum score of 550 on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). The admission of otherwise eligible applicants who do not meet this requirement will be de\u00ad ferred until it is possible for them to demonstrate an adequate level of English ability. Arrangements to take the TOEFL may be made by writing directly to TOEFL, Educa\u00ad tional Testing Service, P.O. Box 899, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. Students must request the Educational Testing Ser\u00ad vice to forward results of their tests to the Office of Admis\u00ad sions. Completion of an acceptable English composition course (as determined by the Office of Admissions) with a grade of C or better will also clear the English proficiency requirement for international applicants. Generally, financial assistance and scholarships from the University are not available to the nonimmigrant-visa stu\u00ad dent. International students must provide proof that suffi\u00ad cient funds will be available to meet their educational com\u00ad mitments while studying in the United States. International undergraduate students are considered as nonresidents of California and are required to pay the nonresident tuition in addition to fees paid by legal residents of California. Please direct all inquiries regarding the undergraduate admission of international students to the Office of Admissions. Credit for Native Language Students whose first language is not English may receive credit for course work in their native language and litera\u00ad ture, provided such courses were completed on the college level in the country of the vernacular, or on the upper\u00ad division or graduate level at UCI or another accredited English-speaking institution. APPLICATION PROCEDURES Application Filing Periods Application packets for undergraduate admission to the University are available from the counseling office of any California high school or community college, or from any University of California Admissions Office. Submit com\u00ad pleted application and related materials to the Office of Admissions, 245 Administration Building, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717 on or after the appropriate date below: Winter quarter, 1981 Spring quarter, 1981 Fall quarter, 1981 Winter quarter, 1982 Spring quarter, 1982 July 1, 1980 October 1, 1980 November 1, 1980 July 1, 1981 October 1, 1981 The beginning of the application filing period is the same for all campuses. Each campus will accept for consideration all applications filed during the first month of the filing period. After the first month the closing deadline will vary from campus to campus. Students are encouraged to file their applications early in the filing period to be assured consideration for the program and campus of their choice. Once enrollment quotas have been filled, additional appli\u00ad cations cannot be accepted and will be directed to another University campus where enrollments are still open, ac\u00ad cording to preferences shown on the application. Application Fee There is a nonrefundable fee of $25 for filing an application for admission. Checks or money orders should be made pay\u00ad able to Regents-UC and attached to the application form. Duplicate Applications Only one application per quarter for the University of California is permissible, and it entitles qualified students to attend the campus of their choice if there is space avail\u00ad able. Fees submitted with duplicate applications will not be refunded. Change of Campus If an applicant prefers to attend a campus of the University different from the one to which the application was origi\u00ad nally submitted, the applicant should send a letter indicat\u00ad ing the new choice of campus and the reasons for the change to the Office of Academic Services to Schools and Students, 510 University Hall, Berkeley, California 94720. The application will be transferred to that campus if enroll\u00ad ment is open, but the student will receive a new admission priority assignment based on the date on which the request for the change was made. Transcripts The Office of Admissions requires complete, accurate, and up-to-date information about a student's academic program and work in progress in order to process and respond to the application in a timely manner. AlLapplicants are responsible for requesting that the high schools from which they graduated and each college at\u00ad tended send official transcripts of work promptly to the UCI Office of Admissions. If a student is applying for admission as a freshman, a pre\u00ad liminary transcript showing work through the junior year should be requested from the high school. The transcript should list the courses the student is now taking and those the student plans to take. A final transcript that includes courses and grades for the senior year and a statement of graduation or a California Certificate of Proficiency must ' UC IRVINE - 1980-1981also be provided. A transcript from the last college attended is required if any college courses are completed before or at the time of high school graduation. Those applying for admission in advanced standing should have their graduating high school send a transcript im\u00ad mediately to the Office of Admissions which will also need a transcript from each college attended. A preliminary transcript from the present college should list the courses currently in progress and those planned before transfer. Attendance at any other schools or colleges after applica\u00ad tion to the University has been filed is considered to be part of the record and must be reported to the Office of Admissions. The transcript and other documents submitted as part of the application become the property of the University; they cannot be returned or forwarded in any form to another college or university. Examination Arrangements Students should make arrangements to take the required tests with the Educational Testing Service, P.O. Box 1025, Berkeley, California 94701, or P.O. Box 592, Princeton, New Jersey 08540 for SAT and Achievement Tests. For the ACT, students should write to the American College Testing Program Registration Unit, P.O. Box 168, Iowa City, Iowa 52240. (Test fees should be paid to the Educational Testing Service, or the American College Testing Program, not the University.) Test scores will be regarded as official only if they are reported directly to the Office of Admissions by the Educational Testing Service or by the American College Testing Program. Also, final notification of admission can\u00ad not be released until scores have been received by the Office of Admissions. In 1980-81 SAT and Achievement Tests will be offered con\u00ad currently on the following Saturday mornings: October 11, 1980 (SAT January 24, 1981 only in California, Florida, April4, 1981 (SAT only) New York, and Texas) May 2 1981 \u00b7 November 1, 1980 J 6 1981 December 6, 1980 une ' The 1980-81 ACT Tests will be offered on the following dates: October 18, 1980 December 13, 1980 February 14, 1981 March 28, 1981 June 13, 1981 Details on testing are available from the Educational Testing Service, the American College Testing Program, and from most high school counseling offices. Notification of Admission Candidates for the fall quarter will be notified whether their applications have been retained for consideration at UCI immediately after they are received. Most candidates who applied early in the filing period will receive notice of their admissibility by April 15. (There are similar notification periods for other quarters.) Delays will occur if required records have not been received by the Office of Admis\u00ad sions. Since each application is considered individually, the length of time before notification is subject to some varia\u00ad tion depending upon the unique circumstances of each applicant. Undergraduate Admissions 31 If offered admission by the University, a student will be asked to sign and return a Statement of Intention to Regis\u00ad ter, accompanied by a nonrefundable fee of $50. This amount will be applied toward payment of University fees, pro\u00ad vided the student enrolls in the quarter to which the stu\u00ad dent has been admitted. Admission to UCI is not an assurance of financial aid nor does it guarantee assignment to University housing. Separate applica\u00ad tions are required of applicants desiring financial aid or University housing, and receipt of communications from the Financial Aid or Housing Office does not imply that eligibility for admission has been established. Reapplication and Deferred Admission Privilege In general, an application for admission is effective only for the quarter for which it is submitted. If a student is not eligible for admission, or if a student is admitted and does not enroll, the student must file a new application with the required fee in order to be admitted to another quarter. The new application will be considered in light of the admission requirements in effect and the space available on the campus. However, qualified applicants for undergraduate admission may request to have their admission deferred until a later quarter. Requests for admission deferment should be ad\u00ad dressed to the Director of Admissions. Every consideration will be given to deferments requested for valid reasons, though applicants should be aware that responses to such requests may vary from quarter to quarter or major to major due to changing enrollment conditions. Educational Opportunity Program Applicants who wish to be considered for the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) should refer to page 50 for supplementary application procedures. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RECOMMENDED SUBJECTS Many University programs require or recommend specific preparatory subjects to give students the needed background in their chosen fields of study. The lack of such preparation, particularly for advanced standing students, may delay graduation from the University. Details about these recommendations can be found in Prerequisites and Recommended Subjects, a University publication sent each year to high school and community college counselors. SUBJECT A AND AMERICAN HISTORY AND INSTITUTIONS To be eligible for a bachelor's degree from UC Irvine, stu\u00ad dents must meet a number of requirements, including those of the University of California, the Irvine campus, and the individual school and major. There are two re\u00ad quirements- Subject A (English Composition) and Ameri\u00ad can History and Institutions- which all University of California students must satisfy in order to graduate. For specific information on these requirements and ways to satisfy them before entrance to UCI, refer to page 13. UC IRVINE - 1980-198132 Planning for Transfer to UCI COLLEGE-LEVEL COURSES The University gives unit credit to students for courses they have completed in other accredited colleges or universities. To be accepted for unit credit, the courses must be consis\u00ad tent with those offered by the University. All applicants with questions regarding transfer of credit should contact the Office of Admissions. COLLEGE LEVEL EXAMINATION PROGRAM (CLEP) Ten quarter units are granted for each general examination in Social Science/History, Natural Science, and Humanities passed with a score of 500 or better. The amount of credit granted for each subject examination passed with a score of 50 or better will be based on the scope of the material covered and transferability as deter\u00ad mined by the Office of Admissions. Credit will not be given for CLEP Examinations that duplicate course work. Credit for CLEP is being reviewed by the University and may be subject to change in fall 1981. ADVANCED PLACEMENT The Advanced Placement Examinations of the College Board are taken, usually during the senior year, in conjunc\u00ad tion with courses taken in high school. Students will re\u00ad ceive 10 quarter units of University credit for each examina\u00ad tion (except Latin, Physics C, Part 1, 2, and Mathematics AB which earn five quarter units each) in which they earn a score of 5, 4, or 3. A maximum of 10 units can be earned for the following: a combination of Physics B and Physics C; English Language and Composition and English Composi\u00ad tion and Literature if both examinations are presented; in Studio Art a student may submit either a General Portfolio or a Drawing Portfolio, but not both. These credits will apply toward the total required for graduation from the University. Information about specific application of Ad\u00ad vanced Placement toward subject credit may be obtained from the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges. HIGH SCHOOL PROFICIENCY EXAMINATION The University of California will accept the California Cer\u00ad tificate of Proficiency, awarded by the State Department of Education upon successful completion of the California High School Proficiency Examination, in lieu of the regular high school diploma. However, all other University en\u00ad trance requirements (subject pattern, grades, tests) must be met. The date of graduation on University records will be the date of the certificate. Entrance by standardized test scores will remain an option for the student ineligible on the basis of high school record. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION All new students and those returning after an absence of two or more quarters require physical examinations and health clearances, respectively, before the first day of the quarter. See Student Health. Planning for Transfer to UCI The University is committed to serve as fully as possible the educational needs of students who transfer from other California collegiate institutions. The principles covering transferability of unit credit and course credit are explained below and, unless otherwise indicated, are much the same whether transfer is from a two-year or a four-year institu\u00ad tion. Information regarding eligibility for transfer may be found in the section on Admission in Advanced Standing, page 28. Unit Credit for Work Taken Elsewhere The University of California grants unit credit for courses completed in other accredited colleges and universities when such courses are consistent with the functions of the University as set forth in the Master Plan for Higher Educa\u00ad tion in California. Equivalent advanced standing credit from institutions on the semester calendar may be deter\u00ad mined at a ratio of one semester unit to one and one-half quarter units. (To graduate from UCI 180 quarter units, equivalent to 45 UCI quarter courses, are needed.) CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES Students may find it advantageous or necessary to com-. plete the first two years of a University of California under\u00ad graduate program at one of the California Community Col\u00ad leges, which are an integral part of the state's system of higher education. High school graduates who cannot be accommodated at their first campus preference may choose to attend a community college and transfer to their pre\u00ad ferred University campus at a later time. A student may earn a maximum of 105 quarter units (70 semester units) toward a University degree in a community college. No further unit credit may be transferred from a community college, although subject, major, or breadth credit for courses taken will still be granted. Students anticipating transfer to UCI are urged to consult with their community college counselors. The community college counselor, with the aid of that college's transferable course list, can advise students about courses which will transfer to the University. Lists for each community college are updated annually and tell which courses will transfer and for how many units. In addition to the community college counselor, staff in the Office of Admissions and Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges keep current copies and can advise students about the transferability of courses. FOUR-YEAR INSTITUTIONS Unit credit is granted for courses consistent with the Uni\u00ad versity of California's functions and which have been com\u00ad pleted in colleges or universities accredited by the appro\u00ad priate agencies. While limitations of credit may be imposed in certain subject areas, these are consonant with the cur\u00ad ricula for all students in the University of California. No UC IRVINE - 1980-1981defined maximum number of units which can be earned toward the degree is set for students transferring from four year institutions. However, see page 13 for UCI graduation requirements, including requirements for units earned in residence at this campus. University of California Extension Course numbers prefixed by XB, XD, XI, XL, XR, are granted credit toward the bachelor's degree on the same basis as courses taken in residence at any accredited collegiate institution. Courses taken in UC Extension are not included on the permanent UC record, nor are the grades included in the UC average. (NOTE: UCI undergraduate students should refer top. 45 about enroll\u00ad ment in University Extension courses.) Decisions regarding the acceptability of extension courses taken in institutions other than the University of California rest with the Office of Admissions. Decisions regarding the applicability of such courses toward specific degrees and majors rest with the respective faculties. Course Credit for Work Taken Elsewhere The policies above refer only to the unit transferability of courses and are uniformly implemented on all campuses of the University. Thus, courses which are determined by the University of California to be transferable are assured only of being granted elective course credit. The application of transfer work to specific course and major requirements is determined by the student's academic dean. The Irvine campus makes every effort to eliminate all bar\u00ad riers to orderly progress from California community col\u00ad leges into its own programs. To this end, many community colleges have entered into articulation agreements with UCI so that the specific application of their courses to UCI's University, school, and departmental major requirements may be readily communicated to prospective transfer stu\u00ad dents. Students are urged to consult community college counselors or the Office of Relations with Schools and Col\u00ad leges for specific information on planning a program for transfer. The University of California bulletin Prerequisites and Rec\u00ad ommended Subjects should also be consulted for planning the lower-division course of study for all programs offered on the campuses of the University of California. Requirements Requirements at UCI are in four categories: University of California, UCI, school, and departmental or major. Courses not specifically applicable to these are considered to be electives. See pages 13-15 for a description of these requirements. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REQUIREMENTS: SUBJECT A AND AMERICAN HISTORY AND INSTITUTIONS Among the means of meeting the Subject A requirement is the completion of an acceptable one-quarter (four units) or one-semester (three units) transfer course in English com\u00ad position with a grade of Cor better. Planning for Transfer to UCI 33 The American History and Institutions requirement may be met by completing in high school one year of U.S. history or one semester of U.S. history and one semester of U.S. government with a grade of at least C, or upon certification by another California collegiate institution. UCI BREADTH REQUIREMENT The new UCI breadth requirement applies to new freshmen entering UCI in fall quarter, 1980. Transfer students who attended college for the first time prior to fall1980 have the option of satisfying this requirement through 1) the UCI 6-3-3 distribution (see below), 2) the new UCI breadth re\u00ad quirement, or 3) one of the other options indicated below. The breadth requirement may be satisfied by college-level courses appropriate to UCI offerings and may be met at any time during the undergraduate years, except in the case of the upper-division Writing Requirement. Transfer students should not feel that these must necessarily be completed in the lower division. See page 14 for details on the breadth requirement. Students who transfer from a four-year institution and who have completed the general breadth requirements of that college will be considered to have met the total breadth requirement of UCI. Students who transfer from a com\u00ad munity college and who have met the general breadth re\u00ad quirements of any campus of the University of California prior to transfer will also be regarded as having met the breadth requirement. Students who, upon transfer, have not completed whatever breadth requirements may have been in progress for another campus of the University of California may elect to complete at UCI either that program or whatever UCI breadth requirement is applicable to them-the UCI 6-3-3 distribution or the new UCI breadth requirement. Students who transfer from colleges on the semester calen\u00ad dar and who elect to satisfy the breadth requirement by fulfilling the UCI 6-3-3 distribution may do so by complet\u00ad ing four semester courses (minimum 12 semester units) in one school outside the major and two semester courses (minimum six semester units) in each of two other schools outside the major. Students transferring from another institution who first at\u00ad tended college in fall1980 or thereafter may satisfy the new UCI breadth requirement (p. 14) by completing a year se\u00ad quence (two semesters work, minimum six semester units, or three quarters work, minimum 12 quarter units) in each of the following areas: I. Writing II. Natural Sciences III. Social and Behavioral Sciences IV. Humanistic Inquiry V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, or Computer Science Students transferring to UCI should refer to the following detailed guidelines on how to satisfy the breadth require\u00ad ment in each area: I. Writing The lower-division writing requirement may be met by a year sequence in English composition. Courses used to meet the lower-division writing requirement must be com\u00ad pleted with a minimum grade of C-(1.7), or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C-. Transfer students may not count any course designed exclusively for the satisfaction of Sub- UC IRVINE - 1980-198134 Planning for Transfer to UCI ject A toward the completion of the lower-division re\u00ad quirement. Any student entering with only one semester or one quarter of English composition through which the Sub\u00ad ject A Requirement is fulfilled will not have satisfied any part of the Writing Requirement. The upper-division writ\u00ad ing requirement normally should be completed at Irvine. II. Natural Sciences This requirement may be met by a year sequence in one of the following areas: general biology, general chemistry, basic physics, the physical sciences with the exception of mathematics. These courses may or may not include a laboratory. III. Social and Behavioral Sciences This requirement may be met by a year of work in any of the following areas: anthropology and comparative culture, economics, political science, psychology, sociology, or so\u00ad cial ecology. Students on the semester system may elect to take both courses in the same area or one course from each of any two areas; students on the quarter system may elect to take three courses in one area, or two courses from one area and a third from another area. History, for the pur\u00ad poses of the breadth requirement, is not considered a Social or Behavioral Science. (See IV, Humanistic Inquiry.) IV. Humanistic Inquiry This requirement may be met by a year sequence in one of the following areas: classics, history, philosophy, humanities, English literature, comparative literature, dramatic literature, art history, history of music, nature and theory of art. Performance courses may not be used in satis\u00ad faction of this requirement. V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, Computer Science This requirement may be met by a year sequence in one of the following areas: probability and statistics, calculus, logic, linguistics, computer science, or completion of the second year in a foreign language. In satisfying the above requirements, a student may count toward breadth no more than a year of work taken within the discipline of the major. For example, a student majoring in Philosophy may count no more than two semester courses or three quarter courses in Philosophy toward breadth. Transfer students should check with the academic coun\u00ad selor in their prospective major, the Office of Admissions, or the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges about courses that may be used to satisfy the UCI breadth re\u00ad quirement. A complete description of the breadth require\u00ad ment is on page 14. NOTE FOR PHYSICAL SCIENCES MAJORS: In addition to the courses taken to fulfill the UCI breadth requirement, students majoring in the School of Physical Sciences are required to take one additional year sequence from one of the following breadth areas: Social and Behavioral Sciences (III), Humanistic Inquiry (IV), or the Foreign Languages or Linguistics section of Category V. For purposes of this re\u00ad quirement, the approved sequences are the same ones listed for the UCI breadth requirement, with the exception that a year sequence of a single foreign language is acceptable. NOTE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES MAJORS: By satisfy\u00ad ing the lower-division Writing Requirement (I) and com\u00ad pleting a year sequence of courses selected from classics, history, philosophy, humanities, English literature, or comparative literature toward the Humanistic Inquiry (IV) breadth requirement, students majoring in Biological Sci\u00ad ences can also satisfy the Humanities requirement for their major. The courses and descriptions listed elsewhere in this Catalogue may be used by prospective transfer students as a guide for selecting courses of similar content and purpose in their own institutions. However, it is strongly advised that they consult with their counselors to verify the trans\u00ad ferability of such courses and the applicability to the breadth requirement. No student who has taken a course which is accepted for credit by the Office of Admissions and which has been determined by a community college as acceptable toward completion of the breadth requirement shall incur any loss of credit in satisfaction of the requirement. SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS Since school requirements occasionally cross school lines (e.g., physical science requirements for all majors in the School of Biological Sciences), courses taken to fulfill a school requirement may at the same time be applicable to\u00ad ward the University breadth requirement unless the school designates otherwise. Also, courses taken to fulfill a de\u00ad partmental major requirement may at the same time fulfill a school requirement or, within prescribed limits, the Uni\u00ad versity breadth requirement. Although course equivalencies for the breadth requirement are liberally interpreted for purposes of transfer, courses to be applied toward school and departmental major require\u00ad ments must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in unit value and in content. By careful selection of courses, it is possible for students to satisfy some or all of the lower\u00ad division requirements of their intended program or school prior to transfer. DEPARTMENTAL OR MAJOR REQUIREMENTS Courses to be applied toward departmental or major re\u00ad quirements must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in content and purpose than is the case with courses applicable to the breadth requirement (seep. 14 and departmental sections). Prospective transfer students should consult with their counselors as to the applicability of courses toward UCI requirements. Prospective transfer students should address specific in\u00ad quiries about their programs to the respective schools or departments at UCI. Community colleges wishing to clarify the status of transfer courses should consult with the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges at Irvine or the Uni\u00ad versity of California campus closest to them. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981Fees, Expenses, and Financial Aid ESTIMATED EXPENSES NOTE: Undergraduate and graduate estimated figures are based on three quarters of attendance. Figures for medical students are based on one calendar year of attendance (and are somewhat less for first-year medical students). All fees are subject to change without notice. The following is in\u00ad tended only as a guide in computing average expenses. Fee payment dates. are announced in the quarterly Schedule of Classes. SPECIAL EXPENDITURES Special expenditures beyond the cost of books and basic supplies may be associated with certain courses of study. For example, field study assignments may involve trans\u00ad portation expenses; students who take a dance class may be required to wear a certain type of shoe; a student may need a calculator. Information on courses which require special expenditures is available from the Financial Aid Office. FEES Under terms of the Alan Pattee Scholarship Act a surviving child of a California resident who died as a result of acci\u00ad dent or injury incurred in the performance of active law enforcement or active fire suppression and preventive duties is eligible to apply for waiver of certain fees. Addi\u00ad tional information concerning this Act is available from the Registrar's Office: California Residents Sample Budgets University Registration Fee Educational Fee Associated Students Fee University Center Fee Books and Supplies1 Room and Board Personal Expenses (Laundry, Clothing, Transportation, Recreation) Average Total for California Residents Nonresidents For nonresidents of California, the above costs apply, plus $2,400 Nonresident Tuition. Fees, Expenses, and Financial Aid 35 REGISTRATION FEE The University Registration Fee is $138 per quarter. The full fee is required of all students regardless of the number of courses taken. This fee, which must be paid at the time of registration, is a charge to each student for services which benefit the student and which are complementary to, but not a part of, the instructional programs. No part of this fee is remitted to students who may not desire to make use of all or any of these services. Graduate students studying out of the state may be eligible to pay one-half of the Registration Fee. The $50 advance deposit on the Registration Fee (Under\u00ad graduate Acceptance of Admission Fee), required of new undergraduates, is applied to the full fee when the student registers. Continuing students are required to pay all out\u00ad standing fines and other debts, in full, at the time they pay their Registration Fee for an upcoming term. Medical students are required to pay the full Registration Fee for each fall, winter, and spring quarter, and $80 for each summer quarter. EDUCATIONAL FEE The Educational Fee is $100 per quarter for undergraduate students and $120 per quarter for graduate students. Legal residents of the State of California with demonstrated fin\u00ad ancial need may defer payment of the Educational Fee by accepting obligation to repay, at a later date, the sum de\u00ad ferred. Students interested in this provision should contact the Financial Aid Office, 204 Administration Building. Medical students are required to pay the Educational Fee for each quarter in which they enroll, including the summer quarter. Part-Time Status (Undergraduates Only) The Educational Fee has been reduced 50 percent (from $100 to $50 per quarter) for undergraduates enrolled for eight units or less, providing their reduced enrollment is ap\u00ad proved in advance by the appropriate academic dean for the following reasons: financial need, health, or family respon\u00ad sibilities. Part-time status lapses at the end of each academic quarter. A student must, therefore, reapply each quarter that part-time status is desired.

UC IRVINE - 1980-198136 Fees, Expenses, and Financial Aid ASSOCIATED STUDENTS FEE The Associated Students Fee of $9 per quarter is adminis\u00ad tered by the Associated Students of the University of California, Irvine to provide social activities, lectures, forums, concerts, and other activities at either a reduced charge, or no charge, to UCI students. This fee is required of all students. UNIVERSITY CENTER FEE The University Center Fee is $9 per quarter. The fee is re\u00ad quired of all students regardless of the number of courses taken. The fee is used to pay the debt service on revenue bonds sold to finance the construction costs of the new University Center. Payment of Fees Fees for each quarter are due and payable in advance within deadlines published in the Schedule of Classes. A student will not be enrolled in classes or receive any University benefits until fees are paid in full.

Nonresident Tuition Fee and California Residence Students who have not been residents of California for more than one year immediately prior to the residence de\u00ad termination date for each quarter in which they propose to attend the University are charged, along with other fees, a Nonresident Tuition Fee of $800 for the quarter or $1,200 for the semester to a maximum of $2,400 per academic year. The residence determination date is the day instruction be\u00ad gins at the last of the University of California campuses to open for the quarter, and for schools on the semester sys\u00ad tem, the day instruction begins for the semester. Nonresi\u00ad dent undergraduate students enrolled in less than 12 quar\u00ad ter units pay Nonresident Tuition at $67 per unit. Nonresi\u00ad dent graduate students pay $800 per quarter or $1,200 per semester regardless of the number of units undertaken. GENERAL In order to be classified as a resident for tuition purposes, an adult student must have established his or her residence in California for more than one year immediately preceding the residence determination date for the term during which he or she proposes to attend the University and relin\u00ad quished any prior residence. An adult student must couple his or her physical presence within this state for one year with objective evidence that such presence is consistent with his or her intent in making California his or her per\u00ad manent home and, if these steps are delayed, the one-year durational period will be extended until BOTH presence and intent have been demonstrated for one full year. In\u00ad deed, physical presence within the state solely for educa\u00ad tional purposes does not constitute the establishment of California residence under state law regardless of the length of his or her stay in California. Relevant indicia which can be relied upon to demonstrate one's intent to make California his or her permanent resi\u00ad dence include, but are not limited to, the following: regis\u00ad tering and voting in California elections; designating California as his or her permanent address on all school and employment records, including military records if one is in the military service; obtaining a California driver's license or California Identification Card, if a nondriver; obtaining California vehicle registration; paying California income taxes as a resident, including income earned outside this state; establishing an abode where one's permanent belong\u00ad ings are kept within California; licensing for professional practice in California; and the absence of these indicia in other states during any period for which residence in California is asserted. Documentary evidence may be re\u00ad quired. No single factor is controlling or decisive. All relevant indicia will be considered in the classification determination. The residence of the parent with whom an unmarried minor (under age 18) child maintains his or her place of abode is the residence of the unmarried minor child. When the minor lives with neither parent his or her residence is that of the parent with whom he or she maintained his or her last place of abode, provided the minor may establish his or her residence when both parents are deceased and a legal guardian has not been appointed. The residence of an unmarried minor who has a parent living cannot be changed by his or her own act, by the appointment of a legal guardian, or by relinquishll).ent of a parent's right of control. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981A man or a woman establishes his or her residence. A woman's residence shall not be derivative from that of her husband, or vice versa. EXCEPTIONS 1. A student who remains in this state after his or her parent, who was thereto'fore domiciled in California for at least one year immediately prior to leaving and has, during the student's minority and within one year immediately prior to the residence determination date, established resi\u00ad dence elsewhere, shall be entitled to resident classification until the student has attained the age of majority and has resided in the state the minimum time necessary to become a resident so long as, once enrolled, he or she maintains continuous attendance at an institution. 2. Nonresident students who are minors or 18 years of age and can evidence that they have been totally self\u00ad supporting through employment and actually present within California for the entire year immediately prior to the residence determination date and have evidenced the intent to make California their permanent home may be eligible for resident status. 3. A student shall be entitled to resident classification if immediately prior to the residence determination date he or she has lived with and been under the continuous direct care and control of any adult or adults other than a parent for not less than two years, provided that the adult or adults having such control have been California residents during the year immediately prior to the residence deter\u00ad mination date. This exception continues until the student has attained the age of majority and has resided in the state the minimum time necessary to become a resident student, so long as continuous attendance is maintained at an institution. 4. Exemption from payment of the nonresident tuition fee is available to the natural or adopted child, stepchild, or spouse who is a dependent of a member of the United Fees, Expenses, and Financial Aid 37 States military stationed in California on active duty. Such resident classification may be maintained until the student has resided ~n California the minimum time necessary to become a resident. If a student is enrolled in an institution and the member of the military is transferred on military orders to a place outside the United States immediately after having been on active duty in California, the student is entitled to retain resident classification under conditions set forth above. 5. A student who is a member of the United States military stationed in California on active duty, except a member of the military assigned for educational purposes to a state\u00ad supported institution of higher education, shall be entitled to resident classification until he or she has resided in the state the minimum time necessary to become a resident. 6. A student who is an adult alien is entitled to resident classification if the student has been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence in accordance with all applicable provisions of the laws of the United States and has thereafter established and maintained resi\u00ad dence in California for more than one year immediately prior to the residence determination date. A student who is an adult alien shall be entitled to resident classification if the student is a refugee who has been granted parolee, conditional entrant, or indefinite volun\u00ad tary departure status in accordance with all applicable laws of the United States, provided that the student has lived in the state for one year immediately prior to the residence determination date. (Effective until June 30, 1980.) 7. A student who is a minor alien shall be entitled to resi\u00ad dent classification if the student and the parent from whom residence is derived have been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence, provided that the parent has had residence in California for more than one year after acquiring a permanent resident visa prior to the residence determination date for the term. UC IRVINE - 1980-198138 Fees, Expenses, and Financial Aid A student who is a minor alien shall be entitled to resident classification if the student is a refugee who has been granted parolee, conditional entrant, or indefir:Ute volun\u00ad tary departure status in accordance with all applicable laws of the United States, provided that the student has lived in this state for one year immediately prior to the residence determination date. (Effective until June 30, 1980.) 8. Children of deceased public law enforcement or fire suppression employees, who were California residents and who were killed in the course of law enforcement or fire suppression duties, may be entitled to resident status. PROCEDURES New and returning students are required to complete a Statement of Legal Residence. The student's status is de\u00ad termined by the Attorney in Residence Matters' Deputy who is located in the Registrar's Office. The student is cautioned that this summation is not a com\u00ad plete explanation of the law regarding residence. The stu\u00ad dent should also note that changes may have been made in the rate of nonresident tuition and the residence require\u00ad ments between the time this catalogue statement is pub\u00ad lished and the relevant residence determination date. Regu\u00ad lations have been adopted by The Regents, a copy of which is available for inspection in the Registrar's Office of the campus. Nonimmigrant aliens having visa classifications A, E, G, I, or K should consult the Residence Deputy in the Registrar's Office for further information about their ability to become California residents for tuition purposes. All students classified incorrectly as residents are subject to reclassification and to payment of all nonresident fees not paid. If incorrect classification results from false or con\u00ad cealed facts by the student, the student also is subject to University discipline. Resident students who become non\u00ad residents must immediately notify the Attorney in Resi\u00ad dence Matters' Deputy. Inquiries from prospective students regarding residence re\u00ad quirements for tuition purposes should be directed to the Attorney in Residence Matters, 590 University Hall, 2200 University Avenue, Berkeley, California 94720. No other University personnel are authorized to supply information relative to residence requirements for tuition purposes. Any student, following a final decision on residence clas\u00ad sification by the Residence Deputy, may make written ap\u00ad peal to the Attorney in Residence Matters at the above ad\u00ad dress within 120 days after notification of the final decision by the Residence Deputy. WAIVERS OF NONRESIDENT TUITION To the extent funds are available, Nonresident Tuition waivers may be granted to spouses and dependent, unmar\u00ad ried children under age 21 of University faculty members who are qualified for membership in the Academic Senate; to the unmarried, dependent children under age 21 of a full-time University employee whose permanent assign\u00ad ment is outside California and who has been employed by the University for more than one year immediately prior to the opening of the term; and for certain foreign students. Inquiries regarding these waivers normally should be di\u00ad rected to the Dean of the Graduate Division of the campus the student proposes to attend. In addition, certain student Teaching Assistants and Teach\u00ad ing Fellows, and certain graduate students designated as University Fellows and Distinguished Scholars, may be eligible for Nonresident Tuition Waivers or fellowships. Such students should contact the Graduate Division for further information. FEE REFUNDS New undergraduates who cancel their registration before the first day of instruction are entitled to a refund of Regis\u00ad tration Fee paid except for the $50 nonrefundable Accept\u00ad ance of Admission Fee; other fees paid are refunded in full. For all continuing and readmitted students, and new graduate and medical students, there is a service charge of $10 for cancellation of registration or withdrawal before the first day of instruction. The Associated Student Fee and the University Center Fee are refunded only for cancellation of registration prior to the first day of orientation. After instruction begins, a withdrawal form, available from the Registrar's Office; is necessary. Students who withdraw from the University during the first five weeks of instruc\u00ad tion will receive refunds1 of Registration Fee, Educational Fee, and Nonresident Tuition Fee, less the $50 nonrefund\u00ad able Undergraduate Acceptance of Admission Fee, on the following basis, effective with the first day of instruction and the effective date of withdrawal: 1-14 calendar days, 80% of amount paid; 15-21 60% of 22-28 40% of amount paid; 29-35 calendar days, 20% of amount paid; 36 calendar days and over, 0%. The effective date of withdrawal is normally the date the student's official notice of withdrawal is received by the University. However, under extenuating circum\u00ad stances, the Assistant Vice Chancellor-Student Affairs, the Dean of the Graduate Division, or the College of Medicine Promotion and Honors Committee, as appro\u00ad priate, may determine that the effective date of withdrawal occurred prior to the filing of the notice. It is presumed that no University services will be provided to the student after that date. Claims for refund of fees must be presented during the fiscal year Ouly 1 to June 30) in which the claim is applica\u00ad ble. To obtain a refund, the student must surrender the identification card to the Assistant Vice Chancellor\u00ad Student Affairs, the Dean of the Graduate Division, or the College of Medicine Director of Admissions and Records at the time of withdrawal. Refund checks are issued by the Accounting Office and are generally received by mail about four weeks after the official withdrawal. If any portion of a student's fees has been paid by the Uni\u00ad versity or outside sources, that portion of the refund.will be returned directly to the source of those funds. Students receiving financial aid will have their monies credited to the appropriate accounts. HOUSING REFUND POLICIES UCI Housing Contracts provide students with complete housing refund policies. 11\u00a3 no credit for courses is received, a full refund of the Registration Fee of the regular session will be granted to all students entering the armed forces prior to the sixth week of the quarter. No refund thereafter. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981FINANCIAL AID Lack of funds need not be a barrier to attending UCI; almost one third of enrolled students receive some form of finan\u00ad cial aid. Students who show that they need financial assis\u00ad tance in order to attend are eligible for financial aid through the Financial Aid Office. In addition to awarding aid on the basis of financial need, the Office also offers some scholar\u00ad ships based on academic excellence. Most graduate fellow\u00ad ship programs are administered by the Graduate Division Office. Students who receive financial aid will receive funds from one or more of the following sources: scholarships, grants, loans, and work-study. These sources are described briefly in the following sections; more detailed information can be obtained from the Financial Aid Office, including publica\u00ad tions which describe financial aid for undergraduate, graduate, and medical students, and student rights and re\u00ad sponsibilities under the program authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. To obtain financial aid, new and continuing students must file the Student Aid Application for California (SAAC) and the necessary supporting documents each year. Students are encouraged to apply as early as possible. The SAAC, additional forms, and information regarding the application process are available in the Financial Aid Office. The usual deadline for loans, work-study, and most grants is April15. The application deadline for Cal Grants A and B is usually around February 11 for the following academic year. The University expects the student and the parent (or spouse) to contribute toward the educational costs to every extent pos\u00ad sible. For dependent students, an analysis of the SAAC and supporting documents determines the amount a student's parents can be expected to contribute toward the cost of the student's education. For independent students, the analysis determines the amount a student and/or spouse can contri\u00ad bute to the cost of the student's education. Income, assets, debts, size of family, and the number of family members in college are the major factors considered in the analysis. Assets include home equity and equity in other real estate; stocks, bonds, and other securities; business and farm equity; and cash, savings, and checking accounts. Income includes wages, salaries, interest, dividends, and nontax\u00ad able income such as Social Security benefits. All undergraduate financial aid applicants are also required to apply for a Federal Basic Educational Opportunity Grant and for a Cal Grant A or B. Scholarships Scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic ability, achievement, and promise. Although a few honorary scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic excel\u00ad lence alone, most also require that an applicant demon\u00ad strate financial need. To be considered for a scholarship, students must file a Scholarship Application, available from the Financial Aid Office., Filing deadlines vary each year, but the usual deadline is' January 4. Regents' scholarships, among the highest honors conferred upon UC students, are awarded on the basis of academic excellence and exceptional promise, without reference to Fees, Expenses, and Financial Aid 39 financial need. Undergraduate students are eligible upon graduation from high school or upon completion of the sophomore year of college. Medical students are eligible during any year of their study in medical school. The ap\u00ad pointments run for four years for students entering from high school or two years for students appointed after their sophomore year. Regents' Scholars receive a $100 hon\u00ad orarium the first year of their appointment. In addition, a stipend is awarded each year to Regents' Scholars who submit a complete financial aid application and demon\u00ad strate financial need. University scholarships are offered to entering and continu\u00ad ing students who show evidence of high scholastic attain\u00ad ment and financial need. These awards are renewable by submitting an application for consideration each year. Other scholarships are available to students who qualify. While a student need not apply for a specific scholarship, applicants with special qualifications will receive careful consideration. For information on Air Force ROTC scholarships, see page 11. For additional information, contact the Scholarship Ad\u00ad visor in the Financial Aid Office. Grants Grants are awarded on the basis of financial need. There is no repayment requirement. Basic Educational Opportunity Grant (BEOG): is a feder\u00ad ally funded grant program and provides awards up to a maximum of $1,800 for the academic year. To be eligible, applicants must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents and must be enrolled as undergraduates and have not pre\u00ad viously received a bachelor's degree. Students should use the SAAC to apply for this grant. Cal Grant A: is a state-funded scholarship program and currently provides awards up to $700 for the academic year to cover the cost of fees. To be eligible, applicants must be California residents and demonstrate financial need. Stu\u00ad dents should use the SAAC together with the California Student Aid Commission Supplement to apply for a Cal Grant A. The filing deadline for new applicants is usually around February 11 for the following year. Cal Grant B: is a state-funded grant program and provides awards up to a maximum of $1,100 during a student's first year, $1,800 during subsequent years. To be eligible, appli\u00ad cants must be California residents, demonstrate financial need, and be entering college or not have completed more than one quarter of college work. The awards are for stu\u00ad dents from low-income families. Students may use the SAAC together with the California Student Aid Commis\u00ad sion Supplement to apply for a Cal Grant B. The filing deadline for new applicants is usually around February 11 for the following year. Note: Students may not receive both a Cal Grant A and a Cal Grant B. If offered both the Financial Aid Office recommends taking Cal Grant B over Cal Grant A. Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG): provides grant aid for undergraduate students who demon\u00ad strate exceptional financial need. These federal grants range from $200 to $1,500 a year, depending upon financial need. UC Grant-In-Aid (GIA): provides grant aid for full-time students who demonstrate financial need. The amount awarded depends upon financial need. UC IRVINE - 1980-198140 Fees, Expenses, and Finandal Aid Educational Fee Grant (EFG): provides aid for under\u00ad graduates in their first year of attendance at UCI. Recipients must be California residents, enrolled full time, and must demonstrate financial need. The maximum grant at a UC campus is $100 per quarter (to pay the Educational Fee) available only for the first three consecutive quarters in attendance. Loans National Direct Student Loan (NDSL): provides long-term federal loans for U.S. citizens and permanent residents. The amounts awarded vary, depending on financial need, but cannot exceed $2,500 for the first two years or $5,000 for the undergraduate years. No interest is charged nor is re\u00ad paymeriJ required while the borrower is enrolled in at least one half of the normal academic load. Interest of 3 percent a year begins nine months after the borrower ceases to be enrolled, or is enrolled less than half time, and repayment must be completed within a 10-year period. Graduate stu\u00ad dents may receive an aggregate of $10,000 which includes loans received as an undergraduate. Educational Fee Loan (EFL): enables California residents who establish financial need to delay payment of all or a portion of the University of California's Educational Fee. Repayment at 3 percent interest begins nine months after graduation or withdrawal from higher education. University Loan: provides long-term loans to full-time stu\u00ad dents who demonstrate financial need. The maximum amount for an academic year is $1,000. The 3 percent in\u00ad terest begins when a student leaves UCI. Repayment be\u00ad gins six months after the student ceases to be enrolled full time and\u00b7must be completed within five years. Two co\u00ad signers are required. California Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) and Federally Insured Student Loan Program (FISL): federally supported and approved through participating local banks or other lenders, allow an undergraduate student to borrow up to a total of $7,500 at an interest rate of 7 percent. A graduate or medical student may borrow up to $15,000, which includes any loans received as an undergraduate. You must be a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident to be eligible. Income and assets are not used as criteria in determining eligibility for interest benefits. As a result, most students are eligible. The maximum loan is $2,500 per academic year. The minimum repayment is $30 per month, including an interest rate of 7 percent a year, and begins nine months after the borrower ceases to be enrolled at least half time. The entire loan must be repaid in 15 years. Application forms are available at the UCI Financial Aid Office. Health Professions Student Loan: provides long-term fed\u00ad eral loans to medical students only. The amount of the loan cannot exceed the sum of all student fees plus $2,500 per academic year, whichever is less. The interest rate is 7 per\u00ad cent. Repayment of the principal is not required and in\u00ad terest does not accrue during the time a student is complet\u00ad ing professional training, including internships and resi\u00ad dencies. The loan may be repaid over a 10-year period. Short-term Loans: In addition to the long-term loans, vari\u00ad ous philanthropic individuals and organizations have pro\u00ad vided money to create a short-term student loan fund. These loans, which do not bear interest, are of a short-term nature to cover emergency needs. Work-Study College Work-Study Program: provides part-time employment for U.S. citizens and permanent residents who are at least half-time students and demonstrate finan\u00ad cial need. The maximum amount recipients can earn under this federal program is determined by their financial need. University Work-Study Program: is similar to the College Work-Study Program except that funds are allocated through The Regents of the University of California. Veterans' Work-Study Program: is available only to U.S. military veterans. Separate applications and detailed in\u00ad formation are available from the Office of Student Support Services. Summer Work-Study Program: may be available to stu\u00ad dents enrolled in Summer Session or planning to enroll at UCI in the fall quarter. Students who are awarded Summer Work-Study and who are not enrolled in summer classes are expected to save a sizeable portion of their earnings fo'r use during the following academic year. Aid For Graduate Students Graduate students should contact the UCI Graduate Divi\u00ad sion, Administration Building, (714) 833-6761, for informa\u00ad tion about application procedures for other forms of aid such as graduate fellowships, traineeships, or teaching and research assistantships. Aid For Medical Students College of Medicine students should contact the Medical School Financial Aid Advisor, E-108 Medical Sciences I, (714) 833-6476, for information about other sources of finan\u00ad cial assistance. Aid For International Students Students who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents may be eligible for assistance from a limited number of Uni\u00ad versity programs if they have experienced an unanticipated change in their financial situation. These students must complete at least one year at UCI in order to be considered for assistance. Aid is normally limited to the expenses for books and fees. Aid For Handicapped Students All forms of student financial aid are available to eligible handicapped students. Interested students should follow the regular financial aid application procedures and should be sure to specify on the Student Aid Application for California any additional expenses they may incur because of a handicap. Student Employment The Career Planning and Placement Center assists UCI stu\u00ad dents, their spouses, and alumni in obtaining part-or full\u00ad time employment during the academic year and summer vacation. It is not necessary to be a financial aid recipient to apply for jobs through the Center. Students with work\u00ad study awards may obtain on-campus or off-campus job re\u00ad ferrals in the Career Planning and Placement Center. The Center is located in 120 Social Science Tower. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981ReRulations ana Procedures Academic Regulations GRADING SYSTEM A-Excellent (4.0 grade points per unit) B-Good (3.0 grade points per unit) C-Average (2.0 grade points per unit) D-Lowest passing grade (1.0 grade point per unit) F-Not passing (no grade points) I -Incomplete P -Pass (equal to grade Cor better) NP-Not Pass S-Satisfactory (equal to grade B or better; graduate students only in courses so designated by the Graduate Council) U --:-Unsatisfactory (graduate students only in courses so designated by the Graduate Council) IP-In Progress (restricted to certain sequential courses, so designated by the Committee on Courses, for which the final quarter grade of a multi-quarter sequence course is assigned to the previous quarter(s) of the sequence) NR -No Report (given when an instructor's final grade course report is not submitted or when the student's name was on the official class roster but the instructor did not report a grade for the student; NR becomes an F or NP after one quarter of subsequent enrollment or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first, unless the instructor at the student's request clears the record or replaces NR with a grade). Plus suffixes may be attached to the grades B, C, and D; minus suffixes may be attached to the grades A, B, C, and D. Plus grades carry three-tenths grade point more per unit, and minus grades carry three-tenths grade point less per unit than unsuffixed grades. After each quarter, a copy of the student's permanent re\u00ad cord is available from the Registrar's Office. On the copy, the student will find grades for all the quarters taken at UCI, a computation of grade point average at the University of California, and a list of the University requirements com\u00ad pleted (Subject A, American History and Institutions, etc.). Requirements for a bachelor's degree include the accumula\u00ad tion of credit for 180 quarter units with an average grade of at least C (grade point average of at least 2.0). A course at UCI normally offers four quarter units of credit, and the Regulations and Procedures 41 term \"course\" may be understood in what follows to carry four units. The grade point average is the sum of all ac\u00ad cumulated grade points (grade points earned in a course per unit times the unit value of the course) divided by the sum of all units attempted. It should be noted that final grades as reported by profes\u00ad sors at UCI are normally permanent and final. A professor may not change a final grade except to correct a clerical or procedural error. Clerical or procedural errors should be corrected within one regular academic quarter after the grade is assigned. Under circumstances explained in the Academic Grievance Procedures (Manual of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate, Appendix II), a grade may be changed if the Academic Grievance Panel has detennined that the grade was assigned on the basis of discrimination. Incomplete Grades An I or Incomplete grade is assigned by an instructor to a student when the student's work is of passing quality, but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the stu\u00ad den~'s control, and when the student has been excused by the mstructor from completing the quarter's work. For currently enrolled students, the maximum time limit for making up an I grade is three quarters of enrollment. After this time the I can no longer be replaced and will appear permanently on the record. The student should consult the instructor to determine how the Incomplete may be made up. The instructor is not obligated to allow the maximum three quarter period. It is strongly recommended that the student and the instructor prepare a written agreement specifying how the Incomplete can be made up and the deadline for doing so. A form is available for this purpose. Once the work is completed within a time agreed upon by the in\u00ad structor, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change of grade form to the office of the dean of the school in which the course was offered. The student should not reenroll in the course to make up the Incomplete. Students not currently enrolled at UCI have a maximum of one calendar year in which to replace an Incomplete. How\u00ad ever, in exceptional individual cases involving the student's prolonged inability to pursue a course of study, extensions of up to two additional years may be granted by the instruc\u00ad tor with the approval of the dean of the unit offering the course; students must petition for such an extension within one calendar year following the assignment of the Incom\u00ad plete grade. Courses graded I carry no grade points and are not included in computation of the grade point average which appears on the student's permanent record. Any I grades will re\u00ad main indefinitely on the permanent record unless the work is completed and a grade assigned as described above. University of California regulations require a grade point average of 2.0 for all units attempted in order to receive a bachelor's degree. Only when a check for satisfaction of gradua\u00ad tion requirements is made are I's treated as F's. If the student's overall average is at least a 2.0, including the Incomplete grades computed as F's, then the student may graduate. If the Incomplete grades computed as F's decrease the stu\u00ad dent's average below a 2.0, the student may not graduate until enough I grades have been made up to bring the average up to a 2.0. UC IRVINE - 1980-198142 Academic Regulations Pass/Not Pass The Pass/Not Pass option is available at UCI to encourage students to enroll in courses outside their major field. Courses graded Pass or Not Pass are not included in compu\u00ad tation of the grade point average which appears on a stu\u00ad dent's permanent record. However, if a student receives \u00b7a Pass in a class, course and unit credit for the class is re\u00ad ceived, except as provided below. If a Not Pass is received, the student receives no credit for the class. The use of Pass/Not Pass is governed by all of the follow\u00ad ing provisions: 1. A student in good standing may take up to an average of four units per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, candidates for the bachelor's degree may take a total of 12 more units in courses designated by academic units as Pass/Not Pass Only. 2. A student who earns a grade of C (2.0) or better will have a Pass/Not Pass grade recorded as Pass. If the student earns a grade of C-, D, or F, the grade will be recorded as a Not Pass, and no credit will be received for the course. In both cases, the student's grade will not be computed into the grade point average. 3. Courses taken under the Pass/Not Pass option may count toward the 180-unit requirement for the bachelor's degree and toward all breadth requirements. But with the excep\u00ad tion of courses designated by the academic unit Pass/Not Pass Only, courses taken Pass/Not Pass may not be used to satisfy specific course requirements of the student's school and major department, unless authorized by the appro\u00ad priate dean. Graduate Division students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program; may not be applied to the requirements for an advanced degree; and do not count toward the minimum number of units for which a graduate student must enroll. 4. Changes to or from the Pass/Not Pass option must be made during the enrollment period. No changes can be made after the first two weeks of a quarter without the approval of the dean of the student's school. 5. No student on academic probation may enroll in a course on the Pass/Not Pass option. (Physical EducatioB courses are excepted.) Satisfactory /Unsatisfactory Grades (Graduate Students Only) Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading, unlike Pass/Not Pass, is not a student option. With the consent of the academic units involved, individual study and research or other indi\u00ad vidual graduate work undertaken by a graduate student may be evaluated by means of the grades S or U. Certain graduate courses are graded S/U only. Also, the grades S or U may be assigned provisionally in each but the last quarter of a graduate course extending over more than one quarter. Upon completion of the last quarter, letter grades (A to F) replace such provisional grades. When a grade of S or U has been assigned on a provisional basis and the student does not complete all quarters of the course sequence, the in\u00ad structor may assign a final letter grade or the grade of I to replace the S or U, or let the grade of S or U stand as a final grade. With the specific approval of the Graduate Council, other graduate courses may be graded on an S/U basis pro\u00ad vided that all students enrolled in such courses receive a grade of S, U, or I (or if an undergraduate student, a grade of P or NP). The grade S is defined as equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit will be allowed for work graded Unsatisfactory. Grades In Progress IP is a transcript notation, restricted to sequential courses which extend over two or more quarters, indicating that the final grade for the individual quarters will not be assigned until the last quarter of the sequence is completed. The grade for the final quarter is then assigned for all of the previous quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. IP notations may be given only for courses designated by the Academic Senate Committee on Courses for use of this notation. IP notations are not included in computations of the student's grade point average and do not contribute to the number of quarter units completed. Grades Not Reported A student who receives an NR must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. An NR becomes an F or N~ after one quarter of subsequent enrollment or at the end of the quarter im\u00ad mediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first. NR transcript notations are not included in computac tions of the grade point average and do not contribute to the number of quarter units completed. Grade Points and Grade Point Average Grade points are assigned on a four point basis: A, 4 points per unit; B, 3 points per unit; C, 2 points per unit; D, 1 point per unit; F and I, zero points. Plus or minus suffixes modify the above by plus or minus 0.3 grade point per unit. Each undergraduate course counts one through eight units, and graduate courses range from one to 12 units each (see departmental course descriptions). Grade point average (GPA) is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total unit value of courses attempted. P, NP, S, U, NR, IP, and I grades are excluded in computing grade point average. Removal of Deficient Grades Undergraduates may repeat courses only when grades of D, F, or NP were received. Degree credit for courses so re\u00ad peated will be given only once, but the grade assigned at each enrollment shall be permanently recorded. In comput\u00ad ing the grade point average of an undergraduate with re\u00ad peated courses in which a D, F, or NP was received, only the most recently received grades and grade points shall be used for the first 16 units repeated. In case of further repeti\u00ad tions, the grade point average shall be based on all grades assigned and on total units attempted. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981A graduate student may repeat only once a course in which a grade below B or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade shall be used in computing the student's grade point average for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades will be used. Satisfaction of the Writing Requirement The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division Writing Requirement must be completed with a grade of C-(1.7) or better. The following applies to students who fail to attain a grade of C-(1. 7) or better in the lower-divisioncourses: 1. Students who fail to attain a grade of C-(1.7) in one or both courses of the Writing 39 A-B sequence must repeat the course or courses in question. 2. Students who fail to attain a C-(1.7) in Humanities 15 normally should enroll in Writing 39A; students who fail to attain a C-in Humanities 16 should normally enroll in Writ\u00ad ing 398. Alternatively, a student who fails to attain a C-in either Humanities 15 or 16 may repeat these courses with the permission of a faculty advisor or academic counselor. 3. Students who fail to attain a C-(1.7) in at least two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course should normally substitute Writing 398 if they need one quarter of additional work to complete the require\u00ad ment, or Writing 39A-B if they need two quarters to com\u00ad plete the requirement. The course taken to fulfill the upper-division requirement must be completed with a grade of C (2.0) or better. The following applies to students who fail to attain a grade of C (2. 0) or better in the upper-division course: Students who fail to attain a grade of C (2.0) in Writing 139 should repeat Writing 139. Students following any other approved upper-division option should enroll in Writing 139 if a C is not attained in the selected course. See page 14 for further information on the Writing Re\u00ad quirement portion of the breadth requirement. CREDIT BY EXAMINATION An enrolled student may obtain credit for many courses by taking a special examination administered by a faculty member who normally teaches that course. Detailed proce\u00ad dures for obtaining credit by examination may be obtained from the office of the dean of the school which offers the course. Approval of any petition for credit by examination must be obtained from the dean of that school before the examination can be administered. After the dean has signed the petition, the student must have it validated by paying a $5 Credit by Examination Fee at the Cashier's Office. The instructor giving the examination retains the preroga\u00ad tive (1) to decide whether the course can be taken by examination, (2) to determine the form such an examination may take, and (3) to stipulate whether the grade will be reported as Pass/Not Pass or as A, B, C, D, or F. Academic Regulations 43 A student may take the examination for a particular course only one time. After receiving the grade, the student may accept it or reject it. If the student is not satisfied with the grade received on the examination, the student may choose not to receive credit or a grade. If the student does choose to accept the results of the examination, grades and grade points will be entered on the record in the same manner as those for regular courses of instruction. INDEPENDENT STUDY: UNDERGRADUATES ONLY Another class option is available primarily to upper-division students at UCI. The option, independent study, allows the student to plan with the instructor a course having a clear relationship to the student's academic program. The plan for the course will include a reading list, a group of assign\u00ad ments, examinations, papers, or similar evidence of intel\u00ad lectual achievement on which academic credit will be based. A description of the course and of its requirements must be approved by the instructor responsible for it and by the department chair or dean. Independent study credit for undergraduates is normally limited to five units per quarter. FINAL EXAMINATIONS Final examinations are obligatory in all undergraduate courses except laboratory and studio courses, or their equivalent, as individually determined by the Committee on Courses. Normally each such examination shall be con\u00ad ducted in writing and must be completed by all participants by the announced time shown in the Schedule of Classes for the quarter in question. These examinations may not exceed three hours duration. In laboratory and studio courses, the department concerned may at its option re\u00ad quire a final examination subject to prior announcement in the Schedule of Classes for the term. Final grade reports from professors are due in the Regis\u00ad trar's Office within 48 hours after the final examination. UNDERGRADUATE SCHOLARSHIP REQUIREMENTS Course Load Limits An undergraduate may enroll in as few as 12 units or as many as 20 units. To enroll for more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units a student must obtain the signature of the student's dean on the Enrollment in Classes Petition. Any action to add or drop courses after submission of the En\u00ad rollment in Classes Petition which will cause a student to be enrolled in more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units re\u00ad quires approval by the student's dean. This approval is cer\u00ad tified by the dean's signature on the Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Card, as appropriate. UC IRVINE - 1980-198144 Academic Regulations Class Level Undergraduate students are classified as freshman, sopho\u00ad more, junior, or senior students, based on the total number of units acquired, as follows: Freshman Sophomore Junior Senior 0-40.4 40.5- 83.9 84.0-134.9 135.0-180.0 Academic Standing To remain in good academic standing a student must main\u00ad tain a grade point average of at least 2.0 and make progress toward the degree at a satisfactory rate. An undergraduate student is normally subject to academic probation if at the end of any quarter the grade point aver\u00ad age for that quarter, or the cumulative grade point average, is less than 2.0. A student whose grade point average falls below a1.5 for any quarter, or who after two consecutive quarters on pro\u00ad bation has not achieved a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or a satisfactory rate of progress, is subject to disqualification. NORMAL PROGRESS REQUIREMENT Regular undergraduate students will become subject to probation or subject to disqualification from further registra\u00ad tion in the University if they fail to make normal progress toward the baccalaureate. (A) Normal progress for all regular undergraduate stu\u00ad dents is defined in the following table, in terms of quarter units completed at the end of quarters enrolled. Normal Subject to Subject to Quarter Progress Probation Disqualification 1 12-15 8-11 \"\" 7 2 24-30 16-23 \"\" 15 3 36-45 24-35 \"\" 23 4 50-60 40-49 \"\" 39 5 65-75 56-64 \"\" 55 6 80-90 72-79 \"\" 71 7 96-105 89-95 \"\" 88 8 112-120 106-111 \"\" 105 9 128-135 124-127 \"\" 123 10 145-150 142-144 \"\" 141 11 162-165 160-161 \"\" 159 12 180 (B) A student who at the end of a given quarter of enroll\u00ad ment has completed no less than a number of units in the range specified in the \"Normal Progress\" category under (A) is making normal progress. A student who at the end of a given quarter of enrollment has completed a number of units in the range specified in the \"Subject to Probation\" category under (A) is subject to being placed on probation by the Faculty of that student's school or program or its designated agent. A student who at the end of a given quarter of enrollment has completed no more than a number of units in the range specified in the \"Subject to Disqualification\" category under (A) is subject to disqualifi\u00ad cation by the Faculty of that student's school or program or its designated agent. (C) Students who have completed two consecutive quar\u00ad ters on academic probation without having achieved at the end of that period at least the normal rate of progress specified under (A) are subject to disqualification. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981A student will be allowed to continue on probation only if the record indicates likely achievement of the required scholastic standing within a reasonable time. (D) For purposes of calculating \"Normal Progress,\" \"Sub\u00ad ject to Probation,\" and \"Subject to Disqualification,\" stu\u00ad dents admitted to the University with advanced standing will be classified with respect to quarter of enrollment at entrance in accordance with the following table: Quarter at Entrance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Advanced Standing Quarter Units at earned under the following three circumstances are not to be counted toward determination of the quarter at entrance under (D) above: (1) Advanced Placement Examination; (2) College Level Examination Program; (3) concurrent enrollment in college courses while in high school. (F) The quarter of enrollment at entrance of students (in\u00ad cluding baccalaureate degree candidates who already hold a baccalaureate degree) seeking admission to the University with 150 or more advanced standing units will be deter\u00ad mined by the Faculty offering the curriculum in which such students seek to enroll. This determination will be made consistent with the program required for such students to obtain the desired degree and with University residence requirements. Academic Regulations 45 Probation is not a necessary step before disqualification. If a student becomes subject to disqualification, the complete record of grades and other accomplishments will be care\u00ad fully reviewed by the responsible faculty authorities of the student's school. If the record indicates little probability that the student will be able to meet the academic standards of the University of California, the student will be disqualified from further enrollment. Each school and program is obliged by Academic Senate regulations to maintain a procedure under which a student may appeal probation .and disqualification actions. In order to transfer from one campus to another in the University of California or from one UCI school to another, a student who has been disqualified or who is on academic probation must obtain the approval of the appropriate fac\u00ad ulty, or its designated agent, into whose jurisdiction the student seeks to transfer. GRADUATE SCHOLARSHIP REQUIREMENTS For a graduate student, only the grades A, A-; B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship. Information concerning graduate student course load requirements and satisfactory academic progress is given in the Graduate Division section. ENROLLMENT IN UNIVERSITY EXTENSION If a UCI student wishes to enroll in a University Ext.ension course concurrently with enrollment in regular courses, the entire program of study must be approved in advance by the dean of the student's school (in the case of graduate students, by the Dean of the Graduate Division). CREDITS FROM OTHER INSTITUTIONS: UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS UCI undergraduate students who wish to enroll in courses at another institution in either a summer or regular session and to use such courses to satisfy any UCI requirements must secure approval from the Office of Admissions and their academic dean. If such courses are determined by the Office of Admissions to be transferable, and if such courses do not duplicate other credit granted and do.not exceed limitations of credit, then the units earned may be applied toward the total required for graduation. The student's academic dean will determine the applicability of such transfer credit toward the satisfaction of specific program requirements. Students are urged to secure, in advance of enrolling in courses, authorization from the Office of Admissions and their academic deans to apply such courses toward UCI requirements. Only then will the applicability of such courses be guaranteed. Forms for securing such authoriza\u00ad tion are available in the Office of Admissions and in deans' offices. Such advance authorization is not required; how\u00ad ever, students may seek it for their own assurance. UC IRVINE - 1980-198146 Enrollment and Other Procedures CREDITS FROM OTHER INSTITUTIONS OR UNIVERSITY EXTENSION: GRADUATE STUDENTS Graduate students may be granted unit credit (not grade credit) toward a master's degree for acceptable graduate\u00ad level courses completed at another institution or through University Extension prior to enrollment in the UCI Graduate Divison. After enrollment, the student must in\u00ad itiate a formal petition for such credit. Approval of the de\u00ad partmental Graduate Advisor and the Dean of the Graduate Division is required. While enrolled at UCI or on a Leave of Absence a graduate student may receive unit credit for graduate-level courses completed at another institution or through University Ex\u00ad tension only with the prior approval of the departmental Graduate Advisor and the Dean of the Graduate Division. See the Graduate Division section for further information about graduate transfer credit and the University's Inter\u00ad campus Exchange Program. Enrollment and Other Procedures Except where noted, all information applies to both under\u00ad graduate and graduate students. Additional information concerning enrollment and academic policies applying only to graduate students is given under the Graduate Division section. ENROLLMENT AND PAYMENT OF FEES To receive academic credit for regular courses and other supervised instruction or research, a student must be offi\u00ad cially enrolled prior to undertaking such activities. Enroll\u00ad ment does not become official until all required fees have been paid, and the student's Enrollment in Classes Petition has been completed correctly, signed where necessary, and submitted to the Registrar. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollments as indicated on the Class Verification and Identification Card are correct. The Schedule of Classes is provided by the Registrar's Office with registration materials approximately six weeks before the beginning of each quarter. The most important form in the registration materials is the Enrollment in Classes Petition. It should be filled out carefully, according to the instructions provided on the form and in the Schedule of Classes. A quarterly calendar of dates for sub\u00ad mission of enrollment materials and payment of fees is in\u00ad cluded in each quarterly Schedule of Classes. The general procedures for enrollment are: 1. Consult the appropriate academic advisor to develop an approved program of study. Secure necessary signatures on the Enrollment in Classes Petition for courses that require special approval. New undergraduate students entering in the fall are en\u00ad couraged to attend one of the Student-Parent Orientation Program (SPOP) sessions during the summer for academic advising and enrollment assistance. 2. Submit the completed class enrollment and student in\u00ad formation forms to the Registrar. 3. Pay required fees to the Cashier. Any other outstanding obligations must be satisfied at this time also. Class Verification and Identification Card After payment of fees and submission of enrollment mate\u00ad rials, a Class Verification and Identification Card is available for each student. The Card lists the courses in which a student is enrolled. If any courses requested could not be scheduled, they are listed also, with the reason why the student is not enrolled in the course. Changes to course enrollments after receipt of the Card are handled through Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Cards, available from the student's academic dean's office. New undergraduate students are required to call in person at their academic deans' offices to secure their Class Verifi\u00ad cation and Identifiaation Cards and advice concerning their academic programs. Continuing undergraduate students should consult the quarterly Schedule of Classes for instructions on where to secure their cards. Graduate students secure their cards from the Registrar's Office. The Class Verification and Identification Card is certification of the student's class enrollment and is evidence that the student is registered at UCI and is entitled to Library privileges. In addition, the Card provides identification for Associated Students functions. If the Card is lost, there is a $3 replacement charge. Inquiries regarding the replacement of lost cards should be directed to the office that issued the Card. Late Enrollment and Payment of Fees Students who submit enrollment materials and pay fees within the published periods are not subject to late service fees. Those who do not submit an Enrollment in Classes Petition to the Registrar's Office during the published period are subject to a late service fee of $25. Students who do not pay all required fees to the Cashier's Office during the published period for payment of fees are subject to a late service fee of $10. If fees are not paid by the established deadline prior to the beginning of instruction, the student is subject to both late service fees (total $35) if allowed to enroll and pay fees after the deadline. To avoid the expense and inconvenience of late enrollment, students are urged to enroll and pay fees well before the published deadlines. Students with financial need should make advance arrangements with the Financial Aid Office, or another source, to have funds available when fees are due. The Registrar does not have authority to allow a stu\u00ad dent to pay fees after the deadline date, or to waive the late UC IRVINE - 1980-1981fees, except in unusual cases where the University is re\u00ad sponsible for the late transaction. A student who is allowed to apply late and, as a result, must pay fees and enroll late, is required to pay late service fees. Change of Class Enrollment After official enrollment materials have been filed with the Registrar, a student may add or drop courses, change sec\u00ad tions of a course, or change the grading option by complet\u00ad ing an Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Card, available from the student's academic dean's office. An undergraduate student may not enroll in more than 20 units (excluding Physical Education) nor fewer than 12 units of course work during a given quarter without the permis\u00ad sion of the student's academic dean. Changes to Pass/Not Pass grading must not cause the student to exceed the limi\u00ad tations to Pass/Not Pass enrollment. Graduate students may not enroll in more than 16 or fewer than eight units of graduate or upper-division credit with\u00ad out the prior approval of the departmental Graduate Ad\u00ad visor and the Dean of the GraduatE: Division. During the first six weeks of each quarter, a student may add classes provided approval to add each class is granted by the instructor in charge. To add a class, a student must obtain the instructor's signature of approval on an Add Card, carefully complete the Add Card, and submit the card to the student's academic dean's office or the Regis\u00ad trar's Office no later than the end of the sixth week of instruction. To drop a class or change the grading option during the first two weeks of the quarter, a student must obtain the signa\u00ad ture of the instructor in charge as evidence of notification on a Drop or Change of Grading Option Card and submit the card to the student's academic dean no later than the end of the second week of instruction. Students may drop classes from the third through the sixth week of a quarter, inclusive, only with the permission of the instructor in charge. A student wishing to drop a class during this period must obtain the signature of approval from the instructor in charge on a Drop Card and submit the card to the student's academic dean. After the sixth week of a quarter, students may drop a course only with the permission of the instructor and the student's academic dean. Permission to drop after the sixth week can be granted only if the student is not failing the course and not subject to disqualification, and only if drop\u00ad ping the course would be to the educational benefit of the student and/or of the class as a whole. To drop a class after the sixth week, a student must complete a Drop Card, ob\u00ad tain the instructor's signature of approval, and submit the card to the student's academic dean for the dean's action. Graduate students must have the approval of the Dean of the Graduate Division to drop a course after the sixth week. Every student enrolled in a laboratory course in which equipment is issued is responsible for the equipment when dropping a course and will not be permitted to drop until the equipment is acco~nted for. Students are responsible for their official enrollment and must be officially enrolled in each class for which they ex\u00ad pect credit. They must officially drop classes they have ceased attending. The student cannot simply discontinue attendance in a class; a Drop Card must be filed or the Enrollment and Other Procedures 47 student will receive an F grade in the class. Courses may not be added or dropped retroactively. Students are urged to verify their official enrollment during the eighth week of the quarter. Students enrolling for the next quarter will find this information included with enrollment materials for the next quarter. Those students not enrolling for the next quar\u00ad ter can verify their official enrollment by inquiring at the Registrar's Office. There is a $3 service charge for all add, drop, or change transactions received in the Registrar's Office after the sec\u00ad ond week of classes. LAPSE OF STATUS A student's status may lapse for the following reasons: Failure to pay required student fees by the prescribed dead\u00ad line; failure to respond to official notices; failure to settle financial obligations when due or to make satisfactory ar\u00ad rangements with the Cashier's Office; failure to complete the physical examination; or failure to comply with admis\u00ad sion conditions. Each student who becomes subject to \"lapse of status ac\u00ad tion\" is given advance notice and ample time to deal with the situation. However, if the student fails to respond, ac\u00ad tion will be taken without further notice, and the student will be dropped from all courses and will be entitled to no further services of the University except assistance toward reinstatement. A student who desires to be reinstated must satisfy the conditions which caused the \"lapse of status\" and pay a $10 reinstatement fee at the Cashier's Office. TRANSCRIPT OF REGORDS The transcript of a student's academic record will be re-\u00b7 leased only upon a signed request of the student authoriz\u00ad ing the release. Application for a transcript should be sub\u00ad mitted to the Cashier's Office with a check or money order payable to Regents-UC for the exact amount due. The fee for transcripts is $2 for the first copy and $1 for each addi\u00ad tional copy ordered at the same time. All outstanding debts to the University (with the exception of long-term financial aid loans not yet due and payable) must be paid in full before a transcript will be released. When a student orders a transcript sent to another college, university, or agency, it is extremely important for the stu\u00ad dent to provide a complete and accurate mailing address to ensure delivery to the correct office. At least two weeks should be allowed for a transcript to be sent to another institution or agency. DIPLOMAS Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are available, which is about 90 days after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. Students may then call in person at the Registrar's Office or authorize the Registrar to deliver their diplomas by certified mail, or registered air mail to foreign countries. There is a service charge of $2 for cer\u00ad tified mail, $3 for registered air mail, payable to Regents\u00ad UC. All outstanding debts due to the University, with the exception of long-term financial aid loans, must be paid in full before a student's di-~loma will be released. UC IRVINE - 1980-198148 Enrollment and Other Procedures CANCELLATION PRIOR TO START OF INSTRUCTION A student who pays fees for a regular academic quarter and then decides to leave the University prior to the first day of classes must submit a Notice of Cancellation, with the iden\u00ad tification card attached, to the appropriate dean's office. With the exception of new undergraduate students, there is a $10 service charge for Cancellation prior to the first day of classes. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY AFTER START OF INSTRUCTION After classes begin for a regular academic quarter, an en\u00ad rolled student who decides to leave the University before the end of that quarter must submit an official Notice of Withdrawal. A student who fails to submit a Notice of Withdrawal will receive failing grades in all courses and severely jeopardize academic standing at the University. Undergraduate students must submit the notice, with the identification card. attached, to the Assistant Vice Chancel\u00ad lor-Student Affairs. Graduate students must submit the notice to the Dean of the Graduate Division, and students in the College of Medicine must submit it to the College of Medicine Director of Admissions and Records. In extenuat-. ing circumstances, such as illness or emergency, the stu\u00ad dent should notify the appropriate dean or office as soon as possible in order to initiate withdrawal procedures. The effective date of the withdrawal will be determined by the appropriate dean. A graduate student in good academic standing who wishes to withdraw and intends to return within one year may submit both the Notice of Withdrawal and an application for a Leave of Absence. If the leave is approved, the student remains in good standing and need not apply for readmis\u00ad sion in order to enroll at the expiration of the leave period. Further information about Leaves of Absence appears in the Graduate Division section. If a student plans to leave the University after completing all academic work for the latest quarter of enrollment and has not paid fees for the next quarter, a formal Notice of Withdrawal is not necessary. See page 38 for information on fee refunds. READMISSION: UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS We strongly urge students to consider the policy below in formulating. plans for leaving or returning to UCI. Every effort will be made to readmit UCI students who were in good academic standing at the time of dropping out and who have filed readmission applications. Readmission is not automatic. A student must file an Appli\u00ad cationfor Readmission with the Registrar's Office at least eight weeks prior to the quarter in which readmission is de\u00ad sired ?nd pay anonrefundable $25 Application Fee at the Cashier's. Office. If a student has been academically disqualified from the University or has left the University while on probation or subject to disqualification, the student must apply for readmission in the manner prescribed above .. The applica\u00ad tion, however, will be forwarded to the dean of the school which the student hopes to enter. If the dean decides that the student is serious about academic life, and/or that the student has displayed capability at another academic in\u00ad stitution, the student will most likely be allowed readmis\u00ad sion to the University. Transcripts for work taken at other institutions must be submitted as part of the application. A nonrefundable fee of $25 is charged for each Application for Readmission. Remit\u00ad tance by bank draft or money order payable to Regents-UC must be attached to the application.\u00b7 READMISSION: GRADUATE STUDENTS A graduate student who withdraws and has not been granted a Leave of Absence approved by the Dean of the Graduate Division can resume graduate study only if read\u00ad mitted. An application for readmission must be submitted by the published deadline\u00b7for Graduate Division admission applications. Please refer to the statement on Readmission which appears in the Graduate Division section. INTERCAMPUS TRANSFER: UNDERGRADUATES ONLY An undergraduate student in. good standing may transfer from the UCI campus to another campus of the University of California. To do so, the. student should first check with the UCI Registrar to see which of the campuses are accept\u00ad ing transfers and which majors are being encouraged by each campus. The student then obtains an Intercampus Transfer Application form from the UCI Registrar's Office and files the form with the UCI Registrar by the deadline prescribed for the quarter in which the student wishes to transfer: The filing periods are winter quarter- July 1-31; spring quarter -October 1-31; fall quarter -November 1-30. After these dates, applications are accepted only until quotas are filled. A student may apply for only one campus in any given quarter. A nonrefundable fee of $25 is required for all'Intercampus Transfer Applications filed with the Registrar's Office.

Programming pre\u00ad sented in 1979-80 included the Bella Lewitsky Dance Com\u00ad pany, Odessa Balalaikas, pianist Deno Gianopoulos, and the New York Chamber Soloists. Committee for Arts pre\u00ad sentations supplement the performances and numerous cultural events sponsored by the UCI School of Fine Arts. OFFICE OF RELATIONS WITH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES/ EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM The Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges (ORSC) serves as a liaison between the University of California, Irvine and other educational institutions of the state. Staff members visit secondary schools and community colleges to interpret the policies and programs of the University and to seek information for the University about educational developments throughout the state. In cooperation with community colleges, ORSC staff mediates course articula\u00ad tion agreements and provides assistance with the transfer process. The ORSC staff is a resource to schools and to education-oriented groups, and responds to invitations re\u00ad questing University representatives and participation in col- UC IRVINE - 1980-1981SO Student Affairs lege advisement programs at schools and in the commun\u00ad ity. Staff members also provide information for prospective students, teachers, parents, and counselors. On the UC Irvine campus, the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges provides a number of services for the prospective student. Program information is supplied in a variety of forms; brochures, flyers, films, and slide presen\u00ad tations are available, describing programs of study offered at UCI and explaining how students can qualify for admis\u00ad sion. ORSC also schedules campus visits and tours, ar\u00ad ranges educational conferences, sponsors a variety of on\u00ad campus activities for prospective students and educational groups, and assists prospective students in the application process. The annual University Day held in October is a special day planned for college-bound high school stu\u00ad dents. Student-led tours for prospective students and their parents and school groups may be scheduled through the Office by calling Campus Tours, (714) 833-5832. Four major programs within the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges are committed to the University of California's program of student affirmative action outreach at the undergraduate level. The Educational Opportunity Program for disadvantaged students may provide, accord\u00ad ing to the student's circumstances, special admissions con\u00ad sideration, financial aid, and academic support through ad\u00ad vising and tutoring. The Student Affirmative Action Out\u00ad reach Program is designed to attract underrepresented minority and disadvantaged students who are regularly eligible for admission as undergraduates to the University of California. Younger students are the focus of the Partner\u00ad ship (Early Outreach) Program, which works with the junior high schools to increase the number of University\u00ad eligible students from low-income and underrepresented groups. University Partners is designed to maintain contact with former Partnership students in the ninth and tenth grades. These programs are described below. Inquiries may be directed to the Office of Relations with Schools and Col\u00ad leges, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717, (714) 833-5410. Educational Opportunity Program The goal of the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) is to encourage representation of disadvantaged students at UCI by assisting them in enrolling and succeeding at the University. The kinds of difficulties students encounter in seeking a college education may range from inadequate public school preparation to a lack of funds to support their education. The Educational Opportunity Program is de\u00ad signed to assist students in overcoming obstacles by provid\u00ad ing counseling on admissions and financial aid, and academic support through advising, tutoring, and learning skills services. A special EOP summer session is offered to those students identified by EOP as most likely to benefit from this support program. Counseling on a continuing basis is available to all EOP students through the Counsel\u00ad ing Center, the Tutorial Assistance Program, the Learning Skills Center, and the Special Services Office. Information and the EOP brochure may be obtained from the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges/Educational Opportu\u00ad nity Program, (714) 833-5410. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds are encouraged to apply. EOP assists those who are regularly admissible to the University, and also those who may not have met tradi\u00ad tional admissions requirements but who can offer evidence supporting their ability to achieve at the University level. With the exception of American Indians, only residents of the State of California are eligible to apply for EOP sponsor\u00ad ship. American Indian applicants must document their tribal affiliation. ADMISSION Prospective EOP students must complete the regular UC admission forms and follow all procedures. EOP applicants should take particular care with the required essay and in\u00ad dicate their interest in EOP by marking the appropriate places provided on the application. Applications may be obtained from counseling offices in California high schools and community colleges or the UCI Office of Admissions. In addition, the EOP applicant is advised to submit two letters of recommendation from teachers, counselors, per\u00ad sons in the community, or employers, which document the student's background, motivation, and academic potential. In those cases where entering the University at this time would not seem appropriate, the EOP staff may recom\u00ad mend a program of study in a community college or elsewhere, in order that the student may qualify for UCI at a later date. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Personal financial resources should not be the determining factor in deciding whether or not to attend college. All stu\u00ad dents admitted to UCI, including EOP students, are eligible for financial assistance on the basis of demonstrated need. Funds can be provided to cover room and board, registra\u00ad tion fees, books and supplies, and living expenses, when a student or family is unable to fully meet these expenses. Financial aid is comprised of a combination or \"package\" of grant, loan, scholarship, and/or part-time employment based on the individual circumstances of the applicant. See Financial Aid, page 39. Undergraduate Student Affirmative Action Outreach Program The purpose of the Student Affirmative Action Outreach Program is to attract underrepresented minority and disad\u00ad vantaged students who are regularly admissible to UCI. Campus representatives visit high schools, community col\u00ad leges, and community centers to meet with students, par\u00ad ents, teachers, and school officials to discuss the outreach approach. The program also includes a series of seminars and workshops aimed at orienting students to specific academic disciplines, such as mathematics, physics, com\u00ad puter science, chemistry, biology, and engineering. Partnership Program In an attempt to assure that more students from under\u00ad represented groups become eligible for admission to the University, the Partnership (Early Outreach) Program was organized between UCI and selected junior high schools. In the target junior high schools, the Partnership Program aims to encourage greater academic achievement among young students. Students, parents, and teachers are given information sessions at their schools and are advised about appropriate University preparatory course work. Addi\u00ad tional advising sessions at UCI provide them with the op\u00ad portunity to tour UCI facilities. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981University Partners University Partners, the most recent addition to UCI's out\u00ad reach efforts, was developed to meet the needs of ninth and tenth grade students who have been involved with the Partnership Program. Partners personnel identify former Partnership students to high school counselors and request that these students be counseled as \"college preparatory.\" Students, their parents, and their teachers are provided with information about the educational preparation neces\u00ad sary for University admission and UCI's financial aid pro\u00ad gram. In addition, Partners provides students with career counseling, motivational and learning experiences, and informational materials. CAREER PLANNING AND PLACEMENT CENTER The Career Planning and Placement Center is responsible for assisting UCI students in the process of career decision making and planning through workshops and individual advisement; for providing part-time, summer, and work\u00ad study job listings and internship opportunities for students; for assisting students and alumni seeking career employ\u00ad ment opportunities; for teaching job-search skills and in\u00ad terviewing techniques; for providing career job listings and administering a full program of on-campus recruitment; and for providing graduate and professional school infor\u00ad mation. Vocational interest testing and a computerized guidance system are available on a fee-for-service basis. Student Affairs 51 In cooperation with the Office of Teacher Education, the Center provides educational placement services for those seeking teaching, administrative, and counseling positions in education. Placement files are maintained and kept ac\u00ad tive free of charge for one year after graduation from or completion of credential work at the University of Califor\u00ad nia. A fee of $20 is assessed each year thereafter to keep a file active. In addition, the Center offers services and programs to meet specialized needs of specific student populations, in\u00ad cluding the handicapped, women, minority and disadvan\u00ad taged students, and returning students. Recorde.d job information is available on a 24-hour telephone lme, (714) 833-5270. . COUNSELING CENTER The Counseling Center offers a variety of programs through which students can learn cognitive, affective, and behavioral skills which will enable them to function more effectively in an educational environment. Group, indi~ vidual, couples, and family counseling services are avail\u00ad able to all students and their immediate relatives. All dis\u00ad cussions are strictly confidential. Consultation and training senrices are available for students, faculty, and staff to im\u00ad prove their communication and helping skills. Staff psychologists train student group leaders, faculty men:\u00ad bers, student interns, resident assistants, peer academic advisors, and administrative personnel in communication, listening, leadership, group dynamics, classroom manage\u00ad ment, teaching, and crisis intervention skills. UC IRVINE - 1980-198152 Student Affairs SPECIAL SERVICES The Special Services Office provides educational and multi-cultural support programs designed to increase the retention and graduation rates of EOP/Special Services stu\u00ad dents. The Office develops programs to help students make a smooth transition into the academic areas of their choice at UCI. Special Services professional counselors, along with peer counselors, maintain a close liaison with academic de\u00ad partments in assisting students, especially freshmen and sophomores, who are having difficulty with their course work. Through support programs which include tutoring, study skills advising, and counseling, these students are provided with resources to help them attain good academic standing. LEARNING SKILLS SERVICES The Learning Skills Center provides programming to en\u00ad hance students' reading, writing, and learning skills. Ongo\u00ad ing noncredit classes, workshops, individual counseling, and self-help materials focus on areas such as improvement of writing style, preparation for graduate entrance examina\u00ad tions, reading and studying for particular academic disci\u00ad plines, development of critical thinking skills, and im\u00ad provement of communication skills for students for whom English is a second language. Many students who utilize the services wish to improve skills developed in high school or to focus on new skills which will help them achieve their highest potential and take advantage of the opportunities for learning available at UCI. TUTORIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM The Tutorial Assistance Program (TAP) provides subject area supplementation through small group peer tutoring to undergraduate students who need academic support in ad\u00ad dition to that which is provided in the classroom. Tutoring is available in all disciplines and is designed to benefit both the student who experiences difficulty in a course and the student\" who does well but seeks to refine basic skills. TAP works closely with faculty and staff in an effort to assist students to become more confident, to reach their academic goals, and to develop a practice of independent learning. STUDENT PROGRAMS CENTER The Student Programs Center supports the efforts of stu\u00ad dents in coordinating extracurricular educational programs of diverse interest and focus which provide opportunities for students and faculty to share learning experiences on an informal basis. These programs aid students in gaining per\u00ad sonal and leadership skills through involvement in campus events and in their own residential communities. The Stu\u00ad dent Programs Center is made up of two units, Student Support Services and Campus Organization Services. Student Support Services This Office emphasizes orientation, outreach, service, and leadership development programs. Orientation programs include the Student-Parent Orientation Program (SPOP), a 36-hour live-in experience on campus for new students and their parents; Uni-Prep, a week-long, intensive program in September to help new students develop increased social and intellectual skills; Irvine Info, a spring information program for UCI applicants; and Academic Advising and Orientation Week, held in the fall. The Student Support Services Office directs the programs for handicapped and international students, commuter stu\u00ad dents, veterans and nontraditional students, and under\u00ad graduate administrative interns. In addition, the Office provides programming for the Cross-Cultural Center and advises the Minority Programs Committee. The Office is located in 255 Administration Building, (714) 833-7244. The program of support services for handicapped students is designed to provide a productive learning environment within the mainstream of campus life and to offer disabled students opportunities to ensure their effective participa\u00ad tion in the academic community. The Handicapped Student Services staff assists students with any and all concerns from the point of admission through the completion of the academic program. Specialized services include tutoring, reader service for the blind, priority registration, and provi\u00ad sion of notetakers, interpreters, and study rooms. In addi\u00ad tion, a van is available (by reservation) for transportation to medical appointments or for academically related uses, such as trips to the UCLA Library. There is a Handicapped Student Center on campus which offers a comfortable at\u00ad mosphere where students may rest, relax, or socialize with other students. All buildings on the Irvine campus are ac\u00ad cessible to wheelcHairs, and white lines are painted on walkways to indicate paths leading to curb cuts. Housing and dining facilities accommodate students in wheelchairs. Handicapped students who require accommodations for the classroom (such as the services of an interpreter or notetaker) are strongly urged to contact the Handicapped Student Advisor as soon as possible after admission in order to acquaint themselves with the policies and services of the campus. Services to international students, permanent residents, refugees, and international faculty members and scholars include assistance with visa and immigration forms and the interpretation of government regulations. In addition, the staff provides information about all the necessary services for effective participation in the University community in\u00ad cluding housing, tutoring, orientation, registration, finan\u00ad cial aid, and student activities. The staff refers students to other campus support services as necessary. The Nontraditional Students Program offers services to students returning to school after an interruption in their education. The staff assists with programming, counseling, orientation, and other student activities. The Commuter Student Program takes campus services and activities into the communities where UCI students reside. Six undergraduate student leaders coordinate the program under the direction of University staff. The Veterans Program emphasizes support services for vet\u00ad eran students. Considerable assistance for veterans with Veterans Administration benefit certification, tutorial ser\u00ad vices, orientation, and outreach programs is available through this office. Veterans are reminded that in order to receive VA educational benefits they must adhere to the standards of satisfactory progress and attendance which are described in the UCI General Catalogue on pages 13-15 and UC IRVINE - 1980-1981pages 41-46. Veterans should check with the Office for ad\u00ad ditional information regarding Veterans educational re\u00ad quirements. The Office is located in 255 Administration Building, (714) 833-6477. The Undergraduate Administrative Intern Program pro\u00ad vides participating students with administrative experience designed to increase the students' knowledge of complex organizational structures. Fifteen to 20 students are selected each year and assigned to campus administrative units where they receive practical experience. The Minority Programs Committee supports and coordi\u00ad nates a series of campus activities sponsored by Third World organizations. Major cultural events include Black History Week, Cinco de Mayo, Chinese New Year, La Tardeada, and the annual Black Awards Presentation. The Cross-Cultural Center offers a friendly atmosphere where Third World students, staff, faculty, and community members may meet. The Center provides a lounge for studying and socializing; job boards listing educational and career opportunities; and a display case with pamphlets, brochures, and flyers on campus and community events. Also, the Center houses offices for Third World student organizations and a full-time Activity Programmer who coordinates the Center's activities and serves as a resource person for students and organizations that use the Center. In addition, the Center sponsors special events, such as the Third World Feast, ethnic poetry readings, and faculty\u00ad student interactions. Campus Organization Services The Office of Campus Organization Services, located in the University Center, provides program advisement and sup\u00ad port services for all registered campus organizations, in\u00ad cluding peer program advisors arid skill development workshops designed to ensure the successful operation of registered organizations. The Office also coordinates the Cooperative Outdoor Program (COP), the Outdoor Equip\u00ad ment Rental Center, the Mesa Court Outdoors Hall (a spe\u00ad cial interest residence hall), and various credit/noncredit courses pertaining to environmental education topics and issues sponsored by student groups in conjunction with academic units. The Office also develops programs for the new ecology and environmental education center adjacent to Humanities Hall, and coordinates Women's Programs. The Women's Resources Center, located in Gateway Com\u00ad mons, serves as an umbrella organization for all campus women's programs, houses a library and reference service, and provides a meeting place for all students to discuss women's issues and concerns.

CAMPUS AUXILIARY SERVICES The Office of Campus Auxiliary Services provides child care services and audio-visual services, and centralizes the steps necessary to make specific arrangements for academic, cultural, and social events on campus. The Office, located in the Administration Building, (714) 833- 6368, is organized into four units which provide a variety of services to students, fac'ulty, staff, and community mem\u00ad bers: Central Campus Calendar, Summer Conference Office, Audio-Visual Services, and Child Care Services. Central Campus Calendar Central Campus Calendar schedules and coordinates events and activities which take place on campus. The Office provides information and advice to program plan\u00ad ners, interprets University policies and procedures, and advises those planning programs on the most economical, efficient way to use campus support services. Selection and reservations of facilities, orders for staff and equipment support, and cost estimates are processed through the Office. The Calendar Office schedules academic, Extension, and Summer Session classrooms, provides centralized bil\u00ad ling for special events, and serves the campus as a central information center by maintaining the master calendar of campus activities. The Office is located in 209 Administra\u00ad tion Building, (714) 833-5252. Summer Conference Office The Summer Conference Office serves as a one-stop service for live-in conferences, workshops, and seminars held at UCI. The Conference Office provides information, program and budget planning, and room and board accommoda\u00ad tions. Also, it can arrange recreational activities, child care, and tours of the area for faculty, students, and staff, as well as non-University organizations, educational institutions, and nonprofit groups wishing to utilize UCI facilities for approved live-in conferences. The Office is located in 209 Administration Building, (714) 833-6963. Audio-Visual Office The Audio-Visual Office provides staff assistance and audio-visual equipment on a recharge basis for students, faculty, staff, and non-University organizations in the de\u00ad velopment and presentation of programs and special events. The staff also operates the audio-visual systems for regularly scheduled academic classes in Science Lecture Hall and Social Science Hall. Consultation and support on effective media use, equipment, or any other aspect of audio-visual usage are available to the campus as a whole. For information telephone (714) 833-5128.

The Verano Children's Center and the Children's Center both provide educational programs and care for children ages two and one-half to five; the Extended Day Care Center serves children ages five to 12. The programs are designed to meet the indi\u00ad vidual needs of each child. Toward that end, the Centers provide environments in which diverse cultural, ethnic, and personal teaching and parenting styles are encouraged. The programs are open to children of UCI students, faculty, and staff, with priority enrollment and tuition subsidy available to students. Information may be obtained by visit\u00ad ing the Centers or telephoning (714) 833-6276. HOUSING AND FOOD SERVICE The Housing Office coordinates application procedures and contracts with campus residents; assists students seeking off-campus housing; provides room, apartment, room\u00ad mate, and realtor listings; provides courtesy telephone and maps; and advises on landlord-tenant rights. On-campus residences are available for 1,550 single under\u00ad graduate students in Mesa Court and Middle Earth. UCI's residence hall program emphasizes small-group living. Each hall houses only 50 or 60 students and a student resi\u00ad dent assistant. The small-scale buildings provide excellent opportunities for social interaction, student government, and leadership experience. Liberal use of wood in building UC IRVINE - 1980-1981design and picturesque landscaping help to create a home\u00ad like environment. The residences are divided into suites of four or five double rooms, with living room and bath; each residence also contains a lounge and recreation and study rooms. A limited number of single rooms is also available in each residence. Rooms are furnished except for bed\u00ad spreads, blankets, and study lamps. Both Mesa Court and Middle Earth have complete food service and dining com\u00ad mons for their residents. The halls are, however, closed during the Christmas and spring recesses. Each hall tends to have distinctive characteristics and often focuses on a specific interest or life-style. Examples include halls devoted to the fine arts, the humanities, languages, the outdoors, or crafts. An additional housing option at UCI is the 80-space Recreational Vehicle Park. Students must p.rovide their own vehicle. For further information, contact the Housing Office. A new apartment complex for single undergraduates is under construction and is scheduled to be completed in 1981. This group of 200 two-bedroom apartments will house 800 students. Half of the units will be furnished, and the others will include carpeting, draperies, a stove, and a refrigerator. A variety of programs will be available in a community center building, two lounges, and two recrea\u00ad tion buildings. Undergraduate applicants must indicate their interest in on-campus housing by marking the appropriate item on the UC Undergraduate Application for Admission in order to receive an application for housing. Prompt return of the Housing Application is important as housing priority is given based on the date of receipt of the completed housing application. Due to the large demand for housing, students wishing to live on campus should apply for admission on November 1, when the application filing period opens, if they wish to live on campus the following fall. The applica\u00ad tion for admission allows the student to request information about off-campus housing, as well. Students who become eligible for residence hall contracts will be obliged to pay approximately $275 as a reservation fee at the time the contract is returned to the University; any cancellation, regardless of the circumstances or time of year, will result in a nonrefundable penalty fee. The cost of room and board in the residence halls may be paid in monthly payments: The University also has 562 one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments in Verano Place for full-time registered students who are married, single parents, graduate students, or who are single and 25 years of age or older. Over half of the apartments are furnished, and all have carpeting, draperies, a stove, and a refrigerator. They are attractive and considerably lower in rent than comparable units in local communities. Students may apply to live in Verano Place at any time by requesting an application from the Housing Office. An application fee of $20 must accompany the application. This amount becomes part of a $50 damage deposit upon occupancy. In the event that a student wishes to cancel the application prior to receiving an assignment, the $20 is refunded. Application should be made at least six months in advance of the date the student wishes to move in. The Business and Food Service Office manages all housing and food services and is responsible for the maintenance of the various locations for food services on campus. Gateway Commons, located across from the Library, has both res-Student Affairs 55 taurant and cafeteria service. The \"North Forty\" snack bar is located adjacent to the Cross-Cultural Center. Student Center I, next to the Science Lecture Hall, houses a snack bar where each week \"Patogh\" Coffee House operates an evening program with music, food, and fellowship. This program is sponsored by the Associated Students. Vending machines are located in and around the campus buildings. Students who live in the residence halls are provided with a choice of prepaid meal plans. Meals are served cafeteria style, and the menu offers a wide selection of food, with fresh fruit and an array of salads daily. Meals are served three times daily on weekdays (brunch and dinner only on Saturdays and Sundays) in the Mesa Court and Middle Earth Commons. Students who live off campus may wish to take advantage of the Nonresident Meal Contract. This contract, good for any quarter, enables a student to eat 14 or 19 meals per week in Mesa Commons. For spring quarter, 1980, prices for these meal plans were $3.90 per day and $4.00 per day, respectively. Residential Learning The Student Programs Offices at Mesa Court and Middle Earth have the significant responsibility of providing stu\u00ad dent residents with an environment conducive to their in\u00ad tellectual, social, and personal growth. The housing staffs work closely with students to create opportunities for edu\u00ad cational exploration and ways of developing interpersonal skills. Academically oriented residential learning programs include the Social Science Center, Social Science Hall, Humanities House, Social Ecology Center, Foreign Lan\u00ad guage Programs, and Center for the Arts. The Outdoors and Photography Halls are examples of special interest hall programs. Weekend field trips and retreats, designed to amplify on-campus experiences, are often part of the in\u00ad terest hall programs. The Student Programs Offices also supervise and train resident assistants; advise the residen\u00ad tial student government, and coordinate information and skill development workshops. STUDENT HEALTH SERVICE All fully registered students are eligible for Student Health Service benefits under the UCI program. Student Health facilities include a complete outpatient clinic, staffed by physicians and nurses, supported by an x-ray and clinical laboratory.

STUDENT CONDUCT AND DISCIPLINE In order to make the administration of campus activities coherent and consistent, the Office of the Vice Chancellor-Student Affairs will provide the student with a handbook setting forth the standards of conduct expected of UCI students. This booklet, \"Policies Applying to Cam\u00ad pus Activities, Organizations, and Students,\" gives the rules concerning conduct and related matters, as estab\u00ad lished by the policies of The Regents and the President of the University. Campus regulations are available also. Stu\u00ad dents enrolling in the University are expected to assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner compatible with the University's function as an educational institution. The booklet is a reinforcement of that assumption. Copies are available from Campus Organization Services, located in the University Center. An Ombudsman is available to assist students with any problems or concerns they may encounter while at UCI, including those related to student conduct and discipline. The Ombudsman is located in the Office of the Vice Chancellor-Student Affairs.

The President handles Univer\u00ad sitywide affairs, instigates office and budgetary efficiency, and provides focal spokesmanship for the Associated Stu\u00ad dents in policy dealings with the administration. In addi\u00ad tion, the President coordinates and lobbies for student in\u00ad terests in the surrounding communities. The Executive Vice President chairs the legislative Council, sits on the Registra\u00ad tion Fee Advisory Committee, and supervises the Elections Commissioner. The Vice President for Academic Services is liaison to the Academic Senate and coordinates student input in each school. The Office also serves as the student voice in statewide academic affairs and assists students with informal and formal resolution of grievances when they arise. The Vice President for Administration super\u00ad vises the Experimental College and directs the Student Re\u00ad commended Faculty Program (SRFP) through which stu\u00ad dents nominate visiting lecturers. The Vice President for Student Services chairs the Communications Board, inves\u00ad tigates new services, evaluates current programs, and coordinates ASUCI entertainment and publicity. The executive officers are aided by appointed commissioners who deal with the Student Lobby Annex, housing, student grievances, concerts, and more. ASUCI policy and budgetary decisions are promulgated by the Council, which consists of the officers, representatives of each school, and students elected \"at-large.\" Each coun\u00ad cilperson sits on at least one subcommittee of the Council. Student Affairs 57 Council elections are held in fall and spring with 10 (or half) Council seats filled in each election. Representation The nine UC campus student bodies are linked together by the Student Body Presidents Council (SBPC), on which the ASUCI President serves. The SBPC carries out many ac\u00ad tivities, including advisement to the Board of Regents and selection of the student Regent, appointment of students to statewide University committees, and direction of the UC Student Lobby through which student interests are pro\u00ad moted in Sacramento and Berkeley (University Hall). On the Irvine campus, students are encouraged to partici\u00ad pate in and are appointed to serve on the Chancellor's Advisory, ad hoc Academic Senate, and campus adminis\u00ad trative committees. Involvement ASUCI's primary goal is to further the control by students over their own curricula, funds, administration, and stu\u00ad dent life .. All students concerned about academics, services, representation, or entertainment can reach their Council representative or the executive officers at ASUCI, Univer\u00ad sity Center, (714) 833-5547. ASSOCIATED GRADUATE STUDENTS All graduate students are members of ASUCI, and all ex\u00ad cept medical students are automatically members of the As\u00ad sociated Graduate Students (AGS). AGS is governed by a Council of members elected from each academic unit con\u00ad ducting a graduate program, and the President, who is elected in a campuswide election held during spring quar\u00ad ter. The AGS Council is an independent entity within UCI, with the exclusive responsibility as the elected student body for representation of all graduate students to the UCI administration, Systemwide, and the community-at-large. The Associated Graduate Student Council nominates graduate students for positions on all UCI administrative committees, councils, special and ad hoc committees, the UCI Academic Senate Committees, and Systemwide committees. The Associated Graduate Student Council utilizes part of the Associated Student Fee for inclusion of graduate stu\u00ad dents in the programs and services of ASUCI, and for fund\u00ad ing various projects at UCI such as film series, speakers series, and projects benefiting the UCI community. AGS representatives also work actively with the Student Body Presidents Council and the Student Lobby in efforts to im\u00ad plement legislation which is supportive of students and crucial to the social needs of the wider community. MEDICAL STUDENTS ORGANIZATION The Medical Students Organization (MSO) is governed by an elected student council composed of two officers from each class and a student body President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer. This council represents the medi\u00ad cal student body in all matters relating to the UCI campus, UC Systemwide, and the community. The Associated Students fee paid by each medical student is used, in part, to support the campuswide programs and activities of the ASUCI and specific medical student activi\u00ad ties, including student organizations, the yearbook, speak\u00ad ers, movies, and maintenance of recreational facilities.

Woolfolk, Ph.D. University of Washington, Associate Professor of Biological Sciences and Microbiology Pauline I. Yahr, Ph.D. University of Texas, Assistant Professor of Psychobiology No one can predict the future, but this much is known: the next quarter century is the time of the biologist, who will be in the midst of many of the activities that govern major aspects of life. These include some of the most challenging intellectual problems, such as the mechanisms of memory and of learning, the molecular basis of embryonic develop\u00ad ment, and the rules that help predict the behavior of the environment. Biology also lies at the heart of major social problems that face mankind in the coming decade, such as sensible management of the environment and the effective control of human populations. It is vital that educated men and women understand the contributions that biological sciences have made and will continue to make for the future welfare of mankind. The School of Biological Sciences reflects new concepts of biology in both its curriculum and its research programs. The faculty is dedicated to providing students with the op\u00ad portunity to avail themselves of the principles and ever\u00ad increasing knowledge of biology. The curriculum is de\u00ad signed to meet present and future educational needs of UC IRVINE - 1980-1981majors and nonmajors. In keeping with the responsibilities of the University, the School encourages vigorous faculty and student research programs. It strongly believes that excellence in research is essential for effective, enthusiastic, and up-to-date teaching. Each quarter nearly 300 under\u00ad graduate students and 150 graduate and postdoctoral stu\u00ad dents participate in independent research programs. In addition to the regular University requirements for ad\u00ad mission, students interested in the biological sciences should include in their high school curriculum intermediate algebra, trigonometry, biology, and especially chemistry and physics, which are now an integral part of most con\u00ad temporary biological work. The biological sciences are presented as an integrated area of study through the 12-course Biological Sciences Core, with lectures and laboratories developing the major con\u00ad cepts of modern biology. Satellite courses expand upon and intensify areas covered in the Core and provide students with the opportunity to specialize in a particular area of the biological sciences. In addition to the regular major in Biological Sciences, a concentration in Ecology and En\u00ad vironmental Biology, also leading to a B.S. degree in Biolog\u00ad ical Sciences, is available at the undergraduate level. The degree requirements of these two programs are similar, with the concentration in Ecology and EnvirOnVlental Biol\u00ad ogy placing a greater emphasis on ecology and the natural sciences and a lesser emphasis on chemistry and molecular biology. Introductory courses for nonmajors are designed to make the biological sciences meaningful and interesting and to inform intelligent citizens of biological phenomena that affect their daily lives. Graduate courses are offered in all the departments. Biological Sciences 61 Students with an interest in the application of ecology to human needs may choose the Applied Ecology major, lead\u00ad ing to a B.A. degree in Applied Ecology, which is offered jointly by the School of Biological Sciences and the Program in Social Ecology. See page 195. DEGREES Biological Sciences ............ B.S., M.A.T., M.S., Ph.D. A concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology is available at the undergraduate level.

DEGREE IN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES University Requirements: See page 13. SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS Biological Sciences Core Curriculum (90, 101, 102, 103, 103L, 104, 104L, 105, 105L, 106, 106L, 107); 51LA-LB; 3LA-LB-LC or 5A-B-C, 5LA-LB-LC; and Humanities 1A-B-C, or another option of the lower-division Writing Requirement of the breadth re\u00ad quirement (Category I) and a three-quarter sequence in either Humanities or Literature (Category IV, Humanistic Inquiry). Students must have a 2.0 cumulative grade point average in the Biologicar Sciences Core Curriculum and three satellite courses. NOTE: Students entering college prior to fall1980 may fol\u00ad low the Core Curriculum numbered 101A-B-C-D-E-F-G; 101LA-LB-LC-LD-~E-LF. In addition to the listed Biological Sciences satellite courses, Engineering EE131, Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131-A-B-C, and Physics 18A-B-C can be used to satisfy the satellite requirement. Students with a double major in Psychology and Biological Sciences can also use Psychology 151A-B-C to satisfy the satellite requirement. No student may enter as a double major, but students in\u00ad terested in other areas may possibly become double majors after the first quarter, if the second school or program ap\u00ad proves. A strong academic performance in the second area is requisite for acceptance as a double major. For information on requirements for the B.S. degree in Biological Sciences with a concentration in Ecology and En\u00ad vironmental Biology, see page 64. UCI BREADTH REQUIREMENT Those students majoring in Biological Sciences who have completed the School requirements and who have passed any two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core or its alternative with a grade of C-(1. 7) or better will have satisfied the UCI breadth requirement, with two exceptions: the upper-division Writing Requirement and Category III, Social and Behavioral Sciences. Specifically, the Humanities Core or its alternative satisfies Category IV, Humanistic Inquiry; it also satisfies the lower-division Writing Requirement when two quarters of the writing component are passed with a grade of C-or better. Chemistry and physics satisfy Category II, Natural Sciences. Category v; Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, Computer Science, is satisfied by completion of the School mathematics requirement. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981Planning a Program of Study Since biological sciences courses are built upon a base of the physical sciences, it is important for students to take their required physical sciences early. Freshmen will normally take eight units of the Humanities requirement, Chemistry lA, and a freshman seminar (Biological Sciences 2) during the fall quarter. Students with a score of 650 or higher on the Mathematics part of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) should enroll in mathemat\u00ad ics during the fall quarter. Please note the prerequisites for Mathematics 2A. During winter quarter, students will begin the Biological Sciences Core with Biological Sciences 90. Sophomores begin organic chemistry (Chemistry SlA), con\u00ad tinue the Biological Sciences Core, and complete the Humanities requirement if they have not taken it during their freshman year. Sophomores often begin taking courses in other schools to meet the UCI breadth require\u00ad ment and fulfill their mathematics requirement if they have not done so as freshmen. Sophomores who have completed the mathematics requirement as freshmen should enroll in physics. Students who intend to go on to graduate school and enter careers in research may prefer to take Physics SA-B-C in place of Physics 3A-B-C. During their junior year, most majors continue the Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences Core and take physics if they have not yet done so. Juniors complete their breadth requirements and often become involved in the satellite course requirements. Since most satellites are based upon material contained in the Core, it is usually preferable for students to have completed most of the Core before taking satellites. Finally, during their senior year, students complete the Core and may become involved in an area of specialization within the School.

A weak background might consist of not completing high school chemistry or mathematics through trigonometry, and not satisfying the Subject A requirement before entering the University. This program allows a student to gain the necessary background skills and may require five years of study at the undergraduate level. Before beginning this program of study, students must see an academic counselor in the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office, 844 Engineering Building. Freshmen should complete Writing lA, Mathematics 1, Biological Sciences 2, and an additional humanities course (to satisfy the alternative to the Humanities Core) during the fall quarter. The winter quarter should include Chemis\u00ad try 10 and continuation of humanities and mathematics. Continuation of humanities and mathematics, and an elec\u00ad tive, are taken during the spring quarter. During the second year, students should begin general chemistry (Chemistry lA-B-C), continue working on the breadth requirement and any remaining humanities re\u00ad quirements, and complete mathematics. During winter quarter, students will begin the Biological Sciences Core with Biological Sciences 90. The Biological Sciences Core, organic chemistry (Chemistry SlA-B-C), and elective courses should be taken during the third year. The fourth year should include Physics 3A-B-C, continua\u00ad tion of the Biological Sciences Core, biological sciences satellites, and possibly research or other electives. The fifth year should be relatively free to explore additional satellites and research and to complete any remaining Biological Sciences Core courses. Junior Senior Irio:L.,..o_r_e _________ Bio.

Students who take the mathematics requirement in their sophomore year should defer physics to their junior year. Physics 3A-B.C is the course for nonmajors and is fully acceptable for a degree in the Biological Sciences. Physics SA-B-C, which begins in the winter quarter, better prepares a student for Physical Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C and for some graduate schools. sciences satellite courses, Engineering EE131, Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C, Physics 18A-B-C, and Psychology 151A-B-C (for Biological Sciences/Psychology double majors) are counted as satellites. UC IRVINE - 1980-198164 Biological Sciences REQUIREMENTS FOR THE B.S. DEGREE IN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES WITH A CONCENTRATION IN ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY The School of Biological Sciences offers a concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology which provides a sec\u00ad ond pathway to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences. The concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology differs from the regular undergraduate program in having a greater emphasis on ecology and the natural sciences and a lesser emphasis on chemistry and molecular biology. Its principal objective is to afford the student an integrated, interdisciplinary program in environmental studies within the framework of a broad and rigorous physical and biolog\u00ad ical sciences background. A vital goal is to allow the student completing the course of study to be broadly trained as a biologist, with the breadth of educational experience to view environmental problems from an informed ecologist's perspective. In addition to completing basic required courses in the humanities and the physical and biological sciences, the student must complete a core of environ\u00ad mentally based courses from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, the Program in Social Ecology, and the School of Engineering. Exposure to current thought in several subareas of ecology is emphasized, and the acquisition of elementary statistical and computer skills is stressed. Opportunities to specialize in several general study areas are furnished. Students will study theoretical concepts and experimental relationships in terrestrial or aquatic systems through Ecology and Evolutionary Biology satellite courses, but may also choose to specialize in the demographic and planning aspects of environmental man\u00ad agement through classes in Social Ecology, or the tech\u00ad nological approach to environmental problem solving through advanced course work in environmental engineering. Students with an engineering perspective are encouraged to explore the program options in environmental engineer\u00ad ing (p. 212), offered by the School of Engineering. Students should also investigate the Applied Ecology major (p. 195), offered jointly by the School of Biological Sciences and the Program in Social Ecology. The Applied Ecology major em\u00ad phasizes ecology as it pertains to human needs, whereas the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology emphasizes ecology as a basic science.

Planning a Program of Study A normal program of study for the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology is similar to that for' the regular Biological Sciences major, except that Mathematics 14A-B-C is taken in place of Mathematics 2A-B-C and Biological Sci\u00ad ences 102, 102L, and 120 are normally taken in the sopho\u00ad more year. In the junior and senior years a program of study in Ecology and Environmental Biology requires In\u00ad formation and Computer Science 1 rather than Biological Sciences 107. In addition, required electives in biological sciences, engineering, and social ecologyreplace the re\u00ad quirement for three satellite courses. The UCI breadth requirement may be satisfied in the con\u00ad centration in Ecology and Environmental Biology in a man\u00ad ner similar to the regular Biological Sciences major. Further clarification on the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology may be obtained from the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office, 844 Engineering Building. SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND COURSES BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES 199 Every undergraduate student in the School of Biological Sciences has the opportunity to pursue independent re\u00ad search in a professor's laboratory in the School of Biological Sciences or in the College of Medicine as an apprentice scientist. Under the guidance of a senior scientist, the stu\u00ad dent is able to experience the challenge and excitement of the world of science and to develop new scientific skills. This activity may commence as early as the sophomore year or, in the case of exceptional students, earlier. Interested students should investigate the possibilities for research early in order to obtain a great deal of research experience, if they so desire, before they graduate. Al\u00ad though we do not require training in a foreign language, some areas of research demand that students possess lan\u00ad guage skills. Students are, therefore, encouraged to discuss foreign language needs with their advisors to see if such training is important for their own careers. Advising for research careers in the biological sciences is best accom\u00ad plished by students working together with their faculty advisors. EXCELLENCE IN RESEARCH PROGRAM The Scbool of Biological Sciences believes that successful participation in creative research is one of the highest academic goals our undergraduates can attain and accord\u00ad ingly rewards such students with Excellence in Biological Sciences Research. Through undergraduate research and the undergraduate research program in Biological Sciences, students have the opportunity of presenting the results of their research endeavors to peers and faculty, and possibly of seeing their research papers published. With successful completion of this program the students are awarded Excel-. Biological, Sciences 65 lence in Research certificates. Selected papers will be pub\u00ad lished in the School's journal of Undergraduate Research in the Biological Sciences. All Biological Sciences majors doing experimental research under Biological Sciences 199 who have completed a minimum of three quarters (with at least one quarter taken during the academic year of the symposium) are eligible to participate. They must be in good academic standing and making normal progress in biological sciences. RESEARCH ENRICHMENT PROGRAM The Research Enrichment Program is open to highly qual\u00ad ified sophomores and juniors who are interested in either health or life science research. Students may apply at the end of their freshman year to participate in the following year. The program offers students special seminars, guest speakers, field trips, and individual projects. It is the goal of the program to introduce students to as many and varied areas of biology as possible, with the intention of participat\u00ad ing in a 199 research project the following year. Selection into the program is based on interviews and overall academic records. MARINE ECOLOGY SUPER COURSE For the winter quarter of odd years, Biological Sciences 181 (Advanced Marine Ecology) and 182 (Applied Marine Pro\u00ad ductivity), or a similar grouping, will be combined into a Marine Ecology Super Course. These courses, with a Biological Sciences 199 research course, will constitute a student's entire winter quarter curriculum. The course is limited to 20 students with selection based on a question\u00ad naire and interview. Prerequisites are completion of Biolog\u00ad ical Sciences 101E and consent of instructor. TERRESTRIAL ECOLOGY SUPER COURSE For the spring quarter of even years, Biological Sciences 167 (Field Ecology), 172 (Physiological Plant Ecology), and 173 (Physiological Animal Ecology), or a similar grouping, will be combined into a Terrestrial Ecology Super Course. These courses, with a Biological Sciences 199 research course, will constitute a student's entire spring quarter curriculum. The course is limited to 20 students with selection based on a questionnaire and interview. Prerequisites are completion of Biological Sciences 101E and consent of instructor. UNDERGRADUATE SEMINARS In addition to research opportunities, there are freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior seminars which enable stu\u00ad dents to meet in small groups with individual professors. Topics vary from quarter to quarter. Exciting developments in modern biology as well as other topics of interest to students are discussed. Some of the areas are regeneration, developmental biology of marine invertebrates, immunol\u00ad ogy, regulation of enzyme action and synthesis, human ecology, population ecology, experimental neuroanatomy, and neural and endocrine bases of behavior. UNDERGRADUATE TEACHING OPPORTUNITIES Through the Education Motivation Program and the Tutor\u00ad ing Program, students can immediately put to practice skills UC IRVINE - 1980-198166 Biological Sciences ' they have learned in their biology training. These programs provide opportunities for students to develop teaching abilities and to perform a worthwhile and necessary ser\u00ad vice. In the Education Motivation Program, present biologi\u00ad cal sciences majors go into the elementary and junior high schools to motivate students toward a career in the sci\u00ad ences. In the Tutoring Program, UCI students tutor other UCI students in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics. 3-2 PROGRAM IN THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ADMINISTRATION Students who are interested in a career in administration and who will have completed all of the course requirements for a degree in Biological Sciences by the end of their junior year may apply to a cooperative 3-2 program which leads to a Master's degree in Administration as well as the Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences. During the senior year, students will take courses in administration which will count toward the 180 elective units needed to receive the Bachelor's degree. Upon successful completion of the required courses and units, usually at the conclusion of the first year in the 3-2 program, the B.S. degree in the Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences will be awarded. The M.S. degree in Adminis\u00ad tration will be awarded after successful completion of course requirements, ordinarily at the end of the fifth year. SPECIAL RESEARCH RESOURCES Special research resources include the Museum of System\u00ad atic Biology, a teaching and research facility which cur\u00ad rently contains material on local populations of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates; the Developmental Biology Center, devoted to analyzing developmental mechanisms in amphibians, insects, and other invertebrates; the Irvine Arboretum, a botanical garden facility; the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, which supports controlled marsh biota; the Burns Pinon Ridge Reserve, a high-desert habitat in San Bernardino County; and the UCI Ecology Preserve, which includes coastal hills on the campus, once under heavy grazing, but now returning to a more natural state. It is important to note that the School has access to the College of Medicine on our campus, thereby providing an opportunity for the sharing of both teaching and re\u00ad search activities. ADVISING: ACADEMIC, CAREER, HEALTH SCIENCES ACADEMIC ADVISING The Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office coordinates the advising program and provides academic counseling as well as special services particularly in the area of preprofes\u00ad sional career counseling. The Office also houses the office of the Counselor for Special Programs. This office is re\u00ad sponsible for academic counseling, coordination of special services, and professional career counseling specifically for minority and E.O.P. (Educational Opportunity Program) students. All freshmen will be enrolled in small group freshman seminars (Biological Sciences 2). All other new students will be enrolled in special sections of Biological Sciences 190. The professor conducting the seminar will be the student's faculty advisor. Upper-division peer advisors will be ac\u00ad tively involved in these seminars. Peer Academic Advisors The Peer Academic Advisors are senior Biological Sciences majors who bring with them valuable academic and social experiences. Their functions include counseling students in mat.ters of major selection, program planning, petitioning, tutoring, learning skills problems, and participation in co\u00ad curricular and extracurricular activities. The Peer Advisors are located in 844 Engineering Building near the Student Affairs Office. Office hours are posted at the beginning of each quarter, and anyone should feel free to drop by and discuss any social or academic problems. CAREER ADVISING Information on graduate and professional schools in the health sciences can be obtained from the Student Affairs Office. Additional career information and job opportunities are available through the UCI Career Planning and Place\u00ad ment Office. It would be wise for students interested in forestry, nurs\u00ad ing, dental hygiene, scientific illustration, and other highly specialized fields to begin their education at institu\u00ad tions offering such programs. Areas of opportunity open to those with a Bachelor of Sci\u00ad ence degree include laboratory technology, publishing, technical editing, pharmaceutical sales, and training pro\u00ad grams in gas companies, oil companies, and county, state, and federal agencies. A B.S. degree, plus short training periods, may prepare students for employment in education, medical technology (usually one year), physical therapy, opticianry; and vari\u00ad ous other areas. The bachelor's degree is necessary to pur\u00ad sue studies leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. Education (community colleges, state colleges, or private schools), medical illustration, and public health (which in\u00ad cludes hospital administration, biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health sciences, social work, public health education, maternal and child health, and infectious and tropical diseases) are fields in which opportunities are available upon completion of a Master's program. The Ph.D. degree may lead to research in many areas, among them bacteriology, biochemistry, biometeorology, botany, cytology, ecology, fishery biology, genetics, home economics, microbiology, pathology, physiology, psychobiology, range manag~Cment, soil conservation, zoology, and public health. Other areas where advanced degrees are necessary include medicine, dentistry, law, optometry, podiatry, osteopathy, and veterinary medicine. HEALTH SCIENCES ADVISING Advising for careers in the health sciences is a specialty of .the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Students de- UC IRVINE - 1980-1981siring to enter the health sciences should have their pro\u00ad grams checked in the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. They should also check deadlines for taking the New Medical College Admission Test or other required tests and application deadlines. The New Medical College Admission Test, required by most medical schools, is ad\u00ad ministered in spring and fall of each year on the Irvine campus. This test should be taken in the spring of the junior year. Many of our students desire a career related to their educa\u00ad tion in the biological sciences. Students can go into medi\u00ad cine, dentistry, optometry, osteopathy, podiatry, veterinary medicine, and related medical fields; into teaching; and into research in the biological sciences. In properly preparing for such careers, planning is essential early in a student's education. Students interested in certain areas of the health sciences (e.g., physical therapy, nursing, dental hygiene) may receive some of their prerequisites at Irvine but may find it advisable to enroll at an institution which offers de\u00ad grees in these areas. Leaders in dental, medical, and veterinary education rec\u00ad ommend that students preparing to seek admission to their schools plan to obtain a bachelor's degree. Students who plan to enter a school of dentistry, medicine, or other areas of the health sciences may receive the required preprofes\u00ad sional training on the Irvine campus. This preprofessional training may be accomplished by (1) completing the major in Biological Sciences or (2) majoring in any school or de\u00ad partmentand fulfilling concurrently the specific course re\u00ad quirements of the dental, medical, or other professional school the student expects to attend. Students interested in the health sciences should choose electives in the social sciences, possibly a foreign language, physical chemistry, or other specific courses required or recommended by graduate schools. STUDENT PARTICIPATION BSSA The School of Biological Sciences highly recommends un\u00ad dergraduate student participation in its activities. The Bio\u00ad logical Sciences Student Association (BSSA) is an autono\u00ad mous student group which provides a liaison among the administration, faculty, Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office, and students. Some of its activities include teaching evaluations, a Biofaire, special events, and publication of a list of 199 courses available and a quarterly newsletter. Alpha Epsilon Delta Alpha Epsilon Delta is a national honor society for students preparing for careers in the health professions. The object of the society is to encourage excellence in premedical scholarship; stimulate an appreciation of the importance of premedical education; promote cooperation and contacts between medical and premedicfil students and educators; bind together similarly interested students; and use its knowledge for the benefit of health organizations, charities, and the community. In addition to regular meetings, the chapter shows medical films, visits medical centers and health facilities, sponsors campus and community health service projects, and honors outstanding members of the health community. Biological Sciences 67 BSSO The Black Students in Science Organization (BSSO) was established to maintain a unified and supportive commu\u00ad nity of successful Black science and prehealth professional majors at UCI. The group holds weekly meetings; sponsors guest speakers; provides academic support in the form of study sessions, examinations, and study aids from previous classes; and compiles and disseminates information on careers and issues affecting the Black community in particu\u00ad Jar. BSSO also works in close association with the UCI Col\u00ad lege of Medicine chapter of the S.N.M.A. (Student National Medical Association). Major achievements have included \"BSSO Week\" and the cosponsoring of an CCM/CBS Chicanos in Creative Medicine/Biological Sciences (CCM/ CBS) was established to promote interaction among Chicano-Latina students majoring in the Biological Sci\u00ad ences. Some of the activities include lectures by prominent scientists, opportunities to visit graduate schools, and an annual dance. The major aim of CCM/CBS is to help mem\u00ad bers attain the goal of their choice-be it medical school, graduate school, or any science-related profession. Medspur Medspur is dedicated to serving prehealth professional students in both their social and academic endeavors. It attempts to bring together students in an environment con\u00ad ducive to the development of cooperation and friendship. It is also committed to providing members with the opportu\u00ad nity to learn about the realities of their prospective careers and the issues which face the health profession. Medspur invites members of the medical community to speak about their professions and sponsors faculty-student interactions, <lances, and preparation sessions for the New MCAT and Chemistry 1A. The annual UCIIUCLA Pre\u00ad Health Conference allows students to explore professions available in the field of health care delivery. GRADUATE PROGRAM The School of Biological Sciences offers graduate study in a wide variety of fields ranging across the spectrum of the biological sciences. The four Departments of the School of Biological Sciences (Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecol\u00ad ogy and Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Psychobiology) and three Departments of the College of Medicine (Biological Chemistry, Micro\u00ad biology, and Physiology) cooperate in the conduct of a unified graduate program, administered by the School of Biological Sciences. The organization of the Departments encourages an interdisciplinary approach to scientific prob\u00ad lems, especially at the graduate level. All programs of study, regardless of emphasis, lead to the degrees of Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in the Biological Sciences. At the cur\u00ad rent time, applications for the M.A.T. are not being ac\u00ad cepted. Each Department has ~raduate advisor whom students may consult in regard to the technical details of their individual programs. UC IRVINE - 1980-198168 Biological Sciences Applications for admission to graduate study are evaluated both by the Graduate Division and by the School or the Department to which the student has applied on the basis of letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examina\u00ad tion scores, grades, and other qualifications of the appli\u00ad cant. Candidates for graduate admission are urged to con\u00ad sult the department(s) whose faculty and expertise best fit their interests. Some faculty are members of an interdisciplinary bio\u00ad physics and biophysical chemistry group. These faculty are from the Department of Chemistry in the School of Physical Sciences; the Departments of Developmental and Cell Biol\u00ad ogy and Molecular Biology and Biochemistry in the School of Biological Sciences; and the Department of Physiology in the College of Medicine. This program provides an oppor\u00ad tunity for interaction among graduate students and faculty who share common interests in biophysics and biophysical chemistry. Participating graduate students pursue a degree in the department best suited to their own background and research interests. A program of seminars brings the group together monthly to discuss research problems of mutual interest, and a regular series of interdisciplinary courses is offered by the participating faculty to provide formal in\u00ad struction in areas encompassed by biophysics and biophys\u00ad ical chemistry. Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy in the Biological Sciences While both the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy programs are offered, emphasis at the graduate level is on the Ph.D. programs. Most training takes place within one of the departments, although full facilities and curricular offerings are available to all graduate students in all de\u00ad partments of the biological sciences. Interdisciplinary study and research are encouraged. Students are expected to maintain a B average at all times, attain the Master's degree in two years, and attain the Ph.D. in four or five years, depending on departmental affiliation. A Master's degree, however, is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree. Each new student is assigned a faculty member as a tem\u00ad porary advisor. During the first part of the initial year of graduate work, the student plans an academic program in consultation with the graduate advisor or a small commit\u00ad tee. Faculty advisors are changed if the specific interests of the student change. Student~ are encouraged to consult with other faculty members with regard to their research and academic interests. During their graduate training all students will serve some time as teacher apprentices under the direction of advanced teaching assistants and faculty. Advanced graduate stu\u00ad dents may work closely with faculty in the planning and execution of the teaching program. The amount and exact nature of the teaching experience varies with the departme\u00a5 MASTER OF SCIENCE Plan 1: Thesis Plan -The .student completes seven upper-division or graduate courses including a minimum of five nonresearch courses. The student then presents a thesis based upon research done while in the School. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Plan -The student completes a minimum of nine upper-division and graduate courses. At least six must be graduate courses (numbered 200-299) in the student's field of specialization. This pro\u00ad gram is terminated with a comprehensive final examination. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY First Level of Competence -The student attains this level by completing oral or written examinations at the discretion of the department. Second Level of Competence -This level is attained by passing an examination dealing with the student's particu\u00ad lar interests. A committee for the purpose of administering this examination is appointed by the Dean of the Graduate Division. Once this examination is completed, the student is ad\u00ad vanced to candidacy for the degree and is considered to have formally begun dissertation research. The student submits a dissertation on this research and defends it at an oral examination during the final year of graduate study.

Schneiderman: Developmental biology and insect physiology Grover C. Stephens: Comparative animal physiology The Department of Developmental and Cell Biology is con\u00ad cerned with the development, physiology, structure, and function of organisms and their component cells. The main emphasis of the Developmental and Cell Biology graduate program is research training in either developmental and cell biology or comparative physiology of animals and plants. The Department maintains facilities for research in\u00ad volving biochemistry; genetics; electron microscopy; cell, tissue, and organism culture; microsurgery; and neurophysiology. Students in the Department of Developmental and Cell Biology generally enter one of two graduate curricula. In the first year, those emphasizing comparative physiology take a three-quarter sequence of organismic physiology (Developmental and Cell Biology 210). Those emphasizing developmental and cell biology take a series of courses (five out of a possible eight) in the first two years. The selection of the first-year course program is made in consultation with a faculty advisory committee when the student first arrives on the campus. This committee monitors the stu\u00ad dent's progress through the first year after which the stu\u00ad dent's thesis committee is established and takes over the advising function. Students are able to diverge from this basic Core into their areas of special interest by means of graduate seminar courses in subsequent years. At the end of the first year students in comparative physiology take an oral examination that covers a broad area in the general and related fields of interest to that student. Students in de\u00ad velopmental and cell biology prepare and defend a research proposal and are examined in fields related to the proposal. Since many doctoral students in the Department undertake academic careers, the Department expects each graduate student to participate in a directed teaching experience dur\u00ad ing the graduate program. Students who enter with normal academic P.reparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within five years or less. Some faculty from the Department are members of an in\u00ad terdisciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. See page 68 for a description of the program.

Littler: Marine production ecology and algal functional morphology Richard E. MacMillen: Physiological animal ecology Gordon A. Marsh: General entomology Eloy Eco-biological function of chemical ecology; W. Runde!: Physiological plant ecology John T. Smiley: Plant-insect interactions Ecology and evolutionary biology deals with the establish\u00ad ment of adaptations over evolutionary time and with the significance of these adaptations in ecological time. The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology focuses on problems at the population and community levels, with particular emphasis placed on coevolved processes. While the Department has faculty specialists in plant and animal ecology and in marine and terrestrial ecology, primary at\u00ad tention is given to important ecological questions rather than to particular habitats or taxa. Faculty and graduate student research is often centered at the interface of two or more of these specialties. Departmental research activities include ecological energetics, plant-herbivore and plant\u00ad pollinator interactions, population and reproductive ecol\u00ad ogy, and community ecology. These research endeavors attempt to achieve a balance between empirical and theoret\u00ad ical approaches to evolutionary and ecological problems. Primary emphasis in the Department graduate program is placed on training leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sci\u00ad ences; under exceptional circumstances, a student may be admitted initially to the M.S. program. All entering stu\u00ad dents are required to enroll during the first year in a two\u00ad quarter graduate core sequence. At the end of the first year, these students will complete an oral examination based upon the core courses and other materials the Department might require. Satisfactory performance on this examina\u00ad tion is required for continuation in the graduate program. Students entering with a B.A. or B.S. degree will enroll in the graduate core for two consecutive years, while those entering with an M.A. or M.S. degree will enroll only for the initial year. Each entering graduate student will be as\u00ad signed a faculty advisor and a three-person advisory com\u00ad mittee for guidance, with whom the student will meet at least once each quarter. All students are encouraged to submit a research proposal to their advisory committee dur\u00ad ing their first year of residency. A comprehensive proposal is required before the end of the second year. The progress of each student is reviewed by the departmental faculty before the end of each academic year. \u00b7 Normally, all requirements for the Ph.D. should be com\u00ad pleted within five years. No more than seven years will be allowed for completion of the program. Prior to advance\u00ad ment to candidacy for the Ph.D., students must satisfy two breadth requirements at the discretion of their advisory committee. One of these must be satisfied with a foreign language and the second by the attainment of an additional skill equivalent to a second foreign language (i.e., a second foreign language, demonstrated skills in computer\u00ad statistics, attainment of unusual technical expertise neces\u00ad sary for dissertation research, etc.). Advancement to doc\u00ad toral candidacy by a comprehensive oral examination will be expected during the third year for students entering with a B.A. or B.S. or during the second year for those entering with an M.A. or M.S. Applicants for this program should have a solid undergraduate program in biology and ecol\u00ad ogy, emphasizing both research and field work. In addi\u00ad tion, course work in statistics, mathematics, and physical and chemical sciences is expected. All applicants are re\u00ad quired to submit verbal, quantitative, and advanced biology GRE scores. The deadline for application is February 1.

The cur\u00ad riculum of the Department is designed to provide advanced training to individuals interested in the molecular basis of regulatory systems which operate in viruses, in micro\u00ad organisms and cultured mammalian cells, and in the struc\u00ad ture, genetics, and synthesis of immunoglobulins. The core curriculum is centered about the molecular biology and genetics of viruses and bacteria, the fundamentals of the immune response, the biology of cultured animal cells, and the genetics and physiology of infectious agents. It is recommended that the student's undergraduate prep\u00ad aration include courses in calculus, physical chemistry, and biochemistry. Before a graduate degree will be awarded, the student must demonstrate competence by course work and examination in biochemistry, physical chemistry, gene\u00ad tics, and various aspects of microbiology and immunology. During the first year, all students in the graduate program will be expected to spend approximately six weeks in vari\u00ad ous faculty members' laboratories with the aim of becoming familiar with the research approaches and the laboratory techniques employed in each specific research area. Incom\u00ad ing students review their programs each quarter with the departmental graduate student advisor. During the second or third year, each student will take an advancement to candidacy examination. Graduate students are required to take graduate courses in biochemistry, and Microbiology 210, 212, 213, and 214. Additional course work will reflect the interest of individual students. The major remaining requirement for the Ph.D. degree will be the satisfactory completion and oral defense of a dissertation consisting of original research carried out under the guidance of a faculty member. Students with adequate preparation should be able to complete the Ph.D. in four years or less.

The Department provides research opportunities in the molecular biophysics of membranes and proteins, endocrinology, cellular physiology, and the physiology of exercise, respiration, and the nervous system. The faculty research is generally oriented toward molecular and cellular physiology, but opportunities for research in organ physiology also exist. The core curriculum provides the student with a broad background in physiology and biophysics and the closely related fields of anatomy and biochemistry. Elective courses permit in-depth exploration of particular areas. Interdisciplinary dissertation research involving the research of more than one faculty member is encouraged. Prerequisites for admission normally include a bachelor's . degree in one of the biological sciences, physics, chemistry, mathematics, or engineering, as well as undergraduate courses in calculus, organic and physical chemistry, biochemistry, and advanced biology (e.g., neurophysiol\u00ad ogy, cell biology, neurobiology, psychobiology). Up to two prerequisites may be fulfilled as first-year electives. GRE Aptitude and Advanced tests are required. Preference will be given to those students who have prior research experience. The Department admits about three highly qualified stu\u00ad dents each fall. The program emphasizes original research, and students are expected to become involved in the re\u00ad search of the Department as early as possible. The core program includes graduate courses in physiology, UC IRVINE - 1980-1981biophysics, biochemistry, morphology, and cell biology. After the first year, training will follow the classical tutorial pattern in which a small number of students are tutored by the faculty in an informal setting. Students also will partici\u00ad pate in a prograin of laboratory rotations and attend the weekly colloquium in physiology. The third and fourth years will be spent primarily in research, with some partici\u00ad pation in teaching physiology to medical students. Each student must submit a written dissertation on an original research project and successfully defend this dissertation in an oral examination. \u00b7 Incoming students will receive academic advising from the Department Graduate Advisor until such time as they choose a thesis advisor. The faculty conducts quarterly re\u00ad views of all continuing students to ensure that they are maintaining satisfactory progress within their particular academic program. Students who have completed all necessary prerequisites should be able to complete the Ph.D. within four years. A comprehensive examination will be administered in June at the en If of the second year. The examination is based upon the tutorials in advanced physiology and is designed to test the student's ability to organize a body of knowledge and to think critically. Some time during the third year, the student will present a seminar on a topic assigned by the formal candidacy committee. Following the seminar, the committee will critically examine the student's qualifica\u00ad tions for the successful conduct of the doctoral dissertation. Advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. is recommended to the Dean of the Graduate Division upon the unanimous vote of the committee. Some faculty from the Department are members of an in\u00ad terdisciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. See page 68 for a description of the program.

UC IRVINE - 1980-198184 SCHOOL OF Fine Arts Clayton Garrison Dean The primary activity of the School of Fine Arts is creating and performing works of art in an atmosphere in which the creative process is central. We are committed to the creative act: to making and performing. A program based on such a commitment requires a faculty experienced in the creative process. The faculty in the School of Fine Arts is comprised primarily of permanent artists-in-residence. Studio courses in all areas are taught by eminent faculty who have earned their living professionally and who continue to maintain professional assignments and commitments. In addition to the permanent artists-in-residence faculty, visiting artists comprise about one-third of the staff, provid\u00ad ing a constant inflow of ideas and personalities. A variety of artists challenges the students' sensibilities and encourages them to think and to create freshly and freely. The focus on the creative process, the professional and scholar-performer faculty, and the individual's commit\u00ad ment and courage provide, we feel, an ideal condition for the serious student in the arts who wants to be painting, sculpturing, dancing, acting, singing, directing, chore\u00ad ographing, writing, or playing an instrument six to 10 hours a day during the most sensitive and formative years of life. Our central concern is the development of a creative talent in an atmosphere of creative activity. In addition to programs concerned primarily with studio and perfor\u00ad mance activity, courses of study in the history and theory of the arts are offered as major areas of concentration. Undergraduate majors are offered in History of Art, Studio Art, Dance, Drama, Music, and Fine Arts (General Inter\u00ad disciplinary). Requirements include extensive studio and workshop experiences, essential theoretical and historical backgrounds, and exercises in criticism. The requirements for all performing and studio majors in the fine arts are designed to provide opportunities for the student-artist to work creatively for at least four hours a day from the freshman year through graduation. Courses in film writing and television are available in the Drama program. A student who wishes to pursue a double major by combin\u00ad ing two majors from the School of Fine Arts or by combin\u00ad ing a major from the School with a major from another academic unit may do so with the proviso that only one major can be officially declared until the senior year. At that time, when the requirements for both majors are nearly completed, the student can be approved as a double major. In addition to producing student concerts, musicals, and dramatic performances, the School of Fine Arts presents a varied offering of cultural events each year, including dis\u00ad tinguished lecturers, world-renowned concert artists, out\u00ad standing dance and drama groups, jazz and folk perform\u00ad ers, a film series, and a gallery program. The Fine Arts Village includes studio and classroom space for the areas of studio art, art history, dance, drama, and music. Specialized,facilities for the studio art area include an Art Gallery and six well-lighted studios for drawing, UC IRVINE - 1980-1981painting, sculpture, graphics, and ceramics. Power equip\u00ad ment for sculpture, two presses for graphics (intaglio), and two kilns for ceramics are available. The Village Theatre, conventionally designed, contains an orchestra pit, a large, completely equipped stage, and seating for 420 people. The Concert Hall, seating 230, has a thrust platform stage, a Baroque pipe organ, and excellent acoustics. The Studio Theatre provides an experimental stage base without fixed seats, allowing complete freedom in determining the style . of production. The Little Theatre, located in Humanities Hall, is an intimate proscenium theatre for Drama Work\u00ad shops and graduate directing projects. All theatres are completely equipped with modern sound and lighting sys\u00ad tems, and students involved in productions work in com\u00ad pletely equipped and professionally operated scenery and costume shops. Campus television studios are also located in the Village. Music students attend orchestra rehearsals in a special Village facility also utilized for choral and instru\u00ad mental ensemble rehearsals. Practice rooms are equipped with Steinway practice pianos, and Steinway concert grands are used in concerts. A music listening laboratory is also available to music students. Dance classes in ballet, freestyle, and jazz are held in four locations: the two main studios in the Fine Arts Village, Crawford Hall (gym\u00ad nasium), and the Studio Theatre. The School of Fine Arts is organized as a School with areas of instruction and production, rather than with formal de\u00ad partments. The faculty in each of the major areas of instruc\u00ad tion (art history, studio art, dance, drama, music) nomi\u00ad nates five students to the Dean's Student Advisory Council. The Dean selects two undergraduates and one graduate student from each area. These 15 students comprise the Fine Arts 85 Dean's Student Advisory Council for a term of one year. The Council meets about six times a year. This council re\u00ad views matters concerning appointments and promotions, curriculum, appropriations, policy on graduate admissions, productions and concerts, and community relations. There is no difference between undergraduate and graduate par\u00ad ticipation. The students act as an ad hoc review committee on all permanent appointments and on all recommenda\u00ad tions for merit increases and promotions. Students in the School of Fine Arts and qualified students from other academic areas are involved at a less formal level as par\u00ad ticipants, organizers, and coordinators throughout the year in the various productional units, including University Chorus, UCI Symphony Orchestra, University Theatre, Student Exhibitions, Graduate Art Gallery, Dance Con\u00ad certs, Friday One O'Clock Concerts, Dance Workshop, Drama Workshop, Music and Opera Workshop, and Televi\u00ad sion Production. The opportunity is provided for all qualified UCI students to participate in the UCI Pep Band and Song Leaders, and to receive course credit for this participation. Those in\u00ad terested should see the instructor of Theatre Orchestra, Drama 173, about requirements for participation and en\u00ad rollment in the appropriate course. All new Fine Arts students are assigned or may choose their own faculty advisors and are encouraged to meet with them during orientation week and periodically throughout the year to plan programs of study and to discuss educa\u00ad tional and career objectives. In addition, students are in\u00ad vited to make use of the counseling services in the Fine Arts Counseling Office for assistance with programs, require\u00ad ments, or any academic matter.

School Requirements: None (see under programs). GRADUATE PROGRAM The School of Fine Arts offers a program leading to the degree of Master of Fine Arts with concentrations in studio art, dance, drama, and music. The primary activity of the School of Fine Arts is performance -the creative act. Re\u00ad search activities are concerned with illuminating perform\u00ad ance and inspiring the studio experience. The intellectual activity of theoretical, literary, and historical courses com\u00ad plements the practical work in studio workshops and per-formance. The aim of the program is, thus, to produce liter\u00ad ate artists who are responsive to intellectual stimuli, who are capable of integrating knowledge into creative acts, and who are disciplined to the point of freedom. It is the strong belief of the School that intellectual integrity and profes\u00ad sional excellence cannot exist without each other. Admission to the Program Applications are accepted for fall quarter admission only, \\ and ordinarily must be completed by March 1 as tpe number of graduate students that can be admitted to the School of Fine Arts is limited. Applicants are advised to arrange for submission of portfolios, auditions, composi- tions, dossiers, and interviews, as appropriate, by March 1. Students applying for scholarships and fellowships should do so by March 1, and are also encouraged to apply for financial assistance through the Office of Financial Aids. The School of Fine Arts has a modest number of teaching assistantships available in all areas, and all candidates are automatically reviewed for teaching assistantship positions; the School informs successful candidates by June 1 for the following academic year. Upon admission to the program the student will be as\u00ad signed an advisor. The student should discuss with this advisor the scope of undergraduate preparation to deter\u00ad mine any areas which may need strengthening if the stu\u00ad dent is to derive full benefit from graduate study.

The curriculum con\u00ad stantly relates studio practice to the development of the visual arts and current critical theory. It aims to develop a sense of visual awareness by as wide a range of the study of art as possible. The student majoring in art experiences the creative aspects of art by learning to think with the mate\u00ad rials and techniques of the medium. UC IRVINE - 1980-198188 Studio Art Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 13. School Requirements: None. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS Studio Major: Art Studio 30A-B-C; Art History 40A-B-C or any three courses from Art History 20A-B-C-D-E-F; one year in lower-division studio courses in sequence; three courses in history of modern art; 12 upper-division studio courses (Art Studio 145 through 194). SAMPLE PROGRAM FOR FRESHMEN Fall Art Studio 30A Art History 40A Elective Elective Winter Art Studio 30B Art History 40B Elective Elective Spring Art Studio 30C Art History 40C Elective Elective Master of Fine Arts Program DEGREE OFFERED M.F.A. in Fine Arts, with emphasis in studio art. GENERAL INFORMATION The M.F.A. program focuses primarily on development of experimental concepts and format relevant to contempo\u00ad rary issues as they affect visual arts, rather than on pro\u00ad cesses of traditional techniques and ideas. A small, per\u00ad sonal environment supports the individual's efforts in re\u00ad search, development, and exhibition of ideas by providing as much latitude for special needs as possible. By meeting with students on a one-to-one basis or in small groups, a variety of art experiences occur. Internships, selected field trips, contemporary exhibitions in the Art Gallery, contact with visiting professional artists, and seminars provide the framework for the program. Because of the limited physical facilities, studio space is arranged privately. ADMISSION Applicants for admission to the degree program must meet the general requirements for admission to the Graduate Di\u00ad vision, hold a B.A. or B.F.A. in Art, and submit by March 1 a portfolio of their creative work. Normally, anyone who has earned an M.F.A. degree in Studio Art will not be con\u00ad sidered for admission into the program. GENERAL DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Normally two years of residence are required. Each candi\u00ad date must enroll for three courses each quarter for six quar\u00ad ters, exclusive of summer sessions. The student's progress and body of work will be reviewed by a faculty committee, normally after three quarters in residence. A satisfactory opinion by this committee will allow the student to progress to candidacy for the degree. Satisfactory attainment must be demonstrated by a specific creative project. This project is to be supported by a thesis incorporating visual and written material relevant to the project and the candidate's creative research while at UCI. Oral defense of the project and essay may be required to test the candidate's general knowledge in the area in which the project falls. SPECIFIC DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Seventy-two quarter units in graduate or approved upper-division undergraduate courses must be completed with a grade of at least B in each course.

University of California, Irvine, Associate Pro\u00ad fessor of Dance Janice Gudde Plastino, Ph.D. University of Southern California, Associate Professor of Dance Barbara Plunk, Lecturer in Dance Antony Tudor, Associate Director, American Ballet Theatre, Lecturer in Dance Dance 89 The program in dance provides studio experiences in the fundamental knowledge and techniques of classical ballet and of contemporary dance movements. The classical academic approach to ballet adheres to those principles de\u00ad veloped from Noverre through Petipa and Cecchetti mod\u00ad ified to accommodate our current understanding of those laws of physics and of the human anatomy applicable to the study of dance. The workshops in contemporary dance explore and extend the various approaches to modern dance and jazz, concentrating on physiological and rhythmic problems encountered in contemporary choreog\u00ad raphy. Studies in preclassic dance forms and their musical structures provide additional workshop experience as well as significant research materials for choreographic prob\u00ad lems. Theoretical and historical courses complement the practical work in workshops, choreography, and perform\u00ad ance. The program is designed for students preparing to continue professionally as dancers, as choreographers, and as teachers, as well as for students who, while not planning to make dance their vocation, have a serious interest in the theory, practice, and history of dance. The traditional technique of classical ballet constitutes a craft and style that serves not only as a physiological center for the logical training of the body, but also as a basic lan\u00ad guage of movement for the choreographer. Workshop ex\u00ad periences build progressively on the techniques of ballet and extend through the contemporary idioms of jazz, mod\u00ad ern, and freestyle. The aim is to develop kinetic resources, precision, flexibility, and freedom in a coordinated and in\u00ad telligently responsive body. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 13. School Requirements: None. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS Students planning to major in dance should develop basic ability in techniques of ballet and freestyle dance forms. Although freshmen entering with fewer than 12 units are not required to audition, a placement examination is of\u00ad fered. The evaluation of the examination indicates the level of ballet and freestyle at which the student is placed. Freshmen declaring the dance major are encouraged to take the placement examination, especially if they feel they could be placed at a higher level than Ballet I and Freestyle I. At the end of the sophomore year, the faculty will deter\u00ad mine whether the student is making sufficient progress to proceed as an upper-division major. All advanced standing applicants (entering students with 12 units or more) to the University who have indicated an interest in majoring in dance are required to audition and will be notified by the School of the date. Evaluations of the student's audition will indicate whether or not the student may major in dance and will indicate the appropriate placement level in ballet and freestyle for students admitted to the major. This placement level determines the minimum amount of years it will take to complete the de\u00ad gree requirements. Inasmuch as the level of performance ability generally de\u00ad termines the length of time in study, and all transfer stu- UC IRVINE - 1980-1981UC IRVINE - 1980-1981dents must anticipate meeting the total performance re\u00ad quirements for the B.A. degree, students deficient in level of performance in comparison to their level of academic study should be prepared to extend their studies in order to meet performance requirements.

University of Texas, Austin, Lecturer in Drama The program leading to the Bachelor of Arts in Drama pro\u00ad vides the professional training and the liberal study essen\u00ad tial to attaining the highest standards in theatre. Each major in drama experiences exacting and rigorous training in the mutually interrelated areas of the theatre: performance, de\u00ad sign, literature, history, and criticism. The curriculum con\u00ad stantly relates studio practices, technical resources, and productional techniques to the development of dramatic literature and current critical theory. The student specializes during the last two years of study in acting, directing, design, television, or criticism. Majors in drama are expected to undertake extensive studies in art, dance, and music. The continuous production of plays, musicals, operettas, and operas constitutes the major activity of the program. Students are treated as members of a theatrical organiza\u00ad tion, and they acquire experiences in all phases of theatrical production in a professionally disciplined atmosphere. Dramatic production centers on an exhaustive analysis of the script and on the challenge of communicating the com\u00ad plexities of the plan to an audience in a unified and mean\u00ad ingful production. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981The program is designed for studenos preparing to con\u00b7 tinue professionally as actors, directors, designers, critics, and teachers, as well as for students who, while not plan\u00b7 ning to make the theatre their vocation, have a serious in\u00b7 terest in the literature, theory, and practice of drama.

The program for the Bachelor's degree in Music is designed for two types of students: those who wish to obtain a sound background in music leading to a terminal degree and those who wish to obtain a thorough preparation for undertaking graduate work in one or more of four broad fields: musicol\u00ad ogy, composition; music performance, and teaching. The program provides intensive training in three mutually de\u00ad pendent areas as related components of a total musical ex\u00ad perience: performance and musicianship, the theory of music, and the history of music. A knowledge of all three of these areas is indispensable and minimal for a successful Music 97 career in music. The program in music provides practical and theoretical studies fundamental to a wide spectrum of careers in music. The aim of this program is to give a sound basic musical education for students wishing to fulfill them\u00ad selves either as performers, scholars, or teachers, as well as in other musical pursuits. A special option is available to fulfill the needs of those students whose primary interest is in the area of string performance. Beyond the specific goals outlined above and the require\u00ad ments listed below, the student in music, through coopera\u00ad tive programs undertaken in conjunction with the other arts, achieves an awareness of the relationship of music to those other arts and of the various roles of music in society, both past and present. Several music scholarships are available. These include, but are not restricted to, the Hinkle-Phillips Memorial Scholar\u00ad ship ($1,000), the Harry and Marjorie Anne Slim Memorial Scholarships ($1,000), the Music Section of the Town and Gown Scholarships, and the Zubin Mehta Scholarship given by the Orange County Philharmonic Society ($500). For information on how to apply, please contact the Music Office. Performance Requirements The student will audition at the beginning of the freshman year (earlier auditions may be arranged by contacting the Music Office) to determine the student's ability to meet the performance requirements of the program as stated below. After two years, the faculty will determine whether the student is making sufficient progress to proceed as an upper-division music major. All transfer students are re\u00ad quired to audition for the music faculty and receive permis\u00ad sion before declaring a major in Music.

UC IRVINE - 1980-1981SCHOOL OF Humanities William J. Lillyman Dean The School of Humanities sets for itself the goal of helping to develop both the analytical and creative powers of its students with particular respect not merely to some specific and limited vocational goal, but also the the larger ques\u00ad tions of human conduct, the modes of human communica\u00ad tion and symbolization, speculative thought, and the verbal arts. The School includes those basic disciplines of lan\u00ad guage, literature, history, and philosophy that deal funda\u00ad mentally with the relation of man to himself and to all that is other than himself. As such, the School takes as its con\u00ad cern a large portion of the liberal education not only of students who intend to major within its confines, but also of students who come to it from other parts of the campus. Because of the nature of the disciplines collected in the School, it is deeply concerned with language and its many facets. Further, though the School has established a number of specific major courses of study, it is intent on integrating the basic disciplines in a variety of ways at the undergraduate level and to some extent at the graduate level. Degrees Classical Civilization ............................. B.A. Classics .................................. B.A., Ph.D. Comparative Literature .............. B.A., Ph.D. English B.A., M.F.A., Ph.D. ............................. Ph.D. ............................ Ph.D. History B.A. B.A. B.A. Spanish ..................... B.A., M.A.T., M.A., Ph.D. HONORS Students are nominated for honors at graduation on the basis of scholarship and special achievements. To be nomi\u00ad nated the student must achieve a UC grade point average of at least 3.40 and receive strong recommendation from the department. A minimum of 18 courses (72 units) in residence at UCI is a necessary condition for honors at graduation. To be eligible for nomination, the student must meet all honors criteria and must file an application for graduation by the end of the winter quarter of the senior year. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS The School offers undergraduate majors in Classical Civili\u00ad zation, Classics, Comparative Literature, English, French, German, History, Humanities, Linguistics, Philosophy, Russian, and Spanish. It offers elementary and inter-Humanities 103 mediate courses in Hebrew and elementary and upper\u00ad division courses in Italian and Portuguese. A corps of lower-division advisors is designed to meet the special needs of freshmen and sophomores. The advisors are particularly interested in undergraduate education and especially knowledgeable about University regulations, re\u00ad quirements in and outside the School, course content, op\u00ad tions to major, and other matters that may present difficul\u00ad ties. Students in the School do not elect majors until the last quarter of the sophomore year, at which time each student is assigned an advisor in the major chosen. Until that time the lower-division advisor is prepared to help the student keep options to major open, plan a coherent program of humanistic study, and reach an eventual decision about the major. NOTE: In many undergraduate courses in the School of Humanities, additional meetings between individual stu\u00ad dents and the instructor may be required. Generally each major stipulates a one-year course that is both an introduction to the discipline and a prerequisite to the major itself. Students who plan wisely with their ad\u00ad visors will construct programs that include a good number of such courses. Undergraduate students in the School of Humanities par\u00ad ticipate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serving on committees of various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, and by serving on the Humanities Council, which directly advises the Dean. Graduates of the School of Humanities often go on to graduate and professional schools. An undergraduate major in the humanities is excellent preparation for future careers in law, teaching at all levels, business, journalism, administration, government service at all levels, and even medicine. Language Laboratory The Language Laboratory serves as the audio-lingual re\u00ad source center for the following languages taught in the School of Humanities: Spanish, French, German, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, and Hebrew. Students, faculty, and staff may listen to cassettes of audio material in the Laboratory, or they may check out cassettes and cassette players to practice at home. Members of the community are welcome to use the Language Laboratory facilities on campus. In addition to the languages offered in the School of Humanities, the Language Laboratory has a tape library that includes reels in Persian, Romanian, Chinese, Japanese, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, English, and Swahili. Arrangements can be made to provide these lan\u00ad guages on cassette. Through the business office, the Language Laboratory op\u00ad erates a translation referral service for students, faculty, staff, members of the community, and local businesses. The Language Laboratory is located in 207 and 213 Humanities Hall and is open from 8:00a.m. until4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. The telephone number is (714) 833-6344. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981104 Classics Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 13. SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS Humanities 1A-B-C, taken in the freshman year (transfer students may substitute appropriate course work in com\u00ad position, literature, history, humanities, and philosophy for the Core Course by permission: apply in the Dean's Office); two years of work in a single acceptable foreign language, either modern or classical (through 2C), or equi\u00ad valent competence; quarterly consultation with an assigned lower-division advisor and the advisor's written approval for the program of study decided upon. Consultation should be made by the second week of each quarter. GRADUATE PROGRAMS The School offers a wide program of graduate degrees. Al\u00ad though the Master's degree is offered in most departments, the programs emphasize the Ph.D. and give distinct prefer\u00ad ence in admission to those students who intend to take that degree. An exception is the two-year Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing). In addition to the seminars of\u00ad fered by the various departments, the School sponsors a number of interdisciplinary seminars annually. These courses are taught jointly by faculty members from various departments. Further, several departments offer a few stu\u00ad dents the opportunity to do part of their work for the Ph.D. in a related discipline. A limited number of students is accepted annually to study for teaching credentials. This program is a cooperative effort between the School and the Office of Teacher Education. Graduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serving on committees of the various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, and by serving on the student graduate advisory committee, which directly advises the Dean. DEPARTMENT OF Classics B.P. Reardon, D.U. Universite de Nantes,Chairofthe Department and Professor of Classics Luci Berkowitz, Ph.D. The Ohio State University, Professor of Classics Theodore F. Brunner, Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of Classics and Director, Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project . Peter Colaclides, Ph. D. University of Athens, Professor of Classics Richard I. Frank, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Associate Professor of Classics and History Dana F. Sutton, Ph. D. University of Wisconsin, Assistant Professor of Classics UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The Department-of Classics aims to provide the under\u00ad graduate student with an exposure to the origins and heri\u00ad tage of Western civilization. The Department is committed to a twofold purpose: (1) disseminating interest in and knowledge of classical civilization through the teaching of Greek and Latin language and literature; and (2), through English translation courses in classical literature, history, civilization, and mythology, helping students to appreciate the pervasive influence of Greece and Rome on our own civilization. The Department offers both a major in Classics with an emphasis on Greek, Latin, or Linguistics and a major in Classical Civilization in which most of the required courses are in English translation. Students are encouraged to consult with the Classics faculty regarding the appro\u00ad priate choice of major and design of program. For the Classics major, the basis of studying the Classics must be competence in both of the classical languages. The Classics program is designed to provide the student with this competence as rapidly as possible, so that by the end of first year Latin or Greek the student has already been intro\u00ad duced to some of the major classical authors in the original. From then on, the student is concerned with reading and interpreting the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and will devote study to literary and textual criticism. In addi\u00ad tion, students obtain an extensive background in ancillary fields such as ancient history, archaeology, art, drama, philosophy, and religion. The major in Classical Civilization is designed for those students who have no plans to pursue graduate studies in the classical languages, yet wish to obtain an under\u00ad graduate degree based on a sound exposure to the classical world. The nucleus of this major consists of one year of study (or its equivalent) in either classical language and a minimum of 10 courses in English translation (seven of which are given by the Department) concerning such topics as classical literature, civilization, history, archaeology, art, and drama. The student planning to major in Classics or Classical Civilization should obtain a copy of the pamphlet, \"The Classics,\" available in the departmental office. Students entering UCI with previous Greek or Latin train\u00ad ing will be given advanced standing as follows: In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, and four years of high school Latin will enroll in Latin lB, 1C, 25, and 100 respectively. Exceptions to this ruling can be made but must have the approval of the Department Chair. Stu\u00ad dents with high school training in the classical languages are encouraged to consult with the Classics staff before en\u00ad rolling in Classics courses. The Department adheres to the policy of giving its students an opportunity to participate in the departmental decision-making process. Student representatives, elected from and by the undergraduate majors, participate in all departmental meetings. They are responsible for maintain\u00ad ing close liaison with their constituency, for representing the students' interest in curriculum and personnel matters, and for the evaluation of both the academic program and the academic staff. Please direct inquiries regarding language placement, pre\u00ad requisites, planning a program of study, or other matters UC IRVINE - 1980-1981related to the Department's offerings to the Office of the Chair, 142 Humanities Hall, (714) 833-6735/5896. HEBREW AND JUDAIC STUDIES Courses in Hebrew and Judaic Studies were initiated by the Department of Classics in September, 1976, through a joint agreement between the School of Humanities and the Uni\u00ad versity of Judaism in Los Angeles. Under the auspices of this agreement, students may take two years of the Hebrew language. The courses cover both contemporary and bibli\u00ad cal Hebrew. In addition, it is intended that a course will be offered each quarter in either Jewish history, philosophy, or literature. All courses are taught by faculty from the Uni\u00ad versity of Judaism. Through this program the Department of Classics is able to broaden its offerings to include both the Greek and Hebrew contributions to Western civilization. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 13. School Requirements: See page 104. Classics 105 DEPARTMENTAL REQUIREMENTS Two separate majors: Classics (with an emphasis in Greek, Latin, or Linguistics) and Classical Civilization. Classics (Greek emphasis): five or more courses on the Greek 100 level; Greek 110; Latin 1A-B-C; Latin 25; two courses on the Latin 100 level. Classics (Latin emphasis): five or more courses on the Latin 100 level; Latin 110; Greek 1A-B-C; Greek 25; two courses on the Greek 100 level. Classics (Linguistics emphasis): two possible plans of study. Greek concentration- Greek 25; five courses on the Greek 100 level; Greek 110; Latin 25; two courses on the Latin 100 level; Linguistics 50, 110, 120, 130 (Greek 120 re\u00ad commended), or Latin concentration -Latin 25; five courses on the Latin 100 level; Latin 110; Greek 25; two courses on the Greek 100 level; Linguistics 50, 110, 120, 130 (Latin 120 recommended). NOTE: With the permission of the Department, an addi\u00ad tional100 series course in the same language may be substi\u00ad tuted for Greek or Latin 25. Classical Civilization: Latin (or Greek) 1A-B-C, or equiva\u00ad lent; Classics 35A-B-C; Classics 50A; at least one course UC IRVINE - 1980-1981106 Classics each from the Classics 150, 160, and 170 series; three addi\u00ad tional courses in classical history, classical philosophy, clas\u00ad sical art, or classical civilization approved by the Classics Department. Planning a Program of Study The Department believes in close consultation with stu\u00ad dents on academic advising, program planning, and dis\u00ad cussion of goals and direction. Students planning to major in Classics or Classical Civilization are strongly urged to consult with the departmental faculty at the earliest possi\u00ad ble moment, in order to familiarize themselves with the nature of the various programs. All majors are assigned to a faculty member for academic advising. Career Opportunities The Classics major may lead to a career in high school teaching, or, after appropriate graduate study, in college and university teaching. The major is prepared for admis\u00ad sion to graduate study in classics, comparative literature, linguistics, ancient history, or, with additional course work, archaeology. A Classics or Classical Civilization major is also excellent preparation for entering a theological semi\u00ad nary. However, it is not the essential purpose of a major program in Classics, and especially Classical Civilization, to provide specific vocational skills. The study of Greek, Latin, and classical civilization is primarily a valuable component of a liberal education. A knowledge of Greek and Roman literature, history, religion, philosophy, and science pro\u00ad vides a proper foundation for the investigation and ap\u00ad preciation of all aspects of modern civilization. Nevertheless, the student who chooses to major in Classics or Classical Civilization has the choice of many professional opportunities. Graduate and professional schools in law, medicine, or business welcome students with training in the Classics. In many sectors of the business world, corpo\u00ad rations prefer to train prospective managers and executives according to their own special methods and needs. These businesses are well acquainted with the value of a person who has chosen to study classics as an undergraduate. In a world of rapid industrial growth in which highly special\u00ad ized skills quickly become obsolete because of changes in technology, the student with a strong background in a respected liberal arts major such as Classics offers the diversity, flexibility, precision, and ability to learn which employers in business, government, and industry find attractive. More specific career information is contained in the publication \"Careers for Classicists\" available from the Department. GRADUATE PROGRAM The Classics graduate program emphasizes individual at\u00ad tention under tutorial conditions and study in small groups. The number of students admitted is carefully limited and work is closely supervised. Each student is associated with various faculty members while developing general compe\u00ad tence in the discipline, research methods, and teaching. The principal strength of the program is in the area of litera\u00ad ture, particularly Greekliterature. The entering student should be qualified at least to the level of the B.A. in Clas\u00ad sics; some students may be required to do additional work at the undergraduate level. Students entering with the B.A. are normally expected to complete the Ph.D. program in four to five years. Comple\u00ad tion of a dissertation and its successful oral defense are required. A sample Ph.D. curriculum can be obtained on request from the Department. The M.A. degree may be conferred after two years of satisfactory work. Students meet in one group for regular course work consist\u00ad ing of four elements as follows: (1) a single weekly seminar, covering a different topic each quarter, which may meet on another UC campus in some quarters; (2) a topically arranged weekly colloquium covering, in a three-year cycle, texts on the reading list; (3) instruction and practical work in the tradition, methods, and tools of classical scholarship, including computer ap\u00ad plication to literature; (4) tutorial instruction in Greek and Latin language and advanced prose composition. In addition to course work, students are required to read extensively in the general field of Classics, under faculty guidance. Students take written examinations, and their progress is assessed periodically. Students are required to pass reading examinations in German and French at an early stage. After course work is completed, each student must pass an indi\u00ad vidually designed qualifying examination, covering both the general field of Classics and the student's own interests, in order to become a candidate for the Ph.D. and enter the dissertation stage. The resources of the program are appreciably enhanced by contributions from other sources. In particular, cooperative arrangements are in force among the Classics graduate programs of the UC campuses at Irvine, Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara. Additionally, the program calls on visiting scholars, faculty from other UCI departments, and mem\u00ad bers of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae project (see below). THESAURUS LINGUAE GRAECAE PROJECT Financed through private and federal funds, a major re\u00ad search project aimed at creating a Thesaurus Linguae Graecae has been in operation at the University of California, Irvine since the summer of 1972. This project has as its goal the creation of a computer-based data bank of Greek literature from its Homeric beginnings to approximately A.D. 600. The data bank now includes most texts written up to A.D. 200. The project expects, while continuing data collection, to devote substantial effort in the future to the provision of services to the scholarly community. Though a separate administrative entity, the TLG is closely related to the Department of Classics in many respects. Faculty members of the Department are involved to varying degrees in TLG research; Classics graduate students are en\u00ad couraged to apply for TLG assistantships; UCI's library and research resources in Classics are immeasurably enhanced by the text and reference holdings acquired by the TLG for its own purposes; TLG-related conferences and visits UC IRVINE - 1980-1981by scholars from North America and Europe afford the De\u00ad partment and its students many contacts with eminent classicists of special competence. The establishment and availability of a data bank of ancient Greek literary and documentary materials has made UCI a major source of research activity in the field of Classics.

Wlecke, Ph.D. Michigan State University, Associate Professor of English Charles P. Wright, Jr., M.F.A. University of Iowa, Professor of English The Department of English and Comparative Literature is concerned with the nature and value of literature, possible approaches to literary works, and the relation of literary criticism to the intellectual issues of the day. Fundamen\u00ad tally it is concerned with the humanistic problem of value. Thus its main literary concern is critical and theoretical. Though not alone in the task, the Department recognizes a continuing obligation to help all students write the English language with clarity and grace. Students are given the opportunity to participate in de\u00ad partmental affairs through two elected student committees, one of undergraduates, one of graduates, which are con\u00ad cerned primarily with matters of personnel and curriculum. The committees meet periodically with faculty committees of the Department, and the recommendations of student committees become matters of record which accompany any recommendations emanating from the Department. Each quarter all students taking classes within the Depart\u00ad ment have the opportunity to evaluate the particular course and teacher. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The Department offers to the undergraduate essentially three areas of study: The Program in Literary Criticism, which emphasizes a variety of critical approaches in the reading and criticism principally of English and American literature. The Program in Writing, which offers an emphasis in the writing of poetry, fiction, or drama. The aim of the program is to encourage the creative powers of students while intro\u00ad ducing them to the discipline of reading and practical criti\u00ad cism, often in workshop situations. Under certain circum\u00ad stances, creative writing courses may satisfy part of the Writing Requirement portion of the UCI breadth require\u00ad ment (Category I). See page 14. The Program in Comparative Literature, which, though administratively a part of the Department, is basically in\u00ad terdisciplinary in its orientation, drawing on faculty and other resources from the fields of the various modern and classical literatures and drama. The consciousness of the modern educated person is the product of centuries of cul\u00ad tural heritage, including not only works of literature in one's own language but world literature from Homer to Gide and Thomas Mann. At UCI, Comparative Literature is regarded as the study of literature from the international point of view rather than in a national framework. A stu\u00ad dent who completes a degree in Comparative Literature will be expected to have a grasp of the history of literature in its broad outlines and to be able to deal competently with liter\u00ad ary texts, whatever their period or national origins. Since the Department believes that a student of literature should recognize the importance of understanding theoret\u00ad ical problems in literature, of developing a broad acquaint\u00ad ance with literary texts, and of experiencing the problems of literary creation at first hand, the Department invites students to take work in all three of its programs, with an emphasis in one of the first two (toward a Bachelor's degree UC IRVINE - 1980-1981in English) or a major in the third (toward a Bachelor's degree in Comparative Literature). Many of the courses will vary in specific content from year to year, depending on the plans of individual teachers, since the Department recognizes that no course can treat all the major authors and works relevant to a given period or topic. Students intending to major in English or Comparative Lit\u00ad erature should obtain a copy of Undergraduate Study in Eng\u00ad lish and Comparative Literature from the departmental office. Comparative Literature is well-suited for students in\u00ad terested in a double major. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 13. School Requirements: See page 104. DEPARTMENTAL REQUIREMENTS English: Two courses from theE 28A-B-C or CL SOA-B-C groups (including either E 28A or CL SOA) and a third course either from those two groups or from E 6, 7, 8 or CL 7 or 8; CR 100A-B; CL 100; E 102A-B~C; four courses above 102, at least three of which must be 103s or 104s; competence in a foreign language, either classical or mod\u00ad ern, equivalent to six quarters of work at Irvine (in classical languages, 1A-B-C and Greek or Latin 100 three times, though Greek or Latin 25 may be substituted for one of the 100 courses), plus (in modern languages) one course in a foreign literature in which texts are read in the original language; passing performance in the Senior Comprehen\u00ad sive ~~amination ~n English (see below). Students selecting a ~r.Ihng emphasis have some flexibility in substituting wntmg workshops for period and genre courses; their total courses normally nu~ber more than the usual major. Comparative Literature: Sufficient competence in a foreign language, either modern or classical, to be able to deal with any standard literary or critical text in that language with facility. If the student intends to continue with graduate work, the study of a second foreign language is highly rec\u00ad ommended before graduation. Three quarters of lower-division work: Comparative Litera\u00ad ture majors are normally required to take CL SOA-B-C. Transfer students may be required to take one or more courses in the sequence depending on the courses they have taken previously. Normally 10 upper-division courses in addition: usually these CL 104; suitable upper\u00ad divisiOn _course work in the literature of a foreign language; appropnate study in English and American literature; and further study in literature or allied fields as recommended by the advisor. The Comparative Literature Program maintains a com\u00ad prehensive reading list in world literature, on which CL SOA-B-C and CL 102A-B are based. Students who have not taken and passed one or more of those courses may, by prior arrangement with the Director of the Program, take an exami\u00ad nation on releva\u00b7nt parts of the reading list in qualifying for a Bachelor's degree in Comparative Literature. English and Comparative Literature 109 PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Students should plan, with their faculty advisors, coherent programs of study, including undergraduate seminars, wor~shops in writing (for students choosing a writing em\u00ad phasis), and courses in allied areas outside the Department. It is possible to combine a cluster of courses in literature with other majors in the sciences and social sciences, and to use an English or Comparative Literature major as prepro\u00ad fessional training in government, law, medicine, etc. Stu\u00ad dents who wish advice in planning such programs should consult both the Department and people in their prospec\u00ad tive professional areas. Students who intend to pursue a single subject or multiple subject Teaching Credential must consult with Professor Myron Simon (as well as with the Office of Teacher Educa\u00ad tion) to ensure that they understand the departmental and state requirements. A student who intends to continue with graduate work is urged to study a second foreign language before graduation. THE SENIOR COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION IN ENGLISH (E 102A-B-C) Each of the three courses English 102A-B-C results in a part of the Senior Comprehensive Examination. Although thus attached to a sequence of courses, the examinations require students to prepare much of the reading list on their own. Divided into three parts by historical periods, the examina\u00ad tion will ask that a student reveal the following: an ability to read any given literary text intelligently; a knowledge of the general outlines of English and American literary history, including the more significant facts and dates; an under\u00ad standing of the terms appropriate to literary discussion; and a knowledge of the works on the reading list. Students must take the three examination courses in their senior year. A student who fails part one may enroll in a second course, taking a make-up examination at first op\u00ad portunity, and so on with parts two and three. No student may take any of the three parts of the examination more than three times, and no student who fails to pass all three parts may receive a degree in English. Normally students will take the three parts in the A-B-C order; students grad\u00ad uating in an off quarter, however, may vary the sequence. Copies of past examinations may be obtained in the Office of the Department of English and Comparative Literature. GRADUATE PROGRAM The Department's three principal areas of work on the un\u00ad dergraduate level -English and American Literature, Comparative Literature, and the English major with writing emphasis -are reflected in the graduate programs: the M.A. and Ph.D. in English, the M.A. and Ph.D. in Com\u00ad parative Literature; and the M.F.A. in English (Creative Writing). A student's courses for the M.A. and Ph.D. in English may include or emphasize work in American litera\u00ad ture as well; and the faculty is particularly equipped to guide students with special interests in criticism and theory, an area which candidates for the Ph.D. in English or in Comparative Literature may stress in their qualifying examinations and dissertations. Ordinarily students are not admitted to the English or Comparative Literature pro\u00ad grams unless they plan to continue, and are qualified to UC IRVINE - 1980-1981110 English and Comparative Literature continue, to the degree of Ph.D. Students are admitted to the M.F.A. program chiefly on the basis of submitted crea\u00ad tive work. A committee of the Department, with the con\u00ad sent of the Dean of the Graduate Division, admits students to these programs. Each program has a director appointed by the Department Chair. A deliberate effort is made to maintain close administrative and intellectual ties between the programs. \u00b7 Specific requirements for graduate degrees will be reached by consultation between members of the faculty and the candidate. The first-year graduate student orthe candidate for the Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing) plans a program with an assigned advisor; candidates for the Ph.D. plan with an advisor and three-person commit\u00ad tee. At the time of the M.A. examination, the Graduate Committee evaluates the student's graduate career up to that point and offers advice about future prospects. Candi\u00ad dates for literary degrees are encouraged to study philos\u00ad ophy, history, foreign languages and literatures, and the fine arts. Applicants for graduate degrees in English and Compara\u00ad tive Literature must submit scores for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) including the Advanced Literature in English Test; applicants must also submit sample papers and a statement about competence in foreign languages. Part-time graduate work is not permitted. Only in excep\u00ad tional circumstances will students be permitted to under\u00ad take programs of less than six full courses during the academic year. The normal expectation, however, is en\u00ad rollment in three courses each quarter, except for Teaching Assistants, who take two courses in addition to earning credit for University Teaching. Students who are not teaching should be able to complete course work in two years, plus a quarter or a summer for preparation of the M.A. examination, which is normally taken after about nine courses. The Ph.D. qualifying examination should be taken within a couple of quarters after courses are finished. Dis\u00ad sertations can frequently be written in a year. The Ph. D. in English normally should be completed in five years or less; the Ph.D. in Comparative Literature normally should be completed in six years or less. The Department recognizes that many of its graduate stu\u00ad dents intend to become teachers, and it believes that graduate departments should be training college teachers as well as scholars -indeed, that teaching and most liter\u00ad ary scholarship complement one another. Thus the\u00b7De\u00ad partment has initiated a program by which all its Ph.D. candidates, in English as well as in Comparative Literature, may gain supervised training as part of the formal seminar work required for the degree. M.F.A. candidates also have the opportunity of participating in this program. All those interested in graduate study in the Department should obtain the brochure on graduate programs from the departmental office. English MASTER OF ARTS IN ENGLISH Each candidate for the M.A. will be assigned to a graduate advisor who will supervise the student's program. The M.A. plan of study includes (1) the completion of course work, as advised, for three quarters or the equivalent; (2) demonstrated proficiency in reading a designated foreign language, modern or classical; and (3) the passing of a writ\u00ad ten examination upon a designated reading list. Exceptional students may be exempted from taking the examination by petitioning the Graduate Committee, which will review the student's performance and qualifications in arriving at its decision. The candidate must take all formal work in graduate-level courses and seminars. MASTER OF FINE ARTS IN ENGLISH The Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) is a degree in creative writing. The M.F.A. degree is normally conferred upon the comple\u00ad tion of a two-year residence. Each quarter the candidate will be enrolled in either the poetry or fiction section of the Graduate Writers' Workshop, which will constitute two\u00ad thirds of a course load, the other course to be selected in consultation with the student's advisor. The fifth quarter of work toward the degree may be taken at the Instituto Al\u00ad lende, San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. It is expected that M.F.A. candidates will complete at least one supervised teaching seminar. In addition to course work, the candidate is required to pass an examination on a reading list of literary works in the genre selected, and to present as a thesis an acceptable book-length manuscript of poetry or short stories, or a novel. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN ENGLISH The program for the Ph.D. in English requires about two years of full-time enrollment in regular courses beyond the B.A. (two of which may be in the graduate teaching pro\u00ad gram); proficiency in the reading of two acceptable foreign languages, modern or classical; the dissertation; and satis\u00ad factory performance on designated examinations. The languages acceptable depend upon the nature of the student's program as determined by the student's advisors. Reading competence in one of these languages must be established in the first year of residence, and competence in the second well before the general examination. Students admitted at the post-M.A. level must provide evi\u00ad dence of satisfactory competence in foreign languages. Competence in one of the two languages required for the Ph. D. is verified through a course in theory and practice of translation; the other language may be verified through examination. Upon completion of course work the student takes general examinations on literary theory and criticism; some particu\u00ad lar literary form, genre, style, theme, or structure; a histori\u00ad cal period; a group of authors; and a specific topic. The first four of these examinations are written; the fifth is oral. The student has the opportunity to present personal choices for the examination, but the choices must enable an individual to demonstrate breadth of knowledge as well as literary understanding and therefore must be approved by the ad\u00ad visory committee. Upon satisfactorily completing the general examination and the oral Qualifying Examination, the student is admitted to candidacy for the degree. As soon after completion of the general examination as is practicable, the student presents UC IRVINE - 1980-1981an essay leading to a dissertation for the approval of the doctoral committee. Submission of an acceptable disserta\u00ad tion completes the Ph.D. All work for the Ph.D. degree must be in courses limited to graduate students. Comparative Literature There are at least four avenues by which the student may approach graduate work in Comparative Literature: l. an undergraduate major in Comparative Literature equivalent to the one described above; 2. an English major, provided that a sufficient background in at least one foreign language is demonstrated (a begin\u00ad ning on a second foreign language is desirable); 3. a normal major in drama, with same proviso as 1. above; 4. a normal major in a foreign language, provided that a sufficient general background in world literature is demonstrated. Make-up work will be required before graduate studies can begin if one of these avenues has not been taken. At the graduate level, the study of Comparative Literature becomes more specialized, with the student engaged in a particular area of research and dealing with such problems as the development of genres, interrelations between litera\u00ad tures, the theory and practice of translation, and other liter\u00ad ary questions transcending national boundaries. For the graduate student in Comparative Literature a pro\u00ad fessional competence in foreign languages is essential. French and German are usually required for all doctoral candidates, since these languages along with English are the accepted tools of international literary scholarship. A classical language may prove indispensable for work in many traditional fields of literary study, and the scholar's own specialty may require the mastery of other languages. The underlying assumption of language requirements is that, after the tool languages have been mastered, the pro\u00ad fessional scholar's own interests should determine the specific kinds and degrees of language skill to be acquired. At the graduate level, the nucleus of the foreign language requirement is the course CL 220 (Problems in Translation) in which, after a suitable theoretical preparation, the stu\u00ad dent plans and carries out a high-quality translation of a literary text. This translation, along with an introduction or other scholarly apparatus explaining and defending the technical decisions involved in the task, is then submitted as a paper for course credit. MASTER OF ARTS IN COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Students entering the Master of Arts program should com\u00ad plete their course work in three quarters. This course work should include CL 220 (Problems in Translation) with a project in either French or German and appropriate graduate-level work in English, foreign languages, drama, comparative literature, and other areas as counselled by the advisor. Soon after beginning graduate work the student, with the advice and approval of the assigned advisor, will decide on a field of specialty which will be emphasized in progressing toward the M.A. degree. (Normally this choice will be a kind of general or preliminary step toward the selection of an area of specialty for the Ph.D.) English and Comparative Literature 111 Graduate study in Comparative Literature requires an ex\u00ad ceptional facility in foreign languages, and the student should not attempt a Master's degree without a thorough knowledge of one foreign language and literature and a considerable knowledge of a second language. Normally the greatest part of the student's work will involve the study of literary texts in the original languages. At the end of course work, normally about nine courses at the graduate level, the student will be examined on a read\u00ad ing list in world literature that the student's committee has approved. This list should be designed by the student in consultation with the committee and based on the general World Literature list for Comparative Literature. The stu\u00ad dent's own list should follow some organizing principle, such as an emphasis on the fields and languages of the student's specialization. Nevertheless, every list should in\u00ad clude works from all of the different groups represented on the general World Literature list. The M.A. examination is a three-hour written examination, which focuses on essay questions based on the student's approved reading list. Exceptional students may be exempted from taking the examination by petitioning the Graduate Committee, which will review the student's performance and qualifications in arriving at its decision. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN COMPARATIVE LITERATURE The doctoral program is designed to prepare the student for a professional career as a scholar and critic of literature. Details of the doctoral program in Comparative Literature may be obtained from the Director. Normally the degree requires two years of course work (usually a minimum of three courses per quarter). Of these courses, the only re\u00ad quired course is CL 220 (Problems in Translation), which is taken twice, with projects in acceptable languages. The rest of the student's work will be in seminars or other graduate\u00ad level courses in Comparative Literature, English, the vari\u00ad ous foreign language departments, or drama. In general an exceptional command of foreign languages is required, normally involving a professional competence in two or more foreign languages, either modern or classical. The doctoral student is encouraged to design and carry out a personal plan of study (the area of specialty) in a particu\u00ad lar field of interest. The requirements for the doctorate also include an area of competence in literary theory and practi\u00ad cal criticism; and a student may stress theory in preparation for the Qualifying Examination. , Upon completion of the course work, the student will be examined in the following areas of knowledge: (1) mastery of a limited topic in literary theory or history of criticism, along with general knowledge of major critical texts in the history of literature; (2) an area of specialty as described above; and (3) major works and authors appropriate to the study of comparative literature. Following this examination, and upon recommendation of a candidacy committee ap\u00ad pointed by the Graduate Council, the student is formally admitted to candidacy. The study toward the degree of Doctor of Philosophy will culminate in the writing of a suitable dissertation, normally on a comparative subject, although subjects lying within a single literature or dealing with general literary and aesthe\u00ad tic problems not confined to any specific literatures may also be acceptable. Studies of the relation between literature and the other arts are also particularly encouraged.

DEPARTMENT OF French and Italian Renee Riese Hubert, Ph.D. Columbia University, Chair of the Department and Professor of French and Comparative Literature David Carroll, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University, Associate Professor of French James Chiampi, Ph.D. Yale University, Assistant Professor of Italian Eugenio Donato, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University, Professor of French and Italian UC IRVINE - 1980-1981114 French and Italian Judd D. Hubert, Ph.D. Columbia University, Professor of French Alice M. Laborde, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Associate Professor ofF rench Leslie W. Rabine, Ph.D. Stanford University, Assistant Professor of French Janette Reardon, M. es L. Universite de Nantes, Lecturer in French Richard L. Regosin, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University, Professor of French Aliko Songolo, Ph.D. University of Iowa, Associate Professor of French Franco Tonelli, Ph.D. Louisiana State University, Associate Professor of French and Italian and Director of the Film Studies Program Bernard Tranel, Ph.D. University of California, San Diego, Associate Professor of French Linguistics The Department of French and Italian offers courses de\u00ad signed to provide linguistic competence and a broad knowledge of diverse aspects of French and Italian culture: literary, social, historical, aesthetic. It seeks to enrich the students' appreciation of their own civilizations and to create a deeper sense of international understanding. The program brings the students to participate in the crea\u00ad tive process of language, to think in French or Italian as they learn to understand, speak, read, and write. Most classes are taught entirely in the foreign language, and a multiple approach stresses the interdependence of the four basic skills and makes them mutually reinforcing. The Lan\u00ad guage Laboratory is used to complement classroom activity. Representatives chosen by the undergraduate French majors and by the graduate students serve on departmental committees. These representatives also participate in De\u00ad partment meetings and are responsible for student evalua\u00ad tion procedures. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM IN FRENCH While preparing the student for graduate work and for the teaching profession, the French major is essentially a liberal arts program offering a broad, humanistic course of study. At the intermediate lower-division level, texts of contem\u00ad porary literary and social interest provide the focus for ad\u00ad vanced conversation, reading, and composition. After the second year, courses in speaking (conversation and phonetics) and writing enable the students to attain a greater degree of proficiency, preparing them for further study in French liteni.ture and linguistics and in French civilization and culture. In the introductory courses in literature, complete texts are studied by genre: poetry in the fall; theatre in the winter; the novel in the spring. The student learns to analyze and interpret different types of creative literature and is intro\u00ad duced to various critical techniques. At the more advanced level, literature courses may emphasize a single author, a generation, or a genre within a historical period. The con\u00ad tent of these courses changes yearly according to the in\u00ad terests of both faculty and students. Senior seminars are offered periodically to discuss literary problems which can\u00ad not be dealt with in depth in the regular offerings. Courses in civilization and culture explore aspects of French history, intellectual thought, and the arts. Courses are of\u00ad fered with a historical emphasis (for instance, The World of the Renaissance in France; The Age of Louis XIV) and with a comparative orientation (for instance, Poetry and Paint\u00ad ing; Fantastic Art and Literature; Movie and Novel). Courses in linguistics introduce students to aspects of the structure of the French language and to the application of linguistic techniques to problems of literary analysis. Students are placed in elementary and intermediate courses according to their years of previous study and their grades; no placement examination is given. One year of high school is equated with one quarter of work at UCI. A student may not go back more than one quarter and receive credit. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 13. School Requirements: See page 104. DEPARTMENTAL REQUIREMENTS French major with Emphasis in Literature: French 11, 100A-B, 1ffiA-B-C, and eight other upper-division courses taught in French, at least six of which must be in literature. French major with Emphasis in Linguistics: French 11, lOOA-B, 1ffiA-B-C, two courses in French civilization, Lin\u00ad guistics 50, 110, 120, 130, French 113, French 131. Prospec\u00ad tive elementary and secondary school teachers who choose this option should take as electives more courses in French language, civilization, and/or literature. Work in French civilization is required by state credentialing authorities. French major with Emphasis in Culture and Civilization: French 11, lOOA-B, 1ffiA-B-C, and eight other upper\u00ad division courses taught in French, at least four of which must be in civilization and culture. Planning a Program of Study The student and the faculty advisor (assigned upon enter\u00ad ing the major) should plan a coherent program of courses to fulfill the literature, the linguistics, or the culture and civili\u00ad zation emphasis during the junior year. The Department encourages the student to study in France, either through the University's Education Abroad Program or independently. Information is available in the Depart\u00ad ment Office. Students should consult with the departmental coordinator of advisors concerning career plans in the areas of teaching, industry, journalism, law, civil service, etc. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM IN ITALIAN Third-and fourth-year offerings provide an introduction to Italian literature and culture. This material also serves as a basis for training in composition, conversation, and phonetics. Tutorial and seminar courses are available for advanced students. Students are encouraged to pursue their interests through a major in Humanities which combines Italian lit\u00ad erature, culture, history, art, and music. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981GRADUATEPROGRAMINFRENCH The Department stresses understanding rather than ency\u00ad clopedic knowledge, experimentation with various critical approaches rather than the perpetuation of a tradition, creativity rather than conformity. Each quarter internation\u00ad ally known scholars are in residence to participate in the graduate program. The graduate curriculum includes courses in each of the three following areas: 1. Theory of Literature: comparative methods; 2. Author, Genre, Period, Movement; 3. Critical Theory: problems in French literature and criticism. Master of Arts in French The Master of Arts degree is considered to be a step toward the Ph.D. degree; only students intending to pursue studies for the doctorate are admitted to the program. The Master's examination functions as a qualifying examination for the doctoral program. Most candidates take a minimum of 11 graduate courses, with at least six in literature, one in linguistics, and one in writing and style. Particularly well\u00ad prepared students may receive special permission to take a minimum of nine courses and to write a short thesis, for which two course credits are given. All entering graduate students are assigned a faculty advisor. Individual pro\u00ad grams are arranged in consultation with the faculty ad\u00ad visors. During the spring quarter of each year, the teaching performance and academic record of each student who is a Teaching Assistant are evaluated. All graduate students are also given a written evaluation of their work on a course\u00ad by-course basis. Proficiency in a foreign language other than the major language is required (proficiency is defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C). All M.A. candidates are required to pass a written and oral examination on material drawn from the class program and the Master of Arts reading list. The student writes essays demonstrating ability to discuss literary texts and establish\u00ad ing relationships between literary works of different periods, genres, or authors. The Master's examination is given in mid-fall quarter and at the end of winter quarter. Students who are Teaching As\u00ad sistants normally take the examination in the fifth quarter of their studies. Doctor of Philosophy in French Upon successful completion of the Master's examinations and admission to the Ph.D. program, or admission with a Master's degree from an accredited institution, a Guidance Committee is appointed to advise the candidate in the choice of courses and to help prepare for the comprehen\u00ad sive examinations, the oral Qualifying Examination, and the dissertation. The formal candidacy committee is com\u00ad posed of four members in fields closely related to the stu\u00ad dent's interest and projected area of specialization, and one who is not affiliated With the Department. One member of the committee will be expected to direct the dissertation. Language Requirements: A reading knowledge of two foreign languages relevant to the student's area of speciali\u00ad zation and subject to the approval of the Guidance Committee. French and Italian 115 Course Requirements: A minimum of 18 graduate courses or seminars in French beyond the B.A., including one graduate course in French linguistics, one graduate course in writing and style, and three graduate courses outside the Department in areas related to the field of specialization. Students entering with a B.A. degree are required to take at least three courses in each area as they progress to the Ph.D. degree; students entering with an M.A. degree must take at least two in each area. Students may receive the Ph.D. with an emphasis in liter\u00ad ary theory by taking three courses in theory outside the Department. Teaching: Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. can\u00ad didates plan to teach, the Department recognizes its re\u00ad sponsibility to train them as teachers. Therefore, as far as it is possible, all candidates without previous teaching ex\u00ad perience are required to participate in a program of super\u00ad vised teaching for at least one year. Comprehensive Examination -Written and Oral: The written part of the comprehensive consists of a series of open book examinations involving clearly defined problems of a critical or historical nature. The student may be given from one to three days to answer any part of the examina\u00ad tion. The oral part of the comprehensive assesses the stu\u00ad dent's knowledge of French literature and understanding of a given literary movement. The student will be examined on (a) five of the following six periods of French literature: Medieval; Sixteenth Century; Seventeenth Century; Eighteenth Century; Nineteenth Century; Twentieth Cen\u00ad tury; or four of these periods plus the development of a single literary genre through all periods of French litera\u00ad ture; (b) a given literary movement (e.g., Romanticism, Baroque, etc.) in a non-French literature. The written and oral parts of the examination are based both on material covered in the graduate seminars and on the Ph.D. reading list. Dissertation: The dissertation topic chosen by the candi\u00ad date will normally, but not necessarily, fall within one of the major fields covered by the Qualifying Examination. The dissertation must be defended in an oral examination and approved by the Doctoral Committee before the candi\u00ad date is recommended for the degree. Three faculty members, chosen by the candidate, proposed by the Department, and appointed by the Graduate Coun\u00ad cil, constitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the preparation and completion of the doctoral thesis. The Doc\u00ad toral Committee supervises a final examination, the focus of which is the content of the doctoral thesis. The Doctoral Committee certifies that a completed thesis is satisfactory through the signatures of the individual Committee mem\u00ad bers on the title page of the accepted thesis.

D. Yale University, Chair of the Department and Professor of German Ruth Ann Crowley, Ph.D. Stanford University, Assistant Professor of German Anton Kaes, Ph. D. Stanford University, Associate Professor of German and Comparative Literature Meredith Lee, Ph.D. Yale University, Assistant Professor of German Herbert Lehnert, Ph.D. University of Kiel, Professor of German German 117 William J. Lillyman, Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of German and Dean of the School of Humanities Bert Nagel, Ph.D. University of Heidelberg, Professor Emeritus of German Wilfried M. Voge, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Assistant Professor of German and Linguistics The Department of German sees its contribution in the con\u00ad text of the humanistic endeavor to understand and evaluate Western culture. We can understand ourselves and our immediate culture more clearly through the study of allied and Q.iverse languages and cultures. The study of German (which is closely related to English) and a comparative stuc}y of the historical and social development of German\u00ad speaking peoples provide the student with another aspect of our common culture. The Department offers courses on the German language and on German literature. The study of German literature is pursued from various critical \u00b7 perspectives. Some courses emphasize its historical, social, and political significance and setting; in others literature is approached as an imaginative experience which transcends its immediate context. The history of German literature and criticism, the theory of literature and literary criticism, and the relations of German literature to other literatures are also studied in the Department's courses. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The German major offers alternative emphases, one in lit\u00ad erature and another in linguistics. All courses in the Department are taught in German to the extent compatible with the aim of the course. In the basic courses the student will develop an understanding of the nature of the language, based on linguistic principles, while learning the necessary skills. Use will be made of the Lan\u00ad guage Laboratory. At the end of the first year, students will have attained mastery of the basic structure of the language. At the intermediate and advanced levels the student's abil\u00ad ity to read and write German will be gradually developed. A third-year course of two quarters will stress composition as opposed to translation. It will be followed by a course in phonetics which will aim to perfect the pronunciation as well as to introduce historical and dialectal variants. The introductory course in literature, also in the third year, will present a first view of some periods of German literary history, familiarize the student with German terminology used in the interpretation of literature, and use these con\u00ad cepts in practical interpretations. A certain number of courses in the series German 117, 118, 119, 120 will be des\u00ad ignated as \"core courses\" which are especially recom\u00ad mended for majors. It is assumed that the student is famil\u00ad iar with basic concepts of literature in English. Students are given the opportunity to participate in pro\u00ad grams of study abroad during the summer and the junior year in Gottingen. Students entering UCI with previous German training will be given advanced standing as follows: In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus students with one, two, three, and four years of high school German will normally enroll in German 18, 1C, 2A, and 28 respectively. Exceptions to this placement pro\u00ad cedure must have the approval of the director of first-or second-year German instruction. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981118 German Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 13. School Requirements: See page 104. DEPARTMENTAL REQUIREMENTS German Major with Literature Emphasis: German 100A\u00ad B-C; German 101; eight courses drawn from German 102- 199, the selection to be approved by the student's advisor; at least one course selected from the following: Linguistics 50; Comparative Literature 50A-B-C; courses in German his\u00ad tory and German philosophy (advisor's approval required). Students who plan to acquire a teaching credential, or in\u00ad tend to do graduate work in litera:ture, are encouraged to take the major with literature emphasis. German Major with Linguistic Emphasis: German 100A\u00ad B-C; German 101; five literature courses drawn from Ger\u00ad man 102-199, to be approved by the advisor; Linguistics 50, 110, 120; at least one of the following: Linguistics 130; Intro\u00ad duction to Middle High German or History of the German Language (these courses are offered under German 220). The German major with linguistic emphasis is recom\u00ad mended especially for students who intend to do graduate work in linguistics or enter a linguistics-related profession. GRADUATE PROGRAM In its graduate courses the Department stresses theoretical understanding of the nature of literature in its specific ap\u00ad plication to literature written in the German language. Courses also are offered elucidating the structure and his\u00ad tory of the German language. The German Graduate Program is essentially a program leading to the Ph.D. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of full-time graduate study. The De\u00ad partment will decide after completion of the M.A., at the latest, whether or not to permit the student to continue in the Ph.D. program. The M.A. may thus in some cases be a terminal degree. In those cases where the student enters the UCI graduate program in German with an M.A. from another institution, the Department will evaluate the stu\u00ad dent's progress during the first year of study before decid\u00ad ing to allow continuation toward the Ph.D. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less. Master of Arts in German Before entering the program, a candidate is expected to have the equivalent of our undergraduate major. Students with a bachelor's degree in another subject may be consid\u00ad ered for admission. Normally their course of studies will have to be extended in order to make up for the deficiency. However, each case is considered individually by the fac\u00ad ulty. The minimum course requirement for the M.A. de-gree is nine courses, eight of which must be taken within the Department of German. Reading knowledge of a foreign language other than German also is required for the M.A. degree. Further requirements are: The Preparation of a Reading List All candidates should prepare as early as possible a list of works read in the field of German literature, e.g., both primary texts and critical works. This list should preferably be augmented by critical texts and by works from other literatures which, in the candidate's opinion, relate to the German works in the list. Since it should ultimately contain representative selections from various eras of German liter\u00ad ature and some works of criticism, a tentative list must be discussed with the graduate advisor before the end of the fall quarter. Candidates should indicate on the list a number of works with which they are especially familiar. In its final form (e.g.,including works read during the year both in and out of class) the list will be submitted together with the essay two weeks before the oral examination. It is the student's responsibility to keep the reading list current. The Master's Essay The purpose of the written part of the M.A. comprehensive examination is to show the candidate's methodological progress in interpreting German literature. It consists of an essay in which a text is elucidated and related to: a) perti\u00ad nent works by the same author, b) its social and historical context, and c) other works of German or other literatures with which the candidate is familiar. The level of the dis\u00ad cussion will normally be enhanced by the candidate's knowledge of the relevant secondary literature. The topic of the essay should be tentatively formulated and reported to the graduate advisor before the end of the second quarter of the student's residence. The Oral Examination During the oral examination the following items will be discussed: a) the essay; b) the reading list. The discussion based on the reading list will focus on works which the student knows well, but may broaden into other areas. One Course in University Teaching (399) One Year of Residence Ph.D. in German The Department requires a minimum of 24 approved courses from students entering with a bachelor's degree. Students entering with the master's degree will be advised individually as to remaining course requirements. These may include courses in philosophy, history, comparative literature, etc., suitable for the individual student's program of study. The Introduction to Middle High German and one course in medieval German literature are required. The student also will enroll in each of the German Department's colloquia. The student will augment the reading list and keep it current during the whole course of study. At least two years of residence are required. Since the majority of Ph.D. candidates choose careers as teachers, the German Department recognizes its obligation to offer them preparatory experience. Therefore, all candi- UC IRVINE - 1980-1981dates for the Ph. D. are required to teach under the supervi\u00ad sion of a faculty member at least one course in each of three quarters (for which they will receive credit as German 399). Three of these courses may be counted towards the 24 re\u00ad quired courses for the Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination There are two parts to the examination. In order to fulfill the written examination requirement the student will choose either 1) to present a lecture to the faculty and to the other graduate students, or 2) to write a three-part examina\u00ad tion (one part on a significant author, one on a major genre, and one on a historical period) within a period of two weeks. These examination essays may be either closed\u00ad book or take-home, by agreement with the candidate's examination committee. The examination essays or the lec\u00ad ture will be on a text or texts selected by the faculty from a reading list submitted by the student for the comprehensive examination. The second part of the comprehensive exami\u00ad nation is the formal oral qualifying examination of up to three hours duration ranging over the whole field of the student's studies, to be taken within two weeks after com\u00ad pletion of the written examination. The student will submit the reading list at least two weeks before the written exami\u00ad nation after consultation with the members of the examina\u00ad tion committee. Language Requirements The candidate will demonstrate reading competence in two languages or extensive competence in one language other than German or English. Choice of this language depends on the student's area of specialization. For the various ways in which these requirements may be fulfilled, the student should see the graduate advisor. Dissertation Toward the end of the second year of study, the student should formulate a tentative dissertation topic. Three fac\u00ad ulty members proposed by the Department and appointed by the Graduate Council constitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the preparation and completion of the disser\u00ad tation. The Doctoral Committee certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory through the signature of the Committee members on the title page of the dissertation.

Wiener, Ph.D. Harvard University, Associate Professor of History UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The undergraduate program in History is designed to de\u00ad velop critical intelligence and to foster an awareness of our\u00ad selves and our world through the study of the past. The Department offers a variety of approaches to history, each emphasizing basic disciplinary skills: weighing evidence, analyzing historical problems, exploring the role of theory, and improving expository writing. In addition to offering a number of lower-division history courses open to nonmajors, the Department requires all History majors to participate in an introductory core course, History 29A-B-C. This is a comparative course that acquaints students with the modern world by examining some of the basic characteristics of modernity and by focus\u00ad ing on the historic process of modernization in several diffe\u00ad rent societies. From this introductory course the student moves on to a series of upper-division courses, the contents of which range from the examination of individual nation-states (e.g., British History), to studies of the relations among nation-states (e.g., European International History), to analyses of political, socio-economic, and cultural factors as they have developed through time (e.g., Mass Movements and Social Control). Students are also provided the oppor\u00ad tunity for small-group learning experiences in a series of colloquia in the following areas: political history, social thought, social history, comparative history, and interna\u00ad tional history. These courses provide designs for bringing a definite focus to the undergraduate major. Finally, collo\u00ad quia and seminars for seniors concentrate on a particular aspect of more general phenomena (e.g., France: May, 1968). The training and discipline derived from historical studies provide a valuable experience for all educated persons seek\u00ad ing to understand themselves and their world. They also provide a useful preparation for professional careers in teaching, law, librarianship, journalism, and business administration. The Department of History seeks to work closely with its students; elected student representatives -both graduate and undergraduate -sit regularly with the faculty at its Department meetings and serve on major Department committees. Students also play an important role in the evaluation of teaching by the faculty and teaching assis\u00ad tants. Each upper-division student is assigned a faculty ad\u00ad visor in the Department. Students are encouraged to see their advisors at least twice each quarter. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 13. School Requirements: See page 104. DEPARTMENTAL REQUIREMENTS Fourteen courses are required, includi,ng History 29A-B-C (for which transfer students may substitute such year-long surveys as European, American, Asian, or Latin American history), six upper-division Historical Studies, three collo\u00ad quia, and a senior seminar (two-course sequence) or two additional colloquia. GRADUATE PROGRAM The graduate program in History is designed to provide students with both basic historical skills and a rigorous UC IRVINE - 1980-1981grounding in social and other comparative theory. This combination of theoretical study with training in historical method reflects the Department's conviction that students should be encouraged to deal with broad questions about the past and to approach these questions in a methodologi\u00ad cally sophisticated way. This approach requires that the scholar develop the critical abilities necessary to deal with primary sources, secondary syntheses, and the interrela\u00ad tionship of history and theory. Candidates for any ad\u00ad vanced degree in History are expected to gain teaching ex\u00ad perience as an integral part of their graduate training. Or\u00ad dinarily this is accomplished through service as a Teaching Assistant or Associate. Basic to the Department's curriculum is a year-long course in History and Theory which deals with both theoretical texts and historical studies that have tested the theorists' concepts and models. The History and Theory course also examines the phenomenon of modernization, the general world transformation of the past four hundred years, and seeks to understand the social institutions through which this process occurred and continues. The course directs at\u00ad tention to the diverse implications of modernity in the modern world, to the groups which dominated and were determined by it, and to the costs and benefits the process has produced. These matters can be studied most satisfac\u00ad torily by the historian whose theoretical self-consciousness and methodological facility have been systematically and carefully developed. The History and Theory course is di\u00ad rected to achieve such development. Another kind of course, the year-long focus seminar, familiarizes the student with one of several approaches to history, the modes in which it has been written, and the methodologies available. At the same time it makes it pos\u00ad sible for the student to begin to carry out a project of origi\u00ad nal research. Currently, the Department offers seminars in social, intellectual, political, and international history. The colloquium, the third type of course, is a reading course that examines the chief historical works in a time\u00ad place field. This course enriches the student's knowledge of the main areas of historical research and develops critical reading skills. Colloquia are offered yearly in U.S. history and Modern European history, and biannually in Early Modern European history, Latin American history, and Ancient history. A student may prepare a dissertation in any of these fields. Finally, independent reading and research courses are pro\u00ad vided for advanced, specialized study in a tutorial form. The immediate objective for the doctoral student is to de\u00ad velop four fields of competence in preparation for com\u00ad prehensive examination. These fields are: History and Theory; First Time-Place Field (field in which the disserta\u00ad tion is written); Second Time-Place Field; Focus Field. The subsequent objective, to write a distinctive dissertation, is of crucial importance. To assist in accomplishing both objectives, the Department, with its modest size, can offer intensive consultation with the faculty, as well as a lively intellectual atmosphere. Indeed, students have long shared in the decision-making process of the Department, an activ\u00ad ity which engages the entire historical community at Irvine in a collective pursuit of excellence. They profit also from a vigorous visiting speakers program which brings scholars from other campuses and other nations to meet and interact with students and faculty. History 121 Master of Arts in History Requirements for Admission Though it is desirable that an applicant have the equivalent of an undergraduate major in History, the Department also welcomes students who have previously specialized in other subject areas and who show promise of sustained and self-disciplined work in history. Typically, a minimum un\u00ad dergraduate grade point average of 3.0 (B) is required for admission, with evidence of better work in history. In addi\u00ad tion, all applicants are asked to submit three letters of rec\u00ad ommendation, aptitude scores from the Graduate Record Examination, and examples of written work in history from their undergraduate classes. Students living in Southern Califor~a must arrange to come to UCI for an interview with the Department Chair or the Coordinator of Graduate Advising. Students are admitted for fall quarter only, and the deadline for application for fall admission is May 1. Program of Study The M.A. program is similar to the doctoral program in .emphasizing the theoretical, comparative, and social di\u00ad mensions of the field in general, and of European, Ameri\u00ad can, or Latin American history in particular. Each candidate for the M.A. will be assigned to a graduate advisor who will supervise the student's program. Nine courses are required for the degree: three in History and Theory (History 200 A-B-C), three in \"time-place\" colloquia (taken in sequence, as a unit), a one-quarter research seminar, and two other courses from \"time-place\" colloquia or from upper-division history offerings. Students intending to pursue the Ph.D. should begin at once to delineate doctoral interests in order to fit their work for the M.A. into the total program. Language Requirements Normally a reading knowledge of one useful foreign lan\u00ad guage is required for the M.A. degree. However, students in American history, with an advisor's permission, may substitute a sequence of courses in communications sci\u00ad ence, statistics, or comparable studies for the M.A. foreign language requirement. Language proficiency can be de\u00ad monstrated either by achieving a score of at least 500 on the appropriate ETS examination or by passing a department test at Irvine. Comprehensive Examination At the end of the final quarter the M.A. candidate must pass a comprehensive examination covering the student's major field (e.g., American, Early Modern Europe) and focusing upon material assigned in the three-quarter \"time-place\" colloquium series. Time Limits The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of graduate study. Doctor of Philosophy in History Requirements for Admission Continuing students must have satisfactorily passed a de- UC IRVINE - 1980-1981122 History partmental evaluation in order to be admitted to the doc\u00ad toral program. New students must undergo a more formal admissions pro\u00ad cedure, submitting transcripts, letters (three), papers, and aptitude scores from the Graduate Record Examination. These documents must be supplemented by an interview whenever possible. It would be advisable for the potential doctoral student to begin graduate work on this campus, since the doctoral student who has taken the M.A. elsewhere will be expected to enroll in most of the same courses required of incoming M.A. students (greater experience will work to advantage later, in the second and third years, in speeding the student to examinations). Incoming students are admitted for fall quarter only, and the deadline for application for fall admission is May 1. Program of Study The Department requires doctoral students to prepare themselves in four different areas: History and Theory. The first \"time-place\" field (such as Modern Europe), which is designed as a teaching field as well as the locus of the student's dissertation. The second \"time-place\" field (such as American History), which is designed as a second teaching field. A \"focus\" field (such as social history, etc.), which is de\u00ad signed to enhance the student's capability for dealing with the problems and phenomena of the field, to make com\u00ad parisons and to introduce the student to the theory and method of relevant related disciplines (e.g., sociology). The courses required in this preparation include the History and Theory sequence, colloquia series in both time-place fields, and the three-quarter focus seminar. Beyond these, the remainder of the student's program during the first six quarters of residence will consist of those colloquia, semi\u00ad nars, and courses in Special Studies which the student finds useful and with which the student attains the normal academic load of three courses per quarter. Every doctoral student will be assisted by a departmental advisor in the same general area of study who will be re\u00ad sponsible for approving defined fields, guiding the student to consultant faculty, and arranging and giving the exami\u00ad nations. Language Requirements All students, except as specified below, must demonstrate a reading knowledge of one useful foreign language no later than the end of the second year in the program. Normally the M.A. foreign language will fulfill this requir,ement, but proficiency can also be established by a score of at least 500 on the appropriate ETS examination or by passing a de\u00ad partment test. Students in American history who have opted for a language substitute in completing the UCI Mas\u00ad ter's degree will be allowed to submit this work in fulfill\u00ad ment of \"further 'special skill' requirements\" (see below) and will not be subject to the time limit in achieving a foreign language competence. Additional language requirements depend on the subject the student selects for the first \"time-place\" field and must be met before the student takes the candidacy qualifying examinations. An individual with a first \"time-place\" field in American history may either demonstrate a reading knowledge of a second useful foreign language (by achiev\u00ad ing an ETS score of 500 or by passing a language test de\u00ad signed by the advisor), or complete, as a doctoral student, a sequence of courses in a special skill (e.g., communications science, statistics, computer work, content analysis, lin\u00ad guistics) that will be useful in mastering the chosen histori\u00ad cal fields. An individual with a first \"time-place\" field in a non\u00ad American subject must demonstrate a reading knowledge of a second useful foreign language. This may be done either by achieving an ETS score of 500 or by passing a language test arranged by the advisor. Qualifying Examinations and Dissertation After completing the appropriate courses and other pre\u00ad paratory work (normally eight to nine quarters after begin\u00ad ning the M.A. at Irvine, or seven to eight quarters after having entered the Ph.D. program from the outside), the student will take written examinations in the History and Theory and two \"time-place\" fields, and, following this, will take an oral Qualifying Examination in the \"focus\" field, first \"time-place\" field, and dissertation topic. After having passed these examinations, the student will be ad\u00ad vanced to candidacy and will begin intensive work upon the dissertation. The research and writing involved in this effort can be expected to require from one to two years. At the end of this period an oral defense of the dissertation will be held, focusing on the adequacy of the student's research and thesis. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less.

SPECIAL PROGRAMS IN THE Humanities UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR IN HUMANITIES The major in Humanities is one of the many options availa\u00ad ble to a student who wants to select a major in the School of Humanities. As such, the major in Humanities is on a par with the major in Spanish, the major in Classics, the major in Linguistics, and other majors in the School. The major in Humanities accommodates students who want to organize their undergraduate education around a humanistic perspective on a topic, a field, or a problem which is inter\u00ad disciplinary in scope (e.g., Literature and Politics in Twentieth-Century America; Social and Religious Thought in the Age of the Reformation). The student enters the program at the end of the sophomore year and, in consulta\u00ad tion with the Humanities Major Committee, devises an in\u00ad dividually tailored set of \"major requirements,\" not all of which need be offered in the School of Humanities. The Committee will assign an advisor on the basis of the stu\u00ad dent's own preference. At the end of the senior year the student will prepare, under the advisor's supervision, a long paper in the area of the special major. This require\u00ad ment is satisfied by taking Humanities 199. A student majoring in the Humanities must also meet the regular School, UCI, and University requirements for graduation. (Seep. 13 and p. 104.) Inquiries by third-quarter sopho\u00ad mores should be addressed to the academic counselors in the School's Office of Undergraduate Study. Film Studies A student may major in Humanities with a concentration in Film Studies. The major centers on an interdisciplinary Humanities Special Programs 125 study of the history and criticism of film. Cinema is studied as a carrier of fictional content and read as a \"text\" which, like a literary work, uses certain devices for aesthetic ef\u00ad fects. It is also read as a social document, stressing the relationship between social movement and art movement. A core of courses is designed to expose the students to a coherent and progressive pattern of study. While it mainly emphasizes history and theory cif film, through courses such as Humanities 50, Humanities 197, and Humanities 198, it tries to expose the student to practical and/or techni\u00ad cal aspects of the study of cinema as well. Humanities 199 (directed research required of all senior majors in Humanities) will allow the student to make a synthesis of prior work as well as to focus on a particular interest including script writing and movie production. Upon completion of the program, students will be awarded the B.A. degree in Humanities with Film Studies as the area of concentration. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See page 13. School Requirements: See page 1'<)4. Program Requirements: Humanities 50, 101A-B-C, 110, 112 (two courses), 115, and 199, and four upper-division courses from the following: French 160, Italian 160, German 160, Russian 160, Spanish 160. These courses are cross\u00ad listed with Humanities 160. Humanities 197 or 198 can be substituted for one or two of the 160 courses. Honors Concentration in Social Thought The School of Humanities and the School of Social Sciences offer an honors concentration in Soeial Thought. The con\u00ad centration offers undergraduates the opportunity to examine major social theories and their implications in a systematic and thorough way. In exploring the intellectual foundations and contemporary development of modern so\u00ad cial thought, students will develop their skills in critical analysis of society and theory. The concentration identifies whole societies as its objects of knowledge. It has as its central focus alternative concep\u00ad tions of society's structure, historical development, and fu\u00ad ture prospects as perceived and analyzed by political and social philosophers, historians, social scientists, and liter\u00ad ary writers. The concentration is taken in addition to a major in the School of Humanities or the School of Social Sciences. Thus, a student would major in, e.g., History and Social Thought or Political Science and Social Thought. Students interested in this program should apply to a member of the faculty steering committee. A student is admitted to the program on the recommendation of the steering committee. Students are selected on the basis of aptitude for theory. A grade point average of at least 3.2 is required for admission, and in order to complete the honors program a grade point average of at least 3.5 must be attained in courses in the Social Thought concentration. Two core courses, two courses in surveys of theory, and two courses in intensive studies of theorists will be re- UC IRVINE - 1980-1981126 Humanities Special Programs quired. Additional problem-centered courses will be rec\u00ad ommended. Lists of courses in these categories and of the current membership of the steering committee may be ob\u00ad tained from the Social Sciences Advising Office or the Office of Undergraduate Study in the School of Human\u00ad ities. A senior honors thesis is required. Concentration in Women's Studies The Women's Studies concentration is not a major but is intended to allow a student to complement any major in the School of Humanities, the School of Social Sciences, or the Program in Social Ecology by studying systematically women in culture and society. The student will follow an interdisciplinary course of study designed in consultation with a faculty advisor from the Women's Studies Commit\u00ad tee. In addition to the two-quarter upper-division core courses (Humanities 155A-B), the concentration also in\u00ad cludes two courses each in the social sciences or social ecol\u00ad ogy, and the humanities. This will ensure that students acquire at least two different methodologies. UNDERGRADUATE COURSES The following set of courses has no necessary relation to the undergraduate major in Humanities. The courses are, of course, open to any UCI student. Humanities lA-B-Cis required for the major in Humanities, as it is a requirement of any student majoring in the School of Humanities. Also, Humanities 199 is required of any undergraduate in the School who majors in Humanities.

The student chooses a director of the project and a coreader. PH.D. WITH INTERDISCIPLINARY EMPHASIS IN HUMANITIES The School of Humanities offers no degree called the Ph. D. in Humanities. Some Ph.D. students in regular programs in the School may elect an interdisciplinary modification of their degree with the permission of the departments or programs concerned. Such students will do about 60 per\u00ad cent of their graduate work in a major field and about 40 percent in one or more minor fields. At least one of the student's courses will be in the Humanities series 200-230. Those interested in an interdisciplinary degree should con\u00ad tact the Associate Dean for Graduate Study or the Graduate Advisor in their major department. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981GRADUATE COURSES Graduate courses in Humanities are under the direction of the School's Associate Dean for Graduate Study. These courses are designed for all graduate students in the School of Humanities, with the exception that students in philosophy may not count Humanities 230 as part of their degree program.

Terrell, Ph.D. University of Texas, Director of the Program and Associate Professor of Spanish and Linguistics Howard A. Appel, M.S. University of Washington, Lecturer in Teacher Education- Foreign Languages and Lecturer in French (on leave) Richard Barru tia, Ph.D. University of Texas, Professor of Spanish and Linguistics Peter Colaclides, Ph. D. University of Athens, Professor of Classics Mary Ritchie Key, Ph. D. University of Texas, Professor of Linguistics Owen Thomas, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Profes- sor of Linguistics, English, and Education Bernard Tranel, Ph.D. University of California, San Diego, Associate Professor of French and Linguistics Wilfried M. Voge, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Assis- tant Professor of German and Linguistics Linguistics is concerned with descriptions of human lan\u00ad guages, with theories that seek to explain the nature of language, and with the various uses of language. Addition\u00ad ally, linguistics has potential relationships with other dis\u00ad ciplines concerned with language. Because of the various possibilities in emphasis, the programs are highly flexible. Linguistics 127 Students are encouraged to enroll in linguistic courses with varying perspectives and counsel with faculty across schools and departments. Students obtaining a B.A. in Lin\u00ad guistics are expected to have some awareness of linguistic work beyond their own specialization. Students are required to take a general introductory course and then work in five Core areas: Phonetics and Phonol\u00ad ogy, Syntax and Semantics, Historical Linguistics, Psycholinguistics, and Sociolinguistics and Special Topics. A Linguistics major is allowed to do work in these areas from courses offered by the Program in Linguistics, the School of Social Sciences, and the various language de\u00ad partments. Other courses may be taken with prior approval of the student's advisor. It is also possible to major in Classics, French, German, Russian, and Spanish with an emphasis in Linguistics. In\u00ad terested students should consult with academic advising personnel. With the exception of Linguistics 50, students may not satisfy major requirements with courses which count for another major. For example, a student with a double major in Linguistics and Spanish will take Spanish 11 as a part of the Spanish major and must take two additional courses in Core Group A. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 13. School Requirements: See page 104. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS 1. Linguistics 50; 2. Two courses in each of the following Core Groups: A-Phonetics and and Special Topics (150-159) Note that Linguistics 110 and 120 are prerequisites for many of the courses offered in their respective groups and should be taken as soon as possible. 3. A single year of a foreign language other than the one used to satisfy the Humanities language requirement. Stu\u00ad dents are strongly urged to study a non-Indo-European language (such as Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Swahili) whenever available.

Smith, Ph.D. Stanford University, Associate Professor of Philosophy Gary Watson, Ph.D. Princeton University, Assistant Professor of Philosophy Peter Woodruff, Ph.D. University of Pittsburgh, Associate Professor of Philosophy Philosophy addresses itself to questions that arise insis\u00ad tently in every area of human experience and in every dis\u00ad cipline within the university. Each discipline inevitably poses problems concerning the nature of the standards ap\u00ad propriate to it and the place of its subject matter within the total framework of human knowledge. If we are to under\u00ad stand science or art or literature, or such human practices as morality and religion, we are bound to address ourselves to philosophical issues relating to their nature, the uses of reason appropriate to them, and the contributions they make to our understanding and appreciation of ourselves and the world in which we live. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Instruction in philosophy relies essentially upon discussion in which students are active participants. Wherever possi\u00ad ble, therefore, classes are severely limited in size in order to permit sustained dialogues between student and instructor. Some of the courses offered are of general interest to all students. Others are designed to explore issues that arise in selected and special disciplines. Among these are courses in the philosophy of science and of art. The staff should be consulted for advice about courses best suited to the spe\u00ad cialized needs of particular students. The program of course offerings is also designed for those majors in philosophy whose intention may be either to enter some professional school upon graduation (e.g., law) or to engage in graduate work in philosophy. Philosophy 129 Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 13. School Requirements: See page 104.

It is hoped that there will be a close intellectual relationship between graduate students and professors in order to provide the students with op\u00ad timum conditions for philosophical development and to expedite their progress toward advanced degrees. In addi\u00ad tion, the Department sponsors a series of colloquia each year. Participation in these colloquia is an important part of the graduate student's training. Every new graduate student is assigned a committee of fac\u00ad ulty members whose purpose is to oversee the student's progress through the major requirements for the advanced degree. The student consults with the committee each quar\u00ad ter about progress and any administrative or academic dif\u00ad ficulties. Each student's overall record is evaluated by the Department each year, customarily during the first two weeks of March. When the student has satisfied residency, language, logic, and portfolio requirements, the Candidacy Committee supervises the qualifying examination and the development of a dissertation project, and the subsequent writing of the dissertation itself. The Chair of this commit\u00ad tee is the principal person with whom the graduate student will consult on the dissertation. Master of Arts in Philosophy There is no list of courses required for the M.A. degree. The M.A. program in Philosophy minimally takes one year. The student may elect to follow either of the following routes to the degree: write a thesis on a subject to be chosen in con\u00ad sultation with an advisor and defend the thesis in an oral examination, or satisfy the Logic and Portfolio requirements for the Ph.D. (see below). Please refer to the Graduate Divi\u00ad sion section for information on the minimum number of courses required for the M.A. degree. Advancement to candidacy for the M.A. degree is not au\u00ad tomatic, but requires formal application to the Dean of the Graduate Division via the Philosophy Department Office. Application must be made with the recommendation of the Philosophy Department and must take place before the be\u00ad ginning of the quarter in which the student expects to re- ceive the degree. \u00b7 Doctor of Philosophy in Philosophy There is no set number of courses required for the Ph.D., thus allowing course work to be tailored to the individual UC IRVINE - 1980-1981130 Philosophy student's needs and interests. However, as a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree, every student is required to have some experience in teaching. The Ph.D. program is designed to take four years for the normally qualified student. In exceptional cases it may be possible to obtain the degree within three years. A Master's degree is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. The requirements for the Ph.D. degree are as follows: Tools of research, to be satisfied by demonstrating profi\u00ad ciency in a single appropriate foreign language* or by pass\u00ad ing with a grade of B or better five to six courses at the graduate level in a discipline or disciplines outside of the Philosophy Department. Approval for the latter alternative will be granted by the Department only if, in its judgment, the courses form an integrated unit in light of the student's research interest. Logic, to be satisfied by 1) passing Philosophy 151 with a grade of B or better, or passing an examination prepared by the Department on equivalent material, and 2) passing with a grade of B or better one course in a mathematically rigor\u00ad ous subject that requires the student to carry out detailed mathematical proofs of significant theorems. Examples of such subjects are: Proof Theory, Model Theory, Probability Theory, Game Theory, Mathematical Linguistics, Topol\u00ad ogy, Classical Mechanics, Relativity Theory, etc. Philos\u00ad ophy 153 will satisfy this portion of the requirement. Other courses will satisfy it only with the approval of the Depart\u00ad ment. Portfolio of papers representing the student's best work in philosophy. The papers may be, or may be based upon, essays written for course work. The topics of the papers will cover four fields in philosophy as well as at least three of the following historical periods: Ancient, Medieval, Early Modern, Kant and Nineteenth Century, and Twentieth Century. Examples of fields in philosophy are metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, philosophy of religion, philosophy of science, aesthetics, and so on. Papers will be evaluated by the faculty for the purpose of determining whether or not the student is ready to seek admission to candidacy. Advancement to candidacy and the writing of a thesis. Upon successful completion of the above requirements, the student will apply for advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree by filling out the appropriate forms andre\u00ad turning them to the Philosophy Department Office. A Can\u00ad didacy Committee including one or two members from an academic area outside of Philosophy is then appointed by the Graduate Council. This Committee administers an oral Qualifying Examination to determine whether the student is qualified to begin work designed to lead to the comple\u00ad tion of a thesis. Upon passing this oral examination, the student becomes a candidate for the Ph.D. degree. The Doctoral Committee appointed by the Graduate Council supervises the stu\u00ad dent's further course work and research, as well as the actual writing of the doctoral thesis. *The foreign language examinations are administered by the De\u00ad partment of Philosophy. They are two hours in length and consist of translating, with the aid of a dictionary, passages from two authors. Students wishing information as to courses to prepare them for these examinations and dates when these examinations will be given should consult the Philosophy Department Office, 500 Humanities Office Building, (714) 833-6526. The defense of the thesis. At a suitable point during the development of the thesis, the Doctoral Committee ad\u00ad ministers an oral examination, the focus of which is the content of the thesis itself. If at all possible, this examina\u00ad tion will be given while the student is still in residence.

PROGRAM IN Russian Helen Wei!, M.A. California State University, San Diego, Director of the Program and Lecturer in Russian Guy de Mallac, Ph. D. Cornell University, Professor of Russian Michael A. Green, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Assistant Professor of Russian Russian is a language spoken by 240 million people in the Soviet Union and ranks with English and Chinese as one of the three major world languages. Russian is a language of the Indo-European family and is thus related to English, French, and German. Russian is an infinitely rich language, as is English, and adapts itself we1l to a variety of styles and genres from lyric love poetry to the seemingharshness and brashness of the futurist poets. For the first two years the Program in Russian emphasizes a combination of speaking, writing, and reading skills. At the end of the senior year, the student can expect to have at\u00ad tained a rather high level of proficiency in all language skills -reading, writing, speaking, and understanding. By then students will have read a number of selected literary texts -including a fair portion of the significant masterworks\u00ad in the original. They will also have familiarized themselves with some of the historical background of the language and with its relation to other Slavic and European languages. And they will have achieved a reasonable degree of famil\u00ad iarity with the major cultural and social trends in Russian history. In addition to the regular Russian major with emphasis on language and literature, the Program in Russian offers a modified major with emphasis on linguistics. This major was designed for those students who have no plans to pur\u00ad sue advanced study in Russian literature, while they wish to focus on the study of the structure of Russian viewed within the framework of Slavic and general linguistics: The Program in Russian a'lso offers a major with an em\u00ad phasis in Russian civilization, which is geared to the in\u00ad terests of students who do not intend to specialize in Rus\u00ad sian language and literature. This emphasis is based upon a multidisciplinary approach (through language, the arts, lit\u00ad erature, history, study of institutions) to the rich variety of a culture that both before the Revolution and during the Soviet period has made an important contribution to man\u00ad kind's heritage and endeavors. Various specializations and challenging new career possibilities in today's world are available to students electing this option. Students planning to major in Russian should obtain a copy of the brochure \"Russian Language, Literature, and Civili\u00ad zation at UCI\" from the Office of the Program in Russian. Students entering UCI with previous training in Russian will be given advanced standing as follows: In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, and four years of high school Russian will enroll in Russian 18, 1C, 2A, and 28 respectively. Exceptions to this ruling can be made but must have the approval of the Program Director. Stu\u00ad dents with high school training in Russian should consult with the Russian staff before enrolling in Russian courses. UCI SUMMER RUSSIAN INSTITUTE AND PRACTICUM In planning their programs of study, students should note that certain courses bearing the designation Summer are also offered within the three-week UCI Russian Institute and Practicum (Russian 1A-B-C, 199, 220, 290, and The UCI Russian Language Institute is a three-week, total-immersion program in Rus\u00ad sian language and culture for students of all levels, con\u00ad ducted entirely in Russian and encompassing all of the stu\u00ad dent's daily activities. The Practicum adjunct of the Insti\u00ad tute affords prospective and practicing language teachers an opportunity for intensive language review and participa\u00ad tion in established and experimental teaching methods. For information and registration forms contact the Director of the UCI Russian Institute and Practicum, Program in Rus\u00ad sian, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717.

Students planning to major in Russian with an emphasis on literature or on linguistics are strongly urged to consult with the departmental faculty as early as possible, in order to familiarize themselves with the nature of the various programs. After indicating an intention to major in Russian, the stu\u00ad dent is assigned to an academic advisor who will help in the task of selecting courses toward the completion of one of the three options open to students majoring in Russian studies at UCI. Special attention is paid to the unique as\u00ad pects of the Russian field. In particular, students' attention is alerted to the combined academic and career implications and potentialities of these major options. Career Opportunities The major in Russian may lead to the following careers: in education (in high school teaching, or, after appropriate graduate study, on the college and university levels); with the Federal Government (where there are a number of openings in such agencies as the Department of State, De\u00ad partment of Defense, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the U.S. Information Office, and the Library of Congress for translators and other positions requiring the knowledge of Russian); a career as interpreter or trans\u00ad lator with private institutions; various careers in science and technology; library science; communications media (thus, the United States Information Agency's Voice of America offers many opportunities for Russian speakers: research, scriptwriting, editing, translating, and announcing); careers in private business corporations. However, it is not the essential purpose of a major program in Russian language, literature, and civilization to provide specific vocational skills. The study of Russian language, literature, and civilization is primarily viewed as a valuable component of a liberal education; a knowledge of Russian literature, history, philosophy, and science provides an ex\u00ad tremely important instrument for the investigation and ap\u00ad preciation of the modern world.

DEPARTMENT OF Spanish and Portuguese Seymour Menton, Ph. D. New York University, Chair of the Department and Professor of Spanish and Portuguese Richard Barru tia, Ph.D. University of Texas, Professor of Spanish and Linguistics Spanish and Portuguese 135 Anne Cruz, M.A. Stanford University, Acting Assistant Professor of Spanish Lucia Guerra-Cunningham, Ph.D. University of Kansas, Assistant Professor of Spanish Alejandro Morales, Ph.D. Rutgers University, Assistant Professor of Spanish Dayle Seidenspinner de Nunez, Ph.D. Stanford University, Assistant Professor of Spanish Hector Orjuela, Ph.D. University of Kansas, Professor of Spanish Julian Palley, Ph.D. University of New Mexico, Professor of Spanish Maria H.

University of California, Los Angeles, Assistant Professor of Spanish Tracy Terrell, Ph.D. University of Texas, Associate Professor of Spanish Juan Villegas, Ph.D. Universidad de Chile, Professor of Spanish Zidia Webb, M.A. Michigan State University, Lecturer in Spanish and Portuguese The main objectives of the program in Spanish and Por\u00ad tuguese are to develop competence in the ability to under\u00ad stand, speak, read, and write Spanish and Portuguese, and to provide through the knowledge of these two languages an understanding and appreciation of their literature and culture. Students are placed in Spanish courses according to their years of previous study and their grades. In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. All courses in Spanish and Portuguese, unless specifically stated, are taught in the foreign language. By the end of the first year, students attain mastery of the basic structure of the language and ability to converse on everyday topics as well as to read and write on an elementary plane. Self\u00ad instructional courses in both Spanish and Portuguese are also available. In the second year, emphasis is put on gradually raising the level of the student's ability to read and write. A third-year course of two quarters stresses composition as opposed to translation. Further, a course in phonetics perfects pronun\u00ad ciation, introduces theoretical considerations, and presents historical and dialect variants of Spanish. The introductory courses in literature, also in the third year, emphasize the analysis and appreciation of complete literary works by genre rather than the study of many short selections of innumerable authors in an anthology. The courses in His\u00ad panic civilization combine a panoramic overview with a close look at a specific country or topic. Although no major in Portuguese is offered, advanced lit\u00ad erature courses are available. Students are encouraged to participate in programs of study abroad during the summer and the junior year. Elected representatives of the undergraduate majors, the graduate students, and the Teaching Assistants participate with full voting rights in Department meetings.

Bilingualism and English as a Second Language: Spanish 100A (Multiple Subject), or 100B (Single Subject), Spanish lOOC (ESL methods); one course in Chicano literature, one course in Chicano culture, Spanish 113, and two upper\u00ad division courses in literature at least one of which must be Latin American literature. (Education 140A-B-C is the same as Spanish 100A-B-C.) For students who plan to teach Spanish, the following courses are strongly recommended: Linguistics 50, Linguis\u00ad tics 140 (Second Language Acquisition), Spanish 113 (Spanish Linguistics). Also, Spanish 200 and Spanish 204 should be taken as seniors or as members of the credential program. Master of Arts in Spanish The candidate is expected to have the equivalent of our undergraduate major. The student takes a minimum of 11 courses, eight of which must be at the graduate level. Two of the 11 courses must be in linguistics. Spanish 239, Methods of Literary Criticism, is required of all literature majors. A maximum of two courses may be transferred from another university, but a maximum of five from another University of California campus. Proficiency (defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C) in a foreign language other than the major lan\u00ad guage is required. The comprehensive examination, in part written, in part oral, will be based both on a reading list and the courses taken by the students and will also test the students' ability to express themselves correctly in Spanish. No thesis is required. The student may choose an emphasis in literature or linguistics. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than three years of graduate study. M.A. students are advised by a faculty member in their field of specializa\u00ad tion. Normally only students who are studying for the Ph.D. are admitted to the graduate program. The com\u00ad prehensive examination for the M.A. may be accepted as the written portion of the qualifying examination for the Ph.D. M.A.T. in Spanish This program is specifically directed at ll)eeting the needs of working credentialed teachers, although others may apply. It seeks to provide a group of modern, relevant courses that will enable teachers to keep abreast of recent developments in their field. It is structured so that working teachers can take courses in late afternoons, evenings, and summers, and may be completed in one academic year and two sum-mer sessions. Applicants should have a B.A. in Spanish and should acquire proficiency in a foreign language other than Spanish. The program consists of 10 courses (eight of which must be at the graduate level) as follows: three courses in Hispanic literature; three courses in Hispanic 1 civilization and literature; three courses in Hispanic linguis\u00ad tics; and one course in Recent Trends in Foreign Language Teaching, to be combined with a curricular research project or a thesis. M.A.T. students are counseled by a faculty member in the Department. Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis The bilingual/cross-cultural emphasis is a specialization in addition to the regular teaching credential for high school (Single Subject) or elementary school (Multiple Subject). Undergraduates may plan from the beginning to aim for this emphasis by preparing themselves with a proficiency in the Spanish language. See page 232. Ph.D. in Spanish The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a Ph.D. degree with a major in either Spanish or Spanish-American literature. The program attempts to integrate period and genre studies with work in literary theory, linguistics, and socio-historical studies. A number of courses outside of the Department are required. We thereby hope to aid in the formation of Ph.D. candidates who are not narrow specialists but scholars acquainted with the various fields that relate. to their discipline. We are concerned also with the practical aspects of helping our graduates become good teachers. The minor field can be Spanish literature, Spanish\u00ad American literature, or Spanish linguistics. Language Requirements A reading knowledge of Portuguese and two other lan\u00ad guages relevant to the student's area of specialization and subject to the approval of the Department is required. Course Requirements A minimum of 23 courses is required for the Ph.D. as follows: Two graduate courses in linguistics, diachronic and syn\u00ad chronic (the students who select linguistics as a minor will substitute two courses in either Spanish or Spanish\u00ad American literature); a course in Literary Theory (genre studies, etc.); a course in Methods of Literary Criticism; a course on the socio-historical context of the period of the student's specialization; a course in Brazilian or Portuguese literature (preferably related to the student's specialization); three courses outside of the Department in non-lberic liter\u00ad atures (preferably related to the student's major with regard to period and genre), or if the minor is Spanish linguistics, three courses in general linguistics and/or non-Iberic litera\u00ad tures; 14 courses in Hispanic literature, with a minimum of four in the minor area, the rest chosen by the student in accord with the major. (Students with a minor in linguistics will take 12 courses in Hispanic literature, with a minimum of two in the field [Spanish or Spanish-American] not cho\u00ad sen as a major. Ph.D. candidates should take one course in each genre within their area.) UC IRVINE - 1980-1981Candidates who have the M.A. degree from another uni\u00ad versity will be interviewed by two professors representing peninsular and Spanish-American literature, in order to evaluate their past studies in terms of our doctoral program; it is recommended that the student's graduate advisor should be the person likely to direct the doctoral disserta\u00ad tion and that the choice of dissertation and director be made as early as possible. Each Ph.D. candidate will act as an assistant to a professor in an upper-division course in the area of specialization, attending the class regularly and par\u00ad ticipating in the teaching (it will count as one of the re\u00ad quired graduate courses). Each incoming graduate student will be assigned a faculty advisor who will supervise the student's program and with whom the student should meet at least once every quarter. All graduate students will be formally evaluated at the end of each year by the faculty with whom they have studied. Students pursuing a full\u00ad time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within five years or less. Teaching Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candidates plan to teach, this Department recognizes its responsibility to train them as teachers. Therefore, all candidates for the Ph.D. without previous teaching experience are required to teach one course under supervision in each of three quarters. Comprehensive Examination The written comprehensive examination will consist of three parts: 1. A genre in all periods. The student will demonstrate knowledge of literary theory and methods of literary criticism. 2. A historical literary period. It includes all of the genres and the socio-historical context. 3. Textual analysis. A representative text in the student's genre of specialization will be given to the student at the time of the examination. If the genre is poetry, the text may be a complete poem or a section from a larger poem. Jn the case of the short story, novel, theatre, or essay, a relatively brief organic section will constitute the text. The student's analysis should be intrinsic; it should also demonstrate the relationship of the text to the total work as well as to the author's total production and the author's position in the literary history of the country or the continent. Admission to Candidacy During the year preceding the comprehensive exams, the student will write a dissertation project of approximately 40 typewritten (double-spaced) pages which will be turned in one month before the comprehensive exams. The topic as well as the dissertation advisor will be chosen by the stu\u00ad dent. The essay should: 1. Define clearly the topic of the dissertation and justify it by discussing its significance. 2. Discuss previous studies on this topic and prove the originality of the new study. 3. Describe and justify the critical method to be followed. 4. Include a bibliography of specific, general, and theoreti\u00ad cal works. Spanish and Portuguese 137 The student is admitted to candidacy after passing unani\u00ad mously an oral Qualifying Examination administered by a Candidacy Committee appointed by the Graduate Council. The Candidacy Committee is composed of five members, of whom four will be from the Department. Dissertation A dissertation topic will be chosen by the candidate which will normally, but not necessarily, fall within one of the major fields covered by the Qualifying Examination. Three faculty members appointed by the Graduate Council constitute the Doctoral Committee which supervises the preparation and completion of the doctoral thesis. The Doc\u00ad toral Committee supervises a final examination, the focus of which is the content of the doctoral thesis. Ordinarily, this examination will not be given after comple\u00ad tion of the thesis, but rather at an appropriate point during its development. Such final examination will normally be given while the graduate student is in residence. The Doctoral .Committee certifies that a completed thesis is satisfactory through the signatures of the individual Committee members on the title page of the accepted thesis.

UC IRVINE - 1980-1981SCHOOL OF Physical Sciences Everly B. Fleischer Dean The School of Physical Sciences offers both professional training and general education in the Departments of Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics. The faculty, active in research and graduate education, are at the same time vitally concerned with undergraduate teaching. Curricula of the School are designed to meet the needs of a wide variety of students ranging from those with little technical background who seek insight i'nto the activities and ac\u00ad complishments of physical scientists to those seeking a comprehensive understanding that will prepare them for creative research in physical science. Over the course of the past century and a half, physics, chemistry, and mathematics have evolved into interde\u00ad pendent but separate intellectual disciplines. This de\u00ad velopment is reflected in the departmental structure of the School of Physical Sciences. In the same period, these fun\u00ad damental disciplines have moved into domains of abstrac\u00ad tion unimagined by early scientists. This trend to abstrac\u00ad tion with its concomitant increase in understanding of the physical universe provides the major challenge to the stu\u00ad dent of the physical sciences. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry, while providing the foundation of the technol\u00ad ogy that dominates contemporary civilization, underlie to Physical Sciences 139 an ever-increasing extent the new developments in the biological and social sciences. In recognition of the contribution students can make to the academic affairs of the School, a variety of responsibilities on School and departmental committees is given to under\u00ad graduate and graduate students. Degrees HONORS Criteria used by the School of Physical Sciences in selecting candidates for honors at graduation are as follows: Approx- \u00b7 imately 1 percent will be awarded summa cum laude, 3 per\u00ad cent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude. Honors are awarded on the basis of a student's performance in research and cumulative grade point average. The School of Physical Sciences also grants special honors to students who have distinguished themselves by their work in their major subject. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS Each department offers courses that are of value to non\u00ad majors and majors in the sciences. The programs for majors are designed to meet the needs of students planning careers UC IRVINE - 1980-1981140 Physical Sciences in business or industry, of students planning advanced professional study, and of students planning graduate work that continues their major interest. Introductory courses in chemistry, mathematics, and physics meet the needs of students majoring in the sciences, mathematics, and en\u00ad gineering and are also appropriate for students in other disciplines who seek a rigorous introduction to the physical sciences. In addition, a number of courses within the ~chool have few or no prerequisites and are directed par\u00ad ticularly toward students majoring in areas remote from the sciences. Planning a Program of Study Every undergraduate student who has chosen to major in Physical Sciences is assigned a faculty advisor. The name of this advisor is communicated to the student prior to enroll\u00ad ment or may be obtained from the Office of the Associate Dean or of the appropriate Department Chair. Students are free to change academic advisors at any time. Each depart\u00ad ment also has a Chief Academic Advisor who is responsible f~>r inte~p.reting degree requirements and dealing with spe\u00ad ~tal advt~mg problems. An academic advising and counsel\u00ad mg staff 1s also employed in the Associate Dean's Office and is available to serve a broad range of student advising needs. In consultation with the advisor the student should plan a course of study leading to a major in one of the departments of the School. In carrying out this major, the student may often concentrate very heavily in a second de\u00ad partment within the School or in some other school. Occa\u00ad sionally students choose to pursue a double major. Permis-sion to do so may be sought by a petition submitted to the Office of the Associate Dean of Physical Sciences. All initial courses of study for majors include mathematics through calculus, and calculus is a prerequisite for much of the upper-division work in each major. A student in\u00ad terested in any of the physical sciences should continue mathematical training beyond these prerequisite courses. Furthermore, students interested in either physics or chemistry will usually include work in both of these sub\u00ad jects in their undergraduate careers. Students in the physical sciences are urged to acquire a working knowledge of computer programming at an early stage of ~eir university studies. This can be done by taking Information and Computer Science 1, Information and Computer Science 15, or Physics 1. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 13. SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS In addition to the courses taken in fulfillment of the UCI breadth requirement, students with a major in the School of Physical Sciences are required to take one additional ap\u00ad proved three-course group chosen from one of the follow\u00ad ing breadth categories: Category III (Social and Behavioral Sciences); Category IV (Humanistic Inquiry); or the Lan\u00ad guage and Linguistics section of Category V. For purposes UC IRVINE - 1980-1981of this requirement, the approved sequences are the same ones listed for the UCI breadth requirement, with the ex\u00ad ception that any three consecutive foreign language courses are acceptable. GRADUATE PROGRAMS A program of course work and research leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees is offered in each of the three depart\u00ad ments of the School. The individual programs are described in the following announcements of each department. DEPARTMENT OF Chemistry Max Wolfsberg, Ph.D. Washington University, Chair of the Depart\u00ad ment and Professor of Chemistry Philip N. Borer, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Assistant Professor of Chemistry David A. Brant, Ph.D. University of Wisconsin, Professor of Chemistry Marjorie C.

Moore, Ph.D. University of Illinois, Professor of Chemistry Larry E. Overman, Ph.D. University of Wisconsin, Professor of Chemistry F. S. Rowland, Ph.D. University of Chicago, Professor of Chemistry Kenneth J. Shea, Ph.D. The Pennsylvania State University, Assis\u00ad tant Professor of Chemistry Constance E. Suffredini, M.S. Lehigh University, Lecturer in Chemistry Robert W. Taft, Ph.D. Ohio State University, Professor of Chemistry UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The major in Chemistry is elected by students planning careers.in the chemical sciences and frequently also by those whose interests lie in biology, medicine, earth sci\u00ad ences, secondary education, business, and law. The cur\u00ad riculum of the Department is designed to satisfy the diverse needs of these students and others who may have occasion to study chemistry. The year course Chemistry 1A-B-C is prerequisite to all study in the Department at more ad\u00ad vanced levels. The subject matter of this course serves also Chemistry 141 as a thorough introduction to the varied aspects of modern chemistry for students who do not wish to pursue their studies beyond this introductory level. Chemistry 51A-B-C is a one-year sequence in Organic Chemistry which is re\u00ad quired for Chemistry majors and for students of the life sciences. Certain more advanced courses required of Chemistry majors may also be of particular interest to the latter groups, among others. The undergraduate program of the Chemistry Department emphasizes close contact with research. Chemistry majors a:re urged to engage in research under the direction of a faculty member. Much of the important chemical literature is being and has been printed in foreign languages, principally German, Russian, and French. Reading competence in one or more of these languages is desirable, and many graduate schools require the demonstration of such competence as a pre\u00ad requisite for an advanced degree. Chemistry majors are en\u00ad couraged to acquire this competence. Chemistry majors who are interested in teaching chemistry at the secondary level are urged to consult with their ad\u00ad visors and with the Office of Teacher Education early in their undergraduate careers. Chemistry majors who plan subsequent study in medical, dental, or other professional schools should request information concerning admission requirements directly from the schools which they seek to enter. Those intending to pursue graduate studies in. chemistry should discuss their plans with their academic advisors. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 13. School Requirements: See page 140. DEPARTMENTAL REQUIREMENTS Basic Requirements: Mathematics 2A-B-C, Physics 5A-B-C and 107L, Chemistry 131A-B-C or 130A-B-C, Chemistry 151. Electives: Four courses chosen from the elective list below. These must include at least two courses offered by the Chemistry Department (Chemistry 180 may be counted no more than once and Chemistry 199 may not be counted) and at least one of the laboratory courses in the following laboratory course group: Chemistry 152, Chemistry 153, Chemistry 160, Chemistry 170, Physics 150, Physics 151, Physics 152, Physics 153. Elective List: Chemistry 125, 135, and all Chemistry courses numbered 152-235, Bio. Sci. 101F (Biochemistry), Bio. Sci. 101G (Molecular (Biochemistry), Physics (Clas\u00ad sical Mechanics), Physics Theory), Physics 113A-B-C (Quantum Physics), Physics 115 (Statisti\u00ad cal Physics), Physics 116 (Thermodynamics), Physics 132 (Nuclear Physics), Physics 133 (Condensed Matter Physics), Physics 134 (Modern Optics), Physics 150 (Electronics for Scientists), Physics 151 (Advanced Laboratory), Physics 152 (Advanced Laboratory), Physics 153 (Advanced Laboratory). UC IRVINE - 1980-1981142 Chemistry Scientific Breadth Requirements: A total of six additional four-or five-unit courses chosen from the offerings of the Departments of Mathematics and Physics and the School of Biological Sciences. (These may be taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis subject to the usual restrictions on Pass/Not Pass enrollment.) Planning a Program of Study The departmental requirements leave the student a great deal of latitude in choice of courses; the student can choose to pursue interests ranging from biochemistry on the one hand to chemical physics on the other. Many of the basic requirements above coincide with those of the School of Biological Sciences, and a double major in Chemistry\u00ad Biological Sciences does not require much extra course work. The Department is accredited by the American Chemical Society to offer an undergraduate degree certified by the Society as suitable background for a career in chemistry or for graduate study in chemistry. While it is not necessary, it is desirable for students to pursue a course of study that the American Chemical Society judges to merit a certified degree. A certified degree specifically requires that the following courses be included in the program of study: Physics 5A-B-C; Mathematics 3 (any two quarters); Chemis\u00ad try 152 and 153; Chemistry 160 or 170 or 180. Students should consult with their academic advisors on courses of study. A Chemistry major normally takes Chemistry 1A-B-C and 1LB-LC, Mathematics 2A-B-C, and required writing courses during the freshman year. The sophomore year should include Chemistry 51A-B-C and 51LA-LB-LC; the Physics SA-B-C and 5LA-LB-LC sequ\u00ad ences should be completed no later than the fall quarter of the junior year. The balance ofthe freshman and sopho\u00ad more program can be chosen at the student's discretion with consideration given to progress toward completion of the School of Physical Sciences breadth requirement, the UCI breadth requirement, and the Chemistry Department scientific breadth requirement. In the junior year all Chemistry majors should enroll in the year sequence of physical chemistry (Chemistry 131A-B-C or 130-A-B-C) and in Chemistry 107 (fall) and 151 (winter). During the junior and senior years the Chemistry Department electives requirement should be fulfilled, as should other University, School, and departmental requirements. There is no foreign language requirement, but Chemistry majors are urged to obtain reading competence in a foreign language through course work. Outlines of several typical programs of study for Chemistry majors, American Chemical Society certified Cheinistry majors, and Chemistry-Biological Sciences double majors have been prepared. Students are urged to obtain copies of the sample programs from their academic advisors, from the Chemistry Department Office, or from the Physical Sci\u00ad ences Associate Dean's Office. GRADUATE PROGRAM The Department offers graduate programs leading .to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemistry. The Ph.D. degree is granted in recognition of breadth and depth of knowledge of the facts and theories of modern chemistry and an ability to carry out independent chemical research demonstrated through submission of an acceptable doctoral dissertation. The M.S. degree may be earned either through submission of an acceptable Master's thesis (Plan I) or through an ap\u00ad proved program of graduate course work (Plan II). A Mas\u00ad ter's degree is not a prerequisite for admission to the Ph.D. program. Upon entering the graduate programs all students are re\u00ad quired to take a series of Area Examinations which test the students' competence in the general areas of chemistry, e.g., organic, physical, inorganic, at the undergraduate level. The Area Examinations are designed to ensure a proper fundamental level of preparation for graduate study and are used as a guide in choosing the appropriate pro\u00ad gram of course work for each entering student. Students in the Ph.D. program are expected to demonstrate their knowledge of chemistry at the advanced level through satisfactory completion of a series of Cumulative Examina\u00ad tions. These examinations are designed to encourage the independent study of chemistry through reading of the classic and current chemical literature and attendance at advanced seminars and colloquia. Normally, beginning with the second year of graduate study, students must take the monthly examinations until four have been passed. This requirement must be satisfied within 12 consecutive Cumulative Examinations. Following completion of the Cumulative Examination re\u00ad quirement, participants in the Ph.D. program take an oral examination for formal Advancement to. Candidacy. This examination normally comes in a student's third graduate year and consists of an oral defense before a faculty com\u00ad mittee of the student's dissertation research project and a second original research proposition conceived, developed, and documented by the student. The committee may examine the student at this time on any subject it deems relevant to the independent pursuit of chemical research. Students in the Ph.D. and M.S. Plan I (Thesis) programs are required to complete a minimum of seven approved courses, including six graduate level courses in chemistry. The M.S. Plan II (Course Work) program requires that the student complete 10 graduate-level chemistry courses. Graduate students are expected to maintain a grade point average of B or better to remain in good academic standing. Training in teaching is an integral part of each graduate program, and all graduate degree candidates are expected to participate in the teaching program for at least three quarters during their graduate career. The most important component of the Ph.D. program is the Doctoral Dissertation, which must describe the results of original research performed by the student under the supervision of a faculty member of the Department. The crite'rion for acceptability of the dissertation is that its con\u00ad tents be of a quality suitable for publication in a scientific journal of high editorial standards. Each Ph. D. candidate is expected to present the work described in the completed dissertation in a seminar before the Department, following which the candidate will be examined ih public on the con\u00ad tents of the dissertation by a committee of the faculty. A Master's thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the re\u00ad quirements for the M.S. under Plan I must also describe the results of a student's original research performed under the direction of a faculty member. However, no public oral de\u00ad fense of the Master's thesis is required. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981Residency requirements specify a minimum of six quarters in residence at UCI for Ph.D. candidates and three quarters for M.S. candidates. Some faculty from the Department of Chemistry are mem\u00ad bers of an interdisciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. The program provides an opportunity for interaction among graduate students and faculty from a number of UCI departments who share common interests in biophysics and biophysical chemistry. Participating graduate students pursue a degree in the department best suited to their own background and research interests. A program of seminars brings the group together monthly to discuss research problems of mutual interest, and a regular series of interdisciplinary courses is offered by the par\u00ad ticipating faculty to provide formal instruction in areas en\u00ad compassed by biophysics and biophysical chemistry.

Whitley, Ph.D. New Mexico State University, Professor of Mathematics Janet L. Williams, Ph.D. Brandeis University, Associate Professor of Mathematics Mathematics is a humanistic discipline. The goal of the pure mathematician is to create new mathematics of striking beauty and elegance; the applied mathematician demands, in addition, that newly created mathematics reveal inner aspects of phenomena drawn from nature and experience. It is remarkable that mathematics, pursued throughout the ages for its transcendental beauty, also is the vehicle used for the description of reality by the physical, biological, and social sciences, as well as by the engineering disciplines. It is not fully understood why mathematics and nature are so closely interrelated, but it is so. The Department of Ma.thematics is engaged in teaching and fundamental research in a wide variety of basic mathemati\u00ad cal disciplines. Its activity is reflected in undergraduate and graduate courses which are responsive to new develop\u00ad ments at the research frontier and the ever-changing re\u00ad quirements of government, industry, and education. The Department of Mathematics offers undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to fashion a thorough and soundly based program of study leading to profes\u00ad sional competence in mathematical research, or in an area of application. The curriculum in mathematics includes opportunities for supervised individual study and research, and is aug\u00ad mented by seminars and colloquia. It is designed to be compatible with curricular structures at other collegiate in\u00ad stitutions in California in order to enable students transfer\u00ad ring to UCI to continue their programs of mathematics study. The Department maintains an LSI-11-based minicomputer and a number of programmable calculators that are available for student and faculty use and that sup\u00ad plement the campus Computing Facility. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Undergraduate mathematics courses are of several kinds: courses preparatory to advanced work in mathematics, the exact sciences, and engineering; courses for students of the social and biological sciences; and courses for liberal arts students and those planning to enter the teaching field.

Department. The general course requirement is satisfactory completion of 12 upper-division or graduate courses (48 units), at least eight of which (32 units) must be at the graduate level (200 series courses). The specific requirements of the three con\u00ad centrations (Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Applied Statistical Mathematics) are described below. Each concentration has a core of nine courses, in each of which the student must earn a grade of B (3.0) or better. A grade point average of at least B (3.0) is required for all courses applicable to the M.S. degree. The student's selection of alternative or elective courses must be approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. The nine required core courses for the Pure Mathematics concentration are Mathematics 210A-B-C, Mathematics 220A-B-C, and Mathematics 230A-B-C. The student must complete three additional approved courses, one of which must be an appropriate course offered by a Department other than Mathematics. The nine required core courses for the Applied Mathema\u00ad tics concentration are Mathematics 210A-B-C, Mathematics 220A or 230A, Statistics (Mathematics 131A-B-C or Differential Equations (Mathematics 142A-B-C or 295A-B-C), plus two additional graduate courses.in Mathematics. The student must complete three additional approved courses, including two appropriate courses of\u00ad fered by a Department other than Mathematics. The nine required core courses for the Applied Mathemati\u00ad cal Statistics concentration are Mathematics 201A-B-C, Mathematics 202, Mathematics 204A-B, and three addi\u00ad tional approved graduate courses in Mathematics or an ap\u00ad propriate applied area. The student also must complete Mathematics 129A-B-C. Ordinarily, the final examinations in the courses listed below will comprise the comprehensive examination for the Master's degree. Pure Mathematics: Mathematics 210C, Mathematics 220C, and Applied 142C or 295C. Applied Mathematical Statistics: Mathematics 201C, Mathematics 202, and Mathematics 204B. The student must satisfy the language requirement for the Master's degree by demonstrating reading proficiency in French, German, or Russian; or by demonstrating pro\u00ad gramming proficiency in one higher level programming language. The residency requirement for the Master's degree ordinar\u00ad ily is satisfied by full-time enrollment for three quarters immediately preceding the award of the M.S. degree. When appropriate, a Leave of Absence may be granted be\u00ad tween matriculation and the final quarters of study. Ph.D. in Mathematics To be admitted to the doctoral program in Mathematics, an applicant must have completed a Master's degree in Mathe\u00ad matics with distinction. When accepted into the doctoral program, the student em\u00ad barks on a program of formal courses, seminars, and indi\u00ad vidual study courses to prepare for the Ph.D. qualifying examination and dissertation. A candidate for the Ph.D. should have both breadth and depth of knowledge. Breadth is demonstrated by advanced knowledge and com\u00ad petence in algebra and analysis. Depth of knowledge is demonstrated by profound familiarity with a well-defined subject in mathematics, e.g., Banach algebras, categorical algebra, group theory, operator theory, probability theory, or topology. After an appropriate period of advanced study, the Graduate Studies Committee will invite the student to pre\u00ad pare for the qualifying examination (or recommend that the student withdraw from the program). This decision will be reached after consultation with the student's faculty advisor and a review of the instructors' evaluations of the student's performance in courses and seminars. To prepare for the qualifying examination, the student should study, in depth, two topics selected with the approval of the Graduate Studies Committee. The oral qualifying examination is conducted by a candi\u00ad dacy committee, appointed by the Dean of the Graduate Division on behalf of the Graduate Council, including at least one member of the faculty outside of the Mathematics Department. Following a successful examination, the committee recommends admission of the student to candi- dacy for the Ph.D. . The Ph.D. in Mathematics requires a demonstration of the ability to read the literature of mathematics in two of these languages: French, German, or Russian; and the ability to program in a higher level programming language. Teaching experience and training is an integral part of the Ph.D. program. All doctoral students are expected to par\u00ad ticipate in the teaching program of the Department. The candidate must demonstrate independent, creative re\u00ad search in mathematics by writing and defending a disserta\u00ad tion that makes a new and valuable contribution to mathe\u00ad matics in the candidate's area of concentration. Following advancement to candidacy, a doctoral committee, ap\u00ad pointed by the Dean of the Graduate Division on behalf of the Graduate Council, guides and supervises the candi\u00ad date's research, study, and writing of the dissertation; con\u00ad ducts an oral defense of the dissertation; and recommends that the Ph.D. be conferred upon approval of the doctoral thesis.

Wallis, Ph.D. Catholic University of America, ProfessQr of Physics . Joseph Weber, Ph.D. Catholic University of America, Visiting Professor of Physics Physics is that branch of science concerned with the study of natural phenomena at the fundamental level. Physicists study the smallest structure of matter (quarks, nuclei, and atoms); the properties of solids, liquids, gases, and plas\u00ad mas; the behavior of matter on the grand scale in stars and galaxies; and eve\u00b7n the origin and fate of the universe. Other disciplines such as chemistry, biology, medicine, and en\u00ad gineering often build upon the foundations laid by physics. In the past century applications of phenomena encountered in the field of physics have led to more changes in our lifestyle than have occurred in the previous millenium. These changes have brought us a \"high\" standard of living on one hand, and a threat of societal extinction on the other. The knowledge gained in physical studies has af\u00ad fected our daily life, our view of life, our philosophies, and our religions. A subject of so great and general an influence Physics 153 is not only of interest to the specialist but should be under\u00ad stood in its scope, power, and promise for the future by every educated person. The Department offers courses for students of various in\u00ad terests, from those in the liberal arts to those in engineering and other sciences. Faculty members are conducting active research in several forefront areas of physical research, and there is student access to specialized research areas such as elementary particles, plasma physics, and condensed mat\u00ad ter at both advanced and undergraduate course levels. In\u00ad struction varies in approach from traditional lecture courses to seminars at variot1s levels, to independently constructed programs, and to experimental computer teaching. The faculty is generally young, innovative, and engaged in everything from the traditional activities of research, education, and university service, to community action, literature, and national policy making, to mention a few examples. The Department encourages student-faculty interaction, and faculty members lead the lower-division discussion sections. The Department consists of people committed to intellectual activities and is exciting to those who are so inclined. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Courses in the Physics Department are designed to meet the needs of many kinds of students, from those students without facility in mathematics whose main interests lie in the humanities or the arts to those students with profes\u00ad sional goals in science and engineering. In addition to the regular Physics major, a concentration in Applied Physics and a concentration of Biomedical Physics are offered. The three lower-division sequences in physics are distinguished by their intended audience, their mathematical prerequi\u00ad sites, and the extent to which they offer preparation for more advanced courses. These aspects of the beginning courses are summarized in the following table: PHYSICS 3 PHYSICS 5 PHYSICS 10-24 Intended Audience Premedical students, Physics, Chemistry, Biological Sciences and Engineering majors majors Mathematical Prerequisites Algebra and trigo- Math 2A (Calcu\u00ad nometry; concurrent Ius); knowledge enrollment in of computer pro- Math 2 or Math 14 gramrning is recommended Preparation for Advanced Courses Physics SC with All upper-division permission courses in physics . , . \u00b7>\" Non science majors None None Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 13.

One quarter of the advanced laboratory requirement may be waived with appropriate engineering laboratory work. BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS REQUIREMENTS The requirements of the concentration in Biomedical Physics include the requirements of the Physics degree, except as noted below, plus the following: Biological Sci\u00ad ences lOlA, Chemistry lA-B-C with laboratory; a three or four quarter sequence of courses in a specific area. Suggested sequences are as follows: 1. Chemistry SlA-B with laboratory; Biological Sciences 101F and lOlG 2. Biological Sciences 101D plus two psychobiology courses 3. Chemistry 130A-B-C 4. Radiological Sciences 200A-B-C Approval must be obtained from the program coordinator. Sequences other than those above may be acceptable. The SAMPLE PROGRAMS- PHYSICS requirement for three additional coherently related upper\u00ad division science courses does not apply to students in this concentration. NOTE: Students entering in falll980 should consult the Department of Physics regarding changes in the Biological Sciences curriculum. Planning a Program of Study Physics 3 is a one-year course suitable for premedical stu\u00ad dents, students majoring in Biological Sciences, and non\u00ad science majors. It surveys most of the important branches of physics with strong orientation toward modern physics. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Nonscience majors with some mathematical skill may wish to consider Physics 3 as an alternative to Physics 10-24. A student who decides to major in Physics after completing Physics 3 with a grade of A orB may, with the consent of the Department, enroll in Physics SC. The premedical physics requirement may be met with Physics 3 or with Physics SA-B-C. . Physics Sis an intensive five-quarter course for students in physics, chemistry, engineering, and other areas interested in a careful quantitative approach to the subject. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Students expecting to enroll in the entire five-quarter sequence of Physics S should en\u00ad roll in Mathematics 3A concurrently with Physics SC. Stu\u00ad dents planning to enroll in only three quarters of Physics S need not enroll in Mathematics 3A. The recommended knowledge of computer programming may be gained by enrolling in Information and Computer Science 1, usually in the fall quarter of the freshman year, or in Physics 1. Biological Sciences majors with facility in calculus should consider Physics S as an alternative to Physics 3. Physics courses numbered between 10 and 24 are general education courses intended for nonscience majors. Physics 13A-B is particularly oriented toward students in Social Ecology. The content and format of Physics 21-24 will vary from year to year. In general, these courses will not include regular laboratory work. A typical course program for Physics majors considering the possibility of graduate study in physics or astronomy is shown below. Three of the electives in the senior year may be physics graduate courses. A student with a weak background may want to postpone Physics ll3A-B-C until the senior year.

This series of courses in the upper-division curriculum is sufficiently broad to provide programs both for the Physics major who does not intend to pursue the study of physics beyond the Bachelor's de\u00ad gree level and for the Physics major preparing for a profes\u00ad sional career in physics. The Physics major with a career goal in medicine, law, teaching, or business, for example, should emphasize the Physics 130 series, which covers most of the important phenomena of physics. The Physics major preparing for graduate work in physics should cover most of the Physics 110 series. Any major who is so inclined can take more than the minimum two quarters of advanced laboratory work. Able students may begin the Physics 111 series in their sophomore year. Courses numbered between 110 and 116 emphasize the mathematical and theoretical structures that have unified our understanding of nature. Those numbered between 130 and 149 emphasize particular domains of the structure of matter. Laboratory work is assigned to separate courses, 150-153. . Transfer students are specifically advised to seek individual consultation with a member of the Physics faculty before deciding on a program of courses. Since many graduate physics departments require a read\u00ad ing knowledge of one foreign language, Physics majors planning graduate work should, if possible, study some Russian, German, or French. Introductory courses in biol\u00ad ogy and chemistry are also recommended options. Every Physics major should avoid overspecialization and wisely use undergraduate years to explore some areas remote from physics. Physics majors with interests other than graduate work in physics or astronomy need not take as many physics courses as indicated above. Note also that alternatives to Physics major requirements can be approved upon petition to the Department and the Office of the Associate Dean. As a guide to preparing a suitable program, the Department makes the following suggestions: Physics majors considering the possibility of graduate school in engineering should complete the Applied Physics requirements. The course program of Physics majors considering graduate work in chemistry, biology, or various interdisciplinary areas should contain: Chemistry 1A-B-C and 51A-B-C, and Biological Sciences 101A-B-C. The concentration in Biomedical Physics. is offered for Physics majors who wish to follow an integrated program which combines biology andfor chemistry with physics, and is suitable preparation for a graduate career in one of these interdisciplinary areas. The course program of Physics majors considering a teach\u00ad ing career in the public schools ot the community colleges should contain: Education 171 and 170; or 172; and additional preparation in some other area of science or mathematics. Courses from the Physics 10-24 sequence may be appropriate. Physics 155 The course program of Physics majors considering graduate work in the history of science should contain at least: History 29A-B\"C. Courses from the Physics 10-24 sequence may be appropriate. SAMPLE PROGRAM- APPLIED PHYSICS The Applied Physics concentration within the Physics un\u00ad dergraduate degree program is designed to provide ap\u00ad propriate education to students who anticipate a career in industrial or technological research. It combines the fun\u00ad damental knowledge of physical processes obtained from physics courses with the technical knowledge obtained from engineering courses, particularly electrical engineer\u00ad ing courses. In addition to the basic courses in physics, a student is required to complete six courses in the School of Engineering approved by the PhysiCs Department. Exam\u00ad ples of appropriate EE114B, EE176, and EE178. Upon completion of the Applied Physics concentration, the student will receive a B.S. degree in Physics. A typical course program for Physics majors in the Applied Physics concentration differs from the Physics major pro\u00ad gram only in the junior and senior years. WINTER Junior Physics llOA Physics 111B Engr. EEllOA EE178 PROGRAM PLANNING -BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS The Biomedical Physies concentration is designed for the student who anticipates a career in physics applied to biol\u00ad ogy and medicine, such as health physics or radiological physics, or who intends to work in a scholarly field which deals with the physical aspects of biology or medicine, such as molecular biology or physiology. Completion of re\u00ad quirements for the Physics major is required, except as noted in the Biomedical Physics requirements, as are six quarters of basic ~ol.l.rses in biology and chemistry. A sequence of three or four integrated additional courses which must be approved by the program coordinator com\u00ad pletes the program. Students who wish to follow the Biomedical Physics concentration are advised to seek guid\u00ad ance early in their college careers. The requirements are such that coordination of a program in the first and second years is essential. A sample program for the Biomedical Physics concentration is available from the Department of Physics Office. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981156 Physics GRADUATE PROGRAM The Department offers the M.S. and the Ph.D. degrees in Physics, the first in recognition of demonstrated knowledge of the basic facts and theories of physics, the second primarily in recognition of demonstrated capacity for inde\u00ad pendent research. In general, graduate study in physics is expected to be a full-time activity. Other proposed arrangements should be approved by the Graduate Committee. Complementing the formal courses, the Department offers regular colloquia and informal seminars. The graduate stu\u00ad dent is a member of an intellectual community and is ex\u00ad pected to participate fully in departmental activities. Atten\u00ad dance at colloquia is considered an essential part of grad\u00ad uate study. In addition, there are regular weekly research seminars in condensed matter, high energy, and plasma physics. About 60 graduate students of physics were enrolled in 1979-80. Active programs of research are underway in high energy physics, condensed matter physics, low tem\u00ad perature physics, plasma physics, mathematical physics, and astrophysics. Sources of support available to graduate students include teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and fellowships. Students planning to pursue graduate work in physics should obtain a copy of the booklet Physical Sciences from the Department. Master of Science in Physics The requirements for the M.S. degree are: (1) at least three quarters of residence; and (2) mastery of graduate course material, which may be demonstrated either (a) by passing, with an average grade of B or better, a minimum of nine quarter courses numbered between 200 and 259, including 211, 213A-B, 214A, and 215A-B, and a written comprehen\u00ad sive examination; or (b) by passing the Ph.D. qualifying examination. Under special circumstances, a research proj\u00ad ect and thesis may be accepted in lieu of proficiency in some of the graduate course material. There is no foreign language requirement for the M.S. degree. In addition to the stated course requirements, all students who have not passed the Ph.D. qualifying examination must register con\u00ad tinuously for Physics 264A-B-C (Seminar in Conceptual Physics). A typical program in preparation for the written examina\u00ad tion for the M.S. degree would consist of 12 courses: 211 (Classical Mechanics) 212A-B (Mathematical Physics) 213A-B (Electromagnetic Theory) 214A-B (Statistical Physics) 215A-B (Quantum Mechanics) Three electives chosen from Physics 212C, 214C, 215C, 216-219, or undergraduate upper-division courses in related areas. Doctor of Philosophy in Physics The principal requirements for the Ph.D. degree are a minimum of six quarters of residence, passage of a written and a two-part oral examination, and successful completion and defense of a dissertation reporting results of original research. In addition, the Ph.D. candidate must complete certain graduate course requirements. There is no foreign language requirement for the Ph.D. degree. Course Requirements. The student is required to exhibit mastery of the basic sequences, Mathematical Physics, Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetic Theory, Quantum Mechanics, Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, and Statistical Mechanics. A minimum of 15 quarter courses numbered be\u00ad tween 200 and 259, including 211, 212A-B, 213A-B, 214A-B, and 215A-B, must be passed with an average grade of B or better. In addition, all students who have not passed the Ph.D. qualifying examination are required to register for Physics 264A-B-C. It is expected that students, having selected a research specialty, will ordinarily take the core course in that subject (237 A-B-C, 238A-B-C, or 239A-B-C) early in their graduate career. Qualifying Examination. For advancement to Ph.D. candi\u00ad dacy, a student must pass a qualifying examination consist\u00ad ing of a written part and two oral parts. The written part covers a broad range of fundamentals of physics at the ad\u00ad vanced undergraduate and graduate levels. The first part of the oral examination will be administered shortly after the written examination. All members of the first oral commit\u00ad tee will be faculty from the Physics Department. The sec\u00ad ond part of the oral examination will be taken approxi\u00ad mately one year after successful completion of the written examination and the first oral. The candidacy committee that administers the second oral examination will contain one or two faculty members from outside the Physics De\u00ad partment. The second oral will cover principally material related to the broad and general features of the student's thesis area. The written portion of the qualifying examina\u00ad tion will be given once per year, generally in the fall. The examination may be taken by some students after one year of graduate study. A second attempt will be permitted if the first is not successful. A third attempt will be permitted only in extraordinary circumstances. Teaching Program. Experience in teaching is an integral part of the graduate program, and all graduate students are expected to participate in the teaching program for at least three quarters during their graduate careers. Dissertation. A dissertation summarizing the results of original research performed by the student under the supervision of a doctoral committee appointed by the Graduate Council will be required for the Ph.D. degree. The criterion for the acceptability of a dissertation by the Department is that it be suitable for publication in a scien\u00ad tific journal. The dissertation must not have been submitted to any other institution prior to its submission to the Physics Department at UCI. Defense of Dissertation. Upon completion of the disserta\u00ad tion, the student will take\u00b7 an oral examination, open to the public, before the doctoral committee. Suggested Course Sequences. Typical programs for the first two years designed to prepare the student for Ph.D. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981qualification and provide the foundation necessary for un\u00ad derstanding and participating in modern research might include: (Relativistic Quantum Mechanics).

Yellott, Jr., Ph.D. Stanford University, Associate Professor of Psychology Social Sciences 161 Undergraduate and graduate education in the School of So\u00ad cial Sciences at UCI represents a commitment to modern social science. The classic subject matter areas of anthropol\u00ad ogy, economics, geography, linguistics, political science, psychology, and sociology are included in the School's educational programs, but these programs go well beyond the traditional disciplines and can be characterized by the following three-way emphasis: First, the faculty recognizes the value of systematic empiri\u00ad cal observation and quantitative analysis in the study of human behavior. Developments in computer science and in mathematics oriented toward the problems of the social sciences and the refinement of techniques for the observa\u00ad tional, experimental, and statistical study of human be\u00ad havior have contributed major new elements to social sci\u00ad ence. Students in the School of Social Sciences will become familiar with the mathematical, computational, and statisti\u00ad cal tools underlying modern social science. Second, many of the most interesting questions in the study of human behavior cannot be fixed within the tradi\u00ad tional disciplinary boundaries. Some of the new and evolv\u00ad ing areas which cross orthodox boundaries are political sociology, public policy, cognitive anthropology, compara\u00ad tive culture, and psycholinguistics. Therefore, many courses and course modules are built around social science phenomena, rather than representing social science disciplines. Third, the School shares the academic philosophy that con\u00ad siders the design of hypotheses and of systems of interre\u00ad lated ideas about the possible structure of the world to be an essential part of scientific pursuit. Consequently, the educational programs place substantial emphasis on under\u00ad standing social science phenomena through the develop\u00ad ment of theories that can be used to guide empirical studies. Opportunities for students in the School of Social Sciences to participate in the educational process extend well beyond attendance at courses. Students may develop independent study proposals in cooperation with interested faculty members; they are invited to participate in the quarterly evaluation of courses and instructors, to propose new courses and other modifications in existing programs, to nominate candidates for visiting faculty appointments, and to serve on School committees. The School provides a variety of opportunities for faculty-student interaction, and students will find the faculty, administration, and academic counseling staff of the School highly accessible and responsive. SPECIAL FACILITIES The School of Social Sciences maintains several special facilities for research and education. The Social Sciences Research Laboratory occupies the entire fourth floor of the Social Sciences Laboratory Building. The facility contains 40 experiment and control rooms situated around a central core where two PDP-11 computers are available for experi\u00ad mental research. The laboratory is used for faculty and student research. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981UC IRVINE - 1980-1981The Farm School, a small, open, and ungraded elementary school located in a rural setting adjacent to the campus, serves as a research facility for faculty and students having interests in children and how they learn. Each quarter un\u00ad dergraduates receive course credit for assisting staff teachers, for developing educational materials, and for ob\u00ad serving and analyzing child behavior at the school. The Anthropology Laboratory provides research facilities which include computer terminals for statistical studies and for the analysis of texts and other verbal material. The laboratory is also available for undergraduate and graduate instruction in field methodology and analytical techniques through the use of video-cassettes, films, tapes, computer quizzes, and artificial intelligence programs that simulate interviewing situations. The School also maintains a Video Laboratory where social science students and faculty can produce and edit video\u00ad tapes for various purposes. The facility currently contains a tape library used extensively in the study of conversation and interaction. Degrees Anthropology ...................................

UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 13. Social Sciences 163 SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS A. Familiarity with some basic mathematical, computa\u00ad tional, and statistical tools underlying modern social sci\u00ad ence. This requirement is met by passing three courses in mathematics (Mathematics 5A-B-C, Mathematics 2A-B-C, Social Sciences llA-B-C, or Social Sciences lOOA-B-C) and one course in computer science (Information and Computer Science 1). B. An understanding of the fundamental concepts, analyt\u00ad ical tools, and methods of social science. This requirement is met by taking two courses in the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences bearing a one-digit course number. C. An understanding of important advanced areas in social science. This requirement is met by passing satisfactorily nine upper-division courses in the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences, where at least three of these courses comprise a module. (See \"Courses in Social Sciences\" below for a dis\u00ad cussion of course modules.) For modules which are listed with more than three courses, the student may normally elect to take any subset of three courses in the module. Appropriate substitutions may be made upon petition. D. Four additional social science courses from any level. Students are reminded that the Pass/Not Pass option is not applicable to course requirements A. through D. above or to any additional requirements listed for specific major pro\u00ad grams below. Information and Computer Science 1 and Social Sciences 100A, however, may be taken Pass/Not Pass. Courses used to meet requirements B. through D. above are included in the computation of the grade point average in courses required in the major program. Major Requirements: Requirements for each of the majors in the School of Social Sciences are listed below. Courses taken to fulfill major requirements may be applied toward School requirements B. through D. above. ANTHROPOLOGY School requirements must be met and must include 12 courses (48 units) as specified below: A. One introductory course in anthropology (four units), either Social Sciences 2A or 2B. B. Two four-unit courses in 31D and one additional four-unit anthropological methods selected from Social Sciences 31A-B-C, 101A-B, 101G-H, or equivalent. C. Four additional anthropology courses (16 units), three courses (12 units) of which must be upper-division. D. One approved four-unit course in linguistics (Social Sciences 3 or equivalent). E. Four courses (16 units) in social science disciplines out\u00ad side anthropology and linguistics, restricted as follows: two courses (eight units) in psychology or psychobiology, and two courses (eight units) in one of the remaining social science disciplines: sociology, geography, economics, or political science. \u00b7 COMPARATIVE CULTURE School requirements must be met and must include 14 courses (56 units) as specified below: UC IRVINE - 1980-1981164 Social Sciences A. Two introductory social science courses (eight units), chosen from Social Sciences 1-9. B. Social Sciences 70A and 71A. C. Four courses (16 units) selected from one or a combina\u00ad tion of the following modules: Social Sciences 170; 171. D. Three courses (12 units) selected from one or a combina\u00ad tion of the following modules: Social Sciences 172; 173. E. Three courses (12 units) designated as Social Sciences 179 (Special Topics). ECONOMICS Alternative 1 School requirements must be met and must include 10 courses (40 units) in economics as specified below: A. Social Sciences 12A-B-C; this course is prerequisite for almost all junior-senior economics courses. It is recom\u00ad mended, but not required, that Social Sciences 4 be taken prior to this series. B. Social Sciences 111A-B and 111C. C. Four additional four-unit upper-division economics courses. At least one of the four courses must be research oriented and involve the production of a significant re\u00ad search paper. This required paper may be approved by any faculty member in economics. It is strongly recommended that students take either the data analysis sequence (Social Sciences 101A-B-C) or the econometrics sequence (Social Sciences 101D-E). Alternative 2 A student who has not completed the economics require\u00ad ments specified above may obtain a B.A. degree in Economics by meeting the School requirements and follow\u00ad ing a program of study in the area, planned in consultation with a faculty advisor. The program is certified through a petition signed by the Dean and two regular members of the economics faculty. Students who wish to pursue this alternative are strongly advised to consult a faculty advisor well in advance of submitting a petition. GEOGRAPHY A B.A. degree in Geography may be obtained by meeting the School requirements and following a program of study in the area, planned in consultation with a faculty advisor. The program is certified through a petition signed by the Dean and two regular members of the geography faculty. Students who wish to pursue this major are strongly ad\u00ad vised to consult a faculty advisor w.ell in advance of submit\u00ad ting a petition. POLITICAL SCIENCE School requirements must be met and must include 11 courses (44 units) in political science as specified below: A. Three introductory courses (12 units) in political science chosen from Social Sciences 6A-B-C-E. B. Six upper-division courses in political science (24 units). Three of these courses must form a module. C. Two additional political science courses from any level (eight units). Honors Program in Political Science: The honors program in Political Science, open to selected students, provides for advanced work in either of two areas: Theory and Re\u00ad search, or Internship and Research. Admission to the pro\u00ad gram is based on a formal application normally submitted during the fall quarter of the student's junior year. In order for an application to be considered, two conditions must be . met. The student must have an overall grade point average of at least 3.2, and the student must have completed at least five political science courses (with a grade point average of 3.5 or higher) by the end of fall quarter of the junior year. Successful completion of the honors program requires at\u00ad tendance at the Honors Seminar, completion of an honors thesis, and the passing of an oral examination administered by three members of the political science faculty. PSYCHOLOGY School requirements must be met and must include 15 courses (60 units) as specified below: A. Social Sciences 7. B. Two four-unit lower-division psychology courses selected from courses listed in the following three groups. The student is strongly encouraged to take courses from two different groups. Group A: Social Sciences SOK; Science(> 2A or 2B, and 8, or approved substitutes (eight units). D. Ten four-unit upper-division courses with emphasis in psychology, distributed as follows: (1) Three courses (four or more units each) taken from one of the following modules: Social Sciences 141; from any module or combi\u00ad nation of modules other than the module selected to satisfy (1) above. (3) Four additional four-unit upper-division psychology courses. These may be selected from any of the modules listed above, including the module used to satisfy (1), as well as from special topics courses which are psychology-related. Students are also encouraged to take psychology courses outside the School of Social Sciences if such courses are appropriate to their educa\u00ad tional goals. SOCIAL SCIENCE Requirements for the B.A. degree in Social Science are met by completing the School requirements on page 163. SOCIOLOGY School requirements must be met and must include 11 courses (44 units) as specified below: A. Social Sciences 8. B. Social Sciences 61E. C. Two lower-division courses (eight units) that emphasize sociology. It is strongly recommended that students take UC IRVINE - 1980-1981one course on sociological methods (such as Social Sciences 61C or 1A) and one course on a special area of sociology (such as Social Sciences 61B). D. Three upper-division courses (12 units) that emphasize sociology. E. Four courses (16 units) in social science disciplines out\u00ad side sociology, or in history or social ecology. Three of these courses must be in the same field, e.g., three courses in economics or three in history. These courses may be upper-or lower-division. They may not be counted as part of the breadth requirement. DOUBLE MAJORS In order to double major within the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences, the following conditions must be met: (1) Normally, neither major program may be the general social science program. (2) Major and School requirements must be met for both majors with no overlap of courses except for those used to satisfy the mathematics, computer science, and introduc\u00ad tory social science requirements. The mathematics and computer science courses need only be taken once. Only two introductory social science classes are needed, pro\u00ad vided this also meets the requirements of both major pro\u00ad grams. The same two-digit and upper-division courses may not be used to meet the requirements of more than one major program. For example, a student who would like to major in psychology and anthropology may take one of the mathematics sequences, Information and Computer Sci\u00ad ence 1, and may use Introduction to Psychology and Intro\u00ad duction to Anthropology to meet the major and School re\u00ad quirements for both programs. However, two different sets of two-digit and upper-division courses must be taken to complete the major and School requirements of the two programs. HONORS CONCENTRATION IN SOCIAL THOUGHT The School of Humanities and the School of Social Sciences offer an honors concentration in Social Thought. The con\u00ad centration offers undergraduates the opportunity to examine major social theories and their implications in a systematic and thorough way. For a complete description of the concentration, see page 125. CONCENTRATION IN WOMEN'S STUDIES The Women's Studies concentration is not a major but is intended to allow a student to complement any major in the School of Humanities, the School of Social Sciences, or the Program in Social Ecology by studying systematically women in culture and society. For further information on the concentration, see page 126. Planning a Program of Study Since there are many alternative ways to plan a program, some of which may require careful attention to specific major requirements, students should consult with their as\u00ad signed faculty advisors or visit the Undergraduate Advising Office (627 Social Science Tower) to design an appropriate program of study. Social Sciences 165 Students who elect one of the Social Sciences majors in their freshman year might begin by taking the one-digit courses required by their major and one of the mathematics sequences listed under Part A. of the School requirements. It is a good idea to take these courses early since they in\u00ad clude fundamental concepts that will be widely applicable in more advanced courses. In addition, the lower-division Writing Requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) should be completed during the first year. In the sopho\u00ad more year, the student might complete the course on com\u00ad puting, three courses toward the breadth requirement, four courses in the social sciences, and four electives. Students who are planning to go on to graduate school can use their freshman and sophomore years to advantage by taking courses in theory, research methods, mathematics, and other areas important to graduate study. In the junior and senior years, the student should take courses in the major area and should create an individualized program of study through a combination of courses and course modules which fall in an area of interest. Particular attention should be paid to planning a program of study that will ensure that major requirements are met prior to graduation. TRANSFER STUDENTS Freshmen and Sophomores: Students transferring to UCI as freshmen or sophomores will fulfill the regular require\u00ad ments of the four-year program either through work at UCI or through transfer credit for comparable work elsewhere. Juniors: Junior transfers electing to major in one of the School's degree programs and with good records at other accredited colleges and universities normally will be pre\u00ad sumed to have satisfied School requirement B. and the University requirements, with the exception of the upper\u00ad division Writing Requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I). Students anticipating transfer to UCI in their junior year, however, should plan their programs so as to anticipate the special mathematics requirements of the program (School requirement A.). Every effort will be made to accommodate individual variation in background, pro\u00ad vided students are prepared to commit themselves to inten\u00ad sive work in areas of deficiency. Ordinarily, the typical two-year program for junior transfers is simply the last two years of the regular four-year program, except that students who have not satisfied the mathematics requirements of the School should plan to do so in the junior year and must do so before graduation. Seniors: Students wishing to graduate with a degree in the School by transferring to UCI in their senior year should plan their work carefully to ensure that the requirements can be met in one year of residence. In general, differences between the program at UCI and programs elsewhere make senior transfers difficult. THE 3-2 PROGRAM WITH THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ADMINISTRATION Students who are interested in a career in administration and who have completed all of the course requirements for the B.A. degree in one of the major programs in the School of Social Sciences may apply to the Graduate School of Administration for their 3-2 Program. Application should be made early in the junior year. During the senior year, students will take courses in administration which will count toward the 180 total units needed to receive a UC IRVINE - 1980-1981166 Social Sciences bachelor's degree. Upon successful completion of there\u00ad quired courses and units, usually at the conclusion of four years of undergraduate study, a B.A. degree will be awarded in the student's major by the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences. An M.S. degree in Administration will be awarded after successful completion of all requirements for the ad\u00ad vanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. TEACHING CREDENTIALS Students planning to seek State of California teaching credentials in social science should discuss their under\u00ad graduate curriculum plans with the School's academic counselors. Students completing any of the B.A. programs in the School qualify for a waiver of the Single Subject Credential Examination in social science. For additional in\u00ad formation about teaching credentials, see the Teacher Edu\u00ad cation section. MATHEMATICS AND SOCIAL SCIENCE The mathematics requirement stems from the nature of modern social science. The concepts and terms of mathematics, statistics, and computers are an important part of the social scientist's vocabulary. Basic knowledge of these tools is necessary to an understanding of current lit\u00ad erature in these fields, to the analysis of data, and to an intelligent use of models in social sciences. Each candidate for a degree in the School of Social Sciences is expected to have a basic knowledge of probability, statistics, and com\u00ad puting. In addition, for students who are preparing for graduate school in an area of social science, it will be impor\u00ad tant to supplement the minimal mathematics requirements with additional courses related to mathematics and social science methodology. The particular courses which would be recommended are not specified here, however, since they are highly dependent on the major emphasis of the student. Students who are preparing for graduate study should consult their advisors to determine a program of study which will give them the research skills necessary for successful graduate work. GRADUATE PROGRAMS Graduate education within the School of Social Sciences is focused upon Cognitive Sciences; Comparative Culture; Politics, Society, and Social Issues; and Social Relations (in\u00ad cluding anthropology). Four interdisciplinary groups of faculty are responsible for graduate study in these areas of emphasis. A fifth faculty group with shared interests in economic theory, public economics, and the evaluation of public policy is developing an emphasis entitled Economics and Public Choice. Most entering Ph.D. students will be admitted to one of the groups and assigned a faculty advisor by that group. Inde\u00ad pendent doctoral study may be offered to a limited number of students interested in an interdisciplinary area of social science not encompassed by one of the groups. The work of these students will be guided by a faculty committee of at least three members that is appointed by the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies. Doctoral study in Comparative Culture leads to the Ph.D. in Comparative Culture. Doctoral study in one of the other groups or under the interdisciplinary committee system leads to the Ph.D. in Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science, depending upon the focus of the student's disser\u00ad tation. All candidates for the Ph.D. must satisfy the general requirements of the School of Social Sciences and of the Graduate Division. The graduate program of the School does not include educational, counseling, or clinical psychology. The School does not offer a program leading to a Master of Arts degree, although the M.A. degree in Comparative Cul\u00ad ture or Social Science may be conferred upon doctoral stu\u00ad dents who satisfy the Graduate Division requirements. Applications for admission to the M.A.T. program in Com\u00ad parative Culture are not being accepted at this time. Admissions Potential graduate students should apply to the Graduate Division for admission to the graduate program of the School of Social Sciences, indicating the title of the degree which they intend to pursue (Ph.D. in Comparative Cul\u00ad ture, Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science) and the academic area in which they expect to concentrate. In addition to the Graduate Division admission requirements, each group may prescribe special requirements or expecta\u00ad tions of applicants. All applicants are required to submit scores for the Graduate Record Examination Aptitude Test. Letters of recommendation are an important factor in the admission decision. The Program in Comparative Culture admits new graduate students only for the fall quarter of even-numbered years. FINANCIAL AID Limited financial support in the form of teaching assistant\u00ad ships and fellowships is available to qualified students. There may be research assistantships available under grants to individual faculty. Students are expected to seek aid for which they are eligible from sources external to the University. General Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree in Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science The general requirements for the Ph.D. in Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science (in addition to those which apply to all Graduate Division students) are summarized below. Each recognized group within the School of Social Sciences may describe additional requirements, subject to the approval of the Graduate Council. LENGTH OF STUDY The faculty envisions a student's Ph.D. program to be of approximately four to five years duration. RESIDENCE Because the intellectual training the School proposes re\u00ad quires full-time study and constant contact with the faculty, the School does not accept part-time students. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981LANGUAGE A knowledge of one foreign language, appropriate to the student's research concerns, is required. Each student's group or candidacy committee will prescribe specific re\u00ad quirements. For those proposing to engage in field re\u00ad search, this may involve interviewing capabilities. QUANTITATIVE METHODS Candidates for the Ph.D. degrees in Social Science, Political Science, or Psychology must satisfy a quantitative methods requirement. This may be met by (1) satisfaction of the quantitative methods requirement of the student's group, or (2) completion of two years of college-level mathematics, statistics, logic, or applications of statistics to social science research problems, in courses approved by the student's group or committee. In the latter option, courses may in\u00ad clude one computer science course; ordinarily at least one year of these quantitative methods courses will be taken during the student's graduate career. EXAMINATIONS The scope and format of the qualifying examinations will be determined by the student's candidacy committee. These examinations may be written or oral, or both, and usually will be conducted after approximately two years of resi\u00ad dence. Also, a student may be required to take additional examinations, submit research papers, or conduct experi\u00ad ments which the committee deems appropriate to the stu\u00ad dent's interests and goals. Upon satisfactory completion of the qualifying examinations, and approval of the disserta\u00ad tion topic, the candidacy committee will recommend that the student be advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. DISSERTATION Following advancement to candidacy, the dissertation is supervised by a doctoral committee ordinarily consisting of three members of the candidacy committee. The purpose of the dissertation is to demonstrate the student's ability to originate interesting and significant research problems, to investigate such problems both broadly and deeply, and to write scholarly material of publishable quality.

Watt: Cognitive Semiotics Kenneth Wexler: Theoretical Psycholinguistics John I. Yellott, Jr.: Mathematical Models and Visual Perception Social Sciences 167 The Cognitive Sciences Group is made up of certain faculty of the School of Social Sciences and graduate students who are pursuing the Ph.D. in either Psychology or Social Sci\u00ad ence, all of whom share common research interests in human cognition. The Cognitive Sciences Group is concerned with how the human mind works. It conducts research and provides ad\u00ad vanced graduate training in cognitive psychology and theoretical linguistics. The Group lays special stress on pre\u00ad cise, scientific approaches to issues in human cognition. It views the formation of formal models as instrumental in understanding what the human mind is all about. The Group takes as its intellectual domain the following: mathematical psychology, perception (visual and auditory), cognitive development, problem solving, learning, mem\u00ad ory, psycholinguistics, iconics, and theoretical linguistics. It does not emphasize traditional training in psychology or linguistics per se; rather, it stresses the integration of re\u00ad search in the areas mentioned above (and related areas) into a discipline whose central focus is the study of human knowledge and human information processing, regardless of the medium in which it is expressed. ADMISSIONS In addition to meeting the general requirements for admis\u00ad sion, applicants should have acquired a background in mathematics equivalent to at least one year of calculus. Ad\u00ad vanced courses in some of the following fields are consid\u00ad ered highly desirable: computer science, mathematics and the physical sciences, biology, logic, and linguistics. Each admission application will be considered on its own merits. REQUIREMENTS Each student is expected to take two three-course graduate sequences. The first is a three-quarter methods sequence covering the areas of probability and statistics, experimen\u00ad tal design, and mathematical models of language. The other is a proseminar sequence covering areas such as learning, memory, perception, and linguistics. Suitable substitutes may be made with written approval of the Group. Addi\u00ad tional advanced course work in other fields relevant to the student's interests will supplement the required courses. Each student is expected to carry out theoretical/empirical research during the first two years. By the end of the sec\u00ad ond year, each student should complete a research project of a scope and nature that potentially could be published in a relevant journal. The student's advisor is responsible for assisting in the planning and other facets of the project. Students are expected to write a paper based on their re\u00ad search and to present a talk to the \"Cognitive Sciences Seminar\" or another appropriate forum by the end of the spring quarter of their second full year in the Program. REVIEWS At the end of each academic year, the faculty in the Pro\u00ad gram will meet to discuss the progress of each of its stu\u00ad dents and to provide feedback on the progress and per\u00ad ceived deficiencies for each first-and second-year student. The advancement to candidacy examination will consist of an oral examination and possibly a written examination as UC IRVINE - 1980-1981168 Social Sciences well. Normally this step will be completed by the end of the third or beginning of the fourth year of the Program. The examination will be based on the student's dissertation proposal. If the student should fail the examination the first time, there will be, at most, one additional opportunity to take the examination. A student who fails the examination twice will be asked to withdraw from the Program. Prior to submission of the final version of the dissertation the student will be expected to defend the dissertation in a public colloquium. Economics and Public Choice Group Duran Bell: Formal Models, Labor Economics Frank Cancian: Economic Anthropology Gordon J. Fielding: Urban Theory and Transportation Policy Amihai Glazer: Industrial Organization and Policy Analysis Bernard Grofman: Public Choice, Law and Economics, and Models of Collective Decision Making John Johnston: Econometrics Sheen T. Kassouf: Econometrics and Economics of Uncertainty Charles A. Lave: Transportation Policy, Economics of Energy, and Social Change Julius Margolis: Economic Analysis of Government Behavior: Positive and Normative Christian Werner: Mathematical Geography and Transportation Networks The Economics and Public Choice Group focuses on the areas of public economics, evaluation of public policy, and economic theory. This specialization was chosen for two reasons: first, governments and nonprofit institutions now occupy a primary role in our society so that an understand\u00ad ing of their behavior has become critical to understanding the economy in general; second, public economics has be\u00ad come one of the most intellectually exciting frontiers in economic analysis. The Group is composed of economists and faculty from the other social sciences who share an interest in these problems. The Group places special emphasis on research in the fol\u00ad lowing areas: public choice, political economy, public pol\u00ad icy, and organizational behavior. Graduate courses taught by members of the Group focus on positive and normative analysis of the behavior of government in formulating and implementing public policy. Theory building is em\u00ad phasized, as well as empirical studies in governmental be\u00ad havior and substantive areas of public policy. The School of Social Sciences has strengths in formal social analysis which are valuable adjuncts to economic theorizing about the public sector. Members of the Group are affiliated with two major research institutes, the Institute of Trans\u00ad portation Studies and the Public Policy Research Organiza\u00ad tion. Public policy and economics are central issues of both institutes. These research institutes provide funding for graduate students who select public policy or transportation as a specialized field. The existing academic programs in medicine and social ecology also provide intellectual sup\u00ad port for the Group. At present, there is no formal set of courses leading to a Ph. D. in economics. Rather, individual programs of di\u00ad rected study with emphasis on economic theory may be approved for selected graduate students, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science. Students contemplating application .for admission to the Social Science Ph.D. program, whose interests include economics a\u00b7nd public choice, are advised to consult with a member of the Group before filing an application.

Members of the Group are committed to studies involving the application of social sci\u00ad ence theory to the solution of social issues. The Ph.D. is granted in either Political Science or Social Science. The Group places special emphasis on recruiting students who propose to pursue research in the following areas: (a) change and structure of cultures and of social and political units; (b) power, authority, and value allocations- relating to public policy, to organization, to participation, and to relationships within and between social and political units; and (c) mathematical models and quantitative analysis of political phenomena. Faculty are currently conducting research on organizational theory and bureaucratic behavior; economic models of political behavior; mass media and society; democracy and participation; public policy; political thought; quantitative political science; foreign policy and international relations; and comparative politics with an emphasis on Europe and Latin America. Two University research institutes affiliated with the Group through joint faculty appointments- the Institute of Transportation Studies and the Public Policy Research Or\u00ad ganization- are located at the University of California, Irvine. Both sponsor theoretical and applied research on social issues. They also may provide research funding for graduate students who select public policy or transportation as a specialized field. ADMISSIONS Students are normally expected to have a grade point average above 3.0 and scores on the two parts of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Aptitude Test which total over 1, 100. Decisions on admission are strongly influ\u00ad enced by letters of recommendation and the statement of student interest. International students will be evaluated UC IRVINE - 1980-1981primarily on the basis of letters of recommendation and completed seminar or research papers, but GRE scores are required in all cases. REQUIREMENTS The following is in addition to the general School and cam\u00ad pus requirements. Each year a core program, focusing upon methodology and substantive problems of current in\u00ad terest, will be outlined for entering graduate students. Those who have not already taken college mathematics are required to take at least three quarters of approved mathematics or statistics courses. At the completion of the first year, the performance of each student is reviewed and the faculty will indicate whether the student should con\u00ad tinue in the Group. Attendance in a colloquium series also is required for all graduate students during their first two years in residence. REVIEWS AND EXAMINATIONS At the completion of the first year, a review of performance in the core program will be conducted for each student by the Group's faculty. Students ordinarily are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.5 or better. Comprehensive written examinations are required before a student can be advanced to candidacy. The level of compe\u00ad tence required in mathematics and language will be decided by the student's candidacy committee. Students may take the comprehensive examination on two occasions. Students who have not been advanced to candi\u00ad dacy at the end of nine quarters of graduate study may be disqualified for unsatisfactory academic progress. Social Relations Group John P.

White: Networks and Social Structure, Cross-Cultural Comparisons, Mathematical Anthropology, Division of Labor The Social Relations Group shares with traditional an\u00ad thropology an interest in whole systems and a willingness to consider long-as well as short-run sociocultural effects. It has a commitment to include the meaning and content of the actions, events, and phenomena it studies from the micro-to the macro-level. The Group also is concerned about similarities and differences among people living at different times and in different places. Unlike traditional anthropology, however, we have not limited our interests to small communities nor to traditional forms of data collec\u00ad tion or analysis. In addition, the program leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science with emphasis in anthropology is distinct from more traditional anthropology programs in that it includes no requirements in archaeology or physical anthropology. ADMISSIONS We welcome students from diverse educational and social backgrounds. We seek graduate students who have a desire to learn quantitative analytical methods or utilize formal procedures to solve crucial social problems and theoretical questions of current urgency. Students who have research interests corresponding to those of specific faculty mem\u00ad bers are especially encouraged to applyto this apprentice\u00ad ship-type program. They should familiarize themselves with the publications of the faculty before applying. REQUIREMENTS Students are admitted by the entire Group. New students are assigned an advisor who serves until a three-person committee is formed by the middle of the second year of residence. The committee oversees the student's academic work and ordinarily is chaired by the faculty member with whom the student plans to work most closely. Throughout their graduate careers, students are expected to attend the Social Relations Colloquium Series, a weekly research seminar for faculty and students. Two quarters of statistics, mathematics, computer science or other appro\u00ad priate analytical methods are required. Normally these will be completed during the first two years of study. REVIEWS During the first year each student will prepare an original paper under the committee's direction. The paper will be presented by the student at a meeting of the Colloquium \u00b7 Series, normally during the spring quarter of the first year. The student's committee members will provide the student with a detailed written critique of the paper as part of the first-year evaluation of the student's overall progress. The second review takes the form of an advancement\u00ad to-candidacy examination. This ordinarily is conducted by the student's committee and two additional faculty mem\u00ad bers from the campus. Students are expected to take this examination no later than the spring quarter of their third year. Satisfactory completion of the dissertation is the final re\u00ad quirement in completing the Ph.D. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981170 Social Sciences FOREIGN LANGUAGE A speaking or reading knowledge of one foreign language is required.

White: Anthropology, Social Networks and Relations, Cross-Cultural Comparison, Mathematical Models of Social Constraints, Decision-Making Networks and Social Processes Joseph L. White: Black Psychology, Community Mental Health, Child Development, and Psychotherapy The doctoral program in Comparative Culture emphasizes study centering on the cultures of the United States, includ\u00ad ing dominant and minority cultures and their antecedents. The program is designed to educate interdisciplinary intel\u00ad lectuals, teachers, and research scholars. The range of cul\u00ad tures found in America is studied on a comparative basis, with some students concentrating upon the expressive forms of culture (literature, religion, myth, and the arts) and others on culture from the perspective of social inquiry (history and the social sciences). However, all students will gain interdisciplinary training as comparative analysts in both broad areas. Finally, the program is intended to pre\u00ad pare graduate students for academic positions in interdis\u00ad ciplinary programs as well as in departments of humanities and social sciences. ADMISSIONS Requirements and standards for admission into the program are in keeping with those of the University of California as a whole. Students with a B.A. degree will be considered for admission on the basis of past academic per\u00ad formance and present academic interests. In addition to the general application material, Graduate Record Examination Aptitude Test scores are required. Applicants who are ad\u00ad mitted to the program begin their study in the fall quarter of the academic year. The deadline for applications is February 1. The program admits new graduate students only for the fall quarter of even-numbered years. RESIDENCE Although the University residence requirement for the Ph.D. is a minimum of six quarters, doctoral students in Comparative Culture must complete three years of course work (108 units). Normally, three courses (12 units) will be completed per quarter. REQUIRED AND ELECTIVE COURSES The program requires 27 courses (108 units) for the doctor\u00ad ate. Courses are selected by the academic advisor to pre\u00ad pare the student for the comprehensive first-year examina\u00ad tion, the qualifying examination, and the development of a dissertation topic. Social Sciences 270A-B and Social Sciences 273A-B are required of all first-year graduate students. In addition, each student must enroll in five ap\u00ad proved electives (20 units). Electives may be in Compara\u00ad tive Culture or other courses pertinent to the graduate program. During the second year, Social Sciences 272A-B is required of all doctoral students. For those emphasizing Social In\u00ad quiry, Social Sciences 275A-B-C also is required. Students of Expressive Forms must complete Social Sciences 276A\u00ad B-C or approved alternative courses. Each second year student must enroll in four approved electives totaling 12 additional units. During the third year, all doctoral students must enroll in Social Sciences 271A-B, topics to vary, or Social Sciences 277 A-B, topics to vary. In addition, all students must enroll in seven approved electives (28 units). All graduate students, including Teaching Assistants and Associates, are expected to enroll for a minimum of 12 units of academic credit (ordinarily, three courses) each quarter. Any student who wishes to take more than four courses (16 units) must petition\u00b7the Graduate Committee and gain ap\u00ad proval of the Dean of the Graduate Division. Incomplete grades will not be assigned for year-long -courses except in extenuating circumstances. CREDIT FOR PREVIOUS ACADEMIC WORK Students entering with an M;A. degree may request credit for a maximum of nine courses (36 units). These courses might be accepted in lieu of electives. A written petition requesting an acceptance of previous work in lieu of elec\u00ad tives should be made to the Graduate Committee after con\u00ad sultation with the academic advisor. Approval of the Dean of the Graduate Division is required. LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS One foreign language and one \"alternate skill\" are re\u00ad quired. The language will be decided upon by the student in consultation with the advisor. The language requirement must be satisfied eitlier through a standard ETS examina\u00ad tion or by another method approved by the Graduate Committee. The \"alternate skill\" may be another language, or a sequence of two courses in statistics, linguistics, or computer science, or some acceptable skill from the arts which is necessary for research. Both the language and the alternate skill must be satisfied before the qualifying exami\u00ad nation can be taken. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981COMPREHENSIVE FIRST-YEAR EXAMINATION Prior to the commencement of class work for the fall quar\u00ad ter, second-year doctoral students are administered a com\u00ad prehensive examination which covers the materials from the two proseminars offered during the first year, including reading lists provided in those seminars. An ad hoc examination committee appointed by the Chair reads the examinations. It is possible for students who fail this examination to take it a second time. A second failure re\u00ad sults in academic disqualification and no degree will be awarded. A student who passes the first or second exami\u00ad nation may be awarded the M.A. degree. On the basis of students' performance in courses and on the comprehensive examination, the program faculty will de\u00ad cide which students to invite to continue studies toward the Ph.D. degree. MASTER OF ARTS DEGREE Those doctoral students who pass the first-year com\u00ad prehensive examination but do not continue beyond that point, or those who have passed the Ph.D. Qualifying Examination, may be awarded the Master of Arts degree by (a) completing 36 units (nine courses), 24 units (six courses) of which must be in Comparative Culture and 12 units (three courses) of which are approved electives in Com\u00ad parative Culture or a related area; and (b) demonstrating proficiency in a second language or an alternate skill. THE PH.D. QUALIFYING EXAMINATION Doctoral\" students are administered two examinations, one written and one oral. The written examination is scheduled after the completion of cou\"rse work and language require\u00ad ments. The student's committee, formed by the Chait of the Graduate Committee in consultation with the student, is responsible for formulating the examination questions. The examination will be based on Program courses and electives taken by the student during the second and third years. The entire Program faculty can be called upon to submit questions for the examination, and the entire faculty will read the examinations. If the student passes the examina\u00ad tion, the student will then be advanced to the oral examina\u00ad tion. The oral examination follows successful completion of the written examination by two weeks or less and is con\u00ad ducted by a candidacy committee (normally the student's \u00b7advisory committee) appointed in the name of the Graduate Council. This committee normally consists of five members of the UC Academic Senate or persons with equivalent qualifications, and will include at least one member who does not hold a faculty appointment in Comparative Cul\u00ad ture. The committee recommends advancement to candi\u00ad dacy for the Ph.D. if the examination is successful. Students who fail the written examination may, upon peti\u00ad tion, take it a second time. Two failures result in academic disqualification. THE DISSERTATION The final requirement for the Ph.D. degree is completion of a dissertation which is approved by the doctoral committee appointed by the Graduate Council. Social Sciences 171 Master of Arts in Teaching in Comparative Culture This graduate degree program is designed primarily for those who want to pursue a career in education at the elementary, secondary, or community college level. M.A.T. students may work concurrently toward a California Teach\u00ad ing Credential, or may be experienced teachers who wish to upgrade their professional preparation. Based upon an in\u00ad terdisciplinary and comparative framework embracing the range of cultures found in the United States, the M.A.T. prepares its graduates to teach and facilitate the develop\u00ad ment of multicultural studies in several subject areas. Specifically, our M.A.T. program focuses on the study of Comparative Culture with a special concentratioq in litera\u00ad ture, history, and social sciences relating to various ethnic groups of America. These emphases will be framed by the students' interests and needs with respect to their career goals in the field of education. Since the M.A.T. and Ph.D. programs in Comparative Culture have different goals, the students in the M.A.T. program are not automatically ad\u00ad vanced to doctoral training. Students who wish to pursue the doctoral degree in the Program must apply to the Gradua:te Committee of Comparative Culture. ADMISSIONS At the present time applications for the M.A.T. program are not being accepted. RESIDENCE The minimum residence requirement for the M.A.T. is three quarters. REQUIRED AND ELECTIVE COURSES In addition to the courses which may be required for the credential, the M.A.T. program consists of at least nine courses (36 units), six of which must be at the graduate level. Outside of the required three-quarter sequence core course, Multicultural Foundations of Education, each stu\u00ad dent may establish an individualized program in consulta\u00ad tion with the M.A.T. program advisor. The student will develop and carry out an appropriate project in the teach\u00ad ing of ethnic cultures and/or minority students, and submit a report of the project demonstrating an integration of theoretical knowledge and applied skills for the approval of the thesis committee. LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT For those who are recommended to acquire proficiency in a second language or alternate skills pertinent to cultural education, additional courses may be required. COURSES IN SOCIAL SCIENCES Courses in the School do not always resembie conventional university courses either in content or in format. Students at any level are encouraged to suggest areas of individual study and may (with faculty approval) pursue any intellec\u00ad tually challenging area within the social sciences. Such UC IRVINE - 1980-1981172 Social Sciences courses may include special seminars, study projects, indi\u00ad vidual papers, or any other useful educational activity. The faculty encourages students to present evidence that they have done interesting and original work and to receive offi\u00ad cial credit for that work by enrolling in an individual study course. Such courses are numbered 198 and 199 (under\u00ad graduate) and 299 (graduate). Students from other schools are encouraged to take courses and talk with faculty within the School. In addition to the introductory courses, many of the upper-division courses are open to students without previous work in social sci\u00ad ence. Since many of the courses touch on several areas of social science, a list of major areas of concentration is nor\u00ad mally included in the description of a course. The classifica\u00ad tion terms used for this purpose are anthropology, com\u00ad parative culture, economics, geography, political science, psychology, and sociology. Most upper-division courses are arranged in modules in order to provide continuity over individual courses, to facilitate long-range planning by stu\u00ad dents, and to encourage the pursuit of interdisciplinary programs of study. Students are encouraged to take advan\u00ad tage of the module concept to acquire experience in several integrated sets of courses. It is not necessary, however, for students to take all courses listed in a module; module courses may be taken individually, as long as course prerequisites have been met. The specific courses offered in module form may vary from year to year, but the structure of the curriculum will remain stable. Ordinarily, a student can expect to find at least one module offered in each broad area each year. By observing the content area of courses and by making effective use of module sequences, a student can assemble an individual program of study in a particular discipline or in an interdis\u00ad ciplinary area. Listed below are course descriptions of some of the pro\u00ad posed courses to be offered during 1980-81. A final, com\u00ad plete listing of the courses offered will be available prior to the beginning of each quarter in 627 Social Science Tower. Students who are interested in obtaining this material may receive copies by visiting or writing to the School of Social Sciences. NOTE: Students who entered UCI before fall quarter, 1980 should refer to the 1979-80 UCI General Catalogue and previous editions for information on the course numbering and lettering system prior to fall 1980.

Lueker, Assistant Professor of Information and Computer Science Jim Meehan, Assistant Professor of Information and Computer Science Jack Sklansky, Professor of Electrical Engineering, Radiological Sciences, and Information and Computer Science Thomas A. Standish, Associate Professor of Information and Computer Science The development of the modern digital computer has made possible the solution of large-scale information processing problems in science, industry, and government. These problems include predicting the orbit of a satellite, simulat\u00ad ing the economy, keeping track of inventories, and sending mail electronically. Such problems are solved by having the computer execute a procedure\"-- a sequence of information processing operations including but not limited to arithme\u00ad tic operations, testing and comparing numbers and rep\u00ad resentations of alphabetic information, and changing the sequence of operations within the computer. Information and computer science is concerned with the development of procedures which are effective and efficient, languages suitable for stating these procedures, systems for executing procedures, and the social setting in which they are used. Information and Computer Science 185 The implications of research in the development of informa\u00ad tion processing procedures and of systems for preparing and executing these procedures extend beyond the direct applications in using the modern digital computer to solve problems ranging from bookkeeping to the control of orbit\u00ad ing satellites. Many animate and inanimate systems can be usefully viewed as information processing systems and analyzed in terms of the way they represent, store, and process information. Thus information and computer sci\u00ad ence provides a point of view, an appproach, for studying phenomena in many sciences. Computing resources available to students include interac\u00ad tive access to the systems in the campus Computing Facil\u00ad ity: a DECsystem-10, a Xerox Sigma-7, a DEC PDP-11/45, and 12 Teraks. The departmental computing laboratory equipment includes several minicomputers, a complement of peripheral devices, and one Terak. Degrees Information and Computer Science .... B.S., M.S., Ph.D. HONORS Honors at magna cum laude, summa cum laude, are awarded on the basis of grade point average and the student's performance on research. Ap\u00ad proximately 12 percent of the graduating seniors are selected for honors. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The undergraduate program in Information and Computer Science (ICS) is designed for students preparing for profes\u00ad sional careers and for students preparing for graduate study in information and computer science. It is designed to ac\u00ad quaint the student with the currently available methods of information and computer science which are useful in solv\u00ad ing problems of science, industry, and government; to pre\u00ad pare the student for the additional formal and self education required in this rapidly developing field; and to foster and UC IRVINE - 1980-1981UC IRVINE - 1980-1981extend the student's abilities to solve the kinds of problems encountered in information and computer science. The use of the computer as a problem-solving tool and the effects of its adoption on procedure and data representation are the underlying themes of the program. Students enrolled in other degree programs who are in\u00ad terested in digital computer programming will normally begin their studies with Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving I (ICS 1) and continue in the programming sequence with Programming and Problem Solving II (ICS 2) and Programming and Problem Solving III (ICS 3) as far as their interests require and their programs permit. Students who are doing, or planning to do, extensive work with numerical problems are advised to consider courses in numerical analysis. Students are advised on academic matters by faculty and staff. Advising of undergraduate students is coordinated by the departmental counselor who also provides information on vocational and counseling services available on the campus. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 13. DEPARTMENTAL REQUIREMENTS Information and Computer Science 1, 2, 2L, 3.

The 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Administration Information and Computer Science majors may enter a cooperative 3-2 program offered by the Graduate School of Administration. The special five-year program for selected students leads to both a Bachelor of Science degree in In\u00ad formation and Computer Science and a Master of Science degree in Administration. Inquiries should be directed to the Graduate School of Administration. GRADUATE PROGRAM M.S. Degree The Master of Science in Information and Computer Sci\u00ad ence is designed to provide first-level professional training jn information and computer science and related fields, and Information and Computer Science 187 basic theoretical understanding and opportunities for con\u00ad tinuing development for professional practitioners. The M.S. Program offers a core curriculum and oppor\u00ad tunities for concentration in one of three fields: Software Design and Analysis -emphasis on the analysis, design, implementation, and management of software systems, such as operating systems, translators, and information retrieval systems. Information Systems -emphasis on the analysis of infor\u00ad mation requirements in organizations and the design of sys\u00ad tems to meet those requirements. Computer System Organization- emphasis on the specifi\u00ad cation and synthesis of computer systems, particularly their organizational and hardware aspects. Admission to the program requires a baccalaureate degree, including two years of course work beyond the introduc\u00ad tory level in computer science and at least two years of college-level mathematics or equivalent work experience. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Aptitude Test is required, and the GRE Advanced Test in Computer Scfence is strongly recommended. The departmental Graduate Advisor for the M.S. program should be consulted upon entrance, and periodically there\u00ad after, for guidance in the selection of appropriate courses. The Graduate Advisor also is an important source of infor\u00ad mation about other academic matters. When the student is prepared to begin work on the thesis and is advanced to candidacy for the M.S. degree, a formal thesis committee will be appointed to supervise the thesis and to accept it on behalf of the Graduate Council. The program consists of 12 courses (48 units). Three may be upper-division undergraduate courses. If appropriate to the program, up to three graduate courses (12 units) may be accepted as transfer credit from other institutions. Three courses (12 units) are required of all students in the M.S. Program: ICS 221 (Analysis of Computer Systems) ICS 231 (Formal Analytic Techniques) ICS 245 (Introduction to Software Engineering) A thesis reporting on a major piece of technical work is required. The program is available to students who are unable to study full time because of personal or professional commitments. Ph.D. Program The program leading to the Ph.D. in Information and Com\u00ad puter Science provides an environment for the training of teachers and researchers. The program is designed for full\u00ad time study and is compatible with teaching and research assistantships. Normally a student should be able to com\u00ad plete all Ph.D. requirements within four years if the disser\u00ad tation is theoretical, or five years if it includes extensive experimentation. ADMISSION Approximately 12 to 15 students are admitted each year. Applications are evaluated on the basis of the student's prior academic record and potential for creative profes- UC IRVINE - 1980-1981188 Information and Computer Science sional contributions. Applicants are expected to have good skills in computer programming and skills in mathematics equivalent to those obtained by students who complete college-level courses in logic and set theory, analysis, linear algebra, and modern algebra or probability and statistics. Computer science undergraduate training is not required, but some familiarity with machine organization, data struc\u00ad tures, software systems, and formal models is helpful. Applicants should take both the GRE Aptitude Test and the GRE Advanced Test in Computer Science. Where feasible, personal interviews are desired, but inability to have one does not prejudice an application. Additional information on application procedures can be obtained from the Graduate Division. Further information on the Department and the graduate program can be obtained by writing to the Department. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Financial assistance is available to students in the form of teach~ng and research assistantships. Stipends vary, de\u00ad pending on the duties involved, and range from $3,000 to $5,000 for the academic year. More than half of the doctoral students in residence in 1979 received financial assistance. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PH.D. The Ph.D. degree is attained in three phases. Phase I. Breadth: The purpose of the breadth phase is to develop the student's understanding of broad areas in computer science. Understanding is certified by satisfactory performance on a written preliminary examination which examines know\u00ad ledge in five areas: 1. Architecture and Operating Systems 2. Programming Languages and Data Structures 3. Formal Methods 4. Artificial Intelligence 5. Design, Analysis, and Impact of Systems The examination is designed to test both basic knowledge and problem-solving ability. It is given twice a year, once in October and once in May. Students are required to pass the examination by the end of their second year. Phase II. Directed Research: Research under faculty direc\u00ad tion in this phase is intended to develop research skills such as use of the literature; problem identification, definition, and analysis in depth; and creative problem solving. This research may be conducted individually or with other students. Phase II concludes with an oral qualifying exami\u00ad nation conducted by a formal candidacy committee, appointed by the Dean of the Graduate Division. In this examination the student must demonstrate the essential re\u00ad search skills. Phase III. Dissertation: This phase is devoted almost ex\u00ad clusively to the dissertation. When the student has passed the formal qualifying examination and advanced to candi\u00ad dacy, a doctoral committee is appointed to supervise the dissertation and approve it on behalf of the Graduate Council. The timing and methods chosen by students and their fac\u00ad ulty advisors to develop competence in different areas are expected to vary. Typically the student and the advisors will outline a program for each area that makes use of a combi\u00ad nation of the following resources: courses, individual study, project work, directed research. Colloquium: Each student shall present a colloquium to the Department in the area of interest prior to entering the dissertation phase. Teaching Requirement: All ICS graduate students are re\u00ad quired to participate in teaching activities before being ad\u00ad vanced to candidacy. Teaching activities in summer or night school, service at other universities, etc., may be accepted as fulfillment of the requirement. Programming Competence Requirement: A computer sci\u00ad entist must be able to read and write programs in assembly, algebraic, and nonnumericallanguages.

Harvard University, Professor of Social Ecology and Vice Chancellor- Student Affairs Social Ecology 191 The Program in Social Ecology applies interdisciplinary sci\u00ad entific methods to the study of a wide range of recurring social and environmental problems. Among the issues of longstanding interest to the Program are violence in soci\u00ad ety, social influences on normal and atypical human de\u00ad velopment over the life span, and aspects of the physical environment which have an impact on human health and behavior. The curriculum is organized around three major problem areas (Environmental Analysis, Criminal Justice, Social Be\u00ad havior) rather than by traditional academic disciplines (e.g., regional planning, criminology, psychology). Borrowing the term \"ecology\" from natural scientists who study the behavior of animals in their natural habitats, the Program in Social Ecology maintains a central interest in human stress and adaptation, and a special but not exclusive interest in the study of events in the natural settings in which they occur. Social ecologists also use laboratory, questionnaire, and interview studies to study human social and environ\u00ad mental problems. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981UC IRVINE - 1980-1981The faculty of Social Ecology is multidisciplinary. It includes psychologists who have specialized in developmental, en\u00ad vironmental, community, and social psychology; sociologists; planners; public health biologists; and lawyers. While faculty members are firmly grounded in their parent disciplines and teach basic courses in them, they concentrate their efforts on teaching and research with a problem orientation. In these problem-oriented courses, they integrate concepts and perspectives of several discip\u00ad lines. This focus arises from commitment to the view that the analysis of complex societal problems requires interdis\u00ad ciplinary efforts (i.e., the joining of talents by people with different intellectual backgrounds). Another feature of in\u00ad struction in Social Ecology is the use of lecturers from the community, individuals whose academic qualifications are complemented by their experiences with practical applica\u00ad tions. For example, a judge, an architect, and a former police officer are among those who teach courses in the Program. A number of social ecologists are involved in in\u00ad terventions directed toward improving the way groups of individuals, institutions, and communities function; a number of others are involved in interventions aimed at improving the quality and control of the environment. Degrees Social Ecology ....................... B.A., M.A., Ph.D. Applied Ecology (offered jointly with the School of Biological Sciences) ........... B.A. HONORS Honors at graduation will be awarded to about 12 percent of the graduating seniors. Initial eligibility for such honors will be on the basis of grade point average. Final decisions con\u00ad cerning the awards of summa cum laude, magna cum laude, and cum laude will reflect a number of other factors, includ\u00ad ing quarters of work completed at UCI, number of graded units of course work in Social Ecology, and the quality of papers written for field study and independent study. Deci\u00ad sions about the award of honors are the responsibility of a committee chaired by the Associate Director for Under\u00ad graduate Studies. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY Social Ecology classes are oriented toward both theoretical and applied learning, so that each enhances and enlarges the other. The undergraduate program is organized around four curricular components: a Principles and Methods clus\u00ad ter and three subareas concerned broadly with problems of Environmental Analysis, Criminal Justice, and Social Be\u00ad havior. Students do not major in a particular subarea; rather, they are expected to develop a degree of compe\u00ad tence in each. Field Study An important characteristic of the undergraduate program is its field study requirement for majors. Field study is open only to Social Ecology majors. In faculty-supervised field study situations, students relate theories learned in the Social Ecology 193 classroom to actual social-environmental problems, use ac\u00ad quired skills to collect meaningful data, and test findings from controlled laboratory studies in the more complex set\u00ad tings in which significant behaviors and events actually oc\u00ad cur. The settings provided for field study include a wide range of problem-oriented institutions and agencies, e.g., Orange County Planning Department, Orange County De\u00ad partment of Mental Health, Orange County District Attor\u00ad ney's Office, California Youth Authority, Environmental Education Council. Other field study placements may be generated by faculty and students to fit their particular in\u00ad terests. Further information on field study, including in~ formation about sign-up procedures, may be obtained from the Social Ecology Counseling Office. Career Opportunities Graduates of the Program in Social Ecology bring a distinc\u00ad tive cross-disciplinary perspective to the job market. The Program provides a solid foundation for those students who seek jobs in planning departments, mental health set\u00ad tings, and a variety of community and governmental agen\u00ad cies. Many Social Ecology students find that their interdis\u00ad ciplinary training is also useful for careers in management and personnel. The Program also provides sound preparation for students who wish to apply to graduate and professional schools of law, administration, public health, social welfare, psychol\u00ad ogy, sociology, criminology, and urban planning. Further information on career opportunities and graduate school preparation can be found in the Sample Programs section on page 194. Major Subareas ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS The Environmental Analysis subarea is concerned with the impact of the physical environment on human health and behavior. Students begin with basic courses in human ecol\u00ad ogy, environmental quality, environmental psychology, and planning and public policy. Subsequent course work moves toward problem-oriented courses, enriched by on\u00ad going faculty and student research. Such course work cov\u00ad ers the effects of environmental stressors (e.g., crowding, smog, noise); the biology and politics of water pollution; the degree of compliance of different California counties with changes in environmental regulation designed to im\u00ad prove the quality of the environment; the way in which economic changes in a community affect the health and well-being of its residents; the psychological determinants of the decision to have children; and the effects of stress on health. In addition to providing basic knowledge for students in other areas, courses are relevant to professional careers in the areas of administration, environmental quality and health, environmental impact assessment, and community environmental education. Graduate and professional op\u00ad portunities related to environmental analysis include urban and regional planning, architecture, environmental psychology, ecology, and public health. Special emphasis is placed upon the roles of individual citizens and comm\u00b7u\u00ad nity organizations, both governmental and private, in maintaining and enhancing the quality of the human envi- UC IRVINE - 1980-1981194 Social Ecology ronment. Field study is done at the Orange County Plan\u00ad ning Department, the offices of private architectural firms, environmental information centers, pollution control agen\u00ad cies, and health agencies. CRIMINAL JUSTICE The Criminal Justice subarea is concerned with the social control of criminality and violence. The subarea focuses on factors that promote criminal behavior, and on the institu\u00ad tions, such as prisons and courts, that attempt to control criminality. Basic courses cover forms of criminal behavior and introduce the student to the criminal justice system. Subsequent course work is complemented by ongoing fac\u00ad ulty and student research. Thus, students learn about the prediction of individual violence; the determinants of police decisions to shoot; the relative effects of the law and of peer group norms on the use of illegal drugs; characteristics of persons and of situations which promote intervention by \"good Samaritans\" at the scene of crimes; viol\u20acnce against women; and the control of delinquency through family counseling and crisis intervention. The Criminal Justice subarea provides Social Ecology stu\u00ad dents with opportunities to examine critical issues in regard to criminal and delinquent behavior and society's reaction to crime. The course of study prepares students for careers in law enforcement and corrections, as well as for law school and other graduate programs, including criminology and sociology. Offerings examine social problems that in\u00ad volve crime, society's reactions to these problems, and as\u00ad sess the organization and operation of the criminal justice system as it now functions. Field study placements are available in police departments, prosecutor's and public de\u00ad fender's offices, probation and parole agencies, consumer affairs agencies, and the state juvenile detention system. SOCIAL BEHAVIOR The Social Behavior subarea is concerned with the relation\u00ad ship between the social environment and human behavior. The central objective is to study variations in social settings (e.g., the family, school, work place) that have implications for healthy and unhealthy development over the course of the life cycle. Students begin with basic course work in human life cycle development, social psychology, com\u00ad munity psychology, and abnormal psychology. Subsequent course work, enriched by research, examines the effects of different types of day care facilities on young children's development; psychological consequences of psycho\u00ad stimulant medication in the treatment of childhood hyper\u00ad activity; social and economic factors associated with child abuse; the impact of early work experience on adolescents' economic power, psychological and social development, and career attitudes; and the role of social support (family and friendship networks) in moderating stressful life events. Approximately 50 agencies are available for field study in this subarea, including schools, child care facilities, com\u00ad munity clinics, hospital settings, and social service agen\u00ad cies. A major objective is to give students a foundation which will enable them to work in the private or public sectors or to do graduate work in psychology, and fields related to mental health, human development, and educa\u00ad tion after graduation from UCI. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 13. SOCIAL ECOLOGY REQUIREMENTS Social Ecology 1 (Principles of Social Ecology) and 10 (Re\u00ad search Design); any three of the following introductory So\u00ad cial Ecology courses: J4 (Introduction to Criminal Justice), ES (Introduction to Environmental Quality and Health), E6 (Populations and Environments), E7 (Introduction to Plan\u00ad ning and Public Policy), or 59 (Introduction to Human Be\u00ad havior); required prerequisite courses for field study in a given subarea; Social Ecology 197 A followed by two quar\u00ad ters of field study: E197, 5197, or J197, to be elected during the junior and senior years; and five upper-division courses (those numbered 100-196) from Program in Social Ecology offerings. Planning a Program of Study As noted earlier, students who major in Social Ecology do not limit themselves to a single subarea of interest. Rather, they are encouraged to develop an appreciation of a wide array of person-environment problems. The strongest program of study also will include basic course work in at least one of the social, biological, or physical sciences. Stu\u00ad dents who enter the major as freshmen should plan to complete the required lower-division courses by the end of the junior year. Transfer students and students who declare a major in Social Ecology after entering UCI should work with the Social Ecology Counseling Office to develop a plan for meeting the requirements of the major in an orderly fashion. The Social Ecology Counseling Office is prepared to help all students in planning a program of study. Contact with this Office is important so that students will develop a broad, yet coherent, series of courses. Students who expect to pur\u00ad sue graduate study should consult also with appropriate faculty members to ensure proper preparation. SAMPLE PROGRAMS Many Social Ecology majors plan to attend graduate or pro\u00ad fessional schools. Since the appropriate undergraduate preparation will vary depending upon the student's post\u00ad graduate plans, the Program makes the following suggestions. Psychology Social Ecology offers a strong program of courses for stu\u00ad dents who are interested in careers or graduate education in psychology. Specifically, half the faculty have backgrounds in psychology and offer courses in developmental, en\u00ad vironmental, community, social, and clinical psychology. Relevant Social Ecology courses for students pursuing career paths in these areas include the following: 10, 166, 59, 511, 520, number of courses from the Schools of Social Sciences and Biological Sciences would strengthen an UC IRVINE - 1980-1981applicant's preparation for graduate work in psychology (e.g., Social Sciences 7 and 151A-B-C and Biological Sci\u00ad ences 80 and 81). Law Most law schools prefer applicants with a broad and varied undergraduate preparation over those who have concen\u00ad trated their studies heavily in a narrowly specialized topic. Consequently, Social Ecology majors who plan on a career in law should take a diversified program of courses both within the Social Ecology program and in their non-Social Ecology elective courses (e.g., political science, economics, history, and a wide-ranging selection of courses in the sci\u00ad ences and the humanities). Social Ecology courses that are relevant to a career in interested in careers in administration or man\u00ad agement in business, health care, or governmental agencies should consider selecting several of the following courses: Individuals interested in combining work in Social Ecology and a Master's degree in Administration may apply to the UCI Graduate School of Administration for admission to their 3-2 Program. Such students must have completed all of the course requirements for the B.A. degree in Social Ecology by the end of their junior year. Applications should be made early in the junior year. During the senior year, students will take courses in administration which will count toward the 180 total units needed to receive the Bachelor's degree. Upon successful completion of there\u00ad quired courses and units, usually at the conclusion of four years of undergraduate study, the B.A. degree in Social Ecology will be awarded. The M.S. degree in Administra\u00ad tion will be awarded after successful completion of all re\u00ad quirements for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. See page 223. Education Students who plan to obtain a teaching credential or a higher degree in the field of education should consult with counselors in the Office of Teacher Education early in their college careers. Students completing a B.A. in Social Ecol\u00ad ogy may qualify for a waiver of the Single Subject Creden\u00ad tial Examination. Social Ecology courses that are relevant to a career in educa\u00ad information about teaching credentials, see page 229. Urban Sociology and Criminology The program of courses for students who are interested in careers or graduate education in urban sociology or Social Ecology 195 criminology should include some of the following courses: Other relevant course work is offered in the School of Social Sciences. Urban and Regional Planning Social Ecology provides undergraduates with a broad prep\u00ad aration for careers or graduate study in planning. Relevant Social Ecology majors who are considering the possibility of graduate school in public health will want to include a number of the following courses in their 5138, 166. It should be noted that a concentration in many graduate\u00ad level specialties withiri. the field of public health requires a strong undergraduate preparation in the physical and biological sciences. Further information about appropriate preparation for these and other graduate programs may be obtained from the Social Ecology Undergraduate Counseling Office. UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR IN APPLIED ECOLOGY The Program in Social Ecology and the School of Biological Sciences offer a new program of undergraduate instruction leading to a B.A. degree in Applied Ecology. The objective is to integrate concepts of theoretical ecology and environ\u00ad mental planning and resource management into an ad\u00ad vanced educational framework. By presenting an interdis\u00ad ciplinary approach, the curriculum furnishes a strong un\u00ad dergraduate foundation for students interested in advanced study in environmental planning and resources management. An Applied Ecology major receives the basic science train\u00ad ing of a Biological Sciences major and utilizes these skills in a core of environmentally based courses taught in Social Ecology. These courses blend theoretical with applied knowledge. Social Ecology brings to this major a unique combination of courses in Environmental Quality and Health, Planning and Public Policy, and Law and Society. This combination, together with a strong biology back~ ground contributed by the School of Biological Sciences and a general science background contributed by the School of Physical Sciences, enables students selecting this major to pursue interdisciplinary learning experiences which are difficult to achieve within traditional disciplines. The first three years of the major are very structured, leav\u00ad ing the last year open for students to specialize in an area of their choice. The Applied Ecology major provides students with a com\u00ad prehensive treatment of basic ecological principles and their relevance to human needs. As an alternate pathway, UC IRVINE - 1980-1981196 Social Ecology students with an engineering perspective are encouraged to explore the program options in Environmental Engineering offered by the School of Engineering. Also, students are encouraged to explore the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology, leading to a B.S. degree in Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences, offered by the School of Biological Sciences. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree in Applied Ecology University Requirements: See page 13. APPLIED ECOLOGY REQUIREMENTS Biological Sciences 90, 101, 102, 102L, 103, 103L, 104, 104L, 105, 106, 106L, 120, either 171 or 174, and either 169 or 179; Chemistry 1A-B-C, 1LB-LC, 51A, and 51LA; 10; Physics 3A-B-C, 3LA-LB-LC; Humanities 1A-B-C, or another option of the lower-division Writing Requirement of the breadth re\u00ad quirement (Category I) and a three-quarter sequence in either Humanities or Literature (Category IV, Humanistic Social Ecology or E146; and Social Ecology 197A and two quarters of Social Ecology E197. Students must attain at least a 2.0 grade point average in required courses in Biological Sciences and Social Ecology, and a 2.0 grade point average in required upper-division courses in Biological Sciences and Social Ecology. NOTE: Students entering college prior to fall1980 may fol\u00ad \"low the Core Curriculum numbered 101A-B-C-D-E-F; 101LA-LB-LC-LE-LF. Planning a Program of Study It is important that students take the required science courses early, in order that the science background may be utilized in the Social Ecology courses. There are many re\u00ad quired courses, and the student must plan carefully. For initial academic advising, students should consult the So\u00ad cial Ecology Counseling Office (544 Engineering Building) or the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office (844 Engineering Building). Faculty academic advisors may be either Social Ecology or Biological Sciences faculty members. GRADUATE PROGRAM IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY The Program in Social Ecology offers graduate education leading to the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. Students desiring a Ph.D. should apply directly for the Ph.D. program. Only individuals interested in the M.A. as their final degree in Social Ecology should apply for admission at the Master's level. The emphasis in Social Ecology graduate study is primarily upon theory andre\u00ad search which have implications for policy and social action. Clinical training is not offered. All applicants for either the M.A. or Ph.D. should submit undergraduate transcripts, three letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Exami-nation Aptitude Test scores, and a formal application to the Graduate Division before February 1. Interested persons may call the Social Ecology Graduate Counselor, Jan Martin, (714) 833-5917, for further information. The Program in Social Ecology is organized around the study of contemporary problems in the social and physical environment, rather than having its structure dictated by the historical development of the traditional disciplines. Problems are studied from the diversified viewpoints of a multidisciplinary faculty, including specialists in commu\u00ad nity, environmental, social and developmental psychology; planning; urban sociology; law; criminology; and public health. Graduate education emphasizes this multidisci\u00ad plinary orientation rather than the focused perspective of a single discipline. Social Ecology is committed to an empirical approach to the study of social problems. Program evaluation, question\u00ad naire and survey methods, field research, naturalistic ob\u00ad servation, and quasi-experimental techniques are em\u00ad phasized as much as laboratory experimentation. A sampling of faculty research and teaching interests in\u00ad cludes, but is not limited to, human stress, economic change and behavioral disorders, \"hyperactive\" children, adolescents' social and cognitive development, juvenile de\u00ad linquency diversion programs, the prediction of violent be\u00ad havior, legal sanctions and deterrence, white collar crime, environmental legislation, psychological responses to phys\u00ad ical settings, planning and public policy, urban sociology, environmental design, population and social change, water quality, and program evaluation. Collaborative research with faculty members is an impor\u00ad tant component of graduate education in Social Ecology. Prospective graduate students should contact the Social Ecology Graduate Counselor for more detailed information concerning the current research interests of Social Ecology faculty members. M.A. Program Each incoming Master's student is assigned a faculty ad\u00ad visor with whom the student discusses an individual pro\u00ad gram of graduate education. The program leading to the M.A. degree requires a thesis and satisfactory completion of seven approved courses (28 units), including the Semi\u00ad nar in Social Ecology (200), Research Methods (201), and at least one additional approved course in statistics or methodology. Other courses should be selected with re\u00ad gard to the student's academic and career objectives, and must be approved by the faculty advisor. The seven re\u00ad quired courses must include at least five graduate courses exclusive of any directed study, independent study, or thesis courses (298, 299, or 295). One four-unit field study (297) course may be counted as one of the seven required courses. A grade of B or better must be achieved in all courses. Students are advanced to candidacy for the M.A. degree, and a thesis committee appointed, after a review of their graduate work and thesis plans by a faculty commit\u00ad tee. All M.A. students who have not advanced to candidacy will be formally evaluated by the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each academic year. At that time the faculty may recommend that the student continue toward the M.A. or cease study in the Program. Evaluation of M.A. students who have advanced to candidacy is the responsibility of the UC IRVINE - 1980-1981student's Master's thesis committee. One year of academic residence is required, but completion of all M.A. require\u00ad ments, including a thesis approved by the student's com\u00ad mittee, ordinarily takes about two years. The M.A. degree in Social Ecology may be useful in obtain-\u00b7 ing a variety of positions. Many recent M.A. graduates are now employed in federal, state, county, city, and private agencies in such areas as planning, mental health and wel\u00ad fare, and probation and parole. A number of students with the Master's degree in Social Ecology have entered Ph.D. programs at other universities. Ph.D. Program The doctoral program offers advanced training that pre\u00ad pares students for research and teaching positions. Graduates may be particularly qualified for positions with private or governmental agencies where they can bring ad\u00ad vanced academic training, insight, and expertise to bear upon such issues as environmental quality, urban plan\u00ad ning, criminal justice, and functional and dysfunctional so\u00ad cial development. Students who enter with the normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree in four to five years. Each incoming Ph.D. student will be assigned a faculty ad\u00ad visor with whom the student should meet at least once every quarter to discuss an individualized program of graduate education. Required for all Ph.D. students are: Seminar in Social Ecology (200), Research Methods (201), two approved quarters of graduate-level statistics, Program Evaluation (291), and Issues in Social Interventions (213). In addition to these six required core courses, doctoral stu\u00ad dents must also complete a minimum of six other approved graduate level courses before advancement to candidacy. These six additional required courses are exclusive of any field study, directed study, independent study, or disserta\u00ad tion research courses (297, 298, 299, or 296). All Ph.D. stu\u00ad dents who have not been advanced to candidacy will be formally evaluated by the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each year. At that time, the faculty may recommend that the student continue toward the Ph.D., complete the M.A. degree only, or cease graduate studies in the Program. Evaluation of Ph.D. students advanced to candidacy is the responsibility of the student's doctoral dissertation commit\u00ad tee. Prior to the award of the Ph.D., each doctoral student must serve as a Teaching Assistant under faculty supervi\u00ad sion for at least two quarters. All Ph.D. students are required to complete a research proj\u00ad ect before advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. The method of research may include experiments, question\u00ad naire and survey studies, systematic field observation, computer simulation, etc. It is expected that students will begin this project during their first year in residence and that it will be completed during the second year. The writ\u00ad ten report of the project may be equivalent to a Master's thesis, and may be submitted as such if the student has been advanced to candidacy for the M.A. degree. Also required for the Ph.D. degree in Social Ecology is a written review of the literature relevant to a social or en\u00ad vironmental problem or process. This paper constitutes the written portion of the qualifying examination. In meeting Social Ecology 197 this requirement the student works closely with a commit\u00ad tee of three Social Ecology faculty members. The scope and boundaries of the literature review are determined by the student in consultation with committee members. The liter\u00ad ature review paper and the doctoral dissertation often deal with closely related topics; therefore the same faculty members frequently serve on the committees responsible for guiding and approving these steps in the.doctoral program. A student may be formally advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. when the literature review paper and the student's dissertation plan have been approved by the candidacy committee appointed on behalf of the Graduate Council. The student will appear before this committee for an oral examination. The dissertation plan will include a thorough examination of the history of the problem being proposed for investigation (often, part or all of the review paper com\u00ad pleted earlier); its current status; the way in which the proposed research will further knowledge; a detailed specification of the proposed method of approach to the problem; and a description of the planned methods for analyzing research findings. Formal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. will be made by the Dean of the Graduate Division upon recom\u00ad mendation by a unanimous vote of the student's candidacy committee. Alternatively, the committee may recommend a course of action to strengthen the student for advancement to candidacy at a future date. When the student is advanced to candidacy, a doctoral committee will be appointed in the name of the Graduate Council. The doctoral committee, ordinarily consisting of three members of the faculty, will supervise the preparation and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The dissertation should be completed and accepted within one to two years, and no later than three calendar years after the student's advancement to candidacy.

Tohoku University, Lecturer in Electrical Engineering The School of Engineering offers undergraduate and graduate programs of study for men and women who will engage in the professional practice of engineering as it re\u00ad lates to design, development, research, and teaching in in\u00ad dustry, government, or a university. Programs at all levels emphasize the fundamentals underlying engineering, thus enabling the graduates to continue professional develop\u00ad ment through formal or informal study. Thus, programs of study in the School of Engineering endeavor to provide UCI graduates with adequate intellectual tools for entrance into the profession and for continued renewal of their tech\u00ad nical knowledge. At the undergraduate level a single program in Engineering is offered with options in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering, all of which are accredited by the Accredita\u00ad tion Board for Engineering and Technology (formerly the Engineers' Council for Professional Development). In addi\u00ad tion, an undergraduate double. option of Environmental Engineering in conjunction with either the Civil Engineer\u00ad ing or the Mechanical Engineering option is available. The Engineering program provides a firm background in the basic sciences through courses in physics, mathematics, and chemistry; a fundamental understanding of the en\u00ad gineering sciences through the required engineering core courses; and specialization via technical electives. The breadth requirement must be taken in the areas of Humanistic Inquiry, Social and Behavioral Sciences, and Writing. At the graduate level, programs of study become less struc\u00ad tured and specialization becomes more intense. The M.S. program requires 36 units to be completed, but the exact choice of the courses will be formulated through consulta\u00ad tion between the student and the faculty advisor. Thesis and nonthesis programs are available. At the Ph.D. level the program is still less structured but more specialized than at the M.S. level. There is no set course requirement; rather, students must demonstrate various competences as they progress toward the completion of their doctoral programs. Engineering students may join any of a number of student organizations. Most of these organizations are profession\u00ad ally oriented and have relationships to national engineering societies. A primary function of these groups is to provide regular technical and social meetings for students with common interests. Most of them also participate in the an\u00ad nual Engineering Week activities held each year in February and in other School functions. Engineering 209 Engineering student organizations are the Engineering So\u00ad ciety of UCI (ESUCI), student groups associated with the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), the Mexican-American Engineering Society (MAES), the Soci\u00ad ety of Women Engineers (SWE), the honorary engineering societies Eta Kappa Nu and Chi Epsilon Mu (Tau Beta Phi), and the Dean~s Cabinet. Composed of the various organiza\u00ad tions, the Cabinet provides a direct communication link be\u00ad tween the students and the Dean. Faculty and committee meetings (except those involving personnel considerations) are open meetings; in addition to designated student representatives, all students are en\u00ad couraged and expected to participate in the development of School policy. Student evaluation of the quality of instruc\u00ad tion is made annually. Degrees Engineering ......................... B.S., M.S., Ph.D. HONORS Undergraduate honors at graduation in the School of En\u00ad gineering are awarded on the basis of a minimum upper\u00ad division grade point average of 3.5 for work completed at UCI and service to the School, service to the University, service to the community, or achievement in research proj\u00ad ects. Approximately 1 percent of the graduating class shall be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude, with no more than 12 percent being awarded honors. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The undergraduate program leads to a B.S. degree in En\" gineering, with an option in Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or Mechanical Engineering. A double option of Environmental Engineering in conjunction with either the Civil Engineering or Mechanical Engineering option may be obtained by satisfying the appropriate double option requirements. ADMISSIONS High school students wishing to begin their engineering programs at UCI should seek admission to the Irvine cam\u00ad pus of the University of California designating Engineering as their intended major. Selected freshman applicants who are not admitted to the UCI School of Engineering due to enrollment limitations may be redirected to the University of California, Riverside for a special two-year program offered by the Riverside Physics Department. These students will be allowed to transfer into the junior class in Engineering at Irvine upon satisfactory completion of the Riverside program with at least a 2.40 grade point average. Transfer students are admitted to the School of Engineering upon completion of a lower-division program in another School at Irvine or at another college, including community UC IRVINE - 1980-1981210 Engineering colleges. Students seeking admission to the School of En\u00ad gineering from colleges and schools other than UCI must satisfy the University requirements for admission to ad\u00ad vanced standing and must have completed appropriate pre\u00ad requisites for the junior-level courses to be undertaken in the School of Engineering. Students satisfying the Community College-State College\u00ad University agreement on lower-division requirements may complete the requirements for the B.S. degree in six quarters assuming normal progress. Such students may not have taken the engineering courses shown in the freshman and sophomore years of the sample programs. Early con\u00ad sultation with the School's Undergraduate Student Affairs Office is recommended so that a smooth transition can be planned, including perhaps some summer courses. ADVISING Each student is assigned a faculty advisor. In addition, ad\u00ad vice is available from the academic counselors and the peer advisor in the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office of the School. Freshmen and sophomores will find that most of their questions can be answered by the counselors, who also approve their programs of study. Juniors and seniors must have their programs of study approved by their faculty advisors. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 13. SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS Credit for at least 180 quarter units including the following: Engineering Core: Twenty-four units- Engineering 10, SOA-B-C, and lOlA-B. Courses in Engineering and Technical Subjects other than the Core: Sixty units, of which no more than eight may be at the lower-division level (i.e., numbered below 100). The number of courses and units which are specified vary be\u00ad tween options. Courses which are not specified are la\u00ad beled \"Technical Electives\" in the table of required subjects. Technical Electives are defined as courses in engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, chemistry, or biological sciences, acceptable toward those majors. Where there is a choice, the course selection must be made in consultation with the student's faculty advisor. If none of the accredited options is followed, the entire segment of 60 units must be approved by the Undergraduate Studies Committee. Mathematics: Twenty-four units- Mathematics 2A-B-C and 3A-B-D. Basic Sciences: Twenty-four units- no less than six courses, with laboratory where appropriate, from Physics 5A-B-C-D-E, Chemistry lA-B-C, and Biological Sciences lOlE. Excess units acquired through laboratory work may be assigned to Electives (see below). It is recommended that Engineering students take more than this minimum and complete both the Physics 5 and Chemistry 1 sequences. Breadth: Thirty-six units-approved three-course clusters in (a) Humanistic Inquiry, (b) Social and Behavioral Sci\u00ad ences, and (c) Writing. At least one Writing course must be taken at the upper-division level. See pages 14-15 for the list of approved courses. Note that the remaining breadth requirements stated there are satisfied by the courses in Mathematics and Basic Sciences specified above. Electives: Any 12 units with the following exceptions- (a) physical education and (b) courses taken in preparation for the first required course in mathematics, chemistry, physics, or writing (as a breadth course). Duplication of Subject Material: Students who take courses which involve considerable duplication of subject material may not receive full graduation credit for all units thus completed. Residence Requirement: In addition to the University resi\u00ad dence requirement, at least 24 upper-division engineering units must be completed successfully at UCI. Variations: Variations from the degree requirements may be made subject to the approval of the faculty of the School. Students wishing to abrogate these requirements should submit a petition to the School of Engineering Under\u00ad graduate Student Affairs Office. Programs of Study A student who wishes to graduate from one of the accred\u00ad ited options- Civil, Electrical, or Mechanical Engineering -should select the engineering and basic science courses listed in the respective program of study. Additional infor\u00ad mation on opportunities within each option is available from faculty advisors and academ1c counselors. Students will work out suitable programs of study with their faculty advisors. Students must realize that they alone are respon\u00ad sible for the planning of their own programs and for satis\u00ad factory completion of the graduation requirements. Students may substitute courses of their choosing for those required if they can substantiate the merits of the program of study and obtain the approval of the faculty of the School. Students are cautioned about the structure of prerequisites which underlies most engineering courses. The sample programs shown here constitute preferred sequences which take into account all prerequisites. Students in the School of Engineering, in accordance with general campus policy, are permitted to take courses in areas outside their major, or outside their School, on a Pass/Not Pass basis. With respect to programs in engineer\u00ad ing, such areas are fine arts, humanities, and social sci\u00ad ences, except for courses taken in fulfillment of the UCI Writing Requirement; any course not being submitted as fulfilling the graduation requirements; and any course used as an elective. Proficiency Examinations A student may take a course by examination with the ap\u00ad proval of the faculty member in charge of the course and the Dean of the School. Normally, ability will be demon\u00ad strated by a written or oral examination; if a portion of the UC IRVINE - 1980-1981Engineering 211 PROGRAMS FOR ACCREDITED OPTIONS Programs showing required subjects and typical sequences for accredited options are shown below. (Recommended selection.) [Not required for graduation.] These programs are based on a rigid set of prerequisites, beginning with adequate preparation in high school mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Students who are not properly prepared or who wish to make changes for other reasons must have their programs approved by their advisors.

Normally, these examinations (written, oral, or laboratory) will be given at the opening of each quarter in which the specified course is offered. All courses in the School are available for such proficiency demonstrations. Double Options for Environmental Engineering A significant feature of these double options is the provi\u00ad sion for the broad interdisciplinary education necessary to deal with contemporary environmental engineering prob\u00ad lems. The student may obtain the Environmental Engineer\u00ad ing option from one of two possible paths -from either the Civil Engineering or Mechanical Engineering option -by satisfying additional course work from the Environmental Engineering core. By suitable choice of the courses taken as electives in either the Civil or Mechanical Engineering op\u00ad tion, a student may complete most of the requirements for the second option in Environmental Engineering as part of the process of meeting the basic requirements for the B.S. degree in Engineering. Specifically, the double option re\u00ad quirement can be satisfied by either of the following: CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING In addition to the requirements in the Civil Engineering option, the student must successfully complete 24 units from the following Engineering group: MEll8 (Energy: Resources and Utilization); and Reporting); ME164 (Air Pollution and Control); CE166 (Public Health Aspects Environmental Quality); CE168 (Sociopolitical Aspects of Environmental Quality); ME169 (Vibration Mass Transfer); MEll5 (Applied Engi\u00ad neering Thermodynamics). MECHANICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING In addition to the requirements in the Mechanical Engineer\u00ad ing option, the student must successfully complete 24 units from the following Engineering group: Engineering CE172 (Water Supply and and Reporting); CE173 (Water Resources and Water Quality); ME164 (Air Pollution and Control); CE166 (Public Health of Environmen\u00ad tal (Vibration and Noise Control); MEllO (Combustion). The 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Administration Outstanding UCI undergraduate engineering students may enter a cooperative 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Administration. Students in this Program will complete their first three years in the School of Engineering and the final two years jointly in the School of Engineering and the Graduate School of Administration. Successful completion of the requirements leads to a B.S. degree in Engineering and a Master's degree in Administration. Students wishing to enter the 3-2 Program should consult with both the School of Engineering and the Graduate School of Admini\u00ad stration prior to, or early in, the junior year. Undergraduate Acceleration toward the M.S. Degree in Engineering Exceptionally promising seniors may, with permission of the Undergraduate Study Committee, take graduate-level Engineering courses in addition to the undergraduate de\u00ad gree requirements. After attaining the B.S. degree and upon acceptance to\u00b7the M.S. program in Engineering, the student may petition for application of up to eight units of excess credit toward theM. S. degree. If the petition is ap\u00ad proved by the School and the Dean of the Graduate Divi\u00ad sion, the student could complete the M.S. degree in three quarters of residence as a graduate student even while serv\u00ad ing as a teaching or research assistant. GRADUATE PROGRAM Graduate study is offered leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Engineering. The graduate program has con\u00ad centrations in electrical, civil, and environmental engineer\u00ad ing, and offers study and research in related areas of mechanical engineering. The concentration in electrical en\u00ad gineering includes 'electronics, digital systems, telecom\u00ad munications, control systems, and electric energy systems. Civil engineering concentrates upon structural mechanics; transportation, planning, and urban systems; and water re\u00ad sources. Environmental engineering is an interdisciplinary concentration with a focus on water quality, air resources, noise, and environmental impact. Additional areas of instruction and research are in mechanical engineering design, mechanics, materials, and combustion. Studies in operations research can be carried out through interdisci\u00ad plinary courses offered by several academic units. Admissions For information on requirements for admission to the Graduate Division at UCI, see page 19. Admission to graduate standing in the School of Engineering is generally accorded those possessing a B.S. degree in engineering or an allied field obtained with an acceptable level of scholar\u00ad ship from an institution of recognized standing. Those seeking admission without the prerequisite scholarship\u00b7 record may, in some cases, undertake remedial work; if completed at the stipulated academic level, they will be admitted to full graduate standing. Those admitted from an allied field may be required to take supplementary upper\u00ad division courses in basic engineering subjects. The Graduate Record Examination Aptitude Test is required of all applicants. Master of Science in Engineering The M.S. degree is normally attained by one of two routes: Plan I, a thesis, or Plan II, a comprehensive examination. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981For theM. S. degree with thesis, a minimum of 36 approved units are required, of which at least 20 must be nonresearch graduate units (courses numbered 200-289). A maximum of .eight M.S. thesis research units (296) may be submitted. The M.S. thesis must demonstrate the student's capability of undertaking an original study and carrying it through to a conclusion satisfactory to at least three members of the faculty. For the M.S. degree with comprehensive examina\u00ad tion, a minimum of 36 approved units are required, of which at least 24 must be nonresearch graduate units (numbered 200-289). The detailed program of study for each M.S. student is formulated in consultation with an advisor who takes into consideration the objectives and preparation of the candidate and the specific requirements of the School. Students should acquaint themselves with core course requirements in the various concentrations of the M.S. program. The program of study must be approved by the faculty of the School. Full-time students should be able to complete the requirements for the M.S. degree in three to four quarters. PART-TIME STUDY Those students who are employed may pursue the M.S. degree on a part-time basis, carrying fewer units per quar\u00ad ter. Since prior approval of part-time programs is required and since University residence requirements necessitate the successful completion of a minimum number of units in graduate or upper-division work in each of at least three regular University quarters, the part-time student should seek the advice of the graduate student counselor in the School of Engineering. Full student fees are required of graduate students in residence regardless of the number of units taken. M.S. programs must be completed in four calendar years from the date of admission. Students taking courses in University Extension should consult the section on Transfer of Courses below. TRANSFER OF COURSES Upon petition a limited number of graduate-level courses taken through University Extension, on another campus of the University, or in another accredited university may be credited toward the M.S. degree after admission. With the exception of work undertaken in another Graduate Division of the University, transfer credit will not be applied to the minimum required units in 200-series courses. For further information, see page 23. Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering The doctoral program is tailored to the individual needs and background of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is formulated in consultation with an advisory committee which takes into consideration the objectives and preparation of the candidate. The pro\u00ad gram of study must be approved by the faculty of the School. There are no specific course requirements, but there are several milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty of the School; passage of the preliminary examination assessing the student's back\u00ad ground and potential for success in the doctoral program; satisfaction of the teaching requirements required of all doctoral students; research preparation; formal advance\u00ad ment to candidacy; completion of a significant research Engineering 213 investigation; and preparation and defense of an acceptable dissertation. The degree is granted upon the recom\u00ad mendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of the Graduate Division. For at least the final two years of the doctoral program it is expected that the student will be a full-time resident in the School. Doctoral programs must be completed in seven calendar years from the date of admis\u00ad sion. Financial aid, such as research and teaching assistant- ships, is available. 1 UNDERGRADUATE COURSES NOTE: Students who entered UCI before fall quarter, 1979 should refer to the 1978-79 UCI General Catalogue and pre\u00ad vious editions for information on the course numbering sys\u00ad tem prior to fall1979.

Rosener, Ph.D. Claremont Graduate School, Lecturer in Administration Bruce A. Samuelson, D.B.A. University of Southern California, Assistant Professor of Administration Edward 0. Thorp, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Professor of Administration The Graduate School of Administration (GSA) offers graduate professional education leading to the Master's de\u00ad gree for students planning careers in management and a Ph.D. program in Administration for those who wish to pursue a career in scholarly research. The Master's program is intended to provide managers of private and public or\u00ad ganizations with a firm foundation in the basic disciplines and the tools and techniques of management. Each student focuses upon an institutional area, such as business, governmental, educational, or health-care organizations, and may develop expertise in one or more functional specializations. Three basic premises underlie the School's philosophy of graduate education. First, there are significant phenomena and problems common to business, educational, and gov\u00ad ernmental organizations; second, a common set of disci\u00ad plines, concepts, techniques, and technologies exist which are appropriate to a wide range of organizational or schol\u00ad arly roles; third, many administrators in the future will work in more than one of the three arenas during their careers. Administration 221 The GSA program leading to the Master of Science in Ad\u00ad ministration is intended to increase the likelihood that fu\u00ad ture leaders will be able to communicate effectively and more easily from one kind of organizational unit to another, thereby providing society with versatile managers and ad\u00ad ministrators. The Ph.D. program for the field of administra\u00ad tion has academic and research objectives. General Admission Requirements April 1 is the deadline for submission of an application for the Ph.D.; applicants for the M.S. program should com\u00ad plete all phases of the application procedure by July 1. GSA also accepts applications for the M.S. program in the winter quarter. In addition to the general University of California rules governing admission to graduate study, the Graduate School of Administration normally requires the following: 1. The Graduate Management Admission Test. 2. Preparation in introductory calculus and probability and statistics. Applicants without adequate mathematical prep\u00ad aration may be admitted with the condition that they com\u00ad plete preliminary courses with a grade of B or better. Un\u00ad dergraduate courses in the social sciences (e.g., economics, political science, psychology, sociology) are strongly recommended. 3. For Ph.D. applicants, a previously prepared paper (re\u00ad search report, essay, case study) which may be indicative generally of the applicant's interests and capabilites. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981UC IRVINE - 1980-1981Evaluation of the applicant's file for admission will consist of an integrated assessment of all materials (test scores, transcripts of previous academic work, statements on ap\u00ad plication forms, and letters of recommendation). There are no arbitrary cut-off points on any of the criteria for admis\u00ad sion-rather, admission is on the basis of the total config\u00ad uration of qualifications. Requests for application material should be addressed to the Graduate Division, University of California, Irvine; Ir\u00ad vine, California 92717. Educational Objectives Regardless of the content of particular courses, it is ex\u00ad pected that all degree candidates will be exposed to and have the ability to use the following: General Knowledge. The broad context of organizations and management: the late-twentieth century (significant trends, conditions, and problems); history of science, scien\u00ad tific inquiry, and the philosophy of science; economic, polit\u00ad ical, and social analysis. Conceptual and Empirical Knowledge of Organizations. Basic concepts of management; the structure and functions of organizations, including comparative analysis and in\u00ad terorganizational relations; levels and units of decision mak\u00ad ing; individual behavior and group norms; operating envi\u00ad ronments of organizations. Specific Knowledge of Particular Arenas of Administra\u00ad tion. In-depth study of specific institutional environments for administrative practice, such as governmental, and business organizations, and other types of organizations. Mathematics and Statistics. As tools of precise reasoning, as languages which will tend more and more to dominate professional and scholarly literature, and above all, as foundations for relevant quantitative methods. Technical Bases of Management. Decision processes; oper\u00ad ations research; systems and policy analysis; budgeting and accounting techniques; personnel policies; techniques for measuring and affecting attitudes and behavior; research design and strategies. Management Information Systems. Computer technology, information sciences, and basic computer applications. General Skills. Political skills, effective management of in\u00ad terpersonal relations, leadership strategies and tactics, and competence in oral, graphic, and written expression. Professional Orientations. Identification of factors, values, and policies which might bear on successful, responsible, and intellectually honest performance of organizational roles. Recognition of the administrator's potential contribu\u00ad tions to society and of ethical and moral problems which arise from social research and the management of human enterprises. Undergraduate Course Offerings The GSA faculty offers a limited number of courses for undergraduates each year, although there is no under\u00ad graduate degree program in administration available at UCI at this time. Administration 223 Examples of these courses include Introduction to Ad\u00ad ministration, Introduction to Managerial Accounting, and Basic Quantitative Methods for Administration. Students should refer to the listings under the Graduate School of Administration in the Schedule of Classes, available each quarter from the Registrar's Office. In establishing these undergraduate course offerings, the faculty anticipated three types of students drawn to courses in administration: (1) students who wish to learn about the administration of organizations as a way of gaining ap\u00ad preciation for a significant aspect of the culture, (2) students preparing for careers in other fields that require some knowledge of administration but not a high concentration in the field, and (3) students who expect to go on to graduate work in administration and who wish early guid\u00ad ance and undergraduate work appropriate to this career objective. The 3-2 Program for Undergraduates In addition to the two-year Master's program for students who have already received a bachelor's degree from this University or another institution, outstanding UCI under\u00ad graduate students may enter a cooperative 3-2 Program with GSA and other campus units such as the School of Social Sciences, the School of Engineering, the School of Biological Sciences, the Program in Social Ecology, or the Department of Information and Computer Science. Accep\u00ad tance into the 3-2 Program constitutes advance admission to the graduate program. Such students complete their un\u00ad dergraduate major requirements by the end of the junior year. During their senior year, they take graduate courses in GSA. These courses are used to satisfy their under\u00ad graduate unit requirements, and at the same time apply toward their graduate degrees. Successful completion of the requirements in the program normally leads to the bachelor's degree in the cooperating discipline after the fourth year, and a Master of Science in Administration after the fifth year. Students contemplating entering such a program should contact the Graduate School of Adminis\u00ad tration prior to, or early in, the start of the junior year, for the purpose of program consultation. NOTE: With the exception of 3-2 students, no under\u00ad graduates will be enrolled in GSA graduate-level courses. The Master of Science in Administration The M.S. program in GSA requires a minimum of 23 quar\u00ad ter courses (92 units) with a minimum overall grade point average of 3.0 iri core and elective courses. The 23 quarter courses normally take two full academic years or their equivalent in part-time registration. No thesis is required. Students with substantial personal or professional com\u00ad mitments normally take two courses per quarter and are required to complete the M.S. degree in no more than four years. To accommodate the needs of part-time students, GSA offers a number of courses each quarter during late afternoon and evening hours. The courses in the M.S. program are divided into two groups, each group designed to achieve specific educa\u00ad tional objectives. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981224 Administration CORE COURSES The first group consists of 13 core courses and has two fundamental aims: (1) to develop skills needed to select and use effectively the appropriate means, methods, and tech\u00ad niques for diagnosing and solving organizational problems; (2) to identify the significant concepts and phenomena as\u00ad sociated with the study of complex organizations, and to bring to bear the relevant contributions of the core disci\u00ad plines or interdisciplinary sources on the analysis of or\u00ad ganizations and the administrative process. The core will consist of the following four-unit courses: Quantitative Methods for Administration; either Quantita\u00ad tive Methods for Administration (second quarter) or tics Microeconomics Managerial Finance; Organization Theories and Models; Organization Theories and Models (second quarter); Interpersonal Dynamics; Human Re\u00ad sources Utilization and Labor Relations; two quarters of one Institutional Arena (Seminar in Educational Administra\u00ad tion, or Business Administration, or Public Administration); Workshop in Administrative Problem Solving. NOTE: The Quantitative Methods courses should be taken at the earliest scheduled opportunity after admission to the GSA program. ELECTIVE COURSES The remaining course work for the M.S. degree will consist of 10 elective courses. The major emphasis in the elective courses will be on the development of specialized know\u00ad ledge relevant to particular institutions (e.g., educational, business, government, or other types of organizations), and on achieving additional depth in a discipline or inter\u00ad disciplinary area or specialized competence in the use of a particular set of technical tools and methods. These elective courses are selected by students in light of their educational and career goals and interests. SPECIALIZATION IN BUSINESS, PUBLIC, OR EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION GSA offers a variety of elective courses for those who wish to specialize in one particular organizational setting such as business, government, or education. In addition to the two required core courses called \"Institutional Arena\" (two seminars in Educational Administration, Business Ad\u00ad ministration, or Public Administration), some elective courses are offered each quarter that emphasize particular organizational settings. By a combination of these regularly offered electives, special topic seminars, individual study courses, and courses offered in other units on campus, the student may design a program with emphasis on any of the administrative arenas -business, government, or educa\u00ad tion. In addition, a student may through elective selection gain a degree of expertise in financial management, organi\u00ad zational behavior, or operations research. ADMINISTRATIVE INTERNSHIP PROGRAM To complement the academic curriculum of GSA, an Ad\u00ad ministrative Internship Program provides practical applica-tion and work experience to selected GSA Master's stu\u00ad dents. Student interns are employed in administrative posi\u00ad tions by local cooperating organizations. Course credit is available for the participants of the Internship Program through the course \"Administrative Internship Seminar.\" GSA faculty and organizational representatives as well as student interns participate in this seminar which deals with specific topics and projects encountered by the interns in their positions. SPECIAL OPPORTUNITIES Opportunities for students to take part in on-going research exist through two university-wide research units based on the Irvine campus. Through the Public Policy Research Or\u00ad ganization (PPRO) a student may participate in research on significant public policy issues. Current projects include a nationwide study of local government information systems. The Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS) conducts re\u00ad search in the areas of urban transportation policy and plan\u00ad ning, transit management and labor relations, and trans\u00ad portation system evaluation. Students interested in these areas may have an opportunity to work on an ITS project. Doctor of Philosophy in Administration Students who have completed the GSA M.S. program (or have obtained a Master's degree elsewhere in an area of administration) may be eligible for the GSA doctoral pro\u00ad gram. Requirements of the Ph.D. program include a broad knowledge of core disciplines as represented by the 13 core courses of the M.S. program. In addition, the Ph.D. student must qualify as a skilled researcher and must complete a significant exercise demonstrating these skills. Only full\u00ad time students are admitted to the doctoral program. Although there is considerable variation in the length of time beyond a Master's degree needed to complete the Ph.D., a realistic range would be three to four years. The Ph.D. program is divided into three phases: preliminary, qualification, and dissertati.on. The preliminary phase (which must be completed within five quarters) is designed to ensure that all Ph.D. students have (1) a thorough knowledge of core materials; (2) know\u00ad ledge of how to conduct research; and (3) a depth of know\u00ad ledge in a basic discipline or tool relevant to administration (e.g., operations research, behavioral science models for administration). In the qualification phase the student prepares for disserta\u00ad tion research in an area of specialization. This phase is completed when an oral qualifying examination is passed and the candidacy committee recommends advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. The dissertation phase involves a significant original re\u00ad search project which demonstrates the Ph.D. student's creativity and ability to launch and sustain a career of re\u00ad search. The dissertation attests to the scholarly objectives of any Ph.D. program. There are no foreign language requirements in the GSA Ph.D. program.

Wynne, M.A. University of Washington, Supervisor of Teacher Education (Early Childhood Education) Teacher Education programs lead to California teaching credentials as established by the Teacher Preparation and Licensing Law of 1970, known generally as the Ryan Act. It is possible for a Graduate Division student concurrently to complete the requirements for a teaching credential and to earn an advanced academic degree. This requires admission to the Teacher Education program and the graduate pro\u00ad gram in which the degree will be sought. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981UC IRVINE - 1980-1981Early in their college career students should consult with counselors in the Office of Teacher Education to work out a long range program that will lead to the teaching creden\u00ad tials. There are regular staff counselors on duty daily, and there is a peer counselor who is particularly prepared to advise undergraduates. Individual counselors are not as\u00ad signed. Each quarter it is essential that graduate students check their progress in a counseling session with Ada L. Nix, Credentials Counselor. The Credential Program There are two types of basic teaching credentials: Single Subject Instruction Credential. \"Single subject in\u00ad struction\" means the practice of assignment of teachers to specified subject matter courses, as is commonly practiced in California high schools and junior high schools. Teachers who are authorized for single subject instruction may be assigned, with their consent, to teach any subject in the authorized fields, at any grade level, but normally in a de\u00ad partmentalized secondary school. UCI is approved for this credential. Single Subject Instruction Credentials are authorized by the State of California in art, business, English/drama, English, history, homemaking, industrial arts, languages, mathema\u00ad tics, music, physical education, social science, biological science, physical science, and agriculture. Multiple Subject Instruction Credential. \"Multiple subject instruction\" means the practice of assignment of teachers to multiple subject matter instruction, as is commonly prac\u00ad ticed in California elementary schools. Teachers who are authorized for multiple subject instruction may be as\u00ad signed, with their consent, to teach in any self-contained classroom: preschool, kindergarten, and grades 1-12 inclu\u00ad sive, but normally the assignment is in the elementary school. UCI is approved for this credential. In addition, there are three other types of credentials. These are the Specialist Credential, the Services Credential, and the Designated Subjects Credential: Specialist Credential. The Specialist Credential is a creden\u00ad tial on top of a credential. It authorizes teaching in the specific specialization area at any grade level from pre\u00ad school through grade 12. In order to qualify for this creden\u00ad tial, the applicant must have a valid basic teaching creden\u00ad tial and complete a specialized program of professional preparation in an approved program. In the State of . California there are seven specialist credential categories: early childhood, bilingual/cross-cultural, mathematics, reading, agriculture, health science, and special education. For the Special Education Specialist Credential a person must complete one of five advanced specialization areas: learning handicapped, physically handicapped, severely handicapped, communication, or gifted. UCI offers prep\u00ad aration for specialist credentials in early childhood educa\u00ad tion and in the learning handicapped area of special educa\u00ad tion. UCI is also approved for the physically handicapped and the severely handicapped categories but does not offer work toward the completion of these credentials at this time. Services Credential. The Ryan Act provides for five categories of nonteaching credentials which authorize their holders to provide specific nonclassroom services to public Teacher Education 229 schools. Services credentials are issued by the State in pupil personnel services, administrative services, health services, library services, and clinical-rehabilitative services. Designated Subjects. \"Designated subjects\" means the practice of assignment of teachers to designated technical, trade, or vocational courses. UCI is not approved in this credential area. CREDENTIAL AUTHORIZATION The credentials authorized by the 1970 credential law are not determined by grade level (i.e., elementary and sec\u00ad ondary) but by the type of instructional situation (multiple or single subject). Each credential carries K-12 authoriza\u00ad tion. These credentials are awarded by the Commission for Teacher Preparation and Licensing upon recommendation of the UCI Office of Teacher Education and are required in order to teach or serve in a professional capacity in any public school in California. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THE TEACHING CREDENTIAL The minimum requirements for the teaching credential are: 1. A baccalaureate or higher degree, in an area other than professional education, from an approved institution. 2. An approved program of professional preparation. This means a sequence of education courses, including an all\u00ad day (full-time) assignment of a semester's duration in stu\u00ad dent teaching. 3. Passage of a subject matter examination or its waiver via an approved academic preparation. UCI academic programs are approved for most examination waivers. 4. Demonstration of a knowledge of the various methods of teaching reading as validated by successful completion of a program of study. 5. A course or an examination dealing with the U.S. Con\u00ad stitution. 6. A fifth year of study is still required, even though a student may elect to start or complete the approved pro\u00ad gram of professional preparation as an undergraduate. Completion of the approved program as an undergraduate at UCI with a grade point average of 3.0 will support admis\u00ad sion to the Graduate Division (in UCI Teacher Education) for completion of the fifth year requirement. The UCI Teacher Education program defines the fifth year as 45 quarter units of upper-division or graduate-level work taken after the bachelor's degree is granted. In each in\u00ad stance the fifth year will consist of a controlled program individually determined, based upon the assessed needs of the student as determined by the student, the Office of Teacher Education, and where applicable, the hiring school district. PASSAGE OF.A SUBJECT MATTER EXAMINATION Single Subject Examinations. California requires all stu\u00ad dents to pass the National Teachers Examination (NTE) in the area of their teaching major except as a particular in\u00ad stitution has developed an approved major which waives the NTE. All UCI academic majors which are commonly UC IRVINE - 1980-1981230 Teacher Education taught in the public schools have been waived in lieu of the National Teachers Examination. However, in some majors there are certain requirements that a student must complete while fulfilling the major in order to receive this waiver. Students should consult a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for detailed information. Supplementary Authorization. Teaching minors by that name no longer exist, but it is possible to add further teach\u00ad ing authorizations beyond the single subject major. Stu\u00ad dents deciding to be credentialed in more than one subject area may qualify to do so in either of two ways: 1. Students may complete 30 quarter units (15 quarter units if they are upper-division) in collegiate-level course work to be used to develop a supplementary authorization to teach in areas differing from the single subject major. Consult a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for specifics. 2. Students may pass the National Teachers Examination in any area of their choice and thus qualify for the supplemen\u00ad tary authorization in that subject. Multiple Subject Examinations. A general subject matter examination authorizing teaching multiple subjects in\u00ad cludes an examination of the candidate's knowledge of the following areas: English, social science, fine arts, science, and mathematics. The UCI program for the Multiple .Sub\u00ad ject Teaching Credential is approved for waiver of the examination. Multiple and Single Subject Credentials Multiple and Single Subject Credentials are of three types: The Preliminary Credential. The preliminary credential is awarded by the State upon completion of the approved program. This can be done in the undergraduate program and is contingent upon possession of the baccalaureate de\u00ad gree. Before the recommendation for the preliminary cre\u00ad dential can be made, the student must have completed (or demonstrate equivalent credit) for the Multiple Subject In\u00ad struction Credential: Education 105A, 105LA, llOA-B; for Instruction Credential: Education 101, 102, 105B, 105LB. The Clear Credential. The clear credential cannot be awarded by the State until the completion of (a) a bacca\u00ad laureate degree, (b) an approved program, and (c) a fifth year. The Life Credential. The life credential cannot be awarded by the State until the completion of all requirements for the Clear Credential plus a certain number of years teaching in California public schools. The Approved Program of Professional Preparation This program refers to education courses required for the State teaching credential. UCI defines the approved pro\u00ad gram as consisting of 19 quarter units, plus student teach\u00ad ing. Six quarter units of this instruction are required to be in the teaching of reading. The professional preparation will contribute effectively to the experience, performance, and excellence of the candi-dates. The understandings and competencies in each of the required courses are attained through the provision of a wide variety of experiences designed to be most effective in providing the competency. MULTIPLE SUBJECT INSTRUCTION CREDENTIAL PROGRAM PROGRAM Education 101~, Education 102.-the students et'U'OU\\in the 174; Ediucatkm 3~0A\"'\u00b7CP-E. One of the above patterns will prevail for all candidates. The primary option will be the status of the candidate (undergraduate or graduate) at entry. The programs are planned for inclusion in the undergraduate degree pro\u00ad gram, but can all be completed in the fifth year. Field experience, including student teaching, is offered in the reg\u00ad ular four-year undergraduate program. UC Irvine is committed to the concept that the student should have a broad range of experiences in the schools and community as a part of any kind of college education. This is true not only in the area of Teacher Education but is a concept shared by most other academic units on the campus. Thus, the field experience is relatively easy to achieve for the student preparing to be a teacher. It should be started in the freshman or sophomore year. The Irvine Teacher Education Program suggests two field experiences prior to entering into student teaching. One such program might be becoming a tutor during the freshman or sophomore year and a teacher's aide in the junior year. There are numerous options for this field experience. Each field experience program is a cooperative arrangement between the University and the public school districts to help provide UCI students with experience that will pre\u00ad pare them for their future work as teachers. The field ex\u00ad perience can come from any one of several academic areas in which students work in public schools under supervision of an experienced teacher in the school and with a Univer\u00ad sity supervisor. As a tutor, the college student will usually work with the public school student on a one-to-one basis. As a teacher's aide, the student will work for a block of time per week for a quarter with a teacher in the classroom. During this time students will be given a variety of oppor\u00ad tunities to help the experienced teacher enrich the course of study and to participate within the classroom. Ultimately it is in the classroom where the problems of teaching are either solved or ignored; hence here is where teacher prep\u00ad aration begins. This experience will assist the UCI student in making a more realistic vocational choice. It will also involve the public school in the selection of future student teachers. Early in the junior year, when it is not too late for the UCI student to change a vocational choice without undue hard\u00ad shipJ the University and the student should be in a position to make certain decisions as to whether to continue in the educational sequence. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981An additional field experience of one unit value will be required of all students in Education 174, and this involve\u00ad ment must be in multicultural areas. FIFTH YEAR REQUIREMENT Regardless of courses completed prior to the bachelor's de\u00ad gree, students must complete a fifth year to obtain a clear teaching credential. In addition to the approved program listed above for the Multiple or Single Subject Instruction Credentials, the fifth year must include the following: 1. Completion of 45 quarter units 2. Completion of the following courses: a. Education 162, Psychology and Education of the Ex\u00ad ceptional Child b. Education 360, Synthesis of the Professional Com\u00ad mitment c. Education 380, Health Education for Teachers PROVISION FOR A STUDENT TEACHING EXPERIENCE Multiple Subject Instruction candidates will be assigned in grades K-8. The assignment will be split to include two levels within this range. Single Subject Instruction candidates will be assigned in grades 7-12. The assignment will be split to include two levels within this range. The student teaching situation requires the student to be in the school the full day the same as the regular teacher, including faculty meetings, parent conferences, and spon\u00ad sorship of events for a full semester's duration. It is a joint responsibility of UCI and the school districts to guarantee that each student will have student teaching ex\u00ad perience in a multicultural or cross-cultural situation. There is no concurrent course work required of student teachers in addition to the student teaching. A weekly seminar is held as a part of the total student teaching program. INTERN TEACHING CREDENTIAL PROGRAM Through the intern program, a student may earn a stipend for one year of teaching while completing either the multi\u00ad ple or single subject credential. To hold an intern teaching credential in a school district, the student must be enrolled in the graduate program. Teacher candidates are selected by participating schools and the University based on the background and experience of the teacher candidate, the needs of the particular school, and the candidate's eligibil\u00ad ity for the University's graduate program. The stipend is paid by the school district. The number of internships var\u00ad ies from year to year. For further information see the intern secretary in the Office of Teacher Education. Basic Information 1. Requirements for the candidate's admission to the pro\u00ad gram of teacher preparation are based on a broad index: Academic Achievement. A 3.0 overall grade point average is required for admission. Education on this campus prior to Teacher Education 231 the Ryan Act has been a fifth year program only. The new law requires that the student teaching program be open to undergraduate students. A program has been worked out with .that in mind. But a fifth year program is still a part of the Ryan Act, and admission to the Graduate Division for the fifth year program requires a 3.0 overall average and completion of a bachelor's degree at the University of California or another institution of high standing. Absence of Criminal Conviction that Would Preclude the Issuance of a Credential. At the time of admission to the program, a statement is issued concerning criminal convic\u00ad tion and obtaining a teaching credential. The document is clear and concise. There is a difference between being charged and being convicted. A fingerprint checking sys\u00ad tem is required by the State. Interview. An interview committee has been set up that is available to meet with prospective students. All admitted to the program will have gone through a personal interview with a member or members of the committee. Written Recommendations. Three letters of recommenda\u00ad tion for admission are required. These recommendations are concerned with the student's ability to do graduate-level work and are not necessarily character references. These are the same kinds of letters that are required for entrance to any other campus graduate program. Admission. Both the UCI academic department corres\u00ad ponding to the student's academic major and the Office of Teacher Education must recommend the admission of applicants for the Single Subject Instruction Credential. The applicant's record is reviewed first by the academic department and then by the Admissions Committee of the Office of Teacher Education. Prior Experience with Children and Youth Groups. Prior to acceptance of a student into student teaching, the student will be required to have had two quarters of experience elsewhere. 2. The approved program should be completed in its en\u00ad tirety at UCI, although equivalent course work taken elsewhere may be considered. Education courses taken at UCI prior to fall1974 are not acceptable in the new program. Students who have previously completed such courses should consult a credential counselor. Any deviation must be cleared with a counselor. 3. For the Multiple Subject Instruction Credential, Educa\u00ad tion 105A, 105LA, llOA-B, 173, and 174 must be finished prior to student teaching. 4. For the Single Subject Instruction Credential, Education 101, 102, 105B, 105LB, 173, and 174 must be finished prior to student teaching. 5. Twenty quarter units of student teaching are defined as a full day, five days per week, for 18 weeks in the appropriate classroom training environment. Evaluation will be based on performance, excellence in instruction, and professional maturity. These factors will be assessed through a rigorous evaluation by the resident teacher, the supervising teacher, and the candidate. If competence cannot be reached by the conclusion of the student teaching program, the student will have failed to qualify for recommendation for credential certification by UCI. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981232 Teacher Education 6. Candidates desiring both Single and Multiple Subject Credentials may apply the basic professional courses of Education 105A, 105LA, 173, 174, 360, and 380 toward both credentials, but must complete Education 101, 102, llOA-B, do student teaching in both areas, and demonstrate compe\u00ad tence by passing appropriate State-mandated subject field examinations where needed. 7. Student Teaching Clearances: A student must apply for a student teaching assignment the quarter before student teaching. Students are to consult the Office of Teacher Edu\u00ad cation for appropriate information. Clearances will be processed by the Office of Teacher Edu\u00ad cation and are contingent upon current health clearance and academic clearance. 8. Under the present program a student can be authorized to teach in California prior to the completion of the fifth year. A student can be granted a preliminary credential upon completion of the B.A., the professional education sequence, a course in the teaching of reading, student teaching, and where necessary, by passing the National Teacher Examination as required by the Ryan Act. Contact the Office of Teacher Education for information on the Na\u00ad tional Teacher Examinations. 9. The \"fifth year\" must be completed within five years after the preliminary credential is issued. 10. Commission-administered examinations for subject matter credential approval exist in most areas. The examination for the Multiple Subject Credential is the General Education Section of the Common Examinations of the National Teacher Examinations. The examination can be taken as often as necessary but should not be taken prior to the junior year. The General Education Section of the Common Examinations will cover the areas of Written Composition/English; Social Science/Fine Arts; and Mathematics/Science. Multiple Subject Instruction Credential Requirements in Academic Areas for Waiver of Examination 1. Of the student's total undergraduate program, 128 quar\u00ad ter hours are required to be divided as follows: Nine courses (36 quarter units) in two of the following areas and seven courses (28 quarter units) in the other two: a. English (including grammar, literature, composition, and speech) b. Social science and history (must have courses in each) c. Mathematics and science (must have courses in each with a minimum of three in mathematics) d. Fine arts, foreign language, and philosophy 2. Since on the UCI campus the academic major will nor\u00ad mally fulfill one of the four areas above and the UCI breadth requirement applies to the others, meeting the four re\u00ad quirements is not particularly difficult if planned early in the student's career. Bilingual/Cross Cultural Emphasis The Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis. The Bilingual/ Cross-Cultural Emphasis is a specialization in addition to a regular teaching credential. This means that a candidate must fulfill all the necessary requirements for a regular State teaching credential whether this be with a single sub\u00ad ject orientation for high school or a multiple subject orienta\u00ad tion for elementary school. The Irvine program is limited to the development of a bilingual capacity in Spanish only as the second language. At UCI the Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a B.A. with a Bilingualism and English as a Second Language emphasis. By acquiring this undergraduate major, the stu\u00ad dent will complete a significant part of the specific require\u00ad ments for.a Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis. This is the best kind of preparation for going into the program leading to a Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis. Specialist Credentials Early Childhood Education Specialist Credential. The Early Childhood Education Specialist Credential is a specialization on top of a regular Multiple Subject Instruc\u00ad tion Credential. If the student can complete all the work, the student can obtain a preliminary teaching credential and an Early Childhood Specialist Credential with the B.A., but it is not likely. In nearly every instance it will be ob\u00ad tained as a result of the fifth year program. Special Education Specialist Credentials. UCI is approved for three areas of the Special Education Specialist Creden\u00ad tial: Learning Handicapped; Physically Handicapped; and Severely Handicapped. Much of the work for the learning handicapped credential can be completed in the under\u00ad graduate years, thus allowing concurrent work between the basic teaching credential and the specialist credential. Services Credentials The Pupil Personnel Services Credential and the Adminis\u00ad trative Services Credential are approved programs at UCI. Both credentials are effective for grades K-12. At UCI the Pupil Personnel Services Credential requires a basic teach\u00ad ing credential or a master's degree. The master's degree is a prerequisite to securing the Administrative Services Credential.

FACILITIES The basic medical science instructional programs are lo\u00ad cated in modern, well-equipped buildings on the Irvine campus. These buildings also house the College of Medi\u00ad cine administration and many of the research laboratories and classrooms. In addition, facilities on the Irvine campus include two amphitheater-style lecture halls, the Medical Sciences Library, and a student lounge/activity center. The UCI Clinical Services System is comprised of the UCI Medical Center, two community clinics in areas of need within Orange County, and several affiliated hospitals and clinics in Orange County, in southern Los Angeles County, and in outlying areas. Its goal is to serve the community while also maintaining an environment of quality medical education and research. The UCI Medical Center provides a full range of medical and mental health experiences to med\u00ad ical students and residents, while the community clinics concentrate on the primary care specialties and the affiliated institutions provide clinical training in specific specialties. Plans are being formulated for an on-campus ambulatory care clinic which will provide primary care services to the Irvine area and specialty services to a large geographic area. UCI Medical Center The University of California Irvine Medical Center (UCIMC), located in the City of Orange, is a 493-bed com\u00ad prehensive medical care center and is the principal clinical facility of the College of Medicine operated by the Univer\u00ad sity. A $15 million renovation project, currently underway, will further enhance the Center's patient care capabilities. The medical faculty of the College of Medicine, together UC IRVINE - 1980-1981with the medical resident staff, provides the professional care at the Center. The following services are provided at the Center: medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, family medicine, pathology, radiol\u00ad ogy, physical medicine and rehabilitation, ophthalmology, neurology, anesthesiology, and dentistry. The Center also has cardiac, pediatric, neonatal, respiratory, burn, and gen\u00ad eral intensive care units. In spring 1980, UCIMC was desig\u00ad nated by the County of Orange as a trauma center. Community Clinics Two University-operated clinics are located in Orange County. The Community Clinic of Orange County (CCOC), located in the city of Santa Ana, is the home of the Department of Family Medicine residency program. The Clinic provides comprehensive care for 35,000 outpatients annually. The North Orange County Community Clinic (NOCCC) opened in the summer 9f 1979. It is located in the City of Anaheim. The affiliated Clinica Sierra Vista, in Lamont, California provides an educational experience in rural medicine. Affiliated Hospitals Additional major teaching and research programs of the College of Medicine are conducted at the Veterans Ad\u00ad ministration Medical Center, Long Beach, and at Memorial Hospital Medical Center, Long Beach.

Applications may be submitted at any time between June 1 and November 15 of the year preceding that for which ad\u00ad mission is requested. No application for admission will be accepted which does not clearly indicate that all the required subjects will have been completed by the date of anticipated entrance. Tenta\u00ad tive acceptance may be given, but final acceptance is con\u00ad tingent upon actual evidence of satisfactory completion of courses. Failure to meet this requirement or falsification of information will be grounds for rejection or dismissal. Applicants may expect to receive notification of acceptance or rejection any time from November until the beginning of the fall term. A list of alternates is maintained for possible appointment if a vacancy occurs in the class for a given year. No other notifications regarding the status of an ap\u00ad plication should be anticipated. Recommended Acceptance Procedures of the Association of American Medical Colleges These acceptance procedures have been approved by the Executive Council of the Association of American Medical Colleges upon recommendation of the Committee on Re\u00ad search and Education. Both applicants and schools are re\u00ad sponsible for abiding by their spirit. 1. No offer of admission to medical school should be made to an applicant more than one year before entering the course of instruction offered by the medical school. 1 2. When offers are made to applicants, the students are required to file a statement of intent within two weeks of the receipt of the offer. The statement of intent leaves the student free to withdraw if accepted by a preferred school up until the time of actual registration. 3. Each medical school should prepare and distribute to applicants and college advisors a detailed schedule of its application and acceptance procedures and should adhere to this schedule unless it is publicly amended. 4. No medical school should use any device which implies that acceptance of its offer creates a moral obligation to enroll at that school. Applicants are free to deal with other schools and accept an offer from one of them even if a deposit has been paid and must be forfeited. Under all cir\u00ad cumstances every accepted applicant does retain an obliga\u00ad tion to notify a school promptly if the decision should be not to accept the offer, and to withdraw at once after accept\u00ad ing an offer from another school. 5. Each school is free to make appropriate rules for dealing with accepted candidates who without adequate explana\u00ad tion hold one or more places in other schools. These rules should recognize the problems of the student who has mul\u00ad tiple offers, and also of those applicants who have not yet been accepted. 'Under special circumstances a school may make an offer more than one year before the expected entrance date to encourage the educational development of the student, but all such offers should state explicitly that the student is completely free to apply to other schools at the usual time. No candidate for admission will be considered who has been dismissed from any college, university, or other pro\u00ad fessional school. If the applicant has attended another pro\u00ad fessional school, complete, official transcripts and a letter of honorable withdrawal from that school must be submitted. Notice of Acceptance The Dean of the College will notify the candidate of accept\u00ad ance or rejection as soon as the application has received final action by the Admissions Committee. Accepted applicants must return a written statement of their accept\u00ad ance of the College's offer within two weeks after receipt of the notice of acceptance. No advance deposit to hold a posi\u00ad tion in the class is required of applicants. The statement of intent to register leaves the student free to withdraw if ac\u00ad cepted by a preferred school. This is in keeping with the recommendations of the Association of American Medical Colleges. Information regarding registration, rules and regulations, grading procedures, requirements for academic advance\u00ad ment, and other facts will be provided to students in the student handbook. Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education The College of Medicine participates in the student ex\u00ad change program of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, under which qualified legal residents of Western states without medical schools are considered along with California residents, and these states of origin reimburse the State of California for the costs of their edu\u00ad cation.

Applications can be made up to March 15 of the year in which admission is sought. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE M.D. DEGREE Each medical student must satisfactorily complete the re\u00ad quired basic medical sciences, preclinical sciences, and clin\u00ad ical sciences courses of instruction, as well as acceptable electives. Passage of Part I and Part II of the National Boards is required at designated points in the curriculum for pro\u00ad motion to the next academic level. Upon recommendation of the faculty and with the Dean's concurrence, the student is awarded the M.D. degree. MEDICAL CURRICULUM The M.D. curriculum requires four years to complete. With permission, exceptionally qualified students may shorten their completion time. Conversely, if special needs are iden\u00ad tified the time may be extended to five years. This latter option is advantageous to those students who wish to pur\u00ad sue an M.D,/Ph.D. program, to those who feel they have educational deficiencies, or to those who have other impel\u00ad ling demands on their time. The instructional year is divided into quintiles (fifths) of 9-11 weeks each, arid the program is composed of 17 in\u00ad structional quintiles. The instructional quintiles and courses of study are grouped as follows: Basic Medical Sciences (Quintiles 1-5) Gross Anatomy; Embryology; Histology; Neuroanatomy The language of medicine is taught by studies of gross human anatomy, human neuroanatomy, embryology, and normal microscopic anatomy. Gross anatomy is taught through a regional approach with heavy emphasis on laboratory dissection augmented by lectures, demonstra\u00ad tions (radiographic films), and teaching aids. Neuro\u00ad anatomy is functionally oriented and emphasizes both laboratory and lecture material. Microscopic anatomy is designed to provide students with knowledge of cellular morphology and function in preparation for studies in pathology. All courses in anatomy are given a clinical orientation. Biochemistry The fundamentals of classical and molecular biochemistry are covered, including the structure, function, and biosyn\u00ad thesis of macromolecules and metabolic interrelations. The molecular mechanisms responsible for regulation at the transcriptional, translational, post-translational, and en\u00ad zymatic levels are ,emphasized. Behavioral Sciences I and II The ultimate goal of the curriculum is for the student to learn the behavioral aspects of medicine as they apply to general medical and surgical practice .. The areas covered are Medicine 247 the basic science of neurobiology, somato-psychic issues, interpersonal (doctor-patient) relationships, and psycho\u00ad pathology. Behavioral Sciences I covers normal human de\u00ad velopment, the basics of the doctor-patient relationship, basic interviewing techniques, and behavioral neuro\u00ad anatomy and neurochemistry. Behavioral Sciences II covers human sexuality, psychopathology, alcoholism, and drug abuse. It also covers psychosocial aspects of medical and surgical disease. The courses consist of readings, lec\u00ad tures, and small group discussions. Students also have their first exposure to patients and learn the basics of the interview. In Behavioral Sciences I the emphasis is on in\u00ad terviewing \"normal\" people; in Behavioral Sciences II the student learns how to assess pathology. Physiology The course consists of lecture, tutorial, and audio-visual presentations of the classical concepts of vertebrate physiology, with emphasis on man and on the relationship between function of normal tissues arid the process of dis\u00ad ease. Specific topics related to neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, exercise, and temperature regulation are presented. Microbiology This course deals with the biochemical and genetic proper\u00ad ties of infectious agents, activities of toxins, chemotherapy, and the biochemistry and genetics of antibiotic resistance. A considerable portion of the course deals with the humoral and celh.ilar basis of immunity and the genetic control of the immune response. The course also includes an in-depth study of the biology of parasites and the structure and activ\u00ad ity of viruses. Community and Environmental Medicine . This course consists of six main segments: biostatistics, epidemiology, nutrition, social medicine, legal medicine, and environmental and occupational medicine. The primary segment, epidemiology, is presented in formal lectures and laboratory sessions. Methods are given for evaluating the distribution and possible causation of acute and chronic diseases, including infections and noninfec\u00ad tious diseases, in human populations. Preclinical Sciences (Quintiles 6-8) Pharmacology The preclinical course in pharmacology deals with drugs of various classifications that are used for specific or sympto\u00ad matic therapies of disease states. Emphasis is on the mechanisms of action of drugs at the organ or system level and on their use in medical therapy. This course includes lectures and laboratory demonstrations that illustrate pharmacologic principles, supplemented by small group discussion sessions. Pathology Theoretical aspects of pathological processes are presented to provide an orientation to disease mechanisms which are correlated with practical laboratory work. Disease is pre\u00ad sented as a dynamic process that affects the organism at molecular, cellular, tissue, and organ levels. Examination of Patient Basic instruction and experience are offered in the elements of physical diagnosis and patient interviews. UC IRVINE - 1980-1981UC IRVINE - 1980-1981Mechanisms of Disease An organ system approach is utilized in presenting the basic mechanisms and manifestations of disease. Introduction to Medicine This course introduces the student to history taking and ward procedures through the case approach. Introduction to Surgery In order to attain the maximum benefit from the basic surgi\u00ad cal course, students are oriented to the method, approach, and history of surgery and to specific surgical problems. Clinical Sciences ( Quintiles 9-17) The clinical experience is composed of clerkship rotations, with a specific allotment of time emphasizing primary care and continuity of care. Sequencing of clerkships is deter\u00ad mined by the Office of Admissions and Records. One and one-half quintiles are undesignated, and students may take electives that suit their particular interests, needs, and goals. These courses must be approved by the student's advisor and the Office of Admissions and Records and, by petition, may be taken at institutions other than UCI. Anesthesiology During the anesthesiology clerkship, students receive in\u00ad struction in the basic principles of general and regional anesthesia, including the pharmacology of anesthetic drugs, basic respiratory and cardiovascular physiology, airway management, preoperative evaluation of patients, surgical anesthesia, fluid balance, hazards of anesthesia, postanesthesia recovery care, resuscitation, and the man\u00ad agement of respiratory emergencies and comatose states. Students gain familiarity with the technical aspects of anes\u00ad thesia by spending a portion of each day in the operating room and by participating in supervised \"hands on\" patient care. Theoretical aspects of the specialty are covered in daily tutorial sessions with the faculty, and students attend departmental clinical conferences which are devoted to presentation and discussion of interesting cases and com\u00ad plications. Special rotations through the Long Beach Veter\u00ad ans Administration Medical Center Special Intensive Care Unit are offered but must be arranged through the depart\u00ad ment chair; the student must have at least one week on clinical anesthesia as a prerequisite. Medicine Students are taught the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic approach to commonly encountered medical illnesses with the intent that, in addition to scientific as\u00ad pects of medical diagnosis and therapy, they will develop an appreciation for the importance of psychosocial\u00ad economic factors in the care of the patient. Experience is provided with common medical procedures such as lumbar puncture, insertion of catheters, and thoracentesis. The student is expected to assume increasing responsibility for hospitalized patients and to develop an approach to patients' problems which includes reference to the appro\u00ad priate medical literature. Neurosciences A combined effort of neurology and neurosurgery, the clin\u00ad ical neurosciences clerkship emphasizes the development of student skills in neurological examination as well as the Medicine 249 medical and surgical management of patients with brain, nerve, and muscle disease. Obstetrics and Gynecology During this clerkship students are taught the scientific basis of gynecology and obstetrics, including reproductive physiology, anatomy, fetal physiology, and pathology. Practical experience is offered in the management of normal and abnormal pregnancy and delivery. Instruction is given in office and surgical gynecology. Students who have com\u00ad pleted an introductory clerkship may then apply for an ad\u00ad vanced elective that allows a progression of clinical respon\u00ad sibility both in operative obstetrics and office. gynecology. This advanced period also may be devoted to an in-depth study of a subspecialty area such as gynecologic oncology, maternal-fetal medicine, reproductive endocrinology and infertility, or human sexuality. Ophthalmology Medical students are instructed in basic techniques of oph\u00ad thalmalogic examination, the principles of ophthalmology, and the common sense evaluation of ophthalmic problems. Pediatrics and Human Development This includes instruction in the management and nutrition of normal and sick infants and children; relationships with parents and other family members; normal development of the baby into childhood and adolescence; diagnosis of de\u00ad velopmental defects; general approaches to treatment and rehabilitation; common infections predominant in infancy and childhood; and peculiarities of the effects of medication in children. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation During the physical medicine and rehabilitation rotation, students are assigned patients who are in an active rehabili\u00ad tation program. Emphasis is placed on the rehabilitation of the total patient. The medical aspects of the patient's care are discussed in detail. Instruction is provided in the vari\u00ad ous physical techniques of rehabilitation and in the psycho\u00ad social factors which permanently affect this process. Primary Care This clerkship provides didactic and practical education in comprehensive and continuing patient care. Students may choose to participate in clinics supervised by Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, or Pediatrics. Students will work with patients who will identify with them (and their preceptors) as their primary care physician. Psychiatry The eight-week clinical clerkship is the culmination of the process of learning human behavior as it relates to general medicine. The student elects two four-week clinical rota\u00ad tions as sub-internships, participating fully in patient care, clinical teaching, and conferences. Choices include adult inpatient psychiatry, alcoholism, child psychiatry, consulta\u00ad tion psychiatry, and emergency room psychiatry. A wide variety of clinical settings and patient populations is available. Radiology The role of radiological sciences (diagnostic and therapeu\u00ad tic) in relation to medicine and surgery is taught through attendance at daily clinical/film conferences, exposure to the film learning laboratory, and small group tutorials in each subspecialty. Emphasis is given to understanding the UC IRVINE - 1980-1981250 Medicine risk/benefit ratios involved in the use of ionizing radiation for diagnosis and treatment, and the clinical indications for any given radiological procedure. Surgery Students study both outpatients (including those in the emergency room) and inpatients. This clerkship empha\u00ad sizes diagnosis, pathophysiology, and general approaches to the treatment of surgical patients, including the special problems of mass casualties. The student becomes an integ\u00ad ral part of the surgical team. Pathology This is an elective opportunity for the study of anatomical pathology, surgical pathology, clinical laboratory pathol\u00ad ogy, and forensic pathology in a clinical setting. Interac\u00ad tions among pathology, tumor immunology, dermato\u00ad pathology, cytology, neuropathology, medical jurispru\u00ad dence, and forensic pathology are demonstrated.

Before recommendation for candidacy, each student, upon completion of most course requirements, especially Phar\u00ad macology 248A-B, will take a written qualifying examina\u00ad tion set by the staff of the Department to determine the student's competence in pharmacology or pharmacology and toxicology. The full-time student is expected to pass the written qualifying examination by the eighth quarter and the oral qualifying examination by the eleventh quar\u00ad ter. The research work upon which the dissertation will be based should begin before the tenth quarter and all re\u00ad quirements for the Ph.D. degree completed within four to five years following the bachelor's degree. Extension of time requirements will be considered by formal petition to the student's doctoral committee. Provisions for other than full-time students may be made on an individual basis. Upon completion of the dissertation, the student will take an oral examination to defend the dissertation which will be open to the public and conducted by the student's doctoral committee. Residency requirements are those established by the University. GRADUATE COURSES IN PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY 241A-B Medical Pharmacology (3-3) F, W Lecture and laboratory, eight hours.

Physiology Graduate instruction and research in physiology and biophysics leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences is offered by the Department of Physiology, College of Medicine. The Department provides research opportunities in the molecular biophysics of membranes and proteins; endocrinology; cellular physiology; and the physiology of exercise, respiration, and the nervous system. The faculty research is generally oriented toward molecular and cellular physiology, but opportunities for research in organ physiology also exist. The curriculum provides the student with a broad background in physiology and biophysics and the closely related fieJ,ds of anatomy and biochemistry. Elec\u00ad tive courses permit in-depth exploration of particular areas. Interdisciplinary dissertation research involving there-. search of more than one faculty member is encouraged. Prerequisites for admission normally include a bachelor's degree in one of the biological sciences, physics, chemistry, mathematics, or engineering, as well as undergraduate courses in calculus, organic and physical chemistry, biochemistry, and advanced biology (e.g., neurophysiol\u00ad ogy, cell biology, neurobiology, psychobiology). Up to two prerequisites may be fulfilled as first-year electives. GRE Aptitude tests are required. Preference will be given to those students who have prior research experience. The Department admits about three highly qualified stu\u00ad dents each fall. The program emphasizes original research, and students are expected to become involved in the re\u00ad search of the Department as early as possible. The core program includes graduate courses in physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, morphology, and cell biology. After the first year, training will follow the classical tutorial pattern in which a small number of students are tutored by the faculty in an informal setting. Students also will partici\u00ad pate in a program of laboratory rotations and attend the weekly colloquium in physiology. The third and fourth years will be spent primarily in research, with some partici\u00ad pation in teaching physiology to medical students. Each student must submit a written dissertation on an original research project and successfully defend this dissertation in an oral examination. Incoming students will receive academic advising from the Department Graduate Advisor until such time as they choose a thesis advisor. The faculty conducts quarterly re\u00ad views of all continuing students to ensure that they are maintaining satisfactory progress within their particular academic program. Students who have completed all necessary prerequisites should be able to complete the Ph.D. within four years. A comprehensive examination will be administered in June at the end of the second year. The examination is based upon the tutorials in advanced physiology and is designed to test the student's ability to organize a body of knowledge and to think critically. Some time during the third year, the student will present a seminar on a topic assigned by the formal candidacy <:ommittee. Following the seminar, the committee will critically examine the student's qualifica\u00ad tions for the successful conduct of the doctoral dissertation. Advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. is recommended to the Dean of the Graduate Division upon the unanimous vote of the committee. For information on faculty research areas and course de\u00ad scriptions, see page 82. Some faculty from the Department are members of an in\u00ad terdisciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group; see page 68 for a description of the program. Radiological Sciences The Department of Radiological Sciences offers graduate programs of advanced study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. Both programs are oriented toward the education and training of the superior student who has the potential and desire to become a creative and productive member of the medical or medical-related communities. A broad based, interdisciplinary curriculum places heavy emphasis on research and is designed to provide the stu\u00ad dent with a comprehensive knowledge of the field in addi\u00ad tion to an exceptionally high level of competence in one or more subspecialties. By utilizing the training received in medical imaging, medical physics, bioengineering, radiobiology, and radiological engineering, the student should be prepared for a wide range of career opportunities in university, hospital, or industrial settings upon comple\u00ad tion of this program. Prospective students are cautioned that the program is extremely demanding and requires a broad base of knowledge in a variety of the conventional disciplines. The Department of Radiological Sciences has well\u00ad equipped radiodiagnostic, radiobiological, engineering, and medical physics laboratories located on campus and at the hospitals associated with the University of California, Irvine. Major research areas include the general aspects of medical imaging and basic and applied studies dealing with radiodiagnosis, nuclear medicine, computerized tomog\u00ad raphy, medical ultrasonics, radiotherapy, and radiobiology. The core program plus additional courses as may be re\u00ad quired by the Graduate Committee normally will require UC IRVINE - 1980-1981two years to complete. To receive either the M.S. or Ph.D. degree, the student must successfully complete the core courses or their equivalents. Requirements for theM. S. degree may be satisfied in one of two ways. Under Plan I, the student completes the Radiological Sciences core program with an average grade of B or above and under the direction of a faculty advisor also prepares a thesis that is acceptable to the thesis com\u00ad mittee. Under Plan II, the student completes the core pro\u00ad gram plus a minimum of eight additional credits (all with an average grade of B or above) in a given area of specializa\u00ad tion and satisfactorily passes a comprehensive written examination. Requirements for the Ph.D. degree may be divided into four stages. First, the student must complete the core pro\u00ad gram and take additional course work as recommended by the Graduate Committee, all with an average grade of B or above. Second, the student must pass a written and oral qualifying examination given at the end of the second full year of study. A student who fails the preliminary qualify\u00ad ing examination can, with approval from the Graduate Committee, repeat the examination the following year. Third, within a year after passing the preliminary examina\u00ad tion, the student must pass the final oral qualifying exami\u00ad nation covering the proposed field of research and be ad\u00ad vanced to candidacy. Finally, a dissertation representing original research in the student's principal field of study must be prepared and defended. The dissertation, con\u00ad ducted under the direction of the doctoral committee, rep\u00ad resents the major element in the doctoral program; it must be a significant contribution to the field and is expected to demonstrate critical judgment, intellectual synthesis, and imaginative creativity. During the final quarter of graduate study the student is required to defend the dissertation in an oral examination conducted by the doctoral committee. Admission to the graduate program is by the Dean of the Graduate Division upon the recommendation of the De\u00ad partment and is based upon letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, previous scholarship, and other qualifications. Applicants should have a broad undergraduate background in both the physical and the biological sciences. Since most students will need some ad\u00ad ditional work in one or more disciplines, the graduate pro\u00ad gram allows for the correction of minor deficiencies during the first year, as determined by departmental review. Al\u00ad though the program is rigorous, it is also sufficiently flexi\u00ad ble to allow for a wide range of interests and objectives. Application deadline for the fall quarter is June 1 of each year. However, to receive full consideration for financial assistance, fall quarter applications should be completed by February 1. Applications for the winter and spring quarters will be accepted only under special circumstances.

UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS Melvin Calvin, University Professor Emeritus University of California, Berkeley Murray Krieger, University Professor University of California, Irvine Josephine Miles, University Professor Emeritus University of California, Berkeley Glenn Seaborg, University Professor University of California, Berkeley Neil Smelser, University Professor University of California, Berkeley Edward Teller, University Professor Emeritus Lawrence Livermore Laboratory Charles Townes, University Professor University of California, Berkeley Harold Urey, University Professor Emeritus University of California, San Diego Sherwood Washburn, Univer9ity Professor University of California, Berkeley Lynn White, Jr., University Professor Emeritus University of California, Los Angeles STUDENT RECORDS The University maintains various types of records pertaining to students; some are maintained for academic purposes; others, such as hospital and employment records, are maintained for other specific purposes. Student records-that is, those pertaining to students in their capacity as students-include but are not limited to academic evaluations, transcripts, test scores and other academic records, general counseling and advising records, disciplinary records, and financial aid records. The disclosure of information from student records is governed in large measure by the Federal Family Educational Rights and Pri\u00ad vacy Act of 1974, by the State of California Education Code, and by University policy and procedures implementing these laws which protect the student's right of privacy, provide safeguards for the confidentiality of student records, and permit students access to their own records. Pursuant to the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the University of California Policies Applying to the Disclosure of Information from Student Records, students at the University have the following five rights: 1. to inspect and review records pertaining to themselves in their capacity as students; 2. to inspect records maintained by the campus of disclosure of personally identifiable information from their student records; UC IRVINE - 1980-1981258 Student Records 3. to seek correction of their student records through a request to amend the records or a request for a hearing; 4. to file complaints with the Department of Health and Human Services regarding alleged violations of the rights accorded them by the Act; and 5. to have withheld from disclosure, in the absence of their prior consent for release, personally identifiable information from their student records, with exceptions as noted in the University student records policies. NOTE: There are instances in which information can be disclosed with\u00ad out prior written consent of the student. University officials may require access to student records in the course of the performance of their as\u00ad signed duties. Further, (a) in connection with conditions of certain financial aid awards; (b) when the campus is complying with a judicial order or subpoena; and (c) when authorized federal or state officials are conducting an audit or evaluation of federally supported educational programs, confidential information can be disclosed without prior writ\u00ad ten consent of the student. There are also other situations in which the University is required to disclose information. See Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, Part B, Section 10.721 for a list of exceptions. Normally the campus will release the following as personally iden\u00ad tifiable information which can be made public: Student's name; Address (campus, local, and/or permanent) and telephone number; Date and place of birth; Major field of study, dates of attendance, degrees and honors received; Most recent previous educational institution attended; Participation in officially recognized activities, including intercol\u00ad legiate athletics; Name, weight, and height of participants on intercollegiate Uni\u00ad versity athletic teams. However, students have the right to refuse to permit any or all of these categories to be designated public information with respect to themselves. (See the NOTE above.) If a student requested that information from his or her records not be regarded as public information, then the information will not be released to anyone without the written consent of the student. The student should be aware of the important implications of exercising this right. For example, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and degrees and honors received, the campus cannot release for publication information on any honors received by the student, such as election to Phi Beta Kappa, and cannot include the student's name and degree earned in the cam\u00ad pus commencement program without the written consent of the student. Similarly, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and dates of attendance, a student's status as a student cannot be verified for potential employers without the written consent of the student. Further, if a student's last instruc\u00ad tion to the campus was to withhold from disclosure the degree granted to that student and the date on which the degree was conferred, that information cannot be confirmed for a third party in connection with the appointment of that graduate to a new position or in connection with an honor that individual received without the written consent of the student. Students wishing to restrict release of public information should contact the Registrar's Office for instructions on how to do so. Questions regarding the rights of students under the University policies and the federal law should be directed to the Vice Chancellor-Student Affairs or that person's designate, 260 Ad\u00ad ministration. A Personal Data Sheet is included in each quarter's registration packet which allows students to examine and update their personal data. Furthermore, during the eighth week of classes, every stu\u00ad dent is provided with a record of current term enrollment as piut of his or her registration materials for the next quarter to ensure the accuracy of official enrollment. Students are urged to officially re\u00ad port to the Registrar's Office all changes in personal data and en\u00ad rollment data. It is extremely important for each student to keep the Registrar's Office currently informed as changes occur to assure that accurate and complete records are maintained. Students are informed annually of their rights under the Universi\u00ad ty's student records policies and the federal Act. A copy of the Act and University and campus policies are available for review in the Reference Room, Main Library. In addition, University policies are published in the booklet \"Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students- Part B,\" copies of which are availa\u00ad ble in Campus Organization Services, 106 Gateway Commons. Complaints regarding alleged violation of the rights accorded stu\u00ad dents by the federal Act may be filed with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Office (FERPA), Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, D.C. 20201.
