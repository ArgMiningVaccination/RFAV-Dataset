The best adult ADHD treatment strategies are multimodal ones \u2014 combinations of several different, complementary approaches that work together to reduce symptoms. For one person, this ideal combination may include medication, nutrition, exercise, and behavioral therapy. For someone else, it may mean taking supplements, participating in CBT, and joining an ADHD support group. Finding the right treatments \u2014 and managing them \u2014 takes research, planning, organization, and persistence. Early on, talk with your doctor about your options. If you use medication, speak with the prescribing professional about his or her expertise with complementary treatment options. If you do not use medication, [find a professional](https://directory.additudemag.com) who specializes in the types of treatments you want to use \u2014 for example, a nutritionist or psychologist specializing in behavior therapy. With that in mind, here is an overview of [ADHD](https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-adhd-symptoms-causes-treatments/) treatments to understand your options. Adult ADHD Treatment 1: Medication Medication is often the first line of defense against the symptoms of ADHD for one simple reason: [studies show it to be most effective](/stimulant-medications-for-adhd/). \"When adults ask me questions about why they should try medication to manage their ADHD, my answer always comes down to two words: Medication works,\" says Russell A. Barkley, Ph.D., a clinical professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the Medical University of South Carolina. \"When you find the right medicine, you can experience substantial improvements in your ADHD symptoms.\" [With the right drug and the optimal dosage](https://www.additudemag.com/add-medication/), the success rate is high: Medication works for at least 80 percent of people with ADHD. Though broadly effective, medication is not an easy answer. Before pursuing treatment with medication, patients should consider the following: - Finding the right medication, dosage, and schedule can take months. - Every medication has side effects for some people. Balancing those with the positive effects of medication is a trial-and-error process. It will take time for you to find the optimal medication and dosage with minimal or zero side effects. - To get the most out of medication, you must communicate with the prescribing doctor and follow his or her advice, especially during the initial phase of taking medication. This communication is needed to adjust dosage and control side effects in a timely manner. - Medication isn't a magic bullet. It helps manage some ADHD symptoms, but it does not cure the disorder. - Supplementing medication with behavioral therapy and/or coaching is often a more effective strategy than managing ADHD with one or the other alone, as studies have shown [1](#footnote1) [ [Free Guide: What to Eat (and Avoid) for Improved ADHD Symptoms](https://www.additudemag.com/download/adhd-foods-to-improve-symptoms/?src=embed_link)] Adult ADHD Treatment 2: Behavior Therapies Medicine alone is not sufficient treatment for most adults with ADHD. This is especially true for adults struggling with work and day-to-day responsibilities. While medication works on a neurological level to regulate the brain, behavior therapy addresses specific problem behaviors by teaching the individual how to structure their time, establish predictability and routines, and increase positive outcomes. Behavior therapy can help change behavior through conditioning, which involves the following: - Creating an environment conducive to suitable behavior - Providing positive feedback and reinforcement for acceptable behavior and improvement - Establishing clear consequences for unwanted behavior, which may entail withholding reward/praise, or enforcing negative consequences - Being consistent about expectations and consequences, both positive and negative Behavior therapy changes negative habits and behaviors in many adults. Adult ADHD Treatment 3: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) This approach, often used in combination with medication, is implemented by a therapist who works with you to pinpoint problem behaviors and to develop strategies for changing them. [CBT](/slideshows/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-techniques-for-adhd/) is a short-term, goal-oriented form of psychotherapy that aims to change negative patterns of thinking and change the way a patient feels about herself, her abilities, and her future. Here's how it works: - Choose one problem behavior \u2014 procrastination, say \u2014 to work on at a time. - Understand the motivation for the behavior, and change the thoughts and perceptions that cause it - Develop practical ways to change the behavior - Implement the strategies, and try new ones if they don't work This approach is effective for most people with ADHD. Exceptions to this rule are people who need a more structured approach, such as those with oppositional defiant disorder who are unwilling to cooperate in managing their behaviors. Changing distorted thoughts, and the resulting change in behavior patterns, is effective in treating mood disorders, anxiety, and other emotional problems, as well. [ [The Full Menu of ADHD Treatment Options](https://www.additudemag.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-medication-therapy-diet-coaching/?src=embed_link)] Adult ADHD Treatment 4: Nutrition and Supplements Changing your daily food choices to increase the consumption of certain [ADHD-friendly nutrients](/best-supplements-for-adhd-zinc-magnesium-iron-and-more/) \u2014 fish oil, the minerals zinc, iron, and magnesium \u2014 plus adding protein and complex carbohydrates to your diet, can help the brain function more effectively and reduce mood swings. Adult ADHD Treatment 5: Exercise \"Think of exercise as medication,\" says John Ratey, M.D., an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and author of [Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain](https://amzn.to/2mAnSg7). \"Exercise turns on the attention system, the so-called executive functions \u2014 sequencing, working memory, prioritizing, inhibiting, and sustaining attention.\" You'd be surprised how walking for just 30 minutes, four times a week, is enough exercise to yield benefits. Of course, more rigorous exercise produces higher benefits for both your brain body, but the message is clear: Just get moving! Adult ADHD Treatment 6: Nature Therapy A daily dose of nature \u2014 a walk in the woods or spending time in a greenhouse \u2014 may reduce ADHD symptoms. This was solidified in a 2004 study where researchers found that \"green outdoor activities reduced symptoms significantly more than did activities conducted in other settings.\" [2](#footnote2) Several experts suggest that patients use nature therapy in conjunction with prescription medications and behavioral therapy. Adult ADHD Treatment 7: Mindful Meditation and Yoga Mindful awareness, or mindfulness, involves paying close attention to your thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations; in other words, developing a greater awareness of what's going on with you from moment to moment. It can be used as a tool to foster physical and psychological well-being, improving blood pressure and chronic pain as well anxiety. A 2005 study at Arizona State University found that [children who participated in mindfulness](/mindfulness-meditation-for-kids-with-adhd/) exercises had fewer ADHD symptoms, plus greater attention than kids who did not participate in the exercises. [3](#footnote3) It stands to reason that these benefits hold true for adults as well. [Yoga](/say-yes-to-yoga-for-kids-with-attention-deficit/), a physical and spiritual practice originating in India, provides similar benefits to mindfulness practice and meditation, reducing anxiety while increasing energy and gives the added bonus of exercise at the same time. Adult ADHD Treatment 8: Brain Training Brain-training therapies like neurofeedback and Cogmed are making a serious promise: increased attention and working memory without medication. The scientific community, however, is not yet convinced. [4](#footnote4) \"Working memory is the ability to hold information in your mind for several seconds, manipulate it, and use it in your thinking,\" says [Ari Tuckman, Psy.D.](/author/ari-tuckman-psy-d-mba/), a clinical psychologist in West Chester, Pennsylvania. \"It is central to concentration, problem solving, and impulse control.\" Individuals with ADHD can't always hold on to information because their attention gets hijacked. Improving working memory capacity with brain training enables an individual to pay attention, resist distractions, manage emotions better, and learn. [Neurofeedback](/does-neurofeedback-work-for-adhd/) is a form of brain training that uses brain exercises to reduce impulsivity and increase attentiveness. The brain emits different types of waves, depending on whether we are in a focused state or daydreaming. The goal of neurofeedback is to teach individuals to produce brain-wave patterns that reflect focus. The result: Some ADHD symptoms \u2014 namely, impulsivity and distractibility \u2014 diminish. Adult ADHD Treatment 9: Digital Therapeutics and Apps Mobile app stores are overrun with products that promise to address individual ADHD symptoms like weak working memory, time management, organization, planning skills, prioritization, and more. One mobile app, however, is designed specifically for adults with ADHD: [EndeavorOTC](https://www.endeavorotc.com/) is a video-game app clinically designed to address symptoms of inattentive ADHD \u2014 namely, focus. [A trial involving 220 participants](https://www.endeavorotc.com/faq/) demonstrated improved focus and quality of life among EndeavorOTC users, as measured by the Test of Variable of Attention (TOVA\u00ae) Attention Composite Score. Adult ADHD Treatment 10: Coaching An [ADHD coach](/why-you-should-get-adult-adhd-coach/) knows about the specific, unique challenges facing people with the condition and can help them acquire the skills to overcome those problems. Part cheerleader, part taskmaster, part personal assistant, part teacher, a coach may help you do the following: - Develop structures for organizing your life - Make plans and set goals - Get and stay motivated - Develop time and money-management skills Some coaches meet with their clients weekly; others stay in regular contact by phone. Still others meet with clients in their homes to help with specific tasks, such as organizing papers or working on social skills. Adult ADHD Treatment 11: Therapy Couples and family therapy helps many adults with ADHD work with loved ones to set up useful behavior plans, increase accountability and cooperation, and improve interpersonal communication and relationships. How to Approach ADHD Treatments [Most people with ADHD try a variety of treatment programs to maximize symptom control. It's often best to start by trying one thing at a time so you can see what effect the treatment is having. When you introduce something new, keep a log, so you can follow the progress of your efforts and understand the outcomes of each strategy you try. Be patient and consult with your providers along the way. Don't drop a treatment from your plan if changes aren't happening as fast as you'd like. Change takes time. Look for ways to adjust the treatment before you give up on it.] [1 \"A 14-Month Randomized Clinical Trial of Treatment of General Psychiatry 56.12 (1999): 1073.
