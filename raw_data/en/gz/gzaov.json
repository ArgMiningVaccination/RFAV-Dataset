These two main categories are determined by the cause of a person's vertigo, which may be due to an inner ear issue or a problem within the brain. Peripheral Vertigo This term describes vertigo caused by an inner ear complication. Because the ear is made up of so many tiny, intricate pieces, it can actually be quite easy for one part to malfunction. Such an issue can quickly lead to balance problems or inflammation within the ear. Individuals with peripheral vertigo often experience a variety of symptoms, including: - Ringing in the ears - Dizziness - Difficulty focusing their eyes - Sweating - Hearing loss in one ear - Nausea - Vomiting Central Vertigo The second type of vertigo is known as central vertigo, which is a balance disorder that has been linked to problems with the central nervous system. This more specifically indicates a problem with either the brainstem or the cerebellum, which are two areas responsible for a person's perception of vision and balance. The most common symptoms associated with central vertigo are: - Double vision - Difficulty in controlling movements of the eye - Temporary facial paralysis - Weakness in the limbs - Trouble swallowing - Slurred speech How Does Peoria Ear, Nose & Throat Group Test for Vertigo? There are a variety of tests that can be conducted to determine if a person has vertigo, and if so, what type of vertigo they are experiencing. This process will first begin with a one-on-one consultation with our office. During this appointment, the physician will ask a series of questions to narrow down the list of the patient's symptoms, how frequently they experience these symptoms, and whether or not there was any recent event that may have caused vertigo to suddenly occur such as head trauma. If initial tests are inconclusive, your doctor will likely order a CT or MRI scan to get better insight into the internal structure of the ear or brain, which will help them pin down an exact cause of the patient's dizzying symptoms. At this point, a course of treatment will be recommended based upon the individual and their original diagnosis. How Do You Treat Vertigo? In many instances, a person's vertigo will correct itself after a few weeks. However, if you notice persistent symptoms, or a sudden intensity of symptoms, it is recommended to seek treatment immediately. Many ENT specialists will begin treating vertigo using the least invasive methods possible, such as prescribing different medications or recommending various physical therapy exercises. If these first attempts to solve a patient's problems with vertigo are unsuccessful, it may be time to consider other options like antibiotic injections or inner ear surgery.
