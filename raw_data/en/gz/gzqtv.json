But the COVID-19 pandemic has sent him into a different direction, consumed him.", "sitename": "STLtoday.com", "date": "2021-10-31", "cleaned_text": "retirement age, William Hermanson wants to get back into boating. He grew up near the water. He'd also like to finish an online music education program he helped build as a side gig with his grown children. They were raised around instruments, singing and a firm belief in spiritual healing. The COVID-19 pandemic has knocked Hermanson in a different direction, consumed him. He recently went a month without attending church, the longest dry spell he could recall in 40 years. He wasn't scared of getting sick. He's an optimist, enjoying the ride. \"Life itself is determined by how you understand God,\" said Hermanson, 74, once described a long time ago by The Washington Post as a fire hydrant in a blue suit. He's still sturdy, wears dress coats and loafers. He's still a civic-minded champion of the First Amendment. But he says his fight these days has more to do with the freedom of assembly than religion \u2014 the rights of \"we the people\" to petition the St. Louis County Council for redress of grievances. People are also reading... His fundamental beef: government is overbearing. That grants him easy audience with some Republican leaders on the council, who, he says, call him Herman. Dive one foot deeper. He believes elites corrupted the U.S. government since it was founded as a corporation, and that the pandemic response is the latest orchestrated effort to reduce the population of an overcrowded planet. \"It is an ideology that is involved here, one that is so terrible that most people can't accept it,\" Hermanson said in a wide-ranging interview at a caf\u00e9 in Wildwood, his hometown. \"It's an ideology that the people are basically slaves to be done away with, to be used. And we've got too many of them so we've got to kill some off. That's exactly what is going on. I am telling you the absolute truth.\" How is the government reducing the population? \"Through a kill shot vaccine,\" he said. \"Through putting masks on everybody to suffocate them. To cause wars. To do all of these things that kill millions of people. We should have never had the Spanish-American War. We should have never had World War I. We should have never had World War II. We could have avoided the Civil War. Do you know who paid for the Hessians in the Revolutionary War?\" \"It hasn't stopped,\" he added. \"The 1%, if you have been controlling the world.\" Weren't you a banker? A yachtsman? \"I have been in banking, yes. I have done a number of things. I have been in insurance. I have been a contractor. An accountant.\" Hermanson has often had the ear of CEOs. At the last stop of his professional career, he flew to different places around the country to help entities upgrade fund accounting systems, anything from a levee district in New Orleans to a school district in Austin, Texas. Every Thursday, he'd come home to St. Louis to be with his family and teach Sunday school. That job has ended. Apart from personal projects, he'd been moving toward a typical retirement. Then St. Louis County Executive Sam Page, a Democrat, started ordering residents to wear masks. Hermanson said he responded by getting certified to be a substitute teacher. To help children. \"I knew there was a need for teachers because of all this stuff going on,\" he said. \"I got in there and I found out that I was required to enforce the mask mandate. I had an elementary student collapse on the gym floor in front of me because they were requiring masks. I pulled the mask off so he could breathe, and then I didn't go back because I did not want to be connected to child abuse. And that's what's happening in our schools right now.\" He said the incident happened at a local school that he wouldn't name. In more recent months, he's become a regular voice at County Council meetings. He's spoken 11 times since the beginning of August. He's part of an outspoken group of individuals who are applauded for speaking against mask mandates and COVID-19 vaccines. They have said vaccines are ineffective and destructive. They've presented data from experts they've tracked down and cited their own experiences. If the coronavirus was so deadly, then why are they, themselves, healthy enough to show up every Tuesday night to present their research in a relatively small, enclosed space? Some of the 3-minute commentaries are emotional and jittery. Hermanson, in his sport coat, leans on experience addressing public entities around the country. In a calm voice, he raises up the classic saw between good and evil, then goes for the jugular. \"You do realize that you have been given facts about people being harmed and dying from the so-called remedies you propose,\" he told the council this summer. \"You are personally on notice. If you think you personally can suffer no consequences from being involved in murder as a result of your actions, I think you better get some legal advice.\" On another night, he argued that he and others gathered behind him, waiting their turn at the microphone, weren't outliers. \"We, 40 million Americans at least, now know with indisputable fact the truth that our country has been attacked by a foreign power and our institutions, Big Tech, and the media, have been infiltrated,\" he told the council and anybody watching online. \"The very authorities you turn to for information are giving you lies. Our First Amendment is being shredded. The pandemic is one of the most egregious and evil lies.\" In the interview, Hermanson said he's done thousands of hours of research over the past year about the coronavirus, which unearthed a trove of other finds. He referenced as fact what has been debunked as conspiracy theory. J.P. Morgan, the powerful financier and banker during the Gilded Age, had the Titanic sunk in an elaborate scheme to avoid a major debt, only it wasn't really the Titanic. The last presidential election was stolen in front of our eyes. \"We watch 93 senators commit treason on television when they approved the election of Biden,\" he said. \"They all knew, factually knew that China had interfered in our election. They had the evidence in hand, and they still did it. That tells us the whole system is corrupt. We've lost the republic. Now we need to get it back.\" 'A true believer' While Hermanson is quick to delve into history, he hasn't been speaking publicly about his own. As a child growing up in Muskegon, Michigan, his mother suffered from debilitating migraines. A neighbor suggested trying traditional Christian Science, a radical belief that they could heal, as Jesus taught and did, without medicine. \"She did and she was almost immediately and permanently healed,\" Hermanson said. \"From that point on there was never any medicine. We literally went into the medicine cabinet, took everything out and threw it in the wastebasket, including Pepto Bismol, which I liked. That was good stuff.\" Hermanson went on to college. He married Christine, who attended the same high school where he'd been drum major in the band and sang in the glee club. They settled in Florida. She ran a fine arts academy in Sarasota. He oversaw lending at a savings and loan. Together, they raised their family as orthodox Christian Scientists. \"Physicians are taught how to treat, not heal, again, and again and again,\" he said. \"It's big money to treat again and again and again. The pharmaceutical companies make a ton of money by treating not healing.\" To this day, if Hermanson had diabetes, he wouldn't take insulin. Christine, who died in 2015, after 45 years of marriage, wouldn't either, even though diabetes ran in her family. Nor would their 7-year-old daughter, Amy, who died at the Hermanson home in 1986 after weeks of decline. She was one of seven child fatalities involving Christian Science families around the time that generated a lot of headlines. \"The diagnoses was that she had juvenile onset diabetes,\" Hermanson said. \"That was the problem. Now, I'll have to tell you this too. Our practice of our religion was interfered with by the state. We were doing everything legally, lawfully. We were practicing our religion correctly at all times. And when she passed on, I was actually in judge's chambers trying to protect my right to take care of our daughter as we saw fit.\" He and Christine were charged with third-degree murder and child abuse. Throughout the trial, they sat quietly, without testifying. Each day entering the courtroom, Christine reportedly would say good morning to the prosecutor. The jury convicted them. An appellate court upheld the verdict. The Supreme Court of Florida eventually overturned the conviction. According to the ruling, the Legislature \"failed to clearly indicate the point at which a parent's reliance on his or her religious beliefs in the treatment of his or her children becomes criminal conduct.\" Seeking a fresh start, the Hermanson family moved to St. Louis. Their eldest son, an accomplished pianist for his age, enrolled at Principia, the private school in Town and Country for Christian Scientists [founded in 1898](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_ad258325-d809-57bf-991c-e4c6e5d3f7e3.html?mode=comments&fb_comment_id=1818751921477534_1819764414709618). Their two other sons attended Principia. Hermanson got a job at Principia, which also has a college in Elsah, Illinois, as controller. He later became chief information officer, primarily focused on computer systems. \"It turned out they had an opening that I applied for, and it worked out,\" he said. In 1999, Hermanson left for a better paying position at a large company. That's when he helped upgrade accounting systems nationwide. His experience working with CEOs and other leaders lends him a respected presence when he appears before the County Council; however, some of those familiar with his history were surprised to hear he wasn't living a quiet existence, out of public view. \"We have religious freedom. We have the right to vote. That's what goes together,\" said Alan Rogers, a Boston College professor whose book, \"The Child Cases: How America's Religious Exemption Laws Harm Children,\" touched on the Hermanson saga. \"But this strong belief about mental connection with God who will save your child, or save you from crashing your car, that doesn't give you a leg up or a pat on the back to then talk about what is wrong or right with the government of the United States.\" Rita Swan, a former Christian Scientist, co-founded an organization that opposes religious exemptions from child welfare laws after her young son died in 1977 from bacterial meningitis. Swan, who attended the Hermanson trial, described the case as \"grotesque.\" \"The suffering of the child was stomach churning,\" she said. She was stunned to learn of William Hermanson's recent activity. \"I guess he's a true believer,\" said Swan, 78, of Kentucky. \"Does he ever stop to think that his 7-year-old daughter was totally dependent on her parents and they failed?\" Hermanson said he understands Swan and has no antipathy for her. He said her sick child was initially under Christian Science care and died after he was switched to medical care. He said Swan suffers terrible guilt over the death that she now puts on Christian Science. As for his daughter's case, he spoke at length. He firmly believes that if the state hadn't interfered, Amy would be alive today. Just the facts Hermanson sees another government overreach involved with the local response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He said the truth has been twisted so many different ways by outside influences that he doesn't trust traditional sources and nor should elected leaders. Peer-reviewed research, even institutions of higher learning like Stanford University, are corrupt. His skepticism is hurled at the County Council in the form of historical anecdotes and soft-spoken verbal hand grenades, like the beginning of his public comment on Aug. 3: \"I am addressing the mRNA gene therapy bioweapon, mistakenly called a vaccine.\" Yet in the interview with the Post-Dispatch, Hermanson said he hasn't told people not to take the vaccine. Rather, he says, he's laying out facts that don't have anything to do with his religion. \"I am not up there preaching about people rejecting medicine,\" he said. \"What I am saying and what the rest of us are out here saying, is this is not medicine good for the people. This is a bioweapon that you do not understand.\" Asked why the overwhelming majority of people who die from COVID-19 aren't vaccinated, he questioned the authenticity of the [data](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-941fcf43d9731c76c16e7354f5d5e187). He said hospitals have financial incentives to skew death reports, as public school districts have unchecked [financial incentives](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-federal-government-gave-billions-to-americas-schools-for-covid-19-relief-where-did-the-money-go) to enforce mask mandates. Asked for the best source to support the anti-vaccination and anti-mask positions that he and others have been taking to the County Council, he said look up Dr. Sherri Tenpenny. Her arguments, which caught the attention of the [Center for Countering Digital Hate](https://252f2edd-1c8b-49f5-9bb2-cb57bb47e4ba.filesusr.com/ugd/f4d9b9_b7cedc0553604720b7137f8663366ee5.pdf), sound familiar. In early June, Tenpenny, an osteopathic doctor from Cleveland, [testified](https://ohiochannel.org/video/ohio-house-health-committee-6-8-2021) to Ohio state lawmakers that she was board-certified in emergency medicine and had researched the \"problems with vaccines\" for more than two decades. She testified that \"big business\" and \"lobbyists\" were wrapped up in a \"bigger agenda\" involved with the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. She advocated that that Ohioans be allowed to \"have a clear choice of what they want to have injected into their body, without fear of reprisal.\" Among many other side effects, she testified information had surfaced that COVID-19 vaccines, undergoing clinical trials at the time, may \"interface\" with 5G cellular towers and \"magnetize\" people. \"I'm sure you've seen the pictures all over the internet of people who have had these shots and now they're magnetized,\" Tenpenny testified. \"They can put a key on their forehead. It sticks. They can put spoons and forks all over them and they can stick, because now we think that there's a metal piece to that.\" Her remarks became another example of how conspiracy theories surface during pivotal moments in history. The Religion News Service [noted](https://religionnews.com/2021/09/14/the-gospel-of-sherri-tenpenny-covid-19-misinformation-and-christian-nationalism) that less attention was given to her direct warning to the faithful. \"For those of you who say you are Christians, what will your life review look like at the end of your life?\" Tenpenny testified. \"Will the Lord say to you: 'You coerced people into being injected with this gene-modification technology that irreversibly disrupts your chromosomes?'\" That the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has since approved COVID-19 vaccines was news to Hermanson in the Oct. 12 interview in Wildwood with the Post-Dispatch. \"Well, you can't get it in the United States,\" he said. \"If that's the particular one I am thinking of, you can only get it overseas.\" In his presence, a reporter looked up a [press release](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine) announcing approval of the first vaccine beyond emergency use authorization, for people 16 and older. Still, he distrusted the website [FDA.gov](http://FDA.gov) as a reliable source. \"You are going to believe anything coming from the FDA?\" he said, laughing. \"What's the date on that?\" Aug. 23, 2021. \"No,\" he said.
