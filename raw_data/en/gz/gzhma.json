Acupuncture has been in use for at least 2,500 years. At Chiro-Med Health & Wellness Centers in Orland Park, we're proud to offer this ancient technique to our patients. From back pain to menstrual cramps and a plethora of problems in between, acupuncture can help you heal. Acupuncture Treats a Variety of Conditions This ancient method of treating patients is based on the idea that patterns of energy (called \"qi\") flow through the body. When qi becomes imbalanced, painful conditions can occur. Acupuncture is a method of restoring the qi to its proper balance in the body. By inserting needles into the skin at specific places (called \"pressure points\"), acupuncture helps redirect energy for the purposes of healing and relieving pain. Acupuncture needles are very thin and generally not painful for the patient. In fact, some people find acupuncture treatment to be relaxing and energizing. The needles are non-toxic, sterile and disposable. Use of the needles is regulated by the FDA and as a result, acupuncture is regarded as very safe. Because acupuncture can be used to stimulate many different pressure points in the body, its applications are far-reaching. Acupuncture is used to treat the following: - Back pain - Carpal tunnel - Osteoarthritis - Fibromyalgia - Headaches - Addiction - Sciatica - Allergies and asthma - Shoulder pain - Anxiety and depression In addition to the above diseases and painful conditions, acupuncture is also used to treat addictions and can be used as an immunity enhancement and can supplement treatments for cancer and other serious diseases. The list of conditions that acupuncture can treat is so long that patients who don't see what they're looking for in the above list should speak with their practitioner to ask about any specific conditions they wish to have treated.
