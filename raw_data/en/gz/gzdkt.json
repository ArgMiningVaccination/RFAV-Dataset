Rare outcomes associated with COVID-19 vaccines might be less likely to be captured in clinical trials,leading to a knowledge gap in real-world vacc ine safety. In contrast with high-income countries, many low-to-middle income countries have limited capacity to conduct active surveillance, owing to the absence of large and fu lly-integrated health information databases. This paper describes the study protocol, which aims to investigate risk of prespeci ed adverse events of special interests following COVID-19 vaccination in a partially integrated health information system with non-shareable electr onic health records. The SAFECOVAC study is a longitudinal, observational retrospective st udy of active safety surveillance using case-based monitoring approach. This involves linkage of seve ral administrative databases and hospitalization data monitoring to identify adverse events of speci al interests following administration of COVID- 19 vaccines in Malaysia. The source population co mprises of all individuals who received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Self-controlled d esign and vaccinated case-coverage design will be employed to assess risk of adverse events of special interests and determine the associationwith vaccine exposure. Data on vaccination recor ds will be obtained from the national COVID-19 vaccination register to identify the vaccination pla tforms, doses and the timing of vaccinations. The outcome of this study is hospitalization for the a dverse events of special interests between March 2021 and June 2022. The outcomes will be obtained through linkage with hospital admissiondatabase and national pharmacovigilance databas e. Findings will provide analysis of real-world data which can inform deliberations by governmen t and public health decision makers relative to the re nement of COVID-19 vaccination recommendations.

Data from clinical trials are inherently limited inproviding full safety pro le of COVID-19 vaccines, as limited sample size and strict inclusion criteria might limit thegeneralisability of the safety data, given that trial subjectsmight differ from actual recipients of the vaccines ( Barda et al., 2021 ;Klein et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, some adverse reaction events may have longer latency than the trial follow-up period. As such, outcomes which are rare or with delayed onset might be less likely to be detected or captured in clinical trials ( Kochhar and Salmon, 2020 ). Therefore, monitoring of the safety of vaccines during the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines inreal-world population, especially at the post-introduction phase,is particularly important to supplement the ndings from clinical trials. With the roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccination programs worldwide, public concerns over the safety of novel COVID-19vaccines are anticipated ( Li et al., 2021 ). In order to maintain public health con dence in vaccination, it is important to establish safety surveillance systems to monitor and assess the Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFIs) and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) during COVID-19 vaccineintroduction. The functions of the vaccine safety surveillancesystems include early detection, investigation and analysis ofadverse events, as well as appropriate and timely response tothese vaccine safety issues ( World Health Organization, 2021 ). In Malaysia, reporting of adverse events to the NationalPharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) involvesspontaneous reporting by healthcare providers or consumersusing a standardized form ( National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency, 2016 ). This passive surveillance system relies on voluntary submission of reports of illnesses after vaccination but is limited by underreporting, which maypotentially underestimate the occurrence of adverse events.Therefore, other approaches to complement existing safetysurveillance systems are needed to enhance the identi cation and monitoring of potential adverse events. Active vaccine safetysurveillance for COVID-19 vaccine can be implemented throughsentinel surveillance and data linkage to collect information aboutAEFIs in a de ned population by actively looking for cases in a continuous, organized process ( Davis et al., 2005 ;Chandler, 2020 ). The type and scope of vaccine safety monitoring activities in each country depend on the availability of the resources related with pharmacovigilance surveillance systems ( World Health Organization, 2021 ). For instance, low-and middle-income countries do not have large healthcare administrativedatabases or capacity that allows the implementation of activesafety surveillance ( Kochhar and Salmon, 2020 ). It is also challenging to implement active surveillance and performlinkage of existing healthcare data in Malaysian settings, giventhe state of suboptimally integrated healthcare system, andabsence of linkage capacity for the existing surveillance system (Duszynski et al., 2021 ). With the implementation of the Malaysia 's National COVID-19 Immunization Program by the government, uptake of COVID-19 vaccines is collected at individual level, thus leading to the establishment of the rst national immunization register in the country. This provides anopportunity to conduct population-level active surveillance forvaccine safety. The 'Case-Based Clinical Safety Monitoring of Unsolicited Adverse Events Following COVID-19 Vaccination(SAFECOVAC) 'project is initiated for the evaluation of safety aspects of COVID-19 vaccination in Malaysia. Through thisproject, the risk of pre-speci ed AESIs in patients exposed to COVID-19 vaccines will be assessed through case-basedmonitoring that combines hospital-based data extraction andlinkage of administrative databases with immunization register to generate the study cohort. 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES The study aims to assess the safety of COVID-19 vaccination on the risk of AESIs within prespeci ed time windows following immunization among population in Malaysia. This study will also evaluate the risks of AESI between different vaccine platforms and in speci c subgroups of interest. 3 METHODS 3.1 Setting The National COVID-19 Immunization Program ( Program Imunisasi COVID-19 Kebangsaan; PICK) is a national vaccination campaign implemented by the Malaysiangovernment as an approach in curbing the spread of COVID-19 in Malaysia ( Suah et al., 2021 ). The immunization program began on 24 February 2021 over three phases: 1) Phase 1\u2014healthcare workers and frontliners, 2) Phase 2 \u2014senior citizens and high-risk groups, and 3) Phase 3 \u2014adults aged 18 years and older Access to COVID-19 Vaccine Supply (JKJAV)],2021 }. As of December 2021, vaccines that have been licensed and approved for emergency use in Malaysia are: 1) Comirnaty and 7) COVILO (Sinopharm). Administration of COVID-19 vaccination are managed via the Malaysia Vaccine Administration System (MyVAS) of theMinistry of Health (MOH), with a mobile application,MySejahtera, which was developed by the government to assistin managing and mitigating the COVID-19 outbreaks in thecountry ( Suah et al., 2021 ). MySejahtera is the of cial channel that supports the PICK program through provision of vaccinationregistration, appointment, and issuance of COVID-19Immunization digital certi cate. It also enables the MOH to monitor users 'health conditions and to facilitate contact Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 834940 2Ab Rahman et al. COVID-19 Vaccine Safety: SAFECOVAC Studytracing for COVID-19 so they can take immediate actions in providing the required treatments. 3.2 Study Population and Study Design The SAFECOVAC study is a longitudinal, observational studyusing retrospective data collected in administrative registers andhealth databases. The study population comprised all individualswho received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. This studyadapted the research protocol from the vaCcine COVID-19monitoring readinESS (ACCESS) project to monitor COVID-19 vaccines post-introduction ( Kawai and Arana, 2020 ), as well as Surveillance Program under the Center for Biologics Evaluationand Research Of ce of Biostatistics and Epidemiology ( Lufkin et al., 2021 ). In this study, self-controlled designs and vaccinated case-coverage design will be employed to assess risk of AESI events and determine association with vaccine exposure. 3.2.1 Self-Controlled Designs Using self-controlled designs, each subject will serve as his/her own control and implicitly adjusting for xed confounders (Farrington et al., 1995 ;Weldeselassie et al., 2011 ;Baker et al., 2015 ). Events that occurred during the study period will be categorized into risk period or control period based on theoccurrence of events relative to the time of vaccination. Twotypes of self-controlled designs will be used as speci ed below. 3.2.1.1 Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) The SCCS method compares incidence of events across different risk periods relative to the exposure with incidence during abaseline or control period. In SCCS, observation period will beanchored based on calendar time during the ongoing COVID-19vaccination program in Malaysia and inclusion of period beforeand after vaccination. 3.2.1.2 Self-Controlled Risk Interval (SCRI) SCRI approach is a subtype of SCCS design and utilizescomparison of incidence of outcome of interest in risk period with that in the control period. Only vaccinated subjects with events occurring during these periods areinformative for the analysis. Vaccination date will be usedas the index date to de ne the risk and control intervals. The follow-up period will begin at the date of vaccination andcomplete at the end of pre-speci ed duration of the control period. 3.2.2 Vaccinated Case-Coverage For the vaccinated case-coverage design, the observed odds ofvaccination in the exposure window for each case is compared with the expected odds of vaccination for each case during the same time period as the case 's exposure window in an external reference population ( Th\u00e9ophile et al., 2011 ;Baker et al., 2015 ). The reference population comprises of individuals who aresimilar to the case with respect to risk factors (e.g., age, sex,comorbidities) and at the same time, the individuals also receivedthe same vaccine during the same time period on the day of theoutcome onset.3.3 Study Period This study is currently plan to cover the period from February2021, following availability of COVID-19 vaccines in the country,until June 2022. 3.4 Exposure Measurement Exposure is de ned as receipt of any COVID-19 vaccine dose. For vaccines administered in multiple doses, each individual dose willbe evaluated separately. Individual-level data on vaccination willbe obtained from the MyVAS database which has nationwidecoverage for COVID-19 vaccination status of populations inMalaysia, including individuals vaccinated abroad. Thedatabase provides information on vaccine administeredincluding date of vaccination and vaccine type. 3.5 Outcome Measurement 3.5.1 Hospitalizations The primary outcome is hospitalization for the speci ed medical events as listed in Table 1 . These outcome events were selected based on a list of potential AESIs identi ed for COVID-19 vaccines from Brighton Collaboration and recommendationsfrom NPRA ( Safety Platform for Emergency Vaccines, 2020 ; Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2021 ). The list will be reviewed and updated for inclusion or omission of codes, if any, for eachround of analysis based on published literatures and latestrecommendations. The outcome events will be identi ed from diagnoses using International Classi cation of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modi cation (ICD-10-CM) codes. Information on the hospitalizations will be sourced from the Malaysian Health Data Warehouse (MyHDW), a centralizedhealth data repository that collects data from all healthcarefacilities across Malaysia including episodes of inpatient careat public and private hospitals. The database providesinformation on dates of admission and discharge, diagnoses,discharge status, and patients 'demographic. Diagnoses were coded using the ICD-10 coding system; all data withinMyHDW are monitored and veri ed by the Health Informatics Centre, Ministry of Health Malaysia ( Health Informatics Centre, 2017 ). The MyHDW database is updated monthly, but there are potential recording delays from dataproviders. To account for the data accrual delays, hospitaladmission data will also be obtained from two other sources:1) sentinel surveillance sites, and 2) national pharmacovigilancedatabase. These additional measures will allow more rapididenti cation of eligible cases for early analysis until suf cient data accrue in the central database. Eight public tertiary hospitalsacross Malaysia were selected as sentinel surveillance sites wherehospitalization data will be sourced directly from the medicalrecord of ce of the respective hospitals. Eligible cases will be identi ed using ICD-10 coded diagnoses and chart review will be conducted for detailed information of admission episodes. Thepharmacovigilance database provides data on AEFI reportscollected by NPRA through its spontaneous reporting system.All cases that require hospitalization will be identi ed for inclusion in the present study and include information on dateof events, vaccine administered, and patient outcome. Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 834940 3Ab Rahman et al. COVID-19 Vaccine Safety: SAFECOVAC Study3.5.2 Mortality Secondary outcome is all-cause mortality in the vaccinated population. Death will be ascertained using death registrationsfrom the National Registration Department of Malaysia. Thedeath registry covers all deaths in Malaysia including deaths ofMalaysian citizens abroad. It provides the date and cause of deathbased on the death certi cate issued. 3.6 Data Management and Record Linkage Table 2 summarizes data used in the study. Data will be collected on monthly basis or at pre-arranged intervals fromall data source providers to cover all vaccinations and outcomeevents that occurred during the study period from 1 February2021 until 30 June 2022. The hospitalization data will be cross-linked to check for overlapping records between differencedata sources and only one record for each case will be retainedfor analysis. Data collection at the sentinel sites will utilise electronic case report form from Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)10.0.31 ( Harris et al., 2009 ) hosted at Institute for Clinical Research, MOH Malaysia, with the physical server located in asecured location within the compound. The REDCap platform ismanaged by a system administrator and information technologysupport personnel for hardware support from Institute forClinical Research itself. Each dataset from different repositories will be pooled and linked deterministically with the use of a unique, common patientidenti er (Figure 1 ). This is possible in Malaysia as each person has unique personal identi cation numbers .If shared identi ers are not available, an alternative approach is to use patient-matching algorithms to determine whether two sets ofinformation belong to separate patients or the same patient. However, the matching algorithms requires the availability ofsome basic data elements such as patient name- rst and last, birth date, gender, address and hospital. In situation where datacustodians do not allow transfer of individual-level data to thestudy coordinating centre, the data linkage and analysis will beperformed at their sites. Data extraction and linkage will beperformed by the research team or data custodians. 3.7 Sample Size The estimated number of cases (i.e., vaccinated cases with an event in the risk or control interval) needed for a self- controlled design to have 80% power under the range ofassumed effect sizes and the proportion of the observationperiod in the risk interval are shown in Table 3 (Musonda et al., 2006 ). The target sample size to identify a clinically relevant rate ratio of 1.5 for this study was set to 250 events toachieve 80% power. All eligible cases will be included and post-hoc power calculation will be determined based on total casesidenti ed during this study. 3.8 Construction of the Study Cohort A cohort of patients hospitalized and vaccinated during the study period will be constructed. For patients with multiplehospitalizations for the same diagnosis, only the rst hospitalization during the study period will be included inanalysis. The cohort will be linked with records of hospitaladmissions from the previous years to exclude patients whohad previous admissions for the same diagnosis within thelast 2 consecutive years. COVI D-19 infection status will be ascertained by linking the cohort with the database ofTABLE 1 | International Classi cation of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modi cation (ICD-10CM) codes for pre-speci ed Adverse Events of Special Interest and recommended risk windows.

All outcome events that occurred during the study period and ful lled the criteria will be identi ed and categorized according to de ned time intervals. FIGURE 1 | Linkage of data sources for establishment of study cohort. TABLE 2 | Data sources of the study. Type Description National COVID-19 vaccination register Data on vaccination records for Malaysian population will be obtained from the register of COVID-19 vaccination, available via national COVID-19 vaccination register (MyVAS). Data elements include patientdemographics and comorbidities, date of vaccination, site of vaccination, vaccine dose, and vaccine batchnumbers Hospital-based medical records All records of hospitalizations for patients who have received COVID-19 vaccines prior to the admission will be reviewed and relevant cases will be identi ed for subsequent chart extraction. Variables to be extracted from medical records include patient details, diagnoses, date of admission, date of discharge, and dischargestatus. Risk factors potentially associated with the event and criteria for vaccination eligibility will also becollected for assessment of potential confounders National hospital discharge database Malaysian Health Data Warehouse is a central repository or database of hospitalizations at all MOH hospitals and several private hospitals in Malaysia. This administrative database is managed by the Health InformaticsCentre, MOH. Information available from this database are patient details, inpatient admission and discharge dates, and diagnoses. Discharge diagnoses are coded according to the International Classi cation of Diseases (ICD-10CM). The database is updated periodically based on quarterly data submission fromhospitals National pharmacovigilance database Data on AEFIs collated by the NPRA based on noti cations and reports received from healthcare providers via several platforms including NPRA web portal, the Pharmacy Hospital Information System, adverse drugreaction reports, and manual forms. NPRA database also include reports from public (consumer) on AEFIsreceived via online and of fline reporting form. Information available from this database include patient characteristics, vaccine administered, and details of the AEFIs. Data that have been screened and processedby NPRA will be extracted for analysis to ensure consistency of AEFIs classi cation National death register Data from the National Registration Department on all deaths registered in Malaysia. Information available from this database include patient characteristics, date and cause of death National COVID-19 cases register (e-COVID/COVID-19 linelisting)This register contains data of all COVID-19 con rmed cases in the country and include details on patient demographics, date of positive test, symptoms at diagnosis, geographical location, and presence ofcomorbidities. The database is consolidated by cases detected from different sources, ranging from entrypoint screening, targeted screening, pre-admission screening, passive detection in healthcare institutions, toscreening among the brought-in dead ( Suah et of Health; MyVAS, Malaysia Vaccine Administration System; NPRA, National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency.

COVID-19 Vaccine Safety: SAFECOVAC Study3.9 Statistical Analysis Baseline characteristics of the study population will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Categorical data willbe reported as counts and percentage while continuous datawill be reported as means with standard deviation or medianswith range. 3.9.1 Measures of Association The risk and control period for each outcome event weredetermined based on review of literature and consultationwith subject matter experts ( Table 1 )(Smeeth et al., 2004 ; Qudah et al., 2012 ;Brighton Collaboration, 2021 ;Lufkin et ;Simpson et al., 2021 ) .T h ei n t e r v a lw i l la l s ot a k ei n t o account vaccine dose interval, depending on vaccine type anddosing schedule. The self-controlled case-series models will be tted using a conditional Poisson regre ssion model with logarithm of time in each interval as the offset ( Kawai and Arana, 2020 ). Rates will be calculated based on the number of eventsduring the interval and the amount of time the patient contributes to the interval. I ncidence rate ratios and the corresponding 95% con dence interval will be computed for each outcome event. For vaccination case-coverage method, association between vaccination and outcomes of interest will be calculated as theodds ratio for vaccination in the cases compared with thematched population. This will be computed using logisticregression with the outcome indicating whether vaccinationoccurred in the case 's exposure or comparison window ( Kawai and Arana, 2020 ). The logarithm of the expected odds of vaccination within the exposure window will be entered into the model as an offset term. The expected probability of vaccination inside the exposure window for each case will beobtained from the reference population. Strati ed models will be used to estimate the risk for subgroups, including but not limited to age and sexstrati cation. Additional analyses will be undertaken by varying the risk periods and using adjacent risk periods toassess for any clustering of events during a speci c period.3.10 Ethics and Dissemination Study data will be handled and stored responsibly and in accordance with applicable da ta protection and privacy laws with password protected folders and data les. Data protection and privacy regulations will be observed in collecting, forwarding, processing, and storing of data. No patient-leveldata will be shared outside of the Institute for ClinicalResearch, Malaysia or investigation team and the data willnot be stored in les that do not meet the requirements of integrity and security. Deidenti cation of dataset will be performed for statistical analysis. Con dentiality and security protocols will be in place to restrict access toinformation as appropriate. Study data will be retained forat least ve years after completion of the research, archived in a secure server, and destroyed after the speci ed storage period. Study results will be published following guidelines, including those for authorship, established by the InternationalCommittee of Medical Journal Editors ( ICMJE, 2021 ). When reporting results of this study, the appropriateStrengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies inEpidemiology (STROBE) checklist will be followed ( von Elm et al., 2008 ). Study data will not be returned or informed to respective patients. The study results will bereported only in aggregate form and it will not be possibleto identify any individual patients from the data that will bepresented. No personal inform ation will be disclosed and individual patients will not be identi ed when study ndings are published. The study outcomes will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications withcompliance to the International Committee of MedicalJournal Editors guidelines for authorship. 4 DISCUSSION To the best of our knowledge, this study will be among the fewfrom low- and middle-income countries and Asian population onCOVID-19 vaccine safety evaluation in real-world environment.Findings from this study will be useful for monitoringdevelopment of anticipated AESIs potentially related toCOVID-19 vaccination to complement or reaf rm results provided by clinical trials. Furthermore, the ndings will provide analysis of real-world data which can informdeliberations by government and public health decisionmakers relative to the re nement of COVID-19 vaccination recommendations. As the number of vaccinated people around the world increases, growing data from clinical studies including real-world surveillance are important for long-term monitoringof vaccine 's safety and effective pro les in the population (Petousis-Harris, 2020 ). These data will further form the basis on whether the vaccine is eligible for full approval since allCOVID-19 vaccines approved for use in Malaysia arecurrently available under emergency use authorization by theNPRA with conditional approval ( National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency, 2020 ). For this study, the case-based monitoring approach addresses the potential limitation of underreporting in theTABLE 3 | Sample size estimation.

COVID-19 Vaccine Safety: SAFECOVAC Studyexisting passive surveillance system to detect AESIs in the population. It consists of active surveillance to nd cases rather than relying on voluntary reporting for vaccine safetyassessment. Combination of passive and active safety surveillance systems is recommended for monitoring vaccine safety after licensure, but the latter is often time-and resource-consuming ( World Health Organization, 2021 ). However, the increasing availability of automated database and electronic health records led to the approachof using large-linked database for population-based orhospital-based active surveillance for identi cation and validation of vaccine and drug safety issues based onsecondary use of existing data ( Scheifele et al., 2002 ;Huang et al., 2014 ). The feasibility of conducting active surveillance to quantify adverse events is highly dependent on availability and completeness of data and it is largely applicable to high- income countries where advanced systems and establisheddata sources are readily av ailable. In Malaysia, the integration of the COVID-19 vaccination data into theMyVAS to track vaccine administration enables vaccinationstatus to be linked with other secondary data sources ( Suah et al., 2021 ). This further allows record linkage to be performed across the heterogenous data sources to form a cohort study ina nationwide setting. As such, this study highlights thefeasibility of conducting hospital-based active surveillancefor vaccine or drug safety evaluations and demonstrate the value of routinely collected healthcare datasets for detecting adverse events. This approach can be considered forenhancement of post approval vaccine and drug safetysurveillance systems in the country. There are several plausible limitations in this study that we acknowledge. First, there is potential misclassi cation of study variables which is unavoidable in studies utilising secondarydata resources. Next, the statistical power to analyse rareoutcomes might be limited, given the potential variation infollow-up time periods. Data c overage in the MyHDW hospital admission database for private hospitals is lower compared to public hospitals; however, admission to public hospitals account for nearly 70% of total hospital admissions in thecountry ( Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2019 ). The use of routinely collected data and administrative database forsurveillance are known to be subjected to availability oftimely and complete data. For this study, the time-lagassociated with obtaining complete data applies to bothhospital admission database and death registry. Oneapproach that will be used is to delay the analysis for aperiod of time until suf cient data becomes available. As such, it limits our ability to conduct a near real-time AESI surveillance. Furthermore, other possible confounders such as disease severity, socioeconomic statuses might not be capturedwithin the existing database and thus, impact of unmeasured confounders could not be evaluated. In summary, ndings from this study will provide insights on the AESIs occurred following COVID-19 vaccination in a real- world setting and contributes to the global data on vaccine safety for comparison. The study protocol provides a framework of acoordinated approach in performing vaccine safety assessmentvia linkage of several secondary data sources, despite thechallenges pertaining to the integration of heterogenous datasources. ETHICS STATEMENT This study was approved by the M edical Research and Ethics Committee, MOH Malaysia. This is a non-interventionalstudy using secondary data coll ection with minimal risk to patients. Personal identi ers are required for the linkage process, but will be removed from the newly createddatabase after merging is complete with no breach ofcondentiality with regards to personal identi ers or health information.
