Frequencies of CD8 + effector (TEFF) and central memory (TCM) T cells along with total IgG, IgG2c, and IgG1 titres were measured to ascertain how timing and location of CpG conditioning influenced vaccination outcome. Prior treatment with CpG enhanced TEFF, TCM, as well as total IgG responses. TEFF and TCM responses were greatest when CpG was given intradermally and prior to s.c. ovalbumin, conditions that eliminated the fraction of TCM 'non-responders' observed after s.c.[CpG + Ova] vaccination. IgG responses were polarized toward IgG2c after early s.c. CpG but toward IgG1 after early i.d. CpG. Separating CpG adjuvant and antigen application in time and space can improve vaccination outcome.
