(A) Synthetic HA1 gene sequence including restriction enzyme sites. (B) Sequences of the recombinant protein, HA1 gene of influenza virus A/New York/3571/2009 (H1N1) was cloned into the 6\u00d7-His-tagged baculovirus transfer vector pAcGP67A. (C) rHA1 protein using baculovirus system was determined by Coomassie blue staining and silver Fig. 2 Validation of the ELISA system in human. (A, B) rHA1 protein could detect anti-HA1-specific antibody effectively both in patients with influenza virus infection (A) and after vaccination (B). (C) A table of diagnostic performance on the ELISA system, in comparison with HI assay and MNT. ***p<0.001, patients vs. controls interval. Fig. 3 Measurements of anti-rHA1 antibodies in mice. (A) Experimental schedule of the vaccination and challenge in mice. (B, C) Body weight changes (B) and survival rate (C) in control and vaccinated mice after influenza virus infection. (D) The level of anti-rHA1 antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in all groups of mice. (E) Anti-rHA1 antibodies were positively correlated with titers in HI assay (r=0.508, p<0.001). Black dots, PBS; gray dots, 0.2 \u00b5g; blue dots, 0.5 \u00b5g; red dots, 0.8 days post infection.
