Long -term and nonspecific symptoms have previously been reported following other viral infections , and after bacterial and parasitic infections. It is also known that people who are admitted to the intensive care unit due to severe lung failure caused by other diseases than COVID -19, can report long -term functional impairments such as impaired cognitive function , mental health problems and reduced lung function after discharge. As of early 2023, m ost of the Norwegian population is vaccinat ed and has undergone an infection with the Omicron variant. We are not aware of research relevant on this population group compared to non -COVID -19 controls , hence there is a need to review primary research systematically. Objectives We aimed to summaris e research on the proportion of patients who report long -term symptoms at least 6 months after Omicron infection , which long -term symptoms occur after COVID -19 due to the Omicron variant , how long the symptoms persist and which patient groups that have the greatest risk of experiencing long -term symptoms. Method s We have previously published a rapid review about Post COVID -19 condition that was las t update d in December 2022. The review published in December 2022 include d data on all previous SARS -CoV -2 variant s, whereas the current review is limited to post COVID -19 condition following infectio ns caused by Omicron . This report supplements the December 2022 report, in which we limited our search to probabl e Omicron cases . We included controlled studies with more than 300 mainly laboratory test positive COVID -19 cases with a follow -up time of six months or longer . We excluded studies mainly reporting on laboratory or radiological finding s, uncontrolled studies , and controlled studies that had not been peer -reviewed . The findings are based on systematic searches in MEDLINE and WHO Global research on coronavirus disease ( COVID -19) database on April 14th, 202 3. Two researcher s screened the search results with machine learning support . 3 Results We screened 6918 studies. No studies matching our inclusion criteria were identified. Discussion There is a lack of controlled studies examining the long -term effects of the Omicron variant compared to non -COVID -19 controls including vaccinated patients who experienced mild or moderate disease. Th e latter population is especially relevant to the Norwegian setting . While there are initial studies with short follow -up indicating a lower prevalence of long -term symptoms after Omicron infections , it is crucial to conduct more controlled studies to obtain reliable and comprehensive data. Generalizing early findings from different populations to the broader society can be misleading and may not accurately reflect the specific situation in Norway. While the urgency of the pandemic has understandably driven researchers to publish their findin gs quickly, it is essential to prioritize thoroughness and quality in the research process. We see a need to conduct a new search for relevant research within a year of our search, to provide an up to date and reliable overview of evidence. Conclusion There is a lack of controlled studies that have investigated the long -term symptoms following an Omicron infection compared to non -COVID -19 controls . Preliminary evidence suggests that the health impacts after an Omicron infection differ in comparison to other SARS -CoV -2 variants. The earliest studies suggest that there may be a lower likelihood of long -term symptoms associated with Omicron. A ssumptions derived from studies conducted during the early stages of the pandemic are less relevant to the current context. This is of particularly relevan ce in Norway, where most of the population was vaccinated prior to infection to the clinically milder Omicron variant. There is a need for controlled studies to be conducted on the late effect s that may result from an Omicron infection to guide public policy decisions. 4 Norsk s ammendrag Bakgrunn For de WHO Global research on coronavrius disease (COVID -19) database 14. april 2023.

Aiming to offer customised treatment, policy makers, health care professionals and patients need access to up -to-date evidence about long -term symptoms after COVID -19. Since the Omicron variant has replaced earlier variants, in the 5th version of this rapid review, we searched evidence aiming to explore: 1. Which proportion of Omicron patients experience lon g-term symptoms at least six months after COVID -19? 2. Which symptoms after Omicron are seen in post COVID -19 condition? 3. Which factors are associated with long -term symptoms of COVID -19 after Omicron? 4. How does post COVID -19 condition after Omicron differ from long -term effects of other respiratory tract infections? The post COVID -19 condition team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) has commissioned this rapid review as a supplementary follow -up to a rapid review published 19th December 2022 (1). 8 Methods Literature s earch We applied an open search strategy to identify all relevant studies on the prevalence of l ong- term COVID -19 symptoms, demographic and medical risk factors associated with symptoms on follow -up, and studies analysing the impact of long -term symptoms of COVID -19. We defined the inclusion criteria prior to the search . We included studies of participants with confirmed COVID - 19, that report ed on symptoms, quality of life, and predicting factors for long -term symptoms. One research er (JH) conducted the search on April 14th, 202 3, in the MEDLINE database for studies published in the period 01.07.202 2 -13.04.202 3. We expanded t his search with a search in the WHO Global research on coronavirus disease ( COVID -19) database on April 14th, 202 3 (limited 202 2-23; five datab ases: EMBASE, EuropePMC, Scopus, ProQuest Central, Web of Science, and English language) (Appendix 1). Inclusion criteria : Population: More than 300 COVID -19 positive participants followed up with non -COVID - 19 controls, infected with identified omicron variant or after 1.01.22 (or studies reporting on the omicron subgroup specifically) Outcome: Any long -term symptoms, consequences associated with COVID -19 (excluding studies only /mainly reporting on laboratory or radiological findings ) Follow -up: Includ ed participants followed up for median/mean six months or longer . Studies reporting cumulative/aggregated follow -up data combined for the acute phase (first 3 months) and beyond were exc luded , unless compared with another acute illness. Study types: Cohort studies (prospective and retrospective ), case -controls, registry -based studies, cross -sectional criteria: Non -peer -review ed studies , abstracts, letters, studies limited to participants with one main underlying disease Review p rocess Two researcher s (JH, HL ) performed title and abstract screening supported by machine learning . Two researchers (JH , HL) planned to re view studies in full text , select studies for inclusion, extract , and summaris e data/results from included studies in tables. A senior researcher in the field provided feedback for the study selection process and methodological approach ( KGB). 9 Quality assessment It was planned that two reviewer s would use the RoB SPEO tool developed by the World Health Organisation and the International Labour Organisation to assess the risk of bias of included studies (2). We would have resolved a ny uncertainty regarding the risk of bias of a study through discussion among review authors. We did not plan to assess t he certainty of the available evidence. Data extraction We planned to extract i nformation on study country, participants, follow -up period , symptom prevalence and statistics (e.g., odds ratio, rate ratio , hazard ratio) . We planned to describe studies with participants mainly below 18 years of age separately . Data analysis We planned to export d ata tables of extracted endpoints to Micro soft Excel and PowerPoint for data analysis and visualisation . Visualisation s were to be based on available datapoints . Peer review Since no studies were identified we did not consider peer review necessary. 10 Results Description of studies Results of the literature search We identified zero unique references matching our inclusion criteria through the sy stematic literature searches . JH and HL screened all potentially relevant titles and abstracts in EPPI reviewer (3). We screened 3214 references with priority screening . We used studies included in our previous reviews as a basis to train a machine learning model (Appendix 2). No unique studies matched ou r inclusion criter ia. Records screened by human (n = 3214 ) Records identified through MEDLINE database (n = 3830) WHO Global research on coronavirus disease (COVID -19) database (n = 3490) Records excluded by screening (n = 6 918 ) Records excluded due to less than 30% probability of likely relevance (n = 3704 ) Full-text studies assessed for eligibility and quality (n = 0) Records after deduplication (n = 6918) Included studies (n = 0) Figure 1 . Flow diagram of search strategy and study inclusion 11 Discussion We were not able to identif y any studies following up participants with COVID -19 Omicron variant and non- COVID -19 controls for six months or longer. Our previous re view on post - COVID -19 condition published in December 2022 included 14 studies , none of which matched the inclusion criteria for Omicron infected patients . This follow -up report supplements the December 2022 report. An anticipated lesser number of controlled studies on O micron led us to reduce the number of participants from 500 to 300 without impacting our findings. Based on our iterative updates, our current findings suggest that the publication speed is slower than expected . Studies that were anticipated to provide variant -specific analysis compared with non- COVID -19 controls have not yet been published. As our fund amental research questions remain unchanged, it is reasonable to expect that the majority of all COVID- 19 patients, those infected by Omicron, will be analysed by researchers in an equivalent manner or more thoroughly to those of earlier variants. Our screening of titles and abstracts has shown that the first controlled studies are now being published, indicating that there will soon be studies with sufficient follow -up relevant to the Norwegian population . These early studies on Omicron patients with short follow -up suggest a lower prevalence of long -term symptoms after infection with Omicron compared to other SARS -CoV -2 variants (4, 5, 6, 7, 8) . In absence of a systematic search for short follow -up studies we have not come across studies indicating higher prevalence of long -term symptoms or increased severity of long -term symptoms after the acute phase of infection by O micron. This systematic review highlights the limited evidenc e on the population that is most relevant to the Norwegian setting, which is vaccinated individuals experienc ing mainly mild or moderate disease following Omicron infection . It is important to exercise caution when generali sing early findings from different populations to the overall society. The severity of infection is a risk factor for a reduced quality of life, and ICU patients are the hardest hit. Vaccination has been shown to contribute to milder infections and fewer and shorter symptoms durin g the post -acute COVID- 19 period (9, 10) . Given that Omicron infections are generally milder , and that most people in Norway have been vaccinated, earlier findings may be less relevant to the Norwegian population. However, it is crucial to identify reliable data for this variant and not rely on outdated research that was produced under the pressure of a rapidly changing pathogen. The emergence of Omicron marks a new phase of variant stability . The lack of identified studies in this review may suggest a shift away from the rapid publication speed seen in t he early pandemic. Possibly pandemic -related research is transitioning to more standard publication timelines, th is may contribute to higher quality studies with fewer biases. We are aware of one recently published systematic review with less stringent inclusion criteria looking at d ifferent SARS -CoV -2 Variants of Concern . The authors found a lower prevalence of long -term symptoms after COVID -19 in individuals infected with the O micron variant compared to earlier variants. However, t heir open inclusion criteria led the authors to conclude that 12 heterogeneity and the short follow -up of included studies limit s their certainty in the findings (8). There is an urgent need for controlled studies on the long -term effects of the Omicron variant . Although our knowledge has rapidly grown, early findings are no longer represen tative of the current challenges the healthcare system faces . We need up to date evidence relevant to the local Norwegian setting. It is also important to investigate how the long -term effects of Omicron vary across diverse population subgroups . Investigating the long -term effects of Omicron is critical for developing comprehensive public health strategies. 13 Conclusion There is a lack of controlled studies that have investigated the long -term symptoms following an Omicron infection compared to non -COVID -19 controls . Preliminary evidence suggests that the health impacts after an Omicron infection differ in comparison to other SARS -CoV -2 variants. The earliest studies suggest that there may be a lower likelihood of long -term symptoms associated with Omicron. A ssumptions derived from studies conducted during the early stages of the pandemic are less relevant to the current context. This is of particularly relevan ce in Norway, where most of the population was vaccinated prior to infection to the clinically milder Omicron variant. There is a need for controlled studies to be conducted on the l ate effects that may result from an Omicron infection to guide public policy decisions. 14 References 1.

We initiated screening through EPPI reviewers Priority S creening with single screening by two researchers. We chose to label studies matching solely the categorical (topic) criteria as \"includes \", based on the assumption that numerical (dates, participants number, etc.) criteria can appear arbitrary to a machine learning model, and hence undermine the ability of a machine learning model to identify most relevant studies based on similarity. At three intervals we reviewed \" includes \" to finetune the selection of studies used to identify further relevant studies. Upon our last finetuning of \" includes \" it became apparent that none of the cat egorically relevant studies also satisfied the numerical inclusion criteria. To confirm that we identified all categorical relevant studies we conducted a keyword searc h for \"Omicron\", screening 1063 studies with the keyword in title or abstract: no studies matching both categorical and numerical criteria were identified (see figure 2). After screening a total of 3214 studies we build a machine learning model , to differentiate between categorically relevant studies and already excluded studies. Six \"includes \" from the priority screening plus 10 studies included in our previous report were considered as categorically relevant . We applied the model to the u nscreened studies and excluded all studies with less than 30% probability of relevance . Figure 3 depicts the distribution of studies by their likelihood for relevance.
