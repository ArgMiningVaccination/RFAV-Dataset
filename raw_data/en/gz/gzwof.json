Report 2017-2020 The Department of Biomedicine (DBM) unites the lab - oratory-based research of the faculty of medicine of the University of Basel. In the DBM, the laboratories of the former \"pre-clinical institutes\" as well as the clin - ical divisions of the University Hospitals are brought together under a common leadership with the goal to focus their efforts and to strive for excellence in bio - medical research. In the 20 years since the department was founded, we enjoyed continuous growth and flour - ishing of our research. By providing a bridge between basic science and clinical medicine, the DBM is an im - portant component in the University of Basel's strate - gic plan for the Life Sciences and a key player in the national \"Swiss Personalized Health Initiative\" (SPHN). The DBM concentrates on research in four focal ar - eas: Oncology, Immunology, Neurobiology, and Stem Cells & Regenerative Medicine. DBM's research groups are to a large part supported by their own research funds from competitive grants by national foundations, the EU and other countries. More than 50% of the positions are funded by third parties. The DBM has attracted individual grants as well as synergy grants from the European Research Council (ERC), the Swiss Initiative in Systems Biology (Sys- temsX.ch) and the Swiss National Science Foun - dation (SNSF). We are particularly proud of hosting a substantial number of young research group leaders supported by competitive career development grants by the ERC, the SNSF, and private foundations. This report summarizes the activities of over 60 DBM research groups during the period of 2017-2020. The reports are grouped thematically according to the four focal areas. Each research group has selected their most relevant publications from this period. A com - plete list of all publications can be found in the annex of this report. The DBM and our research groups are reg - ularly evaluated by the Scientific Advisory Board that consists of nine internationally recognized experts. During their yearly visits, the Advisory Board mem - bers evaluate and make recommendations on how to improve the organization of the department. They also provide an important basis for decisions, includ - ing promotions and changes in future directions. Key to the success of the DBM has been the enthusiasm of our scientists and clinicians from over 40 countries to communicate and to perform inter- and transdis -ciplinary work resulting in benchmark biomedical re - search. The research is supported by a growing num - ber of Core Facilities. While some Core Facilities are for the DBM only, others are joint ventures between our department with the Biozentrum (Faculty of Natu - ral Sciences) and also the D-BSSE Institute of the ETH Z\u00fcrich in Basel. The access to these key technologies is of immeasurable value to us. A major milestone is the project for a new DBM build - ing, which will replace the old Biozentrum located at Klingelbergstrasse 70. The new DBM building is sched - uled to be inaugurated in 2028 and will unite all DBM research groups in a single location situated in close vicinity of the new Biozentrum and the new D-BSSE of the ETH. This new campus will provide an excellent basis for expanding collaborative re- search between clinical and basic science at the highest competitive level. The DBM is committed to the highest quality and in - novation in research. This report portraits the scientif - ic excellence and enthusiasm of our research groups. It also coincides with the closure of my term as head of the DBM. Starting in June 2021, Ivan Martin will be - come the new head and will lead the DBM during the transition to our new DBM building and the years to come. Prof. Dr. Radek Skoda Head of the Department of BiomedicinePreface 8 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020Mission Statement The mission of the Department of Biomedicine (DBM) at the University of Basel is to promote integrated research excellence in biomedical science. We emphasize research in neurobiology, infection and immunity, cancer, and stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. The DBM provides a stimulating environment with state-of-the-art facilities, enabling biomedical research of the highest quality, while also training the next generation of leaders in basic and clinical research. Central to our mission, non-clinical and clinical scientists work side by side to foster a translational environment across all of our disease-relevant scientific themes, benefiting the lives of patients in areas of unmet need. Translational research: Developing novel therapeutic approaches to fulfill the unmet medical need of our patients. 9 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020 10 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020New DBM Building Modell: \u00a9 Joseph Riegger To further grow together as one department, all re - search groups, core facilities and staff of today's five locations will move under the same roof. The new DBM will complete the ongoing developments on the Sch\u00e4l - lem\u00e4tteli Campus by joining the new buildings of the Biozentrum (2021) and the ETH Department of Bio - systems Sciences and Engineering (2021) - creating a magnet for life science research in the Basel area with international reach. It will allow DBM researchers to interact more closely within the department but also with researchers of the neighbouring institutions. These interactions are further strengthened by jointly operated research core facilities, providing access to key technologies. By 2028, all DBM researchers will work in a new building on the Sch\u00e4llem\u00e4tteli Life Sciences Campus. 11 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020 Visualisation: Caruso St John Architects Foremost, the proximity of the DBM research labs to the University Clinics of the USB and UKBB will facil - itate exchange and collaborations between scientists and physicians working on different disease areas, us - ing complementary approaches and methodologies. This interdisciplinary exchange is the basis for a quick translation from bench to bedside in order for newly generated knowledge to be rapidly used in the devel - opment of new diagnostics or therapies for the bene- fit of patients. The new DBM building will create synergies that lead to the professionalization of technical and research ser - vices and a more efficient operation. These are the key for creating a competitive environment, where resear- chers can work more efficiently in state-of-the-art lab - oratories, core facilities and infrastructures. The new nine-storey building for the Department of Biomedicine will provide space for around 800 DBM employees and 200 students. The laboratory building will provide the DBM with six research floors, one floor for the core facilities and one floor with a science lounge and meeting rooms. On the public ground floor, the building will additionally offer laboratory course rooms as well as teaching rooms for university use. The building will be owned by the University of Basel and is being planned by the Basel-based architec - tural firm Burckhardt+Partner. After the construction phase by a total contractor, the building is scheduled to go into operation at the beginning of the semester in autumn 2028 at the earliest. 12 Department of Biomedicine .

Report 2017-2020Core Facilities of the Department of Biomedicine Scientific core facilities are an integral part of the DBM research landscape. They enable cutting-edge research by helping to economically and efficiently take ad - vantage of state-of-the-art technology and collaborate with expert staff. The highly trained facility members serve the evolving needs of the DBM research groups by following up with the latest technological advances, giving compre - hensive trainings to the users or by coordinating grant applications to purchase new equipment. DBM core facilities are providing their service at no or very lit - tle costs, minimizing the administrative burden and leveraging resources to sup - port investigator-driven science. Dedicated steering committees evaluate the ser - vices and provide guidance to the core facility heads in order to improve the core facility infrastructure, technology and management for the benefit of the DBM re - search groups. While DBM members have access to in-house core facilities for bioinformatics, flow cytometry & cell sorting, light microscopy, histology and for the production of medicinal products according to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), the DBM joins forces with other life sciences institutions in Basel to run core facilities for next generation sequencing technologies and genomics research, design and generation of custom transgenic rodent models, preclinical nuclear molecular im - aging, electron microscopy, and high-performance computing. The DBM has a long history in sharing and centralizing common equipment to le - verage resources. In the absence of dedicated core facility personnel, these fa - cilities are maintained by members of DBM research groups or by technical staff. Such technologies that are available to all researchers include facilities for robot - ics, tissue culture, biobanking and other high-end applications. Together, these core facilities play a central role in creating a competitive research environment and contribute significantly to the scientific success of the Depart - ment of Biomedicine.31 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020 Medium change in cell culture32 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020 Good Manufacturing PD Dr. Werner Krenger werner.krenger @unibas.ch DBM HebelstrasseIntroduction Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) is a system to ensure that medicinal prod - ucts intended for human use are produced according to stringent quality stan - dards. Swiss manufacturers of medicinal products must comply with international GMP guidelines set forth by the European Union (EU). These GMP standards are built on three pillars: 1) Medicinal products for human use have to be manufactured at controlled sites that are adequately equipped, 2) the manufacturer has to demonstrate appropriate professional and technical knowledge that is provided by qualified staff, and 3) a Pharmaceutical Quality System (PQS) system needs to be established by the manufacturer. The DBM is approved by Swissmedic to operate a GMP core fa - cility which is located on the 4th floor of the ZLF. Service The \"GMP core facility DBM\" owns a license for manufacturing of investigational advanced therapy medicinal products (investigational ATMPs); i.e. medicines for human use that are based on genes, cells or tissue engineering and that are used in clinical trials. The core facility offers as \"Provider\" central services to individual DBM research groups (\"Users\") that are affiliated with clinical investigator teams. Training of all staff (both core facility staff and research group staff) is organized by the core facility staff. Interested persons not currently affiliated with research groups working in the facility or planning to do so in the future are also welcome to attend basic training sessions. Affiliation and Staff Both the core facility provider and the DBM research group users are required to contribute to the implementation of a fully functional PQS necessary for the certifi - cation and release of GMP-compliant ATMPs: the core facility staff forms a \"Qual - ity Assurance\" unit headed by PD Dr. W. Krenger who also certifies and releases the final product for patient use in his official function of a \"Qualified Person\". Ad - ditional functions mandated by the PQS need to be provided by members of the individual research teams wishing to manufacture products in the facility. These functions include at minimum a Quality Control manager (QC), a Manufacturing Manager and a Product Manager who is usually the Principal Investigator of the research group or the clinical investigator team. Activity 2017-2020 The GMP core facility DBM is uniquely suited to contribute to innovations in cellu - lar therapies. In the time period from 2017 to 2020, cartilage tissue was engineered and used in a phase II clinical trial to treat knee cartilage injuries at the USB and also at hospitals abroad. In early 2020, the technical groundwork was laid for a second group to join the facility in order to study cellular therapy with tumor-infil - trating lymphocytes in a new phase I clinical trial.Core Facilities33 Department of Biomedicine .

Report 2017-2020 Bioinformatics Dr. Robert Ivanek robert.ivanek@unibas.ch Head Facility and SIB Group Leader https://biomedizin.unibas. ch/services/bioinformatics-core-facilityThe Bioinformatics Core Facility provides a centralized resource of expertise in computational biology and statistics, available to all DBM researchers. It offers sup - port for the analysis and visualization of large-scale biological data. The platform also provides training in bioinformatics and facilitates access to high-performance computational resources. Design and analysis of the high-throughput biological experiments The aim of the Bioinformatics Core Facility is to implement solutions for the design, analysis, visualization, interactive exploration and interpretation of large-scale ge - nomic and proteomic data. Over the years, the facility has supported more than fif - ty research groups for genomic projects involving assays such as gene - cal contacts between genomic elements (4C-seq), identification of sequence vari - ants (DNA-seq). More recently the facility has developed the expertise to analyze data from newly emerged technologies: single cell expression profiling (scRNAs - eq), high-dimensionality flow cytometry data (CyTOF) and high-throughput pro - teomics. Beside supporting standardized approaches, the platform also develops customized solutions tailored towards the needs of individual research projects. Bioinformatics training The Bioinformatics Core Facility trains and advises researchers at the DBM. Fur - thermore, it is a point of contact for the bioinformaticians embedded within the DBM research groups, with whom they meet in bi-weekly seminars. The facility also organizes bioinformatics teaching at the University of Basel in col - laboration with computational biologists from the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research. This comprises two full semester lecture series and exer - cises: 1. \"Introduction to R\", a hands-on course on the basic usage of R software with a focus on data exploration and visualization, and basic statistics. 2. \"Analysis of genomics data with R and Bioconductor\", an advanced course giv - ing students an overview of typical Bioconductor based analysis pipelines in - cluding: NGS data processing, differential gene expression analysis, single-cell data, DNA binding analysis, working with sequence and annotation packages and visualization of genomic data. Fostering interactions within and outside of Basel The platform's mission is to build and maintain an infrastructure for comprehensive and strong bioinformatics analysis which empowers the biomedical research at the DBM. To keep track with recent technological developments and the increas - ing number of bioinformatics approaches and tools, the Bioinformatics Core Facil - ity closely interacts with other bioinformatics units in the Basel area (e. g., sciCORE, Biozentrum, FMI). The Bioinformatics Core Facility is a member of Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB). The facility also actively contributes to the Bioconductor project and are involved in the development of packages Gviz, seqLogo, Explore - ModelMatrix Project discussion at the Bioinformatics Core Facility36 Department of Biomedicine . Report is a centralized platform that provides cutting-edge microscopes and expert support to all DBM researchers. Infrastructure and equipment The facility staff is currently supervising over 30 and plate scanning, live-cell imaging, flow cytometer im - aging, stereo, and laser capture microdissection. The facility also provides re - sources for image analysis, including high-end computers, virtual machines, data and image analysis servers, and several commercial and open-source image anal - ysis softwares. Training and support The facility trains and advises researchers throughout the entire microscopy pro - cess, from initial idea to publication. Support often starts with a conversation about the biology and leads to a robust microscopy experimental design that in - cludes sample preparation, choice of microscope, software for image visualization, and strategy for analysis. Researchers are then trained to work independently at the corresponding microscopes and computers. Future developments In order to learn and develop new microscopy technology, the facility is embed - ded in European and Swiss microscopy networks. In the Basel area, the academ - ic microscopy facilities are organized within the Microscopy Network Basel (MNB, https://microscopynetwork.unibas.ch/home). The MNB facilitates interactions on the levels of sharing resources and knowledge, fostering collaborations and co-or - ganizing courses, equipment demonstrations, seminars or symposia. While the core facility staff is constantly keeping up with the latest technological developments, a steering committee of DBM research group leaders is providing instrumental guidance. This allows the facility to swiftly adapt to the needs of the DBM research community. For example, several groups at the DBM recognized the importance of multiplex imaging, and the facility was able to react by hiring a multiplex analyst and investing in software and hardware to make the technique accessible to all DBM researchers.Core Report 2017-2020 38 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020 Researcher working on a flow cytometer in the Flow Cytometry Facility. Flow CytometryIntroduction The Flow Cytometry Facility is a centralized platform that provides advanced in - strumentation as well as high-level technical and scientific expertise in multi-di - mensional flow cytometry and cell sorting, to facilitate science, improve the quality and advance the scope of DBM research. We have more than 60 research groups, from the four different focal areas of research, using the Flow Cytometry Facility. Until recently flow cytometry was limited to the analysis of fluorochromes that had distinct emissions spectra and the instruments were able to separate each with specific filters. For some years that in flow cytometry was possible to analyze the whole emission spectra of the dyes but we were limited with the number of excita - tion lasers that were available on this specific instrument. Recently, a new instru - ment with up to 5 lasers and 67 detectors, have opened the field supporting the analysis of the complete emission spectra of each dye. This allowed for the anal - ysis and separation of fluorochromes with very similar spectra. One of the advan - tages is the detection of simultaneous parameters on the same sample, the limit is always increasing still at the moment it was possible to do 40 parameters simul - taneously. At the DBM we were one of the first in Switzerland to have this technology avail - able for the researchers, opening new possibilities for scientific discoveries. In only a few months, this instrument was being used by more than 8 research groups in the different focal areas. Service The facility is responsible for the maintenance and quality control of all instruments, as well as, to give support to the researchers at all steps of the experiment, from the initial idea and experimental design to publication. The importance of good experimental design will be essential for a robust data analysis, and it includes sample preparation, choice of instrument for acquisition and analysis strategy. The facility is providing one-to-one training for all researchers in the flow analyz - ers. This allows a specialized train based on the researcher experience and exper - iment to acquire, making sure that the later independent use of the instrument is a success. Then, for any correlation between experiment data sets, the instruments must be in the same conditions as before, this is why is so important to have good mainte - nance and quality check control. While the flow analyzers are operated by trained researchers, the high-speed cell sorters are mainly operated by the facility staff. Core Facilities Telma Lopes Department Biomedicine .

Report 2017-2020 HistologyIntroduction In a scientific world dominated by the high-throughput and -omics methodologies, there is still space for the ancient discipline of histology. The study of tissue morphology, the interaction between cells, the intra-and extra- cellular localisation of molecular markers are the bases of this discipline, that over the centuries, does not lose its importance in the basic and translational research. The Histology Core Facility (HCF) has been established at the DBM in 2019, to sup - port the DBM research activities in the specific field of histology. The Facility is located at the Anatomy Institute, in Pestalozzistrasse 20. Diego Ca - labrese is the head of the Facility and he is assisted by Andreas Ochsenbein and, recently, from Myl\u00e8ne Toranelli. Mission The primary mission of the HCF is to train and support scientists at the DBM, to enable them to establish and execute histology protocols specific to their individu - al experimental settings. This also ensures that research groups can maintain and pass-on the corresponding know-how within their groups and/or share them with other groups. Additionally, the Facility provides a fee-based service that can cov - er every histology protocol, including an image analysis service. Facility Organization The facility is currently run on two functional units: the Do It Yourself (DIY) platform and the Service platform. DIY platform The Facility staff supports the DIY platform in two ways: 1. The staff provides an in-depth initial training on the basic principles of histolo - gy. This mandatory training ensures that each user starts with a minimal funda - mental knowledge. 2. After the training, users are supported in their work as follows: assistance in case of equipment failure developing new methods resolving methodological problems Currently, the DIY platform provides 19 instruments, supporting 343 registered and trained users. The DIY platform is free of charge for DBM/USB/UKBB groups. Service platform Since 2019, every established histology protocol (e. g. tissue embedding and cut - ting, automated immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and in-situ hybrid - ization, and imaging analysis with a special focus on the IHC and ISH image anal - ysis) is offered by the HCF on a fee-based service platform. Other HCF responsibilities The Facility is part of a Phase 3, international, multi-center clinical trial on ovarian cancer providing: 1. centralized IHC service for all the trial sites 2. organizing a centralized biobank 3. digitization and distribution of histology data to an international reference pa - thologist network The Facility complies with the GCLP standards for the execution of those activities. The HCF provides support for preparation of histological slides for the anatomy course set up at the University of Basel.Core Facilities Dr. Diego Calabrese diego.calabrese@unibas.ch Department of Biomedicine .

Report 2017-2020Understanding the molecular events underlying diseases of the nervous system and exploiting this knowledge for improving treatment are among the major chal - lenges in the life sciences. In view of the increasing social and financial burden generated by these diseases, especially in the setting of an ageing population, the Department of Biomedicine (DBM) has defined the neurosciences as one of its fo - cal areas. The Focal Area Neurobiology of the DBM complements parallel efforts at the Biozentrum and at the Friedrich Miescher Institute (FMI) and is part of the Neuro - science Network Basel (NNB), which is acknowledged as a center of competence by the University of Basel since 2008. The NNB aims at promoting translational collaborative research and comprises more than 400 neuroscientists from 40 dif - ferent laboratories associated with the University, the University Hospitals, the FMI and the Basel Life Science Industry. Research is conducted at all levels - from molecules and synapses up to complex brain networks and behavior - thus providing outstanding research opportunities and an excellent platform for a strong educational program. The NNB offers week - ly research seminars and lecture series at the graduate and postgraduate levels, covering all aspects of basic and clinical neuroscience. The NNB is part of the tri - national educational and collaborative NEUREX network along with the neurosci - ence programs at the Universities of Freiburg (Germany) and Strasbourg (France). A major aim of the Neuroscience groups at the DBM is to take advantage of the unique expertise in the neurosciences present in the Basel area to pursue trans - lational research projects. Because of these efforts, basic and clinical neurosci - entists have already contributed to the development of innovative therapies with leading roles in international collaborations and successfully raised grant support for translational research projects from the Swiss National Science Foundation, the European Union, the Swiss Cancer League, the Swiss MS Society, various pri - vate foundations and industry. The focus of these projects is on neuroimmune (see the respective reports under focal area immunology), neurodegenerative and ge - netically determined neurological, psychiatric and neuromuscular disorders. To promote the rapid translation of research results into clinical practice the DBM Focal Area Neurobiology co-organizes the Annual Basel sium \"From Bench to Bedside\". The one-day event provides a platform for ex - change of ideas and is regularly attended by more than 150 local neuroscientists, including basic and clinical researchers from Novartis, Roche, Janssen (former Actelion), Santhera Pharmaceuticals, the FMI and the University of Basel.Neurobiology Bernhard Bettler Department of Biomedicine Physiology University of Basel Ludwig Kappos Department of Biomedicine Division of Neurology University Hospital Basel46 Department of Biomedicine .

Because GBRs are implicated in the pathophysiology of neu - rological and psychiatric disorders, we also aim at targeting molecularly defined GBR signaling complexes for therapy. In collaboration with Prof. B. Fakler (Univer - sity of Freiburg, Germany), we identifed 30 GBR-associated proteins (Pin & Bet & Fakler, Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 45, 2017). We have mapped the interactions of several of these proteins with each other and with the GBR subunits GB1 and GB2 (Fig. 1). We found that GBR components associate in a modular fashion into a variety of functionally distinct multi-protein complexes. We analyzed several GBR-associated proteins for their effects on receptor signal - ing, neuronal excitability, brain network activity and behavior. Auxiliary KCTD pro - teins, for example, regulate the kinetics of GBR-induced currents, explaining kinet - ic discrepancies between currents observed in different neurons (Fritzius et al., J. Neurosci. 37, 2017). KCTD proteins influence both strength and frequency of tha - lamic spindle oscillations, showing that kinetic effects of the KCTDs on GBR sig - naling regulate network activity (Ulrich et al., Neuropharmacol. 136, 2018). Accord - ingly, lack of KCTD16 in mice also influences behavioral responses (Cathomas et al., Behav. Brain Res. 317, 2017). Amyloid precursor protein (APP), adherens protein 1 (AJAP1) and PILR -associated neural protein (PIANP) form three mutually exclusive GBR complexes by binding to the N-terminal sushi domain of GB1a (Schwenk et al., Nat. Neurosci. 19, 2016). Because this sushi domain mediates axonal localization, we tested whether axonal trafficking of GBRs is impaired in APP-/-, AJAP1-/- or PI - ANP-/- mice (Dinamarca et al., Nat. Commun. 10, 2019). Selectively APP-/- mice exhibited a decrease in axonal GBRs (Fig. 2A) and a consequent deficit in GBR- mediated inhibition of neurotransmitter release. Trafficking of APP/GBR complex - es in axons was visualized using time-lapse imaging (Fig. 2B-D). APP associates with JIP3 and CSTN3 proteins (Fig. 1) of the axonal trafficking machinery. Complex formation with GBRs stabilizes APP at the cell surface and reduces proteolysis of APP to A , a component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease. These findings establish a link between APP/GBR complex formation, axonal trafficking of GBRs and A production. The SHRM4 protein, which is genetically associated with intellectual disability and epilepsy, controls GBR cell surface expression. Knockdown of Shrm4 in rodents impairs GBR activity, induces anxiety-like behaviors and increases susceptibility to seizures (Zapata et al., Nat. Commun. 8, 2017). Collaborative work further showed that GBRs shape the auditory map (Vickers et al., Neuron 99, 2018), evoke distinct responses in astrocytes (Mariotti et al., Nat. Commun. 9, 2018) and regulate co - caine-induced behaviors (Edwards et al., Nat. Neurosci 20, 2017). Drug Discovery Clinical use of GBR drugs is limited to agonists and the treatment of narcolepsy, spasticity and alcohol use disorders. One reason for the limited use of GBR ago - nists is that global GBR activation results in unwanted side effects. The recognition that GBRs form a variety of multi-protein complexes provides opportunities for tar - geting cell-type specific functions and individual signaling pathways (Rosenbaum et al., Nat Rev Drug Discov (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41573-020-0086-4). Targeting molecularly defined receptor complexes should reduce side effects and enable new therapeutic applications. In collaboration with the medicinal chemistry group of K.

Practice Prof. Murim Choi, Prof. Cyrill G\u00e9raud Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea (MC), Medical Faculty, University Hei - delberg (CG) GABBR2 and PIANP mutations in neuro- developmental de-novo mutations in the GB2 subunit gene GABBR2 were identified in pediatric Rett (RTT) and epileptic encephalopathy (EE) patients (e. g. Lopes et al., J Med Genet 53, 2016; Yoo et al., Ann Neurol 82, 2017; Vuillaume et al., Ann Neurol 83, 2018). Characterization of RTT and EE mutations revealed that increased constitutive receptor activ - ity reduces the efficacy of GABA. We hypothesize that a reduced efficacy of synaptically released GABA tips the excitation/inhibition balance in the brain towards more excitation. Our collaborator, Prof. M. Choi, has generated mice with inducible RTT and EE mutations in GABBR2. We will study the mechanism of pathogenesis and address how GABBR2 mutations affect synaptic GBR respons - es to identify possible therapies. A homozygous nonsense mutation in the gene for the GBR-asso - ciated protein PIANP leads to global developmen - tal delay and intellectual disability. In collaboration with Prof. C. G\u00e9raud, we showed that PIANP-/- mice exhibit autism spectrum disorder-like pheno- types (Winkler et al., Mol. Psych. 2019). Similar to APP-/- mice, PIANP-/- mice exhibit a deficit in GBR- mediated inhibition of glutamate release, support - ing that saturation of synaptic plasticity and excito - toxicity contribute to disease pathology. peptide-based inhibitors of the GBR/KCTD interaction (Sereikaite et al., J. Med. Chem. 62, 2019). These inhibitors are expected to exhibit anxiolytic properties by preventing GBR desensitization. We are currently also developing peptides in - terfering with defined presynaptic GBR complexes to facilitate glutamate release, particularly for the treatment of cognitive dysfunctions. 48 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020Fig. 1: Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Adult neural stem cells (green) are localized within the subgranular zone of the hippocampus and give rise to transient amplifying cells (yel - low). They generate postmitotic neuroblasts which subsequently differentiate into young neu - rons (red). During the following ~6 weeks, they form new dendrites and several thousand new synaptic connections with glutamatergic neurons as well as with various types of soma- and dendrite-targeting GABAergic interneurons.In the adult hippocampus new neurons are continuously generated throughout life by adult neural stem cells (Fig. 1). The newly generated young neurons show a number of distinct functional properties, including enhanced excitability, reduced GABAergic inhibition and enhanced synaptic plasticity (Lodge and Bischofberg - er 2019). Based on these cell biological findings it was concluded that the young neurons are hyperactive and hyperexcitable during learning behavior and memory processing. However, on the behavioral level adult neurogenesis improves learning by increasing the brains capability to distinguish between similar memory items, a process called \"pattern separation\". During the last research period (2017-2020) we focussed on glutamatergic and GABAergic circuit analysis, to address this ap - parent paradox of \"hyperactive cells\" versus \"improved pattern separation\". Synaptic recruitment of cells. glu - tamatergic synaptic transmission from cortical perforant-path fibers onto new - ly generated young granule cells (GCs) up to 4 weeks post mitosis (wpm, Li et al. 2017). We found that the young neurons fire action potentials (APs) as early as 2 wpm in response to a small number of active glutamatergic synapses, due to a high synaptic gain. However, due to small dendritic trees and sparse connectivity, neighboring young neurons are activated by different distinct small subsets of af - ferent fibers with minimal overlap. As the neurons mature, the increase in synapse number is balanced by a gradual decrease in intrinsic excitability. This indicates that the enhanced excitability in young granule cells does not generate hyperex - citability, but instead compensates for sparse synaptic connectivity in developing young neurons. Using paired whole-cell recordings, we could show that AP firing in neighboring young cells is not unspecific, but rather dependent on small non-over - lapping populations of afferent input fibers (Fig. 2). This is due to the sparse con - nectivity combined with the high synaptic gain, generating differential and highly specific spiking output in neighboring cells. Therefore, perforant-path fibers can recruit young neurons in a sparse and orthogonal manner, well suited to support sparse coding during hippocampal information processing.

Report 2017-2020Fig. 2: Low connectivity and high excitability in young granule cells supports orthogonal firing. (A) Sche - matic representation of the dentate. Young granule cells (shown in red) have smaller dendritic cones (outlined in grey) than mature GCs (blue). Glutamatergic (red circles) and GABAergic (blue circles) synapses are fewer and have a high impact in depolarizing young cells. Perforant path (PP) fibers (green) traverse the molecular layer perpendicular to the dendritic trees of granule cells. Due to the small dendritic cones of young cells, different PP fibers connect with young GCs in a non-overlapping manner. In contrast, in mature GCs glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses are present in large numbers and widely distributed. (B) Despite low numbers, the syn - aptic connections in young GCs efficiently generate AP firing via efficient temporal summation and non-linear NMDAR-dependent electrogenesis. (C) Mature cells have low intrinsic excitability, but when combined with a large number of inputs from many synapses, are able to reliably fire action potentials.

Synapses onto young and mature GCs as well as CA1 pyramidal cells were investigated. Remarkably, in young GCs both, PV and SOM interneurons activated 5-subunit containing GA - BAA receptors ( 5-GABAR), showing a pronounced voltage- dependent outward rectification. As a consequence, the conductance was 4-fold larger at depolarized potentials close to AP threshold (40 mV) as compared to the resting potential. By contrast, in fully mature hippocampal neurons (GCs and CA1 pyramidal cells) 5- GABARs are only involved in dendritic inhibition and fully excluded from PV inter - neuron synapses (Schulz et al. 2018, Lodge et al. BioRxiv, 2020). Although GABA is considered to be the major inhibitory transmitter in the adult brain, it depolarizes newly generated young neurons, due to a depolarized GAB - AA reversal potential (-35 mV). Nevertheless, we could show, that GABA can still act as an inhibitory transmitter in young GCs, due to shunting inhibition (Lodge and Bischofberger, 2019). Although activation of a low number of synaptic 5- GABAARs facilitates depolarization, strong activation of synaptic 5- GABAARs can nevertheless inhibit AP firing in young neurons, similar to mature GCs, be - cause of the voltage-dependent conductance profile of 5-GABAARs, generat - ing shunting inhibition. In conclusion, our studies explain how sparse glutamatergic connectivity and fine- tuned excitation-inhibition balance via specific GABAA receptors enable distinct activation of different young neurons. This will not only help to avoid hyperexcit - ability, but also supports sparse activity in the hippocampus to improve hippocam - pal pattern separation. 50 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020The research group \"Human Genomics\" aims to identify the molecular (genetic) ba - sis of human diseases and the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathomech - anisms by combining human genetics knowledge with new genomics technolo - gies (project leader: Per Hoffmann), bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches and in-depth phenotyping. We focus on genetically complex neuropsychiatric dis - orders (project leader: Sven Cichon, DMB's Neurobiology), congenital developmental disorders leader: Isabel Filges), and hereditary cancer syn - dromes (project leader: Karl Heinimann, DBM's Focal Area Oncology). We close - ly interact with the research group Skin Biology and have a strong interest in the molecular basis of genodermatoses (project leader: Bettina Burger) and hereditary angioedema (project leader: Sven Cichon). Neuropsychiatric disorders One strong focus of the research group is the genetic analysis of neuropsychiatric disorders, in particular bipolar disorder. In the context of the Psychiatric Genom - ics Consortium (PGC), we performed the so far largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) including 20,352 cases and 31,358 controls of European descent (Stahl et al., 2019). 30 loci were genome-wide significant, including 20 newly iden - tified loci (Fig. 1). The significant loci contain genes encoding ion channels, neu - rotransmitter transporters and synaptic components. Pathway analysis revealed nine significantly enriched gene sets, including regulation of insulin secretion and endocannabinoid signaling. The study also showed that the clinical subgroup Bi - polar I disorder is strongly genetically correlated with schizophrenia, driven by psy - chosis, whereas bipolar II disorder is more strongly correlated with major depres - sive disorder. These findings address key clinical questions and provide potential biological mechanisms for bipolar disorder. In parallel we performed exome sequencing studies in large and multiply affect - ed bipolar disorder families (e. g. Maaser et al., 2018). Current and future projects aim at a mechanistic understanding of common and rare genetic risk variants for bipolar disorder. This will include sequencing in further large families with bipolar disorder as well as the study of sets of common risk variants in induced pluripo - tent stem cell (iPSC) models. Congenital developmental disordersOur specific interest relates to birth defects and multiple congenital anomaly syn - dromes which present early during pregnancy, since the monogenic aetiology of most severe fetal anomalies is poorly understood. In addition, the clinical descrip - tion of most genetic conditions relates to paediatric and adult patients, and we are trying to understand how those same conditions may present in the prenatal pe - riod. We systematically investigate families with one or more fetuses presenting with distinctive anomaly patterns and identified novel disease genes, new fetal phe - notypes and phenotypes as a variable of developmental timing (Meier et al., 2017; Meier et al., 2019; Meier et al., 2020). We further characterized the function of KIF14 in humans and zebrafish (Reilly et al., 2019) and reviewed the emerging role of ki - nesin family member genes in birth defects, which we proposed to term \"kinesin - opathies\" as a recognizable entity (Kalantari&Filges, 2020; Fig. 2). Our group also studies Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), a heteroge - neous group of conditions with multiple contractures (Filges et al., 2019). In an in - ternational consortium we work towards a standardized interdisciplinary approach to diagnose and care for patients with AMC.

Report 2017-2020Sensory Processing and Behaviour Group Members Innocenti (Technical Staff) James Alexander Taylor (PhD Student) Marvin Weiss (Undergraduate Student)Jan Gr\u00fcndemann Department of Biomedicine Pharmazentrum University of Basel Encoding of behavioural states in amygdala circuits Internal states define sensory perception and actions. For example, we are more alert after a loud bang or lose focus during states of hunger. Brain states are as - sociated with neuronal circuits in cortex. However, the behaviors that are affected by internal states are complex and result in diverse actions including changes in autonomic and hormonal responses. We studied how the amygdala - a center for the regulation of emotional states, associative learning as wells as complex behav - ior like social interactions - encodes internal states. We hypothesized that states are most likely not encoded on the level of individual neurons but by orchestrated changes in large neuronal populations. To measure activity of large populations of amygdala neurons we used novel miniaturized microscopes in freely moving mice (Fig. 1). This allowed us to longitudinally image neural activity across a series of be - havioral paradigms in different contexts across multiple days. We found that two large ensembles of amygdala neurons signaled antagonistic information about an animal's behaviour in an open field context. This signature of neuronal population activity was slow and occurred across consecutive days and paradigms and pre - dicted transitions between exploratory and defensive states in a moment-to- mo - ment fashion (Fig. 2). During fear conditioning, an aversive associative learning paradigm, amygdala population activity to sensory stimuli was orthogonal to state coding. This shows that fast sensory representations in the amygdala and slow state dynamics are separately represented. These state signals are sent to a wid - er brain network, including cortical and subcortical areas and might be crucial for normal brain function. Future studies can now use this population signature and investigate if amygdala state coding is affected in animal models of neuropsychi - atric diseases (Gr\u00fcndemann et al., 2019). Auditory upon associative learning Cortical as well as limbic brain areas like the amygdala are classically regarded as centers for associative learning. In a recent study, we investigated how thalam - ic sensory neurons, which are upstream of the amygdala, shape plasticity upon associative fear learning. Using our miniature microscope approach, we record - ed activity patterns of large numbers of auditory thalamus neurons in freely mov - ing animals during fear conditioning. On the single cell level, we find that individual neurons exhibit mixed selectivity and respond to tone and foot shock. Furthermore, single cells exhibit heterogeneous plasticity patterns to auditory and aversive stim - uli upon learning (Fig. 3). This plastic change in activity is particularly intriguing giv - en that auditory thalamus is supposed to be a reliable relay of sensory information. However, contrasting individual cells, we find that the encoding of auditory stimuli remained stable across days on the level of the total neural population. These find - ings suggest that auditory thalamus is more than a sole sensory relay and balanc - es experience-dependent, diverse single cell plasticity with stable ensemble lev - el encoding of the sensory environment to support perception (Taylor et al., 2020). Integration of multiple sensory modalities in thalamus Malfunctions of sensory integration like false (or \"phantom\") representations can result in detrimental behavioural outcomes. Higher brain areas are involved in computation, storage and retrieval of these sensory representations. Howev - er, how multisensory information flow to these areas is integrated, preprocessed and routed in subcortical circuits remains elusive. In our ongoing work, we are in - terested in how the brain, and particularly early thalamic relays, integrate sensory inputs from different sensory modalities, e. g. vision and audition to generate be -Sensory Processing .

Report 2017-2020Fig. 1: View of a Purkinje cell in an organotypic slice culture after 12d in vitro . Anti-calbindin staining for Purkinje cells is shown in red. The elaborate dendritic tree of this cell has devel - oped almost entirely during the culture period. The cerebellum is a part of the brain which is involved in many neural functions, in particular when precision in time and space is required. This is of course the case for movements and a functional deficit of the cerebellum becomes usually evident in the form of unprecise movements, called an ataxia. Purkinje cells are the prin - cipal cells of the cerebellar cortex and have a large and highly branched dendritic tree (Fig. 1). A large and heterogeneous group of hereditary diseases called spino - cerebellar ataxias is caused by dysfunction and death of Purkinje cells. Our laboratory has a long-standing interest in the molecules and mechanisms reg - ulating growth and development of Purkinje cell dendrites. We have identified Pro - tein Kinase C (PKC) activity as a major regulator of Purkinje cell dendritic growth and have shown that PKC activity via the intracellular calcium concentration reg - ulates the shape and size of the Purkinje cell dendritic tree. The predominant sub - type of PKC in Purkinje cells, PKC , is also linked to one form of the spinocerebel - lar ataxias, SCA-14, which is caused by point mutations or deletions in the PKC gene. The mechanisms by which the mutations in the PKC gene lead to Purkinje cell dysfunction and death in SCA-14 are still not known. This is an important ques - tion because SCA14 can be viewed as a model for neurodegenerative diseases and understanding the mechanisms in SCA14 may also help understanding neuro - degeneration in general. Our group is studying in which ways PKC may contribute to the pathogenesis of SCA and how this may be related to its effects on dendritic growth. We have generated a transgenic mouse model with a point mutation found in some SCA-14 patients which is located in the catalytic domain of PKC (PKC - S361G). We could show that the presence of the mutated protein in mouse Pur - kinje cells induces a striking reduction of Purkinje cell dendritic outgrowth. A simi - lar effect is seen when PKC is stimulated with pharmacological agonists indicating that the mutated protein has increased kinase activity and is biologically active in Purkinje cells (Fig. 2).

In a new mouse model, we have introduced a point mutation which keeps PKC in an open active conformation with increased activity also causing dendritic reduction of Purkinje cells (Fig. 2). This mouse model will allow us to better study the contri - bution of PKC activity to the pathogenesis of SCAs. The Purkinje cell-specific expression of the S361G mutation has allowed us to use this this mouse model for identifying molecules which are transcriptionally regulat - ed in Purkinje cells carrying this mutation and which might be involved in the sig - naling mechanisms eventually resulting in the reduction of dendritic growth. As a first candidate molecule, we have identified Car8 as a potential mediator of PKC signaling. Further work in our group has now identified more potential candidate molecules which have an altered expression in S361G Purkinje cells, and which might interact directly or indirectly with PKC . These molecules are linked to PKC signaling and include the IP3 receptor 1 (IP3R1), the Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), the Regulator of G-Protein 8 (RGS8) and threonine kinase 17b (STK17b, also known as DRAK2). We know for all of the men - tioned candidate molecules that they are expressed in Purkinje cells and that their expression is changed in the S361G mouse model. A major goal of our group is to better define the interaction of these molecules with PKC and better characterize their role for PKC signaling, Purkinje cell dendritic development and Purkinje cell dysfunction in spinocerebellar ataxia. Our studies aim at a better understanding of the role of PKC signaling for Purkinje cell den - dritic development and for dysfunction in spinocerebellar ataxia as the basis for developing novel therapeutic strategies for cerebellar diseases. 56 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020Our research is focused on the pharmacology of psychoactive substances. This may include the designing and synthesis of novel compounds in collaboration with medicinal chemists. Many compounds studied in our laboratory are also misused recreationally as classic or novel psychoactive substances. We then study the mechanism of action of these substances in comparison with classic drugs of abuse or well-known psychoactive substances using in vitro pharmacological ap - proaches. This includes the study of the receptor and transporter interaction pro - files using receptor binding assays and tests of function such as transporter inhi - bition in vitro in human cells expressing different human target as well as receptor activation assays. Toxicology studies may also be performed mainly in collabora - tion with other groups. We perform studies of the metabolism in vitro . Then many substances are further investigated in vivo in humans. For example, we have ex - tensively investigated the clinical pharmacology of MDMA including many phase 1 studies in healthy subjects to examine the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, acute ef - fects, pharmacogenetics, metabolism, and safety pharmacology. The group has also conducted a series of clinical studies on the acute effects of the classic psy - chedelic substance LSD in humans. This includes studies of the acute subjective, emotional, autonomic, and endocrine effects of LSD, safety studies, pharmaco - kinetics, and pharmacokinetic- pharmacodynamic modeling. Then, different psy - choactive substances are compared with each other. This includes comparative studies of MDMA, LSD, d-amphetamine or of LSD and psilocybin.

Our research is aimed at understanding the causes of vision loss and to develop novel therapies to prevent or treat blinding diseases. Treating autosomal dominant optic atrophy The optic nerve formed by the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) relays visu - al information form the light-sensing retina to the vision centers in the brain. Thus, loss of RGCs results in visual impairment and ultimately blindness. Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) is the most common inherited form of optic nerve degeneration. Mainly caused by mutations in the OPA1 gene, visual im - pairment develops in the first decade of life and can progress to complete blind - ness. The OPA1 gene codes for a mitochondrial protein involved in maintaining mi - tochondrial morphology by modulating mitochondrial fusion. In addition, OPA1 is essential for mitochondrial cristae organization and, thus, electron transport chain function. Loss of OPA1 is known to diminish mitochondrial fidelity and to increase sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. Critically, OPA1 mRNA is subject to extensive alter - native splicing giving rise to at least eight different OPA1 isoforms with a balanced isoform expression important for OPA1 function. About 70 % of ADOA cases are caused by OPA1 haploinsufficiency. Using artifi - cial transcription factors (ATFs) capable upregulating OPA1 expression, we aim to alleviate OPA1 haploinsufficiency while maintaining OPA1 isoform balance, thus providing a functional cure for ADOA. Based on TAL effectors, we generated ATFs capable of upregulating mouse or human OPA1 (Fig. 1). To test efficacy of such ATFs, we generated a novel in vivo model of pharmacologically accelerated RGC degeneration in ADOA mice. This allowed us to synchronize RGC death and short - ened the time it takes to detect treatment efficacy from 12-15 months to 14 days. Currently, we are in the process of optimizing viral delivery to allow for efficient de - livery of OPA1-upregulating ATFs to RGCs by simple intravitreal injection. Towards a treatment for Fuchs' dystrophy Vision starts with light entering the eye through a transparent cornea. The cor - nea is a five-layered tissue with the outermost corneal epithelium together with Bowman's layer and the innermost corneal brane sandwiching cell-free corneal stroma. To keep the corneal stro - ma transparent, corneal endothelial cells (CECs) actively remove water from this tissue. During Fuchs' dystrophy and due to CEC loss, water accumulates inside the stroma causing a disorganization of the carefully arranged stromal matrix lead - ing to severe visual impairment. Interestingly, about 4 % of the population over 40 years of age suffers from Fuchs' dystrophy to a varying degree. Severe Fuchs' dys - trophy is treated by replacing the damaged CEC layer with human donor material in a procedure called Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK). How - ever, the demand for corneal transplants outweighs availability about 70:1. By combining additive manufacturing and stem-cell technology, we want to ad - dress this unmet medical need by generating a drop-in replacement for human do - nor material for DMEK. We employ melt electrowriting to fabricate a suitable scaf - fold for culturing human CECs (Fig. 2). Furthermore, a differentiation protocol for CECs from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) was developed and adapted to be compatible for culturing these cells on such scaffolds. To assess whether these implants are compatible with the established transplantation procedure, cell-free scaffolds were implanted into porcine eyes ex vivo . Imaging revealed that the fab - ricated structural support is well suited as drop-in replacement during DMEK.

Thus, the focus is on halting or even re - versing loss of vision. Understanding degenera - tive mechanisms affecting ocular tissues such as the optic nerve, the retina or the cornea is of great importance to develop novel treatment modali - ties. Such modalities include gene therapeutic ap - proaches as well as stem cell-based treatments for retinitis pigmentosa, Stargardt disease, age-relat - ed degeneration, diabetic au - tosomal dominant optic atrophy, but also corne - al dysfunction as encountered in Fuchs' dystrophy. The clinical research center of the Institute of Mo - lecular and Clinical Ophthalmology (IOB) in collab - oration with the University Eye Hospital offers the opportunity for clinical research into causes of vi - sion loss as well as the natural history of ocular diseases. Together with the evaluation of clinical outcome measures and the possibility to conduct clinical trials, the clinical research center provides an integrated environment for successful transi - tion from bench-to-bedsite by bridging the \"val - ley of death\" often encountered by translational re - search. Only careful studies into the natural history of diseases as well as thoughtful selection of out - come parameters - especially in the case of slowly progressing eye diseases - minimize the inherent risk of translational research projects and devel - opment of new therapies. The close connection between the ocular pharmacology and physiolo - gy lab and the IOB clinical research center, both headed by Prof. Hendrik Scholl, is instrumental to leverage our translational research for the benefit of the patients. 60 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020The aim of our research is to reveal the role and mechanism of cell-to-cell spread - ing of potential toxic proteins in neurodegenerative disorders. In neurodegenerative diseases the nervous system gets progressively altered. Im - paired structure and function, due to degeneration of neural cells, results in severe behavioural disabilities and often death of the patient. Understanding pathogenic mechanisms underlying the severe clinical progres - sion of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs), like Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) is critical for developing novel therapeutic strate - gies. Patients display a progressive accumulation of pathological changes rang - ing from epigenetic and transcriptional abnormalities to degeneration of neural circuits. These lesions arise in a typical spatiotemporal pattern in the brain. This might be explained by a potential novel disease pathway, which is termed: misfold - ed protein spreading. A process in which disease-linked, misfolded proteins prop - agate from cell to cell and function as seeds which convert healthy, like-proteins into toxic species by a procedure called templated misfolding. This phenomenon was first identified in Prion disorders in which it underlies the progressive spatio - temporal spreading of neuronal lesions through the brain. A series of exciting new studies have provided strong experimental evidence that a 'prion-like' self-prop - agating mechanism is applicable to a variety of proteins related to dissimilar neu - rodegenerative protein misfolding diseases (PMDs). These include A and tau in AD, -synuclein in PD, SOD1 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), TDP-43 frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD), and mutant huntingtin (mHTT) in HD. Recent work suggests that pathogenic protein spreading matches the spatiotem - poral progression pattern of neuronal lesions through the brain and that it propa - gates along neural networks in a pattern that matches the architecture of function - al synaptic connectivity in the healthy human brain. The spreading of misfolded proteins might therefore be an important contributor to neuronal damage in PMDs. We use HD as a model disease to address the following questions: Is mHTT cell-to-cell spreading causally linked to depend on functional synaptic connectivity? Does mHTT spreading from spinal motor neurons to skeletal muscles contribute to muscle pathology? These questions we address with a multidisciplinary experimental approach, in - cluding a wide array of tools, spanning from morphological and molecular cell bi - ology to systemic physiology and behavioural analyses, applied to both HD mouse- and human induced pluripotent cell models. With this approach we aim to disclose novel mechanisms of mHTT trans-neuronal spreading and consequences thereof for HD progression. The results likely are of high relevance to other neurodegenerative PMDs. Pathogenic Protein Spreading and Neurodegeneration Eline Pecho-Vrieseling Department of Biomedicine Neuroscience University .

Report 2017-2020Sounds and hearing play a pivotal role in human communication. People who suf - fer from central auditory processing abnormalities are affected in their daily lives and might not be able to appreciate even the most basic verbal communication. Tinnitus, in which phantom sounds are experienced in the absence of acoustic stimulation, is an example of pathology of the central auditory system. More than 10% of the population suffers from it. Despite the importance of hearing in human communication, we still understand very little of how sounds are perceived and how they are processed in the central auditory system. The aim of our lab is to un - derstand the role of specific neuronal circuits in making sense of sounds, and to lead to new ways of reinstating normal connectivity in cases of abnormal audito - ry processing. We combine in vivo physiology, optogenetics, rabies virus tracing, immunohistochemistry, behavioral assays, cochlear implants and computer mod - eling to explore the functions of neuronal circuits in the mouse auditory cortex. Adaptability of the auditory system in health and disease We use several approaches to reach our lab's aim (Fig. 1). First, we study audi - tory circuits during postnatal development. We identified a new form of develop - mental plasticity linked to a specific sound feature and to the maturation of a cor - tical interneuron subtype (Bhumika et al., 2019). We also demonstrated that the development and plasticity of the processing of different sound features is asyn - chronous, and follows a temporally precise developmental program (Nakamura et al., 2020). Then, we study how neuronal responses change with context, wheth - er it is related to the auditory environment, to the internal state of the animal or to learning. We showed how a white noise background can improve tone discrimina - tion performance and, more generally, how manipulating the cortical neural code leads to perceptual improvements (Christensen et al., 2019). We also demonstrat - ed that the modulations in neuronal activity arising when switching from active - ly listening to passively hearing are diverse and widespread in the auditory sys - tem (De Franceschi and Barkat, 2020). We also study the specific roles of spatially distinct cortical neural circuits in sound processing and perception. We identi - fied some cortical regions specialized in coding sound termination, whereas oth - ers are better for spectral integration (Solyga and Barkat, 2019). Finally, we estab - lished a mouse model of cochlear implants (Navntoft et al., 2019) providing us with the tool to link basic to translational research. Our findings put forward the cen - tral role of adaptive plasticity in central auditory circuits. We will pursue this line of research to explore the different forms of adaptability that the brain uses to make sense of sounds. Not only will this new knowledge advance our understanding of auditory functions, but it will also set the ground for new approaches in transla - tional research to help reinstating normal neuronal processing in central audito - ry dysfunctions. From basic to translational research with a mouse model of cochlear implant Cochlear implants (CIs) are neuroprosthetic devices that can provide a sense of hearing to deaf people. However, a CI cannot restore all aspects of hearing. Im - provements are needed if CI users are to appreciate music or more complex en - vironments, such as hearing out a voice in a noisy crowd. Such improvements in - clude the necessity of experimental animals to better understand the mechanisms of electric stimulation in the cochlea and its response in the whole auditory sys - tem. We developed a mouse model providing a powerful opportunity to study ge - netic and neurobiological mechanisms that would be of relevance for CI users (Fig. Development and function of neuronal circuits in the central auditory system Group Members Dr. Student) Elisabetta Messina* Staff) Catherine during report period Tania Rinaldi Barkat Department of Biomedicine Physiology University of BaselBrain Sound LabAuditory System .

Its etiology is still unclear, but the interpretation of recent genome-wide associ - ation studies in MS, which identified almost exclusively immune system-related genes, has been that MS develops from the outside, i.e. the peripheral immune system, which then attacks the central nervous system. In the search of identify - ing factors preceding demyelination, we investigated the molecular pathomech - anisms in the so-called normal appearing cortical grey matter, where there is no sign of inflammation and demyelination. We performed the to-date largest whole- genome gene expression study conducted with normal-appearing human brain cortical grey matter tissue of multiple sclerosis cases (Fig. 1). There we detected an upregulation of HLA-DRB1 gene expression in multiple sclerosis brain tissue compared to control cases. We were further able to link the high HLA- DRB1 gene expression to a higher frequency of HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele carriers amongst the multiple sclerosis cases. The HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele is known to be the strongest risk factor for developing multiple sclerosis. We were further able to link the elevat - ed HLA-DRB1 gene expression to higher protein expression, mainly by brain-res - ident microglia cells, and notably to increased size of cortical grey matter lesions. The fact that HLA-DRB1*15:01 is expressed at higher levels in the brain parenchy - ma challenges the outside-in hypothesis of multiple sclerosis and demonstrates the possibility of relevant immunological mechanisms taking place within the brain itself, i.e. from the inside (Enz et al., 2020). Combinatory multifactor treatment effects on primary nanofiber oligodendrocyte cultures Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating and neurodegen - erative disease of the central nervous system. Neurological deficits are attributed to inflammatory demyelination, which compromises axonal function and survival. These are mitigated in experimental models by rapid and often complete remyelin - ation of affected axons, but in MS this endogenous repair mechanism frequently fails, leaving axons increasingly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of inflamma - tory and metabolic stress. Understanding the molecular basis of remyelination and remyelination failure is essential to develop improved therapies for this devastat - ing disease. However, recent studies suggest that this is not due to a single domi - nant mechanism, but rather represents the biological outcome of multiple changes in the lesion microenvironment that combine to disrupt oligodendrocyte differenti - ation. This identifies a pressing need to develop technical platforms to investigate combinatory and/or synergistic effects of factors differentially expressed in MS le - sions on oligodendrocyte proliferation and differentiation. We developed a proto - col using primary oligodendrocyte cultures from Bl6 mice on 384-well nanofiber plates to model changes affecting oligodendrogenesis and differentiation in the complex signaling environment associated with multiple sclerosis lesions (Fig. 2). Using platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-AA), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) as representative targets, we demonstrate that we can assess their combinato - ry effects across a wide range of concentrations in a single experiment. This in vi - tro model is ideal for assessing the combinatory effects of changes in availability of multiple factors, thus more closely modelling the situation in vivo and furthering high-throughput screening possibilities (Enz et al., 2019).

A) The molecular basis of DM1 is an expansion of an unstable repeat sequence in the noncoding part of the DMPK gene. Severity of disease is correlated with the size of the repeat expansion. B) In DM1, the mutation is located in a noncoding region and does not alter the protein sequence, but leads to toxic RNA. C) The sequestration of the alternative splicing factor MBNL1 by toxic RNA leads to altered splicing of target pre- mRNAs like CLCN1, encoding muscle-specif - ic chloride channel (ClC-1). This mis-splicing leads to ClC-1 deficiency and to myotonia. D) We established a pathophysiology based screening cascade including biochemical, cellular and animal model assays to identify small molecular weight compounds able to disrupt the interaction between MBNL1 and the toxic RNA, and to restore splicing and function.Our Neuromuscular Research Laboratory is part of the Clinic of Neurology and the Department of Biomedicine and focuses on the elucidation of pathophysiological mechanisms involved in neuromuscular diseases and on the development of ther - apeutic strategies. Myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) is a disabling neuromuscular disease with no causal treatment available. It is the most prevalent muscular dystrophy in adults, affecting about 1 in 10'000 individuals. This disease is caused by expanded CTG trinucleotide repeats in the 3' UTR of the dystrophia kinase gene (DMPK). On the RNA level, expanded (CUG)n repeats form hairpin structures that sequester splicing-factors, such as muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1). Lack of avail - able MBNL1 leads to mis-regulated alternative splicing of many target pre-mRNAs, causing multisystemic involvement in DM1. In an effort to identify small molecules that liberate sequestered MBNL1 from (CUG)n RNA, we developed a pathomech - anism-based screening cascade including biochemical, cellular and animal model assays which allow for high throughput screening of small molecular weight com - pounds. Identified hits may provide pharmacophores for further medicinal chem - istry optimization.

An additional line of research in our laboratory is dedicated to the identification of mechanisms underlying disruption of proteostasis as a cause for muscle diseas - es. To this end, we initiated experimental strategies to identify molecular networks that specifically control protein synthesis and degradation in human myofibers un - der physiological conditions and upon atrophic stress. Our strategy integrates the genome-wide measurements of a.) transcript levels (RNA-Seq), b.) translation lev - els (sequencing of ribosome foot prints) and c.) protein levels (proteomics) from genetically (Crispr/Cas9) modified human immortalized myoblasts. The ribosome foot-printing method, which we developed together with the laboratory of Prof. M. Zavolan, provides us with estimates of protein synthesis rates of individual RNA molecules, thus allowing us to further uncover the regulatory factors of translation for each gene under normal and diseased conditions. In parallel, we developed in situ proximity-dependent labelling assays (BioID) to map the direct and indirect in - teractome of the two main proteins we have already identified in skeletal muscle at - rophy, MAFbx and EIF3F (Fig. 3). 68 Department of Biomedicine .

MiyoshiHirotsugu (Visiting Scientist) Dr. Alexis Ruiz Velez (Postdoc) Dr. Francesco Zorzato (Research Associate)In skeletal muscle calcium is a key second messenger regulating contraction and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is the intracellular organelle involved in - lation. The ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channel (RyR1) present on the terminal cis - ternae of the SR, is closely apposed to and is directly activated by, the dihydro - pyridine receptor an L-type Ca2+ channel functioning as voltage sensor. Upon depolarization, the voltage sensor undergoes a conformational change promoting the opening of the RyR1, leading to Ca2+ release from the SR; this elevation of the myoplasmic [Ca2+] is necessary for, and leads to, muscle contraction and this pro - cess is called excitation-contraction coupling (Fig. 1). More than 700 RYR1 variants have been identified in patients worldwide, making this gene the primary target of neuromuscular disorders and accounting for over 30 % of mutations found in patients with congenital myopathies. Both dominant and re - cessive RYR1 mutations occur and usually associate with different phenotypes. Dominant mutations are causative of malignant hyperthermia/rhabdomyolysis/ exertional heat intolerance and central core disease and functionally impact the channel's biophysical properties. Patients bearing recessive mutations are gener - ally more severely affected, characteristically also display involvement of extraoc - ular muscles and are diagnosed as having multi-minicore disease/centronuclear myopathy. The latter mutations have no major effect on the channel properties, but their presence is accompanied by profound biochemical changes in patients' mus - cles, including a significant reduction of the RyR1 protein content and high levels of expression of class II histone de-acetylases. The reduced RyR1 levels in the SR membrane cause a decrease of calcium release during excitation contraction cou - pling, leading to weak muscles. Our laboratory focuses on determining the functional effect of RYR1 mutations with the long-term goal of developing a pharmacological strategy to improve mus - cle function in patients. To do so we use two main experimental models: patient-derived biological material and transgenic mouse models knocked in for mutations identified in patients. Muscle biopsies are evaluated biochemically and physiolog - ically. Our results have demonstrated that muscle biopsies from patients carry - ing recessive RYR1 mutations show abnormally low RyR1 protein content, alter - ation of gene methylation and an increase in the content of chromatin modifying enzymes including class II histone de-acetylases and DNA methyl transferases. A mouse model we knocked in for a mis-sense mutation in one allele and a frameshift mutation in the other allele (DKI mouse, Fig. 2) exhibits severe muscle impairment, reduced levels of calcium release and disorganization of the muscle ultrastructure. Additionally, extraocular muscles from the transgenic mice have impaired excita - tion contraction coupling, as well as almost no EO-MyHC, the eye-muscle specific myosin heavy chain isoform. These results are consistent with the weak eye mus - cles of patients carrying recessive RYR1 mutations. We are also interested in other aspects of skeletal muscle and in particular in iden - tifying and validating the function of newly identified SR proteins. We have charac - terized a number of novel proteins including JP-45, junctate, SRP-27 and SRP-35; the latter is a membrane bound retinol-dehydrogenase converting retinol (Vitamin A) to all trans-retinaldehyde. Our results show that SRP-35 is involved in glucose metabolism, facilitating glucose uptake into skeletal muscle. We are currently in - vestigating directly the role of Vitamin A in skeletal muscle physiology. Taken together the results of our studies will have important implications especially since they will promote the development of pharmacological therapies to improve the quality of life of patients with disorders leading to a decreased levels of RyR1 and may shed new information regarding the link between metabolic disorders and skeletal muscle glucose metabolism.

The figure shows the main components and subcellular localization of the proteins involved in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling (ECC). The transverse (T-) tubules containing are invaginations of the plasma membrane where the voltage sensing di - hydropyridine receptor (DHPR) is located. STCA3 binds to the DHPR. The T- tubules face the sarcoplasmic reticulum junctional0 face (JFM) containing the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) Ca 2+ release as JP-45, triadin and junctin/junctate/asparty -hydroxylase. Calsequestrin bind Ca2+ and mesh within the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Opening of the RyR1 leads to Ca2+ release into the myoplasm which then binds to the contrac - tile proteins resulting in sarcomeric shortening (muscle contraction). ECC is terminated when Ca2+ is actively pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (TC) and longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane where it is thought to be involved in the transport of K+ ions during Ca2+ release to maintain a neutral electrochemical gradient across the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. 70 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020X Xxxxxxx Stem cell research and regenerative medicine are major pillars within the Depart - ment of Biomedicine (DBM) and the life science strategy of the University of Ba - sel. The last two decades has seen massive progress in identifying and isolating multipotent progenitor and stem cells from adult and embryonic origin, which can be induced to differentiate into various specific cell-types relevant to regenerative medicine. While the groups that are part of this focal area have rather heteroge - nous research interests, several are actively studying how stem cells of the blood are maintained in the bone marrow, differentiate into the various different cell- types of the hematopoietic system, and how their differentiation potential is altered in malignant states that are caused by aberrant stem cell-based cancers (e.g. leu - kemia or lymphomas). The close interactions of clinical with basic researchers al - low bridging the gap between fundamental and translational research. For exam - ple, attempts to grow and differentiate mesenchymal stem cells from human and mouse bone marrow in vitro into different cell- and tissue types, aim at develop - ing cartilage and bone replacement therapies that can be translated to the clinic. The knowledge gained from these studies forms the basis for designing and de - veloping clinically applicable tissue engineering strategies and in moving toward re- generative medicine. One of the major aims of regenerative medicine is to reactivate and support the re- generative potential of the body in a controlled manner. To this aim, understanding the normal regulation of organogenesis and tissue homeostasis is crucial. While first attempts have given encouraging results, it is important to gain a much bet - ter knowledge of how stem cells interact with their niche to maintain their multi- potency and give rise to daughter cells that undergo transient amplification upon leaving the niche. These populations of transient amplifying cells will then initiate their specification and differentiation in a controlled manner. Major advances in this direction include the establishment of organoids multipotent progenitors and stem cells under controlled culture conditions. This can now be done for an ever increasing number of organs and tissues including e.g. liver, gut, lung, bones and last but not least brain from both mouse and human stem cells. With respect to the later, patient derived organoids provide an excellent test system to study the etiol - ogy of disease and test potential therapeutic avenues in vitro . However, organoids have their limitations as they are not able to fully recapitulate the complex patter - ing and interactions of cells that originate from different lineage and differentiate into fully functional tissues. Any functional organ and tissue will consist of well- organized and functionally interacting cells with different identities, which at this stage can only be studied in its full extent in model organisms. Therefore, it is im - portant to e.g. understand the control of tissue patterning & organization and cell- type specification & differentiation by molecular and genetic analysis signaling and gene regulatory interactions during embryonic development. The knowledge gained the molecular analysis of cell-type and tissue specification during organogenesis in embryos and/or using organoids is highly relevant to di - rected engineering of tissues from multipotent progenitor and stem cells. Another important approach includes the use of so-called induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which are adult cells (e. g. skin cells) reprogrammed into stem-like cells. iPS cells are increasingly used as they can be obtained from patients for cell differen -Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Rolf Zeller Department of Biomedicine Anatomy University of Basel Jakob Passweg Division of Hematology University Hospital Basel71 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020tiation and tissue engineering studies. The generation and analysis of iPS cells fits the strategy of the DBM to promote collaborative efforts between basic research groups and clinicians with the aim to significantly reduce the gap between bench and bedside. In addition to interactions within the DBM, there are numerous col - laborations with groups at the Biozentrum, FMI and the D-BSSE. Finally, several of the research groups in this focal area in this are actively participating in the Ba - sel Stem Cell Network (BSCN), which is one of the life science research networks of the University of Basel. The BSCN is a scientific platform bridging the interdis - ciplinary stem cell community in Basel, representing 50 research groups from the academic institutions and pharmaceutical industry. Within the BSCN, stem cell re - searchers have the opportunity to closely interact and collaborate with develop - mental biologists, geneticists and clinicians with the objective to foster interdisci - plinary and innovative basic and clinically-oriented research.72 Department of Biomedicine .

Bone Regeneration . Mesenchymal Stem Cells Gene Therapy . Cell therapy Therapeutic angiogenesis aims at restoring blood flow to ischemic tissues by gro- wing new vessels. Our research focuses on the basic mechanisms governing vas - cular growth and their translation into rational approaches to: 1) treat ischemic dis - eases and 2) improve the vascularization of tissue-engineered grafts. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the master regulator of vascular growth. However, uncontrolled expression causes vascular tumors (angiomas). By the close interaction of basic scientists and clinical surgeons, we are developing novel methods to deliver VEGF alone or in combination with modulating factors to increase its safety and efficacy in vivo . Key approaches include: 1) transduced pro - genitors, combining the specific advantages of cell and gene therapy; 2) gene ther - apy vectors; and 3) engineered recombinant proteins to decorate smart biomate - rials or endogenous tissue matrix (Fig. 1). Research is funded by Swiss agencies (SNF, Swiss Nanoscience Institute and Swiss Diabetes Foundation) and the Euro - pean Union (FP7 and H2020). Cellular and molecular mechanisms of VEGF-induced angiogenesis Our understanding of angiogenic mechanisms is mostly based on developmen - tal models, in which new vessels sprout to vascularize tissues. However, we found that VEGF delivery to skeletal muscle, at the doses needed for functional bene - fit, induces angiogenesis without sprouting, but by circumferential enlargement of vessels, followed by longitudinal splitting (\"intussusception\", Gianni-Barrera 2020). The mechanisms regulating intussusceptive angiogenesis are essentially unknown and likely to differ from those of sprouting. For example, the transition between normal and aberrant vascular growth during in - tussusceptive angiogenesis is not an intrinsic property of VEGF dose, but depends on the balance between VEGF-induced endothelial stimulation and vascular mat - uration mediated by pericyte recruitment by PDGF-BB (Gianni-Barrera 2018). The underlying molecular mechanism involves the activation of ephrinB2/EphB4 signaling between endothelium and pericytes, which finely tunes the degree of ERK1/2 activation downstream of VEGF-Receptor 2 and can be targeted pharma - cologically (Groppa 2018). Taking advantage of the highly controlled cell-based gene delivery platform we de - veloped, we are currently pursuing a systematic investigation of the mechanisms that regulate intussusceptive angiogenesis in vivo through single-cell transcrip - tomics and non-invasive live imaging, to identify novel and more specific molecu - lar targets for therapeutic angiogenesis. Controlled factor delivery for therapeutic vascularization We previously found that the transition between normal and aberrant angiogenesis depends on the VEGF amount in the microenvironment around each producing cell rather than on the total dose, since VEGF remains tightly localized in the extra- cellular matrix (Ozawa & Banfi 2004). In order to translate this biological concept into a clinically applicable approach, we developed a high-throughput FACS-ba- sed technology to rapidly purify transduced progenitors expressing specific VEGF levels (Misteli 2010). Controlled VEGF expression by FACS-purified progenitor populations could induce effective vascularization both inside and outside of thick, engineered cardiac patches (Marsano 2013; Boccardo of osteogenic grafts (Largo & Di Maggio 2020). To avoid the need for genetic modification and improve clinical applicability, in col - laboration with Jeffrey Hubbell (University of Chicago, USA) we developed a state-Therapeutic angiogenesis from vascular biology to regenerative medicine 73 Department of Biomedicine .

Report 2017-2020Hearing impairment has a significant impact on people's live affecting their social life, access to education and career opportunities. According to WHO estimation, 466 million people worldwide are currently affected by hearing loss, including 34 million children. Approximately one third of the people over 65 live with disabling hearing loss and more than 1 billion young people are at risk of developing gradu - al hearing loss due to regularly and prolonged exposure to loud sound. As report - ed by the non-profit organization Hear-it, disabling hearing loss costs 260 billion per year in Europe. Hearing loss may result from a variety of factors such as genetic factors, infec - tious diseases, noise overexposure, ototoxic drugs and natural aging process. The main functions of the outer and the middle ear are transducing and amplification of sound, while the cochlea in the inner ear is the auditory sensory organ. The outer hair cells of the organ of Corti are mechanically active, while the inner hair cells of the same organ convert the stimulus into neuronal impulses via afferent synaps - es to the dendrites of primary auditory neurons. Loss of sensorineural elements of the inner ear, hair cells and auditory nerve, lead to sensorineural hearing loss. Since sensory cells of mammals do not regenerate, hearing loss is often progres - sive and irreversible. Although the causes of hearing loss are known, the molec - ular mechanisms underlying cochlear degeneration and auditory function remain incompletely understood. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of the sen - sory cell damage will provide the basis to develop new prophylactic and therapeu - tic approaches. Our research group has conducted investigations on mechanisms that maintain the hearing function and survival of sensory cells. We have tested several candi - dates as otoprotective agents that could attenuate inner ear damage and hearing disabilities. We observed that the use of simvastatin, a statin commonly used for the treatment of hyperlipidemia, resulted in a dose dependent risk of neurotoxic - ity suggesting cautions about using it as otoprotective drug. Further drugs used for the treatment of diabetes and dyslipidemia were tested. Pioglitazone, tesaglita - zar and fenofibric acid, that are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists, have shown protection against the ototoxic drug gentamicin via regula - tion of production of reactive oxygen species. Similarly, telmisartan, a partial ago - nist of PPAR , protected hair cells from gentamicin-induced damage. Furthermore, protection of hair cell against gentamicin has been successfully achieved by using brimonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist. In addition, we examined the effect of pasierotide, an analog of the neuropeptide somatostatin. In-vitro, pasie - rotide antagonized gentamicin-induced hair cell death via factor of acti - vated T cells. In-vivo, pretreatment with pasierotide decreased hearing thresholds in gentamicin-exposed mice. In response to noise, ototoxic drugs and aging process; sensory cells activate var - ious anti- stress signaling pathways. A number of those signaling pathways of co - chlear degeneration are known, however other pathways still need to discover. We were the first research group reporting the involvement of Sestrin-2, stress-re - sponsive protein, in the protection of hair cell against gentamicin exposure. We have found that Sestrin-2 exerted its protective effect via AMPK/mTOR pathway. Recently, we have reported that sodium-hydrogen exchange 6 (NHE6) was impor - tant for hearing function, as NHE6 knockout mice showed significant hearing im - pairment compared to wild type. Further studies to unravel the ototoxicity mech - anism included the examination of mitophagy.

Report 2017-2020Our group investigates mechanisms whereby receptor tyrosine kinases regulate hypertrophic and hyperplastic cell growth in the heart. To this end we use primary neonatal rat heart cultures and several in vivo mouse models of cardiac disease. During the past reporting period we have investigated models of high-fat diet-in- duced cardiomyopathy and aortic-constriction-induced cardiac hypertrophy to mimic the pathophysiology associated with obesity and valve disease, respectively. In addition, we are establishing a model of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy, relevant to the interdisciplinary field of oncology and cardiology. Our focus at the cellular level is on protein turnover mechanisms, which to a large extent depend on available energy resources together with hormone and cytokine levels. We have recently directed our attention to the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases ac - tivated by neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), while also extending our earlier work on the in - sulin/IGF-I/Akt/mTOR pathway. Neuregulin-1 NRG-1 regulates cell growth and differentiation in various tissues including the heart. After myocardial infarct or anthracycline therapy, NRG-1 is released by the endothe- lium and activates multiple signaling pathways leading to distinct biological effects depending on the expression levels and dimerization of its receptors ErbB2, ErbB3 or ErbB4 on neighboring cells in the heart. NRG-1 is cardioprotective in a range of animal models of cardiac disease. While its therapeutic use is being tested in heart failure, the hormone risks to enhance tumor growth. A better understanding of the mechanisms whereby NRG-1 acts in cardiac versus cancer cells is important. We reported that NRG-1 causes glucose uptake in neonatal cardiomyocytes by trig - gering translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane via ErbB2/ErbB4 (Fig. 1). Using Seahorse, we showed that NRG-1 also enhances glycolysis. Like for insu - lin and IGF-I, the mechanism involves PI3K , Akt and AS160 (Pentassuglia et al., 2016; Heim et al., 2020). Under stress conditions cardiomyocytes switch from fat - ty acids to glucose as energy source. We hypothesized that the NRG-induced glu - cose uptake contributes to cardiomyocyte contractility e.g. under ischemic con - ditions or in insulin-resistant states. However, our experiments demonstrated that NRG-1 does not activate this cardiac glucose uptake pathway in adult models. We are currently testing whether the metabolic effects of NRG-1 provide the means for cell cycle activation and proliferation observed in neonatal cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2). While our studies reveal mechanisms that contribute to normal physiological car - diac growth and differentiation observed in neonatal hearts, they also aim to pro - vide fundamental insights that may contribute to cardiac regenerative approaches. Function of mTORC2 in the heart To perform its function as biological pump that provides oxygen and nutrients to our whole body, the heart consumes large amounts of energy. A tight regulation of the available resources, including cellular proteins, becomes critical in disease states where metabolism must increase to maintain cardiac performance, e. g. in hypertensive or valve disease. We previously reported that the metabolic regula - tor mTOR is essential for cardiac function when part of mTORC1: its cardiomyo - cyte-specific ablation causes heart failure rapidly followed by death of the mice, a phenotype explained by mTORC1's role in protein synthesis as well as mitochon - drial metabolism. We next demonstrated that aortic constriction-induced pressure overload significantly increases rictor (an essential mTORC2-specific protein) and PKCII and PKC phosphorylation in control mice, but not in cardiac rictor knock - out mice.

Connection to Clinical Practice ErbB4 agonists For the translational side of our work on NRG-1, we collaborate with teams of the University of Antwer - pen (Profs Gilles de Keulenaer and Moscow (Profs Shchendrygina and Yuri Belenkov), funded by a European ERA.Net RUS Plus grant. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that the car - diac NRG-1/ErbB4 system is activated in chronic heart failure, exerting disease mitigating and rege- nerative effects. NRG-1 is developed as a drug for heart failure and clinical trials have progressed to stage III. In addition, there is solid evidence from animal studies that the NRG-1/ErbB4 pathway is involved in other chronic diseases, such as dia - betic nephropathy, pulmonary hypertension, ath - erosclerosis and fibrotic disorders. All of these are common chronic disorders, and potential thera - peutic targets for NRG-1. In the project together with Antwerpen and Moscow, a multi-disciplinary approach is taken to identify novel potent and se - lective agonists of the ErbB4 receptor, to test these in validated rodent models of heart failure, and to define specific patient populations in the heteroge - neous field of cardiovascular diseases that could benefit from ErbB4 agonists. 78 Department of Biomedicine .

The thick - ness of the placenta of both Hectd1 -mutant homozygous and heterozygous mice was distinctly thinner than that of wildtype mice, the difference being most pro - nounced in the labyrinth layer of the placenta (Fig. 1). Moreover, as an E3 ubiqui - tin ligase, many aspects of the functional role of HECTD1 still remain to be eluci - dated. By Y2H and MS assays, the HECTD1 interactome network was generated. HECTD1 regulates the protein level of IQGAP1 through ubiquitination and there - fore mediates cell spreading and directionality of migration by regulating the dy - namics of the focal complexes, especially determining paxillin and zyxin localiza - tions. HECTD1 also regulates the expression of SNAIL and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). The knockdown of HECTD1 in HeLa cells increased cell migration and induced a mesenchymal phenotype, in addition to demonstrating sustained EGF/R signaling, which was observed through increased phosphorylated ERK ex - pression levels. We found that the sustained signaling of EGFR is accompanied by co-localization of Rab4 together HECTD1 effector. We identi - fied APPL1 as a critical player during fast recycling endosome biogenesis, in which APPL1 is not only a marker of the very early endosome but plays a crucial role in early endosome sorting. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that APPL1 is essen - tial for the recruitment of KXD1 to the Rab5-Rab4 endosomes. BLOC-1 is required for RAB4 fast recycling. APPL1 establishes a network of interactions with RAB5, BORC/BLOC1 and RAB4 for fast endosome recycling (Fig. 2).

Report 2017-2020Our laboratory conducts basic and translational research aiming at testing and de - veloping protective and regenerative strategies to repair the central nervous sys - tem (CNS) after injury. Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) HIE is a brain injury resulting from an impaired delivery of oxygen (hypoxia) and blood (ischemia) to the brain of a newborn. It causes significant mortality, and up to 25 % of surviving infants endure lifelong neurological deficits, collectively re - ferred to as cerebral palsy (CP). Currently, therapeutic hypothermia is the only ap - proved therapy, nevertheless the rates of death and severe disabilities in treated children remain high. Thus, there is an urgent need for alternative therapies. Pre - clinical and clinical data indicate that stem cell (SC) transplantation improves the functional outcome of HIE, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. A major research goal of our laboratory is to study the cellular and molecular de - terminants of repair in the developing brain. Our focus is on neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis, two complex endogenous processes that generate mature neurons and oligodendrocytes respectively from neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCPs). Data in rodent models of neonatal HIE suggest that these repair pro - cesses are induced by HI (Br\u00e9g\u00e8re et al., 2017)-albeit insufficiently -, and can be potentiated by SC therapy. Postnatally, these processes are mainly retained in two restricted and specialized areas of the brain, the neurogenic niches, namely the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the hippocampal gyrus (DG). Using in vivo and in vitro rodent models, our previous data showed that microglia, the main im - mune cells in the CNS, are more densely populated in the neurogenic niches than in non-neurogenic areas of the brain. We and others also demonstrated that a re - ciprocal NSPCs/microglia crosstalk contributes to the regulation of neurogene - sis. This aspect is being further investigated in the context of neonatal HI brain in - juries (Fig. 1). Neuroimmune interactions during brain ischemia Using a rat model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI), we recently showed that mi - croglia in the SVZ have a very distinct response to injury when compared to mi - croglia in the adjacent cortex or corpus callosum (Fisch et al., 2020). Specifically, we found that 3 and up until 33 days after HI, SVZ microglia (i) accumulate, (ii) are activated and phagocytic, and (iii) upregulate immunomodulatory and neurotroph - ic genes, features not or less observed in non-neurogenic areas (Fig. 2). In vitro , microglia isolated from the SVZ supported neurosphere generation in a concen - tration-dependent manner. Altogether these data suggested a functional impact of SVZ microglia on neurogenesis after a developmental brain injury. The effect of glucose deprivation on the microglial phenotype We are also investigating the impact of ischemia on brain cells through subjecting primary rodent mixed glial cultures to glucose deprivation (GD). Mixed glial cells comprise predominantly astrocytes, and to a lesser extent microglia and oligoden - drocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). We observe that after GD, microglia are the main survivors among glial cells. Microglia under GD conditions display an 'activated', phagocytic like phenotype, as indicated by an increased cell size, and higher co- expression of IBA1 (microglia/macrophage marker) and CD68 (lysosomal marker). The concentration of PDGF-AA, -an important chemokine for the proliferation of OPCs-, in the conditioned medium from GD mixed glial cultures is 247 times high - er than that from non-GD cultures. These data highlight microglia as very flexible cells for energy substrate, and point to a role of microglia in oligodendrogenesis during ischemia.Neuroimmune interactions and Bustos Meneses (Technical (External Collaborator) Nilabh PD Dr. Gros (External Collaborator) Christoph Markus H\u00e4fel- finger (Intern) Alois C.

Report 2017-2020Fig. 1: 10X confocal micrograph showing a coronal overview of a postnatal day 15 (P15) rat brain exposed to HI at P7. The HI surgery consists of right common artery ligation followed by 40 minutes exposure to hypoxia (8 % oxygen). HI produces an injury on the same side of ca - rotid ligation (or ipsilateral) while leaving the contralateral hemisphere intact. The rat brain slice is stained at the level of the dorsal hippocampus with Iba1 (green) and CD68 (red). Activated microglia (double positive cells in yellow) can be observed in the ipsilateral side of the brain, especially in the thalamus and hippocampus, while almost none are visible on the contralateral side of the brain, thus demonstrating the neuroinflammation induced by HI. The enlarged image shows the hippocampal dentate gyrus, a neurogenic niche, with the molecular layer containing also more activated microglia than the surrounding tissue (unpublished data). Fig. 2: After neonatal HI in the rat, the microglial density and the number of activated microglia in the SVZ remain significantly higher in the injured (ipsilateral) hemisphere than in the contralat - eral hemisphere from HI animals and in brains from sham animals.

The RNA-Binding Protein RBM3 Promotes Connection to Clinical Practice Raphael Guzman, Sven Wellmann University Children's Hospital Regensburg (KUNO) Neuroprotective mechanisms role of RBM3, a cold-inducible protein Therapeutic Hypothermia (TH) is the only approved treatment for term born infants diagnosed with HIE. Even tough it is not fully effective, it reduces mortality and disabilities up to 24 months of age if applied within 6 hours of birth. TH appears also neuroprotective in patients undergoing cerebro - vascular surgery, but randomized controlled trials have yielded conflicting results. Yet, subgroups of patients may still benefit from this intervention. Re - search has established that the benefit of TH lays in the modulation of several injury pathways, but the molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidat - ed. In collaboration with Prof. Dr. Sven Wellmann (SNF grant 31003A_163305), we examined the role of RNA-binding motif protein 3 (RBM3), a cold-in - ducible stress protein, in brain repair. Hypothermia up-regulates RBM3, which is neuroprotective un - der stressful conditions. We demonstrated that, af - ter an HI injury, RBM3 stimulates neuronal differen tiation and inhibits two neurogenic niches, i.e. the SVZ and the DG, while promoting NSPCs proliferation only in the DG. The severity of HI-induced neuronal injury was great - er in RBM3 knockout mice than in wildtype mice. We unraveled a novel RBM3- IMP2-IGF2 signal - ing pathway in the hippocampus that explains the niche-dependent regulation of neurogenesis after adult HI (Zhu et al., 2019 and Fig. 3). In a second re - port, we showed that RBM3 contributed to the reg - ulation of the cell cycle of NSPCs and their viability under hypoxic conditions (Yan et al., 2019).

Report 2017-2020Ultrasound molecular imaging Developments in hardware, computing power and image processing have contrib - uted to impressive improvements in medical imaging over the last decades with depiction of the human body with ever increasing resolution. However, early dis - ease processes are often characterized by changes in cellular phenotype and will remain out of range for conventional imaging. To overcome this limitation, molec - ular imaging that uses contrast media to image biological processes at a cellular level has been developed for all major medical imaging modalities, and it is thought that molecular imaging will in the future allow to detect diseases earlier, lead to bet - ter understanding of pathophysiology and will be an integral part of personalized medicine. In our laboratory, we are developing targeted contrast agents for ultra - sound molecular imaging. Microbubble ultrasound contrast agents have been in use in the clinical field for some years for blood pool and perfusion imaging. With a size range of 1-4m, microbubbles circulate freely throughout the microcirculation. Being composed of a gas core and a monolayer lipid shell, microbubbles re-radiate sound waves efficiently and can be depicted using clinical ultrasound equipment. For ultrasound molecular imaging, microbubbles have been functionalized for mo - lecular imaging by anchoring antibodies or other ligands to the microbubble sur - face (Fig. 1). Upon injection, these functionalized microbubbles accumulate on the vascular endothelium expressing a particular marker in diseased tissue, and can be imaged non-invasively with ultrasound. Ultrasound molecular imaging in atherosclerosis Risk assessment for atherosclerotic cardiovascular events currently relies on clin - ical risk factors. This approach places a large proportion of individuals in an inter - mediate risk category, where the value of interventions to reduce the risk for events is uncertain. Therefore, tools to better assess the risk in these patients are needed. Noninvasive imaging of molecular events associated with atherosclerotic disease may serve this purpose. Previous studies have shown that contrast enhanced ul - trasound molecular imaging using microbubble contrast agents directed against vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), which is involved in inflammatory pro - cesses in atherosclerosis, is feasible in murine disease models. However, the ul - trasound contrast agents used in these studies are not suitable for clinical transla - tion and there is a need for the development of microbubbles employing clinically translatable strategies for conjugation of targeting moieties, and targeting ligands that can readily be used in the clinical field. Therefore, recent work in our labora - tory has concentrated on the development of contrast agents that will allow trans - lation of this non-invasive imaging technique into the clinical field. Nanobodies are small antibody fragments (10-15kDa) derived from heavy-chain-only antibodies. They are attractive for applications in molecular imaging, as they are highly specific, non-immunogenic and thus offer the potential for clinical translation. We have shown that MBs bearing nanobodies with cross reactivity for murine and human VCAM-1 can be not only used to image various stages of murine atherosclerosis, but that imaging of VCAM-1 expression on human carotid thrombendarterectomy specimens is also possible using an in-vitro flow chamber setup (Fig. 2). Likewise, Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) are potential candidates for clinical ultrasound molecular imaging given their easy production and selection, high af - finity and low immunogenicity, and we have examined their use as ligands for tar - geting of VCAM-1. For this purpose, ribosome display was used to select >400 DARPin binders targeted against murine VCAM-1. Subsequently, flow cytometry and flow chamber assays were used to select 5 top candidate binders that were assessed in-vivo. Using these top candidates, assessment of murine hindlimb in - flammation was possible using ultrasound molecular imaging.

Report 2017-2020Valproic acid (valproate) is a branched medium-chain fatty acid (Fig. 1) that is used as an antiepileptic. Valproate frequently causes hepatocellular triglyceride accu - as non- alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We investigated the effect of valproate on lipid metabolism in HepaRG cells, a human hepatoma cell line. For that, we first established methods to assess fatty acid im - port, activation, mitochondrial degradation, triglyceride formation and VLDL export. The study showed that several mechanisms are responsible for valproate-associ - ated triglyceride accumulation. The main mechanisms identified were increased fatty acid transport into hepatocytes, impaired mitochondrial fatty acid metabo - lism and impaired export of VLDL. With the same techniques, we assessed triglyc - eride accumulation associated with the COMT inhibitor tolcapone in HepG2 cells. Here, mainly impaired mitochondrial metabolism of fatty acids and reduced ex - port of VLDL were the mechanisms. The studies show that the techniques devel - oped deliver valuable results regarding mechanisms of hepatocellular triglyceride accumulation by xenobiotics. Statins are drugs used widely to lower LDL-cholesterol in patients with dyslipid - emia but can lead to myotoxicity and impaired insulin sensitivity. Regarding myo - toxicity, we have shown previously that statins impair insulin and IgF-1 signaling by inhibiting the activation of AKT. Impaired activation of AKT leads to a reduced func- tion of mTORC1, which favors protein breakdown and diminishes protein synthesis. In C2C12 cells and in mice we could show that impaired activation of AKT is due to a reduced function of mTORC2, a kinase which phosphorylates AKT ser473. We explain reduced function of mTORC2 by impaired prenylation of certain G proteins essential for formation and function of mTORC2. In addition, treatment with statins can lead to glucose intolerance and diabetes type II. In one of our recent studies, we showed that treatment of mice with simvastatin leads to higher blood glucose concentrations as compared to untreated control mice whereas the plasma insu - lin concentrations were not affected (Fig. 2). These findings were compatible with impaired insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscle. Indeed, simvastatin impaired skel - etal muscle glucose uptake in vivo in mice and in vitro into C2C12 cells. Reduced activation of AKT impaired downstream phosphorylation of GSK3 , leading to di - plasma membranes of C2C12 myotubes. In addition, simvastatin was associated with ER stress, which caused accumulation of Glut4 in the ER. We also investigated the effect of simvastatin on C2C12 myoblasts and satellite cells in mice. Simvastatin was more toxic on C2C12 myoblasts, a surrogate of satel - lite cells, than on myotubes. Simvastatin inhibited the proliferation and maturation of satellite cells in mice and of C2C12 myoblasts, suggesting that simvastatin im - pairs skeletal muscle regeneration. This effect could be prevented by mevalonate but not by insulin, indicating that impaired prenylation of proteins is an important mechanism. Metamizole is an analgesic and antipyretic drug used widely in some countries but is associated with neutropenia and agranulocytosis. To explore potential toxic mechanisms, we used HL60 cells, a human promyelocytic cell line. In a first study, we showed that metamizole reacts with Fe 3+ in hemin (Fig. 3), yielding reactive me - tabolites, which can cause myelotoxicity. Using an in vitro system, we could pro- pose a potential structure of the reactive metabolite. Since HL60 cells can be dif - ferentiated to granulocytes, we were interested up to which cell type metamizole is toxic. Toxicity was predominantly seen for promyelocytes, but not for metamyelo - cytes or granulocytes, corresponding to the clinical findings in affected patients.

Roos NJ, Duthaler U, rone Stephan Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology Toxicological mechanisms of drugs Adverse drug reactions can broadly be divided into type A and type B reactions. Type A reactions are typically observed when drugs are overdosed and often correspond to an exaggerated pharmacolog - ical action. Type B reactions occur at therapeutic doses in patients with susceptibility factors. Met - amizole-associated agranulocytosis is a type B re - action. Our studies show that N-methyl- amino - antipyrine (MAA, primary metamizole metabolite) may react with Fe3+ in hemin in the bone marrow, which produces a reactive metabolite that damag - es granulocyte precursors. Susceptibility factors may be a high hemin concentration (hemin is pro - duced by hemoglobin degradation) and/or an in - sufficient antioxidative system (suggested by our recent genome-wide association study). Valproate is a type A drug for liver steatosis. Since treatment with valproic acid is not often mentioned as a risk factor for liver steatosis, our publication may help to make this subject more popular. Con - sidering the possible severe consequences, pa - tients treated with valproate may be screened for liver steatosis. Statin-associated myotoxicity and type II diabe - tes are dose-dependent and therefore type A re - actions. As shown, these adverse reactions can be explained by the pharmacological action of the statins: block of HMG-CoA reductase with impair - ment of the synthesis of cholesterol intermediates that are important for protein prenylation. Since statins act in the liver, they should not reach the systemic circulation, necessitating excellent he - patic uptake properties. If they reach the system - ic circulation, they should not be transported into skeletal muscle.

Report 2017-2020Various tumors have been shown to contain subpopulations of so-called cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are thought to be responsible for disease initiation, main - tenance, metastasis and relapse after conventional anti-tumor therapies. We hy - pothesize that signaling pathways that regulate stem cells during development are reactivated during oncogenesis in CSCs. For example, we showed that en - hanced expression of the pluripotency-related embryonic protein SOX2 associ - ates with stemness, disease aggressiveness and therapy resistance in putative ovarian and breast CSCs (e. g. Schaefer et al., 2015). Current research in our lab focuses on novel post-translational mechanisms by which SOX2 regulates stem - ness in cancer cells and during the reprogramming of somatic cells to induced plu - ripotent stem cells. Acute myeloid leukemia is driven by chemotherapy-resistant leukemic stem cells that selectively evade immune surveillance by natural killer cells Patients treated for leukemia often achieve remission yet subsequently die of re - lapse. Initiation and relapse of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are thought to be mediated by LSCs, defined by their ability to initiate leukemia in immuno - deficient mice. Interestingly, we could recently demonstrate that AML LSCs are also immune-privileged and escape recognition and lysis by natural killer (NK) cells. Mechanistically, leukemic stem cells (LSCs) suppress for example the sur - face expression of ligands for activating NKG2D receptors expressed on such im - mune cells. We developed an experimental xenograft model that enables robust engraftment of ~95 % of human AML and can be used as pre-clinical model to investigate new treatment avenues (Paczulla et al., 2016). Here we could show that in vivo treat - ment of human AML cells with PARP inhibition (PARPi) was able to co-transplanted human allogeneic NK cells (Fig. 1, Paczulla et al., 2019). We currently focus on the detailed investigation of mechanisms underlying sup - pression of NKG2D ligands in stem cells and the role of PARP1 therein. Compared to healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), LSCs have growth advantages induced by oncogenic mutations, but are in many ways similar to their healthy counterparts. We investigate the complex interactions between LSCs and HSCs, since their sim - ilarities makes it difficult to target LSCs without simultaneously eradicating HSCs. Like HSCs, LSCs home to protective bone marrow niches promoting stemness and therapy resistance and modify them to displace HSCs and promote their own expansion. Supported by an ERC Consolidator Grant, we investigate interactions between LSCs, HSCs and niche cells with the goal of identifying strategies that can promote the fitness of HSCs and target LSCs. The zebrafish as a model organism in health and disease Zebrafish offer a powerful vertebrate model for studies of development and dis - ease. The major advantages of this model include the possibilities of conducting reverse and forward genetic screens and of observing cellular processes by in vivo imaging of single cells (Fig. 2, Konantz et al., 2016). Moreover, pathways regu - lating blood development are highly conserved between zebrafish and mammals. Whole exome sequencing analyses are increasingly performed on patients pre - senting with suspected inherited disease but lacking classical mutations linked to the presented phenotype. We use the zebrafish to explore the functional relevance of genes that are identified by this method, such as SRP54 (Carapito, Konantz et al., 2017) or NCKAP1L (Castro et al., 2020).

In vivo live imaging indicates that suppression of the transcription factor evi1 impairs endothelial cell progression to hematopoietic mously: In control-injected embryos, c-myb:eGFP+ hematopoietic cells directly arise from kdrl:mKate+ ECs along the VDA as previously described: ECs, normally flattened in appearance, transform into double-positive kdrl+c-myb+ cells of spher - ical shape before budding into the lumen of the dorsal aorta (DA). However, after knockdown of evi1 using Morpholino Oligonucleotides (MO), kdrl+c-myb+ cells start transitioning to spherical shape but are not able to emerge from the DA. Confo - cal time-lapse live imaging was performed in Tg(c-myb:GFP; kdrl:mKate-CAAX) embryos from 28 to 42 hpf. Shown is one representative time point in which the transformation from hemogenic EC to the hematopoietic fate is visible, indicated by the white arrowheads. Merged images are shown.

Report 2017-2020The main goal of our group is to investigate repair therapies based on engineered tissues (patches) to induce safe and efficacious angiogenesis and to rescue hiber - nating myocardium in a of heterogenous Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) cells aims to standardize the production of engineered patches (Fig.1). SVF as a cell population is capable of releasing a broad secretome range comprising angiogenic and pro- survival factors. Further aims are to develop in vitro functional cardiac models to investigate processes of myocardial repair and regeneration. Research is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, Swiss Heart Foun - dation, the University Hospital of Basel (USB), and the University of Basel (Unibas). Patches engineered by cells with a high angiogenic and repair potential In this approach, we use human adipose tissue-derived SVF cells as a heteroge - neous cell population with a high angiogenic potential thanks to the presence of numerous endothelial and mural progenitors (collaboration with A. Scherberich, Tissue Engineering Group, Department of Biomedicine, Unibas). We demonstrat - ed that perfusion-based bioreactor culture supported the maintenance of endo - thelial and mural cells as compared to static culture, thereby accelerating whole construct vascularization and support of cell survival upon implantation in a sub - cutaneous nude rat model (Fig. 1-2). Moreover, medium conditioned during 3D perfusion- based culture of SVF was showed to partially rescue damaged cardio - myocyte function during monolayer culture under sever hypoxic condition (<1% of oxygen) (Mytsyk and Isu, 2018). An ongoing in vivo diseased study aims to inves - tigate the repair potential of SVF-perfused patches in nude rat model of cardiac ischemia (in collaboration with the Department of Cardiac Surgery, USB). 3D functional cardiac models Our angiogenic engineered tissues might also affect cardiac repair and regener - ation by influencing cardiomyocyte maturation and functionality while increasing progenitor cell recruitment. Therefore, we aim to generate a 3D functional cardiac models as a tool to investigate the interactions of SVF cells' secretome and car - diomyocytes. We hypothesize that the recapitulation of the proper physiological conditions, mimicking the native tissue environment, enhanced the cardiomyocyte maturation, 3D organization and functionality. Culture medium perfusion systems were employed to mimic the highly dense capillary network present in the myo - cardium to ensure the cardiomyocyte survival in vitro (Marsano, et al. 2010; Maid - hof, et al. 2010; Cerino, et al. 2016). Mechanical stimulation (collaboration with the Politecnico of Milano, Italy and Politecnico of Torino, Italy) was employed to great - ly promote rat neonatal cardiomyocytes or human induced pluripotent stem cell- derived cardiomyocyte maturation and contractility both at the micro- and mac - ro- scale (Marsano, et al. 2016, Massai and Pisani, et al. 2020). Microfluidic culture systems harnessing mechanical stimulation was recently generated to recapitu - late some of key steps of a scar formation (Occhetta, Isu, et al. 2019). A novel 24-multi-well bioreactor (Patent number: EP19165964) was also developed to culture mm-scale engineered cardiac constructs in a highly controlled environ - ment under multi-physical stimulations (isotonic and auxotonic loads Friedrich Eckstein Deborah Fusco (PhD Student) Laia Gili Sole (PhD Student) Prof. Dr. med.

Macro-circulation. Revascularization strategies aim to use autologous blood vessels (e. g. saphen- ous vein) as coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG). However, some patients might need an alternative to the autologous vessels due to recurrent oper - ations or morbidity issues. Nowadays there still lacks a valid alternative to autologous grafts used for CABG. Our research group has developed a vas- cular graft made of acetobacteria-derived nano cellulose reinforced by a cobalt-chrome mesh. Pre - vious results showed the cellulose vascular graft's patency and its colonization by host vascular cells following a one-month implantation. The clinical research counterpart has established two long term studies to test the patency of the cel- lulose vascular grafts used as carotid artery repla- cement sheep and as CABG in pigs.

Report 2017-2020 The common denominator of the research projects in the group is related to the establishment of 3D cell culture systems, combining interdisciplinary efforts in cell biology, engineering technologies and materials science. These systems are used as models to investigate fundamental aspects of tissue development/pathologic changes, or as grafts to induce tissue regeneration. Our main focus is the devel - opment of cartilage and bone/bone marrow tissues, though the developed exper - tise has also been implemented in collaboration with other groups in different ar - eas, including tumor modelling. Cartilage tissue engineering and regeneration (Prof. A. Barbero) Our goal is to repair cartilage defects of traumatic or degenerative nature using grafts engineered from autologous cells. We discovered that nasal chondrocytes (NC) have a larger and more reproducible capacity for cartilage regeneration as compared to other cell types, including articular chondrocytes. Moreover, NC dis - play features of environmental plasticity and can thus genetically and functional - ly adapt to implantation in a joint. Our concept has been translated into a first-in- man study for the treatment of focal cartilage defects in the knee (Fig. 1). Based on the promising findings, we are now coordinating a multicenter phase II trial (Bio- Chip) for the same indications, funded under the EU-Horizon2020 program. In parallel, with the goal to treat also degenerative cartilage diseases (e. g., osteoar - thritis), we are currently investigating the capacity of NC to regulate the main path - ological processes activated in a joint by inflammation and abnormal loading. In the framework of an ERC Synergy project (collab. with F. Rijli, FMI), we target un - derstanding the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms endowing NC with their distinct functionalities. Vascularized bone and bone marrow engineering (Prof. A. Scherberich) One goal of the program is the controlled development of bone / bone marrow os - sicles using human cells, as models for human hematopoiesis and as grafts for bone regeneration. We demonstrated that mesenchymal progenitors from human bone marrow or adipose tissue can recapitulate the developmental process of en - dochondral ossification. This involves the formation of cartilaginous intermediate tissues which robustly and efficiently remodel into functional ossicles upon im - plantation. The system was used to investigate interactions between stromal and hematopoietic cell components (collab. with T. Schroeder, to extracellular matrices (collab. with P. Bourgine, Univ. Lund). An associated goal is the efficient vascularization of the implanted grafts to sup - port scaled up bone regeneration. We found that axial vascularization of engi - neered implants with an arterio- venous (AV) bundle leads to a rapid formation of vascular networks (Fig. 2). This principle was used to reconstruct maxillary bone in a patient following carcinoma excision. The bone defect was satisfactorily re - stored by ectopic prefabrication of a vascularized bone graft using autologous fat- derived cells and an AV bundle, which was transferred into the defect site. Stud - ies are ongoing to adapt and evolve the paradigm for use in the challenging clinical settings of infected bone. Engineering platforms for 3D cell culture Dynamic 3D cell culture under perfusion flow (Fig. 3A) has been introduced to model in vitro tissue development and physiological homeostatic processes (e. g., bone matrix deposition and resorption, stromal-vascular-hematopoietic cell inter - actions) as well as pathologic settings (e. g., cartilage degeneration, hematologic malignancies, solid tumor microenvironment) (collab with R.

Report 2017-2020CT-Osteoabsorptiometry (CT-OAM) - a new investigation technique in the field of mummy research The objective of the current study was to investigate the applicability of CT-OAM on mummies for the load analysis of joints. In order to clarify whether apparent mal - positions of the spinal column existed during lifetime or occurred post-mortem, we evaluated the long-term loading patterns within the endplates of 8 mummies. The implementation of CT-OAM on mummies for load analysis of joints was fea - sible. The mineral density distribution within the endplates was not homogenous but followed distinct distribution patterns. The vertebra columns without malposi - tion showed an almost even circular allocation of the density maxima within tho - racic endplates, the spines with kyphosis displayed a concentration of the density maxima in the ventral area, and the spines with scoliosis exhibited a predominant localization of the density maxima on the concave side. The examined endplates showed characteristic reproducible density patterns consistent with the long-term loading conditions. Pathological load distributions can be visualized with help of CT-OAM before macroscopical changes appear and can therefore help to solve paleopathological and paleoarchaeological questions. CT-calculometry (CT-CM): advanced NCCT post-processing to investigate urinary calculi This study aimed at evaluating the potential of CT-calculometry (CT-CM) as a nov - el method to determine mineralisation, composition, homogeneity and volume of in preoperative NCCTs of 25 patients treated for upper tract urinary by ureterorenoscopy or percutaneous neph - rolithotomy. Absolute mineralisation values were achieved by use of quantitative CT-osteoabsorptiometry and compared to Fourier infrared spectroscopy as a ref - erence for stone composition. Homogeneity was assessed by advanced software- based NCCT post-processing and visualised by using a maximum intensity pro - jection algorithm. Volumetric measurement was performed by software-based threedimensional reconstruction. CT-CM was feasible in all of the 25 NCCTs. Ab - solute mineralisation values calculated by quantitative CT-OAM might be used to identify the most frequent stone types. High levels of inhomogeneity could be de - tected even in pure component stones. Volumetric measurement could be per - formed with minimal efort. CT-CM is based on advanced NCCT postprocessing software and represents a novel and promising approach to determine mineralisa - tion, composition, homogeneity, and volume on preopera - tive NCCT. CT-CM could provide valuable information to predict outcome of dife - rent stone treatment methods. Adaption of the bony-microstructure of the human glenoid cavity due to long-term biomechanical loading Structural arrangements of the bony microstructure of a joint through adaptation - al processes are thought to be determined by the biomechanical demands. Pursu - ing this theory of \"form follows the biomechanical function\", the load distribution of the glenoid cavity, as it is mirrored in its mineralization pattern, should also have an impact on the trabecular network below. To prove this hypothesis, we analyzed the mineral distribution and the distribution of the architectural parameters of the trabecular network below. Our findings clearly show an inhomogeneous but regu - lar and reproducible mineral distribution. Regarding the trabecular network below, Form-Function-Relationship in the locomotor apparatus and application in the living as diagnostic tools or for monitoring the outcome of joint surgery.

With increasing depth, the trabecular network administers the expression of each struc - tural parameter given that the strain energy becomes increasingly evenly distribut - ed and changes from a high degree of differentiation just beneath the subchondral bone plate to a more equal distribution within the deeper areas.

The preva - lence of all CILD is increasing worldwide since several decades. All CILD have an increase susceptibility to bacterial or viral infections, which cause exacerbations of the disease. Together, they incurred the fourth highest health care costs and significantly reduced education and productivity of the patients. None of the CILD can be cured with available therapies, only the symptoms can be controlled. The American Thoracic Society suggested in 2017 that a cure for CILD would only be found when we understand the cause and role of tissue remodelling, which oc - curs in all such diseases. Recent studies implied that the pathogenesis of CILD re - sults from a disturbed response of the lung to environmental factors such as aller - gens, dust, ashes, or microorganisms, as well as humidity, temperature, exercise or stress. Each of these factors alone, or together, trigger epigenetic events that become persistent. Today, it is assumed that the first epigenetic event has to oc - cur during late embryogenesis and early childhood, followed by a second event lat - er in life. However, the nature of these epigenetic events seem to be disease spe - cific and remain largely unknown. Asthma affects 300 million people worldwide and is characterised by chronic air - way inflammation and airway wall remodelling. Today, none of the available drugs can reverse airway wall remodelling, while inflammation can be well controlled. This supports the idea that both pathologies are largely independent. The only therapy that has been shown to reduce airway wall remodelling is bronchial ther - moplasty, but the mechanism is largely unknown. In our latest studies, we have proven that the expression of an important epigenetic regulator, protein methyl ar - ginine transferase 1(PRMT1), is constitutively expressed in mesenchymal cells of asthma patients. This is due to the over-expression of C/EBP- , which suppresses miR-19a, and thereby stimulates the expression of a proliferative signalling path - way. PRMT1 is a major methyl donor for histones, which control the accessibili - ty of pro-inflammatory genes and mitochondria regulating factors. Our research revealed that many well-known asthma triggers, such as TGF- , PDGF-BB, IL-4, and PRMT1 by upregulating C/EBP- . Thus, we found a mechanism that merges the action of different asthma stimulating factors. Furthermore, bronchial epithelial cells from asthma patients secrete heat shock protein-60 (HSP60), which stimulates the expression of PRMT1 in sub-epitheli al mesenchymal cells. Thereby, HSP60 drives and mitochondria ac - in thermoplasty reduced the secretion of HSP60 in asth - ma patients, and thereby interrupted the remodelling driving signalling cascade of PRMT1. Independent from PRMT1, we showed that non-immune IgE stimulates an autologous signalling loop through inhibition of PTEN by increased synthesis of miR-21. This study indicates that the increased IgE found in many asthma patients contributes to remodelling, even in the absence of an allergen.

We link basic and clinical research to find novel bio-markers and therapeutic targets for asthma, COPD, ACOS, and idiopathic fibrosis. None of these diseases is easy to diagnose, and despite symptom control, curative therapies are not available. All studies are based on large pa - tient cohorts, diagnosed according to internation - al guidelines. We preform risk factor analysis and validate new biomarkers, as predictors for exacer - bation and survival of patients. The clinical studies are enabled by a close collab - oration of pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons, hae - matologists, pathologists, and basic research - ers. This translational approach benefits from the close co-location of the Clinic of Pneumology and the research laboratory (DBM). Using human lung samples of patients we are able to isolate prima - ry diseased human epithelial cells, fibroblasts and bronchial smooth muscle cells and provide them to our collaborators in other countries. The cells are analysed for disease specific expression and regulation patterns of biomarkers and inflammato - ry mediators. This also allows us to identify novel disease specific pathophysiological pathways and test new medications on the cellular level. Com - ponents of tissue remodelling are studied under the influence of allergic and non-allergic stimuli. In addition to this translational research projects numerous investigator driven non-commercial randomised studies are performed to optimise patient's safety during bronchoscopy in COPD pa - tients.

Report 2017-2020All multicellular organisms depend on adhesion between cells and of cells to the surrounding matrix. Our long-standing aim is to identify how cells sense and adapt adhesion on molecular, cellular and tissue levels and to apply this knowledge for identification of novel treatment approaches. We primarily focus on desmosomes, a supramolecular complex required for stable interactions of all epithelial and some non-epithelial cells (Fig. 1). The relevance of this junction is evident by a number of severe diseases caused by desmosome dysfunction, e. g. as a result of mutations in desmosomal proteins (resulting in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies, ACM) or of autoantibodies (causing pemphigus, a blistering skin disease). Plasticity and regulation of desmosomes While the molecular composition of desmosomes is well defined, much less is known if and how the adhesive function is modulated in response to external and internal stimuli. We showed that desmosomal adhesion, until now considered to be rather static, can rapidly adapt to external or internal stimuli such as mechan - ical load on junctions or cAMP-dependent signaling. We identified the cytoskel - eton as essential player to maintain desmosomal adhesion homeostasis (Fig. 2). Using biophysical techniques such as single molecule force spectroscopy, we demonstrated that intermediate filaments, which are anchored at desmosomes, modulate the adhesive properties of adhesion molecules and their stability in the membrane. This regulatory function is compromised in pemphigus, in which auto - antibody binding to desmosomal molecules causes uncoupling of intermediate fil - aments from the desmosome, subsequent destabilization of cell-cell adhesion and blister formation in the skin and mucous membranes. In contrast, the actin cyto - skeleton and associated proteins such as -adducin indirectly modulate desmo - somal turnover by shaping clusters of adhesion molecules which is required dur - ing desmosome assembly. Accordingly, adducin-deficient skin fails to adapt to increased mechanical load. To test the relevance of desmosomal adhesive function in a whole animal model, we generated a mouse line in which a putative binding mechanism of desmosom - al adhesion molecules is mutated (Fig. 3). The exchange of a single tryptophane of the adhesion molecule Dsg2 (Dsg2-W2A) results in a severe cardiac phenotype which reproduces the major criteria of ACM on the pathological and clinical lev - el. This not only demonstrates that loss of adhesion is a major trigger of ACM but also gives us an excellent tool to study the impact of adhesion loss on cellular and tissue functions. Beyond adhesion? Non-canonical functions of desmosomal molecules Although desmosomes are primarily described as cell adhesion complexes, they also contribute to cellular functions beyond mere adhesion. As example, we showed that desmosomal adhesion molecules are downregulated at the invasion front of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and a loss increases Slug-dependent invasion and malignant behavior in knockout models. To our surprise, we also detected the expression of distinct desmosomal adhesion molecules in non-adherent cells such as CD4+ T cells. Moreover, tissue-specific loss of Dsg2 in several mouse models led to reduced numbers of regulatory T cells. Application of these knockout lines in distinct disease models will outline the func - tional relevance of this expression. Together, these results fuel the conceptual switch from desmosomes being \"sticky glue\" to representing active modulators in health and disease Group Members Dominique Brantschen* (Undergraduate Student) Niclas Dietrich (MD Student) Dr. Henriette Franz (Research Associate) Anja Fuchs* (Technician) Matthias Hiermaier* (PhD Student) Jan Daniel Hoffmann* (MD student) Sina Hohler (Undergraduate Student) Alicia Lorena Kasper (Undergraduate Student) Jakob (Technician) * left during report periodVolker Spindler Department of Biomedicine Institute of Anatomy University of Basel Cell Adhesion97 Department of Biomedicine .

Report 2017-2020Control of brain development from mice to human How the billions of neurons and glial cells of the mammalian brain are generated from a pool of multipotent stem cells in a precise and orderly fashion is unclear. Using mouse genetics and human pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) we are examining the molecular mechanisms controlling neural stem cell (NSC) maintenance, differ - entiation and fate choices. We perform proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of NSCs, progenitors and newly generated neurons at different stages of mouse de - velopment and from human iPSC cultures at the population and single cell levels and obtain unprecedented insight into the transcriptional dynamics and heteroge - neity in stem and progenitor cells during neurogenesis. Regulation of neurogenesis at the signaling and transcriptional levels Neurogenesis continues in the adult mouse forebrain and hippocampus from NSCs, most of which are quiescent and only a few enter the cell cycle at any point in time. Notch signaling is critical for NSC maintenance. Of the four Notch pro - teins in mammals, we showed that Notch2 conveys quiescence to adult NSCs by regulating cell cycle-controlling genes and inducing expression of Id4, which pre - vents cell cycle entry. We found that Notch1 and Notch2 regulate different aspects of neurogenesis, therefore, we are comparing the regulome and interactome of Notch1 and Notch2 in the developing nervous system. In addition, we address the functions of other signaling pathways in the control of neurogenesis including Hip - po signaling during cerebral cortex development. We analyze how different Tead transcription factors, the Hippo effectors, control different aspects of neurogen - esis. Regulating NSC fate at the post-transcriptional levels The composition of a cell's proteome determines its phenotype and function. Pro - tein expression can be regulated at the mRNA level. We showed how the RNAs - eIII Drosha is an intrinsic regulator of adult NSC maintenance and differentiation though a novel mechanism of direct mRNA cleavage. Drosha represses expres - by cleaving hairpins in their mRNAs. In - trigued by how a ubiquitous enzyme, Drosha, can cleave mRNAs in what we found to be a cell-type and stage-specific fashion, we use quantitative proteomics com - bined with co-immunoprecipitation and affinity pull-down assays to determine the Drosha interactome in NSCs. We identify novel protein complexes and examine how components of these complexes regulate Drosha function and cell fate. Stem and progenitor cells and the origin of brain tumors Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in adults and the prognosis in many cases is very poor. NSC-like cells exist in brain tumors leading to the ques - tion of whether they require the same molecular signals as normal NSCs. We are elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying transformation of neural stem and progenitor cells into tumor cells. Notch signaling has often been implicated as an oncogenic pathway in glioma. Contrary to predictions, we have uncovered a tumor suppressive function for the Notch pathway in brain tumor subtypes. We are cur - rently addressing the differences and similarities between glioma stem cells and NSCs on the molecular level.

Fig. 1: NSCs of the adult hippocampus are multipotent but mitotically inactive. They must enter cell cycle to generate neurons during homeostatic maintenance and they transit to astrocyte production with age. Notch2 blocks NSC entry into the cell cycle by inducing Id4 expression, and inhibits Ascl1 transcription, thereby simultaneously preventing neuronal fate commitment. Id4 increases Hes5 expression by blocking its autorepression, and promotes astrocyte dif ferentiation of NSCs. Increased Notch2 activity in ageing NSCs contributes to reduced neuron production and commitment to astrocytes differentiation.

NFIB drives oligoden - drocyte commitment of hippocampal NSCs, but its expression is repressed but Drosha cleavage of its mRNA. A.

It has been proposed that gliomas could aberrantly hijack the same signaling pathways that allow normal NSCs to self-renew, thus enabling glioma cells to proliferate extensively and form the tumor. Unexpectedly, our studies indicate that Notch signaling, one major mo - lecular pathway implicated in NSC self-renewal, can actu - ally suppress the formation of some forms of brain tumor. 100 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020Group Members Dr. Julie Gamart* Dr. Fabiana Walser- van Gelderen Barbara Widmer* (Administrative Staff) * left during report periodHow an embryo develops from a single cell - the zygote - is one of the most fasci - nating biological processes. Recent research has uncovered the amazing self-reg - ulatory properties of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and cellular interactions that drive organogenesis, which are a focus of our research. One property of self - regulation is robustness against genetic perturbations. Despite congenital malfor - mations being a major cause of infant death, they are relatively rare considering the vast number of genes required for embryogenesis. A paradigm to study genetic ro - bustness is the regulation of gene expression by cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) embedded in genomic landscapes. We have shown that Gremlin1 (Grem1) medi - ated BMP antagonism is pivotal to mouse organogenesis and its dynamic regula - tion in limb buds defines a key node in the self-regulatory signaling system con - trolling its development. The large Grem1 genomic landscape encodes the eight CRMs that orchestrate the Grem1 expression dynamics during limb bud develop - ment. These CRMs were functionally studied by reverse genetics using CRISPR/ Cas9 genome editing in the mouse. While single CRM deletions did not alter limb development, deletion of all eight CRMs reproduces the Grem1 null phenotype. Combinatorial analysis uncovered the complex cis-regulatory logics and robust - ness of the dynamic Grem1 regulation during mouse limb bud development. We establish that these CRMs regulate Grem1 transcript levels in an additive manner while its spatial regulation depends on enhancer cooperativity. The latter provides Grem1 expression and digit development with cis-regulatory robustness as spatial alterations are the cause of digit fusions and loss. The observed phenotypes are very reminiscent of the changes in digit patterns that occurred during evolutionary diversification of mammalian limbs. Indeed, we discover that the Grem1 cis-regu - latory landscape is evolutionary ancient and experimental evidence indicates that it provided the cis-regulatory plasticity for limb skeletal diversification during evo - lution. Two of the CRM enhancers are conserved from basal fishes to mammals and transgenic analysis reveals the substantial plasticity in their species-specif - ic activities, which also provides insights into the molecular alterations underlying the fin-to-limb transition. Another focus is the cellular analysis of the mechanisms controlling progenitor cell proliferation and specification in mouse limb buds. We initiated this analy - sis as little was known about the origin and molecular signatures of the limb bud mesenchymal progenitors (LMPs) that give rise to the chondrogenic primordia of the appendicular skeleton. The combination of flow cytometric analysis with tran - scription profiling revealed the molecular profiles of LMPs in limb buds. In particu - lar, this analysis identified the most immature LMPs in early limb buds as Jagged1 (JAG1) positive cells located in the posterior-distal mesenchyme. The transcription pro-file of JAG1-positive LMPs and their functional manipulation in culture shows that they depend critically on morphogenetic SHH and FGF signaling. In particu - lar, JAG1-positive LMPs are protected from apoptosis by GREM1-mediated BMP antagonism. This shows that the proliferation and survival LMPs in the distal limb bud mesenchyme is controlled by the SHH/GREM1/AER-FGF signaling system. At the same limb bud stage, the osteochondrogenic progenitors located in the core mesenchyme are already actively responding to BMP signaling, which induces their chondrogenic differentiation. This analysis identified the different LMP pop - ulations in early mouse limb buds and uncovers the spatially distinct response of cells to patterning, proliferation and differentiation signals.The Molecular and Cellular Basis of Developmental Robustness and Evolutionary Plasticity - Insights from Vertebrate Limb Bud Organogenesis Aim\u00e9e Zuniga Department of Biomedicine University of BaselRolf Zeller of Biomedicine University of BaselCongenital Malformations . .

Fig. 1: Analysis of the Grem1 cis-regulatory landscape by CRISPR/Cas) genome editing in mice. In the Grem1 genomic landscape (upper scheme) an array of eight CRM was identified, several of which display strong enhancer activities in transgenic mouse limb buds (indicated in blue. The combinatorial analysis of these enhancers showed that CRM2-5 form an enhancer network that regulate Grem1 transcript levels in an additive and the spatial expression dynam - ics in a cooperative manner. Strikingly an 80 % reduction in Grem1 levels results in no digit phenotypes when the asymmetric spatial expression is maintained (lower panel). Only when this spatial cooperativity is broken - i. e. the expression becomes symmetric digit numbers are reduced and middle digits loose their asymmetry.

Report 2017-2020X XxxxxxxThe major goal of this focal area is to foster research in the field of molecular and clinical oncology in Basel. In particular, we aim at bridging the gaps between ba - sic, translational, and clinical oncology research ongoing at the University of Basel and the biotech and pharmaceutical industry in the Basel area. Ultimately, the fo - cal area should enforce collaborative efforts and common projects between var - ious research groups, research institutes and pharmaceutical industry and be - tween different disciplines. An added value is seen in innovative research projects that eventually will be transferred to a clinical setting. In the past years, the Focal Area of Research in Oncology has been chaired by Pro - fessor Gerhard Christofori, leader of the \"Tumor Biology\" group at the DBM, and by Professor Christoph Rochlitz, head of Clinical Oncology at the University Hospital. The program has now been reorganized with new leadership and initiatives, and adapted as Focal Area of Research in Oncology (FARO). It is now chaired by Pro - fessor Mohamed Bentires-Alj, head of the \"Tumor Heterogeneity, Metastasis and Resistance\" group, and by Sara Meyer, head of the \"Myeloid Malignancies\" group at DBM. The program focuses on two major topics: first to support basic, trans - lational, and clinical research by generating opportunities for oncology research, for example by mentoring young investigators and hosting new recruitments with - in the DBM. The second focus of the Focal Area Oncology is to increase communication be - tween the various researchers, clinicians and pharmaceutical company represen - tatives in Basel and to boost scientific exchange and technological collaboration, also with the other Focal Areas of the DBM. Towards this goal, monthly progress reports, one-day symposia and annual meetings are organized to offer platforms for the discussion of research progress and for the exchange of ideas. In addition, renowned international cancer researchers are invited to present lectures within the DBM Oncology Program Seminars, and impromptu Guest Seminars complete the seminar activities of the research program. Many members of FARO are also engaged in the Swiss-wide Personalized Health Initiative in Oncology which aims at implementing the nation-wide exchange and computational analysis of clinical data, at establishing common tumor boards and adequate biobanks, and at inten - sifying the cooperation between basic and clinical research. Many FARO members are also active in the Basel Breast Consortium (BBC) which integrates basic, trans - lational and clinical research on breast cancer and is highly successful in foster - ing many translational research projects and in organizing progress report meet - ings, invited speakers lectures and annual conferences. Finally, specific advanced courses in experimental cancer research and in cell signaling are offered to Mas - ter and PhD students. Thus far, these communication activities have resulted into highly successful collaborations and research networks, manifested also by the accomplishments of several network grants and by the start-up of spin-off com - panies. Accordingly, many of these efforts are part of international and national re - search initiatives that cover innovative approaches towards cancer research and treatment, including research on cancer genetics and genetic instability, cancer epigenetics, angiogenesis and metastasis, signal transduction, cancer stem cells, tumor immunology and immunotherapy, tumor imaging and novel therapeutic reg - imen.

In the years to come, we still need to enforce scientific exchange between basic and patient- oriented research in order to facilitate the identification of clinical problems for the design of appropriate and innovative basic research approaches and, on the oth - er hand, to further improve on the rapid translation of basic research results into clinical application. 104 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020The formation of a metastatic disease accounts for more than 90% of cancer-as - sociated death. Understanding the biological and molecular features of the met - astatic process is key to identify new anti-metastasis therapies. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells that have detached from a primary or metastatic tu - mor mass, have entered the blood circulation and are on their way to establish - ing new metastases at distant sites. CTCs can be found in the blood of patients as single cells or as multicellular clusters. We previously demonstrated that CTC clusters are primarily responsible for the establishment of metastasis at distant sites, and that they are 50 times more metastatic compared to single CTCs (Ace - to et al., Cell, 2014). Similarly, in cancer patients, the presence of CTC clusters in blood circulation denotes adverse clinical outcomes. These results point to the need to better characterize the biology of CTCs to gain more insights into the met - astatic process and to identify new targets whose inhibition may impact the abili - ty to form metastasis. Recently, our group came across three major findings that highlight important fea - tures of metastasis biology. First, we discovered that clustering of CTCs leads to DNA methylation remodeling at critical (stemness-related) transcription factor binding sites, favoring metastasis seeding. We also identified FDA-approved drugs with the ability to target (dissociate) CTC clusters and suppress the metastatic spread of cancer in mouse models (Gkountela et al., Cell, 2019). These results are rapidly translating to patients, as clinical trials with these inhibitors are now being conducted in breast cancer. Second, we have discovered a new type of CTCs that was previously uncharac - terized, i.e. those that travel in association with immune cells. With single cell par - allel RNA and exome sequencing of CTCs from breast cancer patients and mouse models as well as CRISPR-based loss-of-function studies, we understood that CTCs most frequently partner with neutrophils, and that CTCs derived from CTC- neutrophil clusters feature recurrent mutations, higher proliferation rate and in - creased ability to initiate metastasis compared to CTCs that are not bound to neutrophils. We also uncovered that CTC-neutrophil clusters are held together through VCAM-1-dependent intercellular junctions, and that neutrophils secrete IL1beta and IL6 to boost CTC proliferation in the bloodstream (Szczerba et al., Na- ture, 2019). These findings were not only key to the identification of ta new route of metastatic dissemination, but also because they represent one of the first exam - ples whereby the interplay between cancer cells and immune cells occurs away from the primary tumor site, yet determines disease outcome. Third, we asked what are the molecular triggers that promote the intravasation of CTC clusters and CTC-neutrophil clusters into the bloodstream from the primary tumor site. We found that intra-tumor hypoxia is localized within well-defined areas of the primary tumor, and that cell-cell junctions are upregulated in hypoxic tumor cells. In turn, this promotes the ability of hypoxic cells to intravasate as CTC clus - ters and CTC-neutrophil clusters, leading to accelerated metastasis formation. In contrast, treatment with EphrinB2 improves tumor vascularization and decreases hypoxia, leading to a reduced shedding rate of clustered CTCs and suppression of metastasis (Donato et al., Cell Reports, 2020). Together, recent results from our laboratory have contributed to a better under - standing of CTC biology and vulnerabilities of the metastatic process (Figure 1). Our research is now focused on increasing the translational potential of our find - ings and testing new therapeutic approaches in preclinical models. In collabora - tion with clinicians at the University Hospital Basel we routinely profile CTCs isolat - ed from the blood of cancer patients, aiming to define their key molecular features Circulating Tumor Cells .

Although the overall survival rates for breast cancer have improved over the last decades, more than 600,000 lives are lost to this disease annually because of drug resistant metastases. A thor - ough understanding of both cancer cell intrinsic (i. e., cell autonomous) and extrin - sic (i. e., non-cell autonomous) mechanisms of breast cancer progression is ur - gently needed to end this stalemate. The thread connecting the research topics in my lab is tumor heterogeneity. We as - sess fundamental mechanisms that influence normal and neoplastic breast stem cells, metastasis, and resistance to targeted therapies at the molecular, cellular, and whole organism levels. These interdisciplinary projects seek to leverage a mechanistic insight into personalized therapy, which is a focus of the translation - al research that we pursue in close collaboration with clinicians (Fig. 1) (www.ben - tireslab.org).

Glucocorticoids promote breast cancer metastasis Transcriptional profiling of tumours and matched metastases revealed cancer-site specific phenotypes and increased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity in dis - tant metastases. GR mediates the effects of stress hormones and synthetic deriv - atives. We show that increase in stress hormones during breast cancer progres - sion resulted in GR activation at distant metastatic sites, increased colonization, and ultimately reduced survival. The data also reveal that GR activation decreases the efficacy of the widely used chemotherapy paclitaxel. Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone are widely used in the treatment of breast cancer to combat side- effects of chemotherapy and to treat symptoms related to advanced cancer. Our results suggest that GR activation increases heterogeneity and metastasis and, thus, call for caution in the use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of BC patients with cancer related complications (Obardovic, Nature 2019).

Hippo kinases LATS1/2 control human breast cell fate with ER Using a high-content confocal image-based shRNA screen for tumor suppressors regulating human breast cell fate, we have discovered that ablation of the Hippo ki - nases large tumor suppressors (LATS) 1 and 2 promotes luminal fate and increas - es the number of bipotent and luminal progenitors, the proposed cell-of-origin of most human breast cancers. Mechanistically, we revealed a crosstalk between Hippo and ER signaling. In the presence of LATS, ER was targeted for ubiqui - tination and DCAF1-dependent proteasomal degradation. Our findings reveal a non-canonical effect of LATS in the regulation of human breast cell fate (Britschgi, Nature 2017). Swiss Personalized Oncology The Swiss Personalized Oncology (SPO) driver project, part of the Swiss Personal - ized Health Network, is chaired by Profs. Bentires-Alj and Michielin (CHUV). SPO is a Switzerland-wide effort that aims at integrating clinical and molecular infor - mation from cancer patients, which should ultimately enable more precise diagno- ses and thus treatments tailored to individual patients. SPO'S main goal is to achieve interoperability of the clinical and laboratory data from cancer patients in Switzerland. Personalized breast cancer treatment While the SPO is a nationwide effort, we have assembled, a local group of clini - cians to make up a breast cancer personalized medicine team that should ultimate - ly improve treatment of patients. Our goal is to collect patient samples and to use multiomics, combined with drug response profiling and computational analysis, in the assessment and modeling of cancer and tumor microenvironment heteroge - neity in a longitudinal way (Fig. 2). 108 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020 The vast majority of cancer patient deaths are due to the systemic dissemination of cancer cells throughout the body and the seeding and outgrowth of secondary tumors (metastases) in distant organs. One major objective of our research is the identification and characterization of the molecular pathways underlying the pro - gression from differentiated benign tumor cells to invasive malignant cancer cells and to the seeding and outgrowth of metastasis in distant organs. Moreover, we have set out to delineate the genes and pathways that allow cancer cells to evade from current therapies. In addition to cultured tumor cell lines in vitro , we employ transplantation and transgenic mouse models of specific cancer types to deter - mine causal connections between the expression of particular genes and the cel - lular changes during tumor progression, metastasis formation and therapy resis - tance in vivo . In the past years we have learned that the development of malignant tumors is in part characterized by a tumor cell's capability to overcome cell-cell adhesion and to invade surrounding tissue by a process referred to as epithelial-mesenchymal- transition (EMT). An EMT underlies the conversion of epithelial, differentiated cells to mesenchymal, migratory and invasive cells. EMT occurs in multiple stages and is regulated by complex molecular networks regulating the expression of a large number of proteins, lncRNA and miRNA-encoding genes. Using dual recombi - nase lineage tracing approaches in transgenic mouse models, we have noted that hybrid intermediate stages of EMT represent the stages of highest cell plasticity which confers cancer cells with hallmarks of cancer stem cells and increased met - astatic traits and drug resistance. For example, we have found that breast cancer cells undergoing an EMT and exhibiting high cell plasticity can be therapeutically forced to differentiate into post-mitotic adipocytes, thus eliminating invasive cells and limiting metastatic seeding. Investigating the regulatory circuits defining cell plasticity, we have established the epistatic nature of a network consisting of tran - scription factors, miRNAs and lncRNAs which act as master regulators not only in the initiation and execution of the morphogenic process of an EMT but also in pro - viding survival signals to cancer cells and thus allowing cancer cells to seed and grow metastases in distant organs. With these experimental approaches we have also identified novel signaling pathways and epigenetic events occurring during EMT, which have been subsequently scrutinized for their potential use as thera - peutic targets for preventing metastatic disease. In a second line of research, we have investigated the molecular pathways under - lying the development of evasive resistance to targeted cancer therapy. We have found that cancer cells shift from lethal autophagy during acute therapy to survival autophagy in therapy-resistant cells, thus overcoming cell death. Moreover, thera - py-resistant cells appear to undergo a partial EMT and gain anti-oxidant activities which are critical in overcoming ferroptosis, a novel programmed cell death path - way involving reactive oxygen species and lethal lipid peroxidation. Finally, ther - apy resistant cells appear to shift their metabolism to glycolytic pathways. These pathways are specific for therapy resistant cells, and we have shown in preclinical experiments that they offer suitable therapeutic targets for overcoming resistance to conventional therapies.Molecular dissection of malignant tumor progression, metastasis and therapy resistance Group Members * left during report periodTumor Biology Due to the retirement of Gerhard Christofori, the group will be closed by August 2021Cancer .

Report 2017-2020Connection to Clinical Practice Markus Heim, Walter Weber Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel Evasive resistance to targeted therapy and tumor heterogeneity The development of resistance to targeted cancer therapy (evasive resistance) has appeared a major obstacle in treating cancer. In two network projects connecting patient care (Markus Heim), biomedi - cal research (Mike Hall, Biozentrum) - ling, D-BSSE, ETHZ, Basel), we have aimed at the molecular dissection of the pathways underlying the development of drug resistance to current can - cer therapy. We have employed drug-sensitive cell lines and their drug-resistant counterparts, novel mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to identify some of the molecular pathways under - lying evasive resistance and to test first alterna - tive therapies to overcome it. These projects have been supported by a European Research Council (ERC) Synergy Grant and by a SystemsX.ch MTD Grant. In a network project in collaboration with the De - partment of Surgery of the University Hospital Ba - sel (Walter Weber) and basic and computational researchers of the DBM and the Friedrich-Mie - scher-Institute in Basel (Mohammed Bentires-Alj and Michael Stadler), the University of Z\u00fcrich (Ber - nd Bodenmiller) and IBM R\u00fcschlikon (Maria Rodri - guez), we have addressed basic questions regard - ing breast cancer cell heterogeneity in patients and in experimental models and we have learned about the regulatory networks driving EMT and metastasis formation.

Gynecol Oncol. 148:79-85.Key molecules in ovarian cancer dissemination Peritoneal dissemination is a particular form of ovarian cancer metastasis which is the cause why the majority of patients are diagnosed at advanced FIGO stage accompanied with a poor patient's outcome. Identifi cation of the molecular play - ers involved in ovarian cancer (OC) dissemination can offer an approach to devel - op treatment strategies to improve clinical prognosis. We have identified several cell surface markers that may promote the spreading of ovarian cancer. Here, we describe integrin 2 (ITGA2) as a key factor for can - cer cell adhesion to extracellular matrix protein collagen that promotes metasta - sis to the omentum as demonstrated by in vitro assays in gene-edited cancer cell lines and ex vivo using patient-derived tumor cells. Moreover, we also demonstrate that ITGA2 promotes directed cell migration and mesothelial clearance in co-cul - ture systems. Mechanistically, the rely pathways ( Huang et al., 2020; Fig. 1). In a collaboration with Leonor David (University of Porto, Portugal) we show that mesothelin (MSLN), which is overex - pressed in primary and matched peritoneal metastasis of high-grade serous car - cinomas, promoted invasion of tumor cells through the mesothelial cell layer in vi - tro. Intraperitoneal xenografts established with MSLN-high OC cell lines showed enhanced tumor burden and spread within the peritoneal cavity. MSLN is hence suggested as key player in OC progression by triggering peritoneal dissemination (Coelho et al., 2020). Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reverse MET are suggested to be key features of OC metastasis and comprise cellular and molecular processes essential for local tumor growth, dissemination, and establishment of metastases at distant sites. We found that loss globoside glycosphingolipids (GSL) through genomic deletion of the key enzyme A4GALT induced EMT in OC cells, associat - ed with loss of E-cadherin expression (through epigenetic silencing of CDH1 ) and cell-cell and increased chemoresistance ( Jacob et al., 2018 ). Our current focus is to understand the role of GSL in MET, identify associated signaling path - ways and study the expression of GSLs in patient-derived cells.

Report 2017-2020Connection to Clinical Practice Prof. Viola Heinzelmann-Schwarz Hospital for Women, Department of Gynecology and Gynecological Oncology, University Hospital Basel Precision medicine in ovarian cancer management The tailoring of treatment in cancer is a pivotal for improved treatment regimens. In this respect, one study shows a superior outcome of patients with Malignant mixed Mullerian tumors originating from the endometrium (MMMT-E) treated with plati - num/anthracycline or ifosfamide regimen as com - pared to those treated with platinum/taxanes reg - imens, suggesting that the previous shift from anthracycline or ifosfamide-based towards tax - ane-based chemotherapy for MMMT-E (possibly also for MMMT of the ovary) may be worth review - ing (Heinzelmann-Schwarz et al., 2020). In addition, the potential of immunotherapy for patients with advanced cervical cancer is highlighted by the per- sistent complete response after third-line treat - ment for relapsed chemotherapy-resistant cervical cancer (Baettig et al., 2019). In regards to ovarian cancer, our data suggest Letrozole maintenance treatment improving recurrence-free interval (Hein- zelmann-Schwarz et al., 2018). These data are the basis for our initiated MATAO-trial, a phase III multi- center international clinical trial to evaluate the effi-cacy of Letrozole maintenance therapy after stan - dard surgical and chemotherapy treatment in pa - tients with newly diagnosed ER- positive epithelial OC (PI: Prof. Heinzelmann-Schwarz). We are also part of the Tumor Profiler (TuPro) Con - sortium, an integrated, multi-omic, functional tumor profiling platform for clinical decision support, and currently evaluate the use of various state-of-the-art platforms (www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/202 0.02.13.20017921v1).with Arun Everest-Dass and for Griffith Uni - versity, Australia), we have established MALDI imaging to study spatial distribution of GSLs in matched and longitudinal tissue samples. New molecular signatures towards early detection, outcome prediction, and tailored management of ovarian cancer The identification of markers (signatures) for early and accurate diagnosis and re - liable outcome prediction are the key to optimal management of ovarian cancer. In the era of precision medicine, where we transition from organ-based diagnosis towards individual genetically-linked diseases, the tailoring of treatment in cancer becomes increasingly important. This is particularly true for high-grade advanced stage serous adenocarcinomas comprising malignant tumors of the ovary (OC), fallopian tube (TC) and peritoneum (PC). These diseases currently are managed similarly, but our study using transcriptomic and next-generation sequencing data and validation by immunohistochemistry in various patient cohorts indicate that OC and PC are epidemiologically and molecularly distinct disease entities: PC re - lapsed earlier, had a distinctively different gene signature, and showed a different sensitivity to standard chemotherapy drugs compared to OC ( Jacob et al., 2020) . A preceding study characterized the N- and O-glycome of these two disease entities using tissue glycomics and revealed also distinct glycomic signatures i.e. proteins are differently and uniquely glycosylated in OC versus PC (Anugraham et al., 2017) . Additional studies from our own group evaluated candidate ovarian cancer detec - tion and outcome markers for HGSOC. Among them the expression of maternal embryonic leucine-zipper kinase correlated 2017) , whereas LATS expression was not associated with outcome in ovarian cancer patients (Montavon et al., 2019) . Fig 1: Schematic representation of ITGA2-collagen dependent signaling axis in ovarian cancer metastasis Left: Cancer cells shed of from primary ovarian tumor are passively (via ascites) disseminate into the peritoneal cavity and establish a metastatic tumor in the omentum (omental metasta - sis). Integrin (ITGA2) triggers cell adhesion to collagen-rich omentum, pro - motes directed cell migration, anoikis resistance, mesothelial clearance, and peritoneal metas- tasis through the activation of MAPK and FAK signaling axis. Right: This process can be inhibited at several levels by deletion of ITGA2 function (disrupts interaction with collagen), by integrin 21 inhibitor TC-I-15 (dimerization failure with Integrin 1), adhesion kinase FAK and mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK (blocks signaling multiple cellular processes).

Report 2017-2020In 2018, we founded the Brain Tumor Immunotherapy (BTIT) re - search group, which closely collaborates with the Brain Tumor Biol - ogy group (BTB) to the point that a clearcut thematic distinction is not meaningful for the purpose of this report. Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating brain tumor devoid of curative treatment options. Cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), especially tumor-associated microglia, play a pivotal role in tumor development and support (1). Targeting microglia in combination with other modalities is a promis - ing therapeutic strategy to control the disease. Microglia modulation and adaptive immunity. We have setup genetically modified immunocompetent mouse strains to genetically activate or deplete microglia in the tumor con - text. We found significant survival benefits when microglia was ge - netically activated. In vitro , we have optimized microglia phagocy - tosis assays, and are now able to perform them in reproducible manner using in vivo imaging and flow-cytometry based methods. This also applies to human GBM derived microglia, which enables us to assess the interaction/phagocytic capacity of microglia and GBM cells in a patient-matched way. Specifically, we are investigating the role of potential don't eat me signals, specifically Siglec receptors and Sirpa/CD47, on microglia, in the context of GBM. We analyzed Siglec expression in GBM associated microglia and found a cor - relation of SIGLEC9 expression with overall survival. We have es - tablished mouse colonies to specifically delete SiglecE on microg - lia or overexpress human SIGLEC9. blocking Siglec-E or Siglec-H enhanced tumor cell phagocytosis. Moreover, tumor cell phagocytosis was enhanced when we combined Siglec blockade with Sirpa-CD47 disruption. In the next years, we are es - pecially interested in the role and interaction of microglia with T-cells that infiltrate into the tumor but are severely exhausted. We will thor - oughly characterize the immune compartment in the mouse tumor models under question by multidimensional analysis. We hypothe - size that \"overphagocytosis\" of GBM cells by microglia would lead to an intratumoral-cross presentation of neoantigens which in con - sequence could lead to tumor-reactive T-cells. Microglia modulation and tumor specific CAR T cells. We have generated and tested several batches of EGFRvIII-specific human CAR T cells. In parallel we have setup a CRISPR based ap - proach to place the EGFRvIII CAR directly under the control of the TRAC promoter to become independent of lentiviral integration ar - tifacts and potentially improve efficacy of the T-cells. Next, we will combine the CART treatment with microglia modulation, especially anti-CD47 treatment, but also other modifiers of microglia activity. In parallel, we have backcrossed the Sall1-GFP reporter mouse to an NSG background and will be able to perform cranial window experi - ments to visualize the interplay of pharmacologically modulated mi - croglia, grafted tumor cells and intratumoral CARTs in detail. We aim Combined Microglia Modulation and Targeting to Combat . Mouse Tumor Models to streamline the CAR production to fit GMP standards in line with a current initiative at our hospital. Moreover, modified CAR constructs that reprogram the GBM (TME) have been generated. Microglia phenotype in GBM regions: region specific treat - ment responses. We acquired a large biobank of navigated, clinically annotated brain tumor samples, specifically from viable tumor center and non-con - trast enhancing, infiltrated periphery. We performed single-cell RNAseq analysis (Fig. 1) and established 3D perfusion bioreactor cultures of a vast array of these samples, to (1) pinpoint the differ - ences of microglia and other immune components between cen - ter and periphery at baseline, and to assess the local response of the TME to combinations of microglia modulators and T-cell check - point inhibitors. Using a microscopy platform (CODEX, collabora - tion with Christian Schuerch, Stanford) for formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue, we established a 50-marker panel to gain unpre - cendent insight into the plasticity of the iTME under different treat - ment paradigms. The data of 8 patients is currently analyzed on our high-performance computing platform and will give us exciting in - formation on how microglia and T-cells are shaping in different ther - apeutic settings and tumor regions (Fig. 2).

Prof. Luigi Mariani, Dr. Severina Leu Neurosurgery, University Hospital Basel Profiles from -omics analyses of gliomas have allowed to update and refine 'classical' histopathology, to lead to the 2016 WHO integrated classification of CNS tu - mors. Although newly defined subtypes can show distinct outcomes and responses to therapy, only few markers are currently available for only partial glioma classification. With the support of the Forschungs - fonds of the University of Basel, we aim at identifying biomarkers specific for fast and reliable WHO glioma classification. To do so, we are currently performing wide-range proteomic and phospho-proteomic anal - yses of nearly 100 biopsies from adult glioma of all histologies and grades operated at Department of Neurosurgery. Identification of novel biomarkers is ex- pected to provide novel tools for fast and reliable glio - ma classification, so that most appropriate therapeu - tic strategy could be applied, and longer term, may designate novel therapeutic targets.Connection to Clinical Practice Prof. Gregor Hutter, Prof. Luigi Mariani Neurosurgery, University Hospital Basel Towards personalized glioma treatment Having direct access to the neurosurgical operat - ing theatre, we have been building a large biobank of clinically annotated brain tumor specimen and con - trol samples. Using this repository, we are currently investigating the immunological differences between matched treatment-na\u00efve primary and on-treatment recurrent GBM samples to deduct potential immu - nological interventions at recurrence. Indeed, several promising candidate genes expressed on tumor-as - sociated microglia/macrophages and/or tumor cells are correlated with time to recurrence (manuscript in preparation). In a proteomic study exploiting this biobank, we iden - tified endocytic machinery components to be widely reduced in GBM samples, which might be an impor - tant and potentially targetable mechanism of enhan- ced oncogenic receptor signaling in GBM (Buser et al., 2019, Fig. 3). Generous support from the Department of Surgery at the University Basel and Pro Patient Forschungsstif - tung enabled us to invest into a 3-dimensional in vivo culturing platform, which will allow us to tailor patient- specific immunotherapies in combination with tumor- targeting treatments. Using this approach, we hope to simulate the effect of patient-specific CAR T cells and combined microglia modulation directly on tumor tis - sue. The developed multi-dimensional analysis tools (CODEX, multiomics) will help in treatment stratifi - cation.

The goal of these studies is to gain novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of cardiotoxicity and cancer drug-associated cardiac side effects and to identify nov - el therapeutic targets for cardioprotection. Our ongoing work focuses on fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3), a prominent target of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) administered to acute myeloid leukemia and solid tumor patients, in whom ensuing cardiomyopathies have been observed. We found that Flt3 is upregulated in the ischemically injured heart and that its activa - tion via intramyocardial injection of its ligand confers cytoprotection and improves remodeling and function after myocardial infarction in mice (Pfister O et al., J Am Coll Cardiol 2014). Using Flt3 ligand-deficient mice and mice treated with a Flt3- targeting TKI, we also uncovered a role of Flt3 in the maintenance and functional - ity of the cardiac side population (Della Verde et al., submitted), a population en - riched in cardiac progenitor cells (Pfister O et al., Transl Res 2014), which could be relevant for patients with atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. We further examined the effect of impaired Flt3- signaling on the outcome after myocardial in - farction using Flt3-deficient and TKI-treated mice. We found very different effects depending on whether a genetic or pharmacological strategy was used, whereby the involved mechanisms appear related to both heart-intrinsic (pharmacological model) and heart-extrinsic actions of Flt3 (genetic model) (Monogiou Belik D, sub - mitted, and Della Verde G et al., unpublished). We and others found that cancer drug toxicity is associated with cardiac microvas - cular rarefaction, which is at least in part due to the impaired endothelial differen - tiation potential of cardiac progenitor cells. These findings prompted us to further study the molecular mechanisms responsible for endothelial differentiation of car - diac progenitor cells. In this context, we identified the cell cycle regulator and tu - mor suppressor polo-like kinase 2 as an important regulator of cardiac cell fate in the early stages of endothelial lineage commitment (Mochizuki M et al., J Am Heart Assoc 2017 and J Vis Exp 2019). In summary, our findings on cancer relevant kinases in the heart provide novel in - sights into cardiac progenitor cell biology, are instructive regarding potential side effects of novel TKIs in the heart and could be therapeutically exploited to improve post-infarction remodeling and regeneration. In our ongoing work, we now focus on non-coding RNAs in cardiac disease in a collaborative effort within COST Action CA 17129 CardioRNA (Robinson EL et al., Noncoding RNA 2020, Pedrosa da Costa Gomez et al., Circulation 2020, Pedrosa da Costa Gomez et al., Noncoding RNA 2019). Emerging concepts in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) HFpEF accounts for roughly half of all heart failure cases, but its pathophysiology is still poorly understood and no evidence-based guidelines for its treatment be - yond the control of co- morbidities exist (Kuster GM and Pfister O, Swiss Med Wkly 2019). An emerging concept of HFpEF proposes that a pro-inflammatory state cre - ated by various co-morbidities including metabolic disease, diabetes, and hyper - tension, causes microvascular endothelial inflammation, which is associated with Cancer drug targets and the failing heartOnco-Cardiology .

Report 2017-2020Connection to Clinical Practice Onco-Cardiology, a young and growing sub-specialty in cardiology During the past decade, the still young and very dynamic field of Onco-Cardiology has established itself as a new sub-specialty of Cardiology. Where - as the focus at the beginning was mainly on the cardiotoxicity of classic chemotherapies such as anthracyclines, the field has grown significantly to include now all interfaces between cancer and car - diovascular disease from shared pathophysiology over common risk factors to the co-existence and interaction of both diseases. Rapid developments in the field of oncological drugs lead to a continu - ously large number of new approvals or new sub - stances or substance classes administered within the scope of clinical trials. As a result, cardiovas - cular side effects in oncological patients will con - tinue to be relevant in the future. Close interdis - ciplinary and multi-professional collaboration is essential in order to sustainably improve the sur - vival of tumor patients, both with regard to the tu - mor and cardiovascular diseases. Current clinical and translational collaborations are ongoing with Medical Oncology, Hematology and the Breast Center of the University Hospital Basel.

Report 2017-2020Our main goal is to improve immunotherapy for cancer patients by using transla - tional in vitro and in vivo tumor models, performing correlative analysis of patients treated with immunotherapy and conducting early clinical interventional trials (also see link to Medical Oncology). One of our research foci is on the role of glycans and glycan-binding receptors in anti-cancer immunity. Glycans can mediate important interactions with immune cells and manipulation of glycans and glycan-binding receptors (lectins) bear a great potential to improve anti-tumor immune reactions. Glycan-mediated interac - tions in cancer immunology are significantly underexplored and could be used to improve anti-cancer immunity. Our group has studied the interaction between gly - cans that contain sialic acids (siaologlycans) and their interaction with Siglec re - ceptors on immune cells and have demonstrated that this pathway can be targeted to augment T cell stimulation and tumor control. Current goals include improve - ment of cancer immunotherapy by modifying glycans in the tumor microenviron - ment and glycans of cellular products for adoptive cell therapies including genet - ically modified T cells. An additional focus of our group is the improvement of immune checkpoint block - ade and adoptive cellular therapies by investigating mechanisms and patterns of resistance to these therapies. To this end, we are investigating the tumor micro - environment as well as circulating immune cells in patients undergoing immune checkpoint blockade or adoptive T cell transfer. Identified pathways are further studied in the laboratory for their potential as new targets to improve antitumor im - mune responses. Improving cancer immunotherapy .

Clinical trials have shown high and very encouraging re - sponse rates depending on the stage and se - lection of patients. We have established and ex - pansion protocol for the treatment of melanoma patient refractory to standard immune therapy with checkpoint inhibitors (and BRAF/MEK inhibition in BRAF mutated patients). Our first planned clinical trial just recently start - ed and will recruit patients. It includes an adapted classical expansion protocol and the application of IL-2 after the adoptive TIL transfer. In addition, we will perform a PD-1 blockade after stopping IL-2 treatment to render the tumor microenvironment more permissive for tumor-attacking T cells. Our program will enable us to expand this treat - ment option to other tumor types. In addition, we are working to improve the expansion protocols and the specific expansion of tumor- recognizing T cells. Finally, the program will also allow for a di - rect translation of new genitically- modified T cell therapies into early clincical trials. 120 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are chronic leukemias - of mature myeloid thrombocytosis, - creased megakaryocytes and marrow fibrosis. They progress to bone marrow fail - ure or acute myeloid leukemia. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as a cu - rative therapy is limited to a subset of patients. It is the goal of our studies to contribute to novel therapeutic approaches by targeting the molecular signaling driving these diseases. MPN are characterized by dysregulated signaling of the JAK2 kinase due to ac - quired mutations in the JAK2 signaling pathway. JAK2 is a tyrosine kinase essential for hematopoiesis as the mediator of signaling from thrombopoietin, erythropoietin and GM-CSF receptors. JAK2 activates several signaling STAT transcription pro - naling is constitutively activated by mutations JAK2, MPL or CALR. The central role of JAK2 signaling in MPN has led to the development of JAK2 inhibitors which act as ATP mimetics and stabilize JAK2 in the active form (type I inhibitors). De - spite certain benefits, type I JAK inhibitors fail to reduce the MPN clone suggesting limited disease-modifying potential and induce resistance. To improve therapeutic targeting of JAK2 signaling, we are pursuing several approaches: Targeting MAPK pathway activation We found that MAPK signaling remains activated in MPN despite JAK2 inhibi - tion. This suggests that of MAPK effectors bypass phar - macologic JAK2 blockade. We identified PDGFR signaling as a mediator of com - pensatory MAPK activation and dual targeting of JAK2 and MEK1/2, intermediate kinases in the MAPK pathway, showed superior therapeutic efficacy. Correction of splenomegaly and cytoses was improved by combined JAK2/MEK inhibition. Bone marrow fibrosis was reduced to an extent not seen with JAK2 inhibitors sug - gesting the MAPK pathway needs to be targeted for enhanced therapeutic efficacy. More effective targeting of JAK2 A new mode of JAK2 inhibition has been reported which stabilizes the inactive form of JAK2 (type II inhibitors). We found high potency of type II JAK inhibition in preclinical MPN models. We observed decreased allele burden suggesting type II JAK inhibition could lead to a class of agents with disease-modifying potential. Resistance to type I JAK2 inhibitors is also abrogated. We are continuing our stud - ies on type II JAK2 inhibition given the potential to lead to more potent, clone-di - rected JAK2 inhibitors. Mechanisms of resistance to JAK2 inhibitors Response to type I JAK2 inhibitors may be lost upon prolonged exposure, but JAK2 resistance mutations have not been found in patients. It has been shown that MPN cells reactivate JAK2 signaling by formation of JAK2 heterodimers with other JAK family members as JAK1 and TYK2. We found that this escape mecha - nism extends to type I JAK inhibitors in clinical development and observed cross- resistance. These molecular studies of resistance to JAK inhibitors may reveal new therapeutic targets, while studies on patient samples will provide insight into clin - ical JAK2 inhibitor Therapeutic Targeting Resistance Mechanisms Sara Meyer Division of Hematology and Department of Biomedicine University Hospital Basel and University of BaselMyeloid Malignancies Group Members Jungius (PhD student) Alice Santopolo (Master student) 121 Department of Biomedicine .

Connection to Clinical Practice Prof. Dr. J. R. Passweg Prof. Dr. R. C. Skoda Division of Hematology, University Hospital Basel Characteristics of oncogenic signaling, therapeutic response and resistance in MPN patients Our studies on oncogenic signaling and targeted therapeutic approaches in MPN are in close col - laboration with Prof. R. Skoda who has established a long-term MPN patient cohort at University Hos - pital Basel, and Prof. J. Passweg, Head of the Divi - sion of Hematology at University Hospital Basel. We are studying clinical isolates of MPN patients with different mutational setup or at different stages of the disease for characteristics of oncogenic signa- ling and functional capacity of hematopoietic stem/ progenitor cells. We are interested in the signaling dynamics in response to different therapies and upon development of resistance to conventional JAK2 inhibitors such as ruxolitinib. Collaborative studies with Prof. R. Levine based on the MPN co - hort at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center New York, support these efforts. We aim to corre - late the molecular findings with clinical character - istics of response or resistance to therapy in these MPN patients. These translational studies will fa - cilitate potential clinical studies on improved targe- ting of JAK2 signaling in MPN in the activates STAT-, PI3K- and MAPK pathways and we have that combined inhibition of e. g. JAK2/Bcl2 or JAK2/MEK can increase benefit in JAK2-driven leu - kemia. We are investigating the JAK2 signaling network to delineate mechanisms limiting efficacy of JAK2 inhibitors to inform therapeutic strategies. We aim to ex - tend these studies to other myeloid malignancies with suboptimal clinical benefit of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. JAK2 signaling in thrombopoiesis Efficacy of therapeutic targeting with JAK2 inhibitors is limited by on- and off-tar - get toxicities. Thrombocytopenia is a relevant side effect of JAK2 inhibition.

Elucidating the mechanisms of these diseases will help to understand NMSC development in the general population. Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is an autosomal recessive disease. EV pa - tients develop plane wart-like lesions in childhood mainly on the neck and extrem - ities. Most patients develop NMSC, mostly on UV-exposed areas. They are sus - ceptible to beta-human papilloma virus (HPV). These HPV are harmless to the general population because they miss E5, a gene which is probably necessary for HPV to overcome the immune system. In about 50 % of patients, biallelic null mu - tations are found in TMC6/EVER1 or TMC8/EVER2. Function of both proteins and the pathomechanism in EV are unknown. It is assumed that they are part of kera - tinocyte-intrinsic immunity, since EV patients are not susceptible to other infec - tious diseases. We have expanded the phenotypical spectrum of EV by careful examination of pa - tients. In collaboration with Casanova's group (Rockefeller University, NY; INSERM and Imagine Institute, Paris) we discovered CIB1 (calcium and integrin binding 1) as a novel EV-associated gene. Functional studies showed the formation of a com - plex of both TMCs and CIB1. We generated a keratinocyte model using CRISPR- Cas9 enabling future functional studies of CIB1 independently of patient material. Ichthyosis with confetti (IWC) is an autosomal dominant hereditary skin disorder. IWC patients suffer lifelong from erythroderma, but develop pale spots within the inflamed skin area, which look like healthy skin. All patients are carrier of a hetero - zygous keratin (KRT) 1 or KRT10 mutation which leads to a shifted reading-frame. We showed that the reading frame needs to be translated in an arginine-rich C-ter - minus of the keratin, leading to its nuclear accumulation instead of cytoplasmic lo - calization (Fig. 2). It needs to be elucidated how the nuclear localization is associ - ated with the disease-typical mitotic recombinations or gene conversions affecting the chromosome with the mutated KRT. This loss of heterozygosity leads to ke - ratinocytes expressing the wildtype allele only. These cells present as pale spots on the skin. By clinical examination of patients and next-generation sequencing on fixed material from deceased patients, we showed that IWC patients have an increased risk of NMSC. Further functional analyses will be done to clarify how the IWC-causing pathomechanisms are related to NMSC and whether the same mechanisms are involved in NMSC in the general population. As model to study skin diseases, we developed epidermal organoids. An organoid is a collection of organ-specific cells that develops from stem cells or organ pro - genitors and has the capability to recapitulate the function and architecture of the target organ. They are used for drug development and toxicity studies and in per - sonalized medicine. They also have the potential to replace organ transplantation. In contrast to 2D keratinocyte cultures, epidermal organoids recapitulate the func - tion and structure of the epidermis. By testing culture conditions, we have estab - lished Murine and Human Epidermal Organoids (HEO). HEO be success - fully generated from human foreskin keratinocytes (Fig. 3) and skin biopsies from healthy donors or patients. While being necessary to protect us against dangers from the environment, in - nate immunity in the skin, when dysregulated, leads to various inflammatory der - matoses.

Report 2017-2020Salvatore Piscuoglio Department of Biomedicine Visceral Surgery and Preci - sion Medicine University of Basel and Institute of Medical Genetics and Pathology University Hospital Basel Precision medicine is about getting the right treatment to the patients at the right time. Taking rectal cancer as an example, patients with intermediate-stage rec - tal cancer are typically treated with chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical exci - sion to remove any residual disease. Post- surgery histologic analysis reveals that ~25% of the patients achieve complete response to chemoradiotherapy, meaning that they would not have needed surgical intervention. For the remaining patients that do not achieve complete response to chemoradiotherapy, alternative thera - peutic options are desirable. Thus the identification of robust biomarkers that will precisely predict which patients would likely achieve good response to chemora - diotherapy, thus sparing them the unnecessary surgery, are urgently needed. On the other hand, model systems that reflect the biological behavior of the tumors in individual patients to test alternative therapeutic options in an ex vivo manner are essential. Our lab takes several complementary approaches to address outstand - ing challenges in precision oncology. Ex vivo models for drug testing Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have been shown to retain the molecular fea - tures of the original tumors and to better resemble tumor heterogeneity than tradi - tional two-dimensional cell culture methods derived from single cell clones. They are thus frequently used as ex vivo preclinical models for drug response prediction. In collaboration with the visceral surgeons at the Clarunis, we have initiated the prospective collection of patient tumors to establish a living biobank of PDOs. To date, we have successfully established a collection of ~100 PDOs (Fig. 1a). We have also established a protocol to test drugs and monitor response in real-time over five days. Using this protocol, we showed that 6-mercaptopurine effectively reduc - es cell growth and induces apoptosis in colorectal tumors with overexpression of ADSL, a gene with a critical role in purine synthesis (Fig. 1b). Discovery of cancer vulnerabilities The concept of synthetic lethality has helped extend precision oncology to enable the targeting of undruggable genes by disrupting their genetic interactors. For in - stance, GATA3 is mutated in 15-18% of estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer but is not targetable. By systematically interrogating a large-scale RNAi screen, we identified MDM2 as a top synthetic lethal interactor of GATA3. We found that phar - macological inhibition of MDM2 with idasanutlin reduces cell proliferation and in - duces apoptosis in GATA3-deficient cancers in vitro and in two independent in vivo models (zebrafish and chicken chorioallantoic membrane models). GATA3-mutant PDOs are also more sensitive to idasanutlin than GATA3-wild-type PDOs (Fig. 2a- b). With idasanutlin and other MDM2 inhibitors widely available, our findings can be rapidly translated into clinical trials to evaluate in-patient efficacy and GATA3 mu - tation status as a predictive biomarker of response to idasanutlin in breast cancer. Cell-free DNA as a minimally invasive tumor surrogate Precision medicine is only possible with tumor materials, and those that can be ob - tained through minimally invasive procedures (e. g. blood draw) are particularly de - sirable. Plasma- derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been shown to reflect the ge - netic makeup of tumors and may serve as a tumor surrogate for mutation detection and disease monitoring during the course of therapy. cfDNA may be particularly useful as a genetic surrogate for tumors difficult to or not amenable to biopsy. This is important for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as its diagnosis does not always require tissue biopsy; tumor tissue materials in inoperable patients are usually un Profiling Integrative approaches to augment precision medicine in cancer Group Members Aikaterini Apostolopoulou (Technical Staff) Dr. Gaia Bianco (Postdoc) Gina Boot Dr. med.

Report 2017-2020DNA in our cells is continuously damaged through its exposure to reactive agents of endogenous or environmental origin. Damage to DNA, however, does not only occur randomly by chemical reactions, but also on purpose, by the action of en - zymes, to increase genetic variance or alter cell fate determining epigenetic marks, i.e., DNA methylation. Modifications of either kind occur thousands of times in our DNA every day and need to be controlled if genome integrity is to be maintained. We investigate molecular mechanisms underlying this dynamic instability of ge - nomes. Over the past years, our research focus has been the role of DNA repair in DNA demethylation and its contribution to the patterning and maintenance of epi - genetic programs - hence - cell identity. We have been following three main lines of investigation towards (i) unraveling the basic molecular mechanisms and func - tion of active DNA demethylation, (ii) the relevance of DNA methylation control and stability for human aging and disease, and (iii) the impact of the environment on the stability of DNA methylation. Shaping chromatin by DNA repair mediated DNA demethylation An important long-term interest of our research has been a DNA repair pathway controlled by the \"Thymine DNA Glycosylase\" (TDG). TDG first caught our atten - tion because of its ability to remove thymine (T) or uracil (U) when mismatched with guanine (G) in DNA. TG and UG mismatches arise frequently by hydro - lytic deamination of cytosine (C) or 5-methylC (5mC) and, unless repaired, will give rise to C>T mutations, the most prevalent base substitution found in our ge - nomes. While its enzymatic activity implicates TDG in the anti-mutagenic repair of these mismatches, our research led us to uncover a quite different function. It started with the unexpected observation that a genetic defect in TDG causes de - velopmental failure in a mouse model, due to aberrant gene expression and DNA methylation patterning. Together with work of others on the biochemistry of trans- eleven-translocation (TET) proteins, these findings indicated TDG to act in a path - way for active DNA demethylation, operating through the oxidation of 5mC by TET and replacement of the oxidized 5mC with a C through TDG dependent DNA re - pair. We then found that TDG and TET indeed cooperate in differentiating cells to drive cyclic methylation and demethylation at specific gene regulatory sequences. We were able to show that TET1 and TDG physically and functionally interact to form an active DNA demethylase, and to proof by full biochemical reconstitution that the TET-TDG-repair system, coordinated by SUMO modification, is capable of productive DNA demethylation. Ongoing work addresses, amongst other ques - tions, the \"biology\" of TDG driven DNA methylation/demethylation cycling, in par - ticular its implicated role in shaping chromatin and gene expression states in dif - ferentiating cells. (Epi)genetic maintenance by DNA repair Aberrant DNA methylation contributes to tumorigenesis by deregulation of the ge - nome, but exactly why and how such aberrations arise is largely unknown. Our aim is to identify and mechanistically understand genetic und environmental con - ditions modulating DNA methylation stability in human tissues. Investigating DNA methylation stability in the human colonic mucosa with a molecular epidemiolog - ical approach, we were able to decipher distinct patterns of age-dependent DNA methylation drift and found the rate of such DNA methylation change to be mod - ulated by lifestyle factors, including BMI, medication and smoking.

Report 2017-2020Our research aims to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of a hu - man blood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We focus on genetic le - sions associated with particularly aggressive disease that, despite improved ther - apeutic options, remains incurable for most of the patients. Based on the rarity and genetic heterogeneity of the disease with limited access to primary material, we perform most of our studies in cell- and mouse models. During the last three years, we worked on two major subjects. A) We studied the impact of the cellular origin and transforming potential of AML- associated fusion oncogenes by generating a series of inducible transgenic mouse lines (in collaboration with A. Peters, FMI, Basel and T. Mercher, Institute Gustave Roussy, Paris). We found that these fusions act as epigenetic regulators and in - duce a reversible leukemia in mice that closely phenocopies the human disease. Interestingly, induction of an MLL-AF9 fusion in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) resulted in a more aggressive disease than activation in more committed progen - itor cells. In contrast to MLL-AF9, the MLL- ENL fusion only resulted in leukemia when induced in HSC and early multipotent progenitors suggesting a particular window of hematopoietic transformation susceptibility (Stavropoulou et al., 2018). The NUP98-MLL fusion is the only AML-associated MLL rearrangement in which the entire C-terminus of the protein is maintained. Induction of NUP98-MLL re - sulted in myelodysplastic syndromes and AML in mice (Fisher et al., 2020). The ETO2-GLIS2 fusion gene is a molecular hallmark of acute megakaryoblastic leu - kemia (AMKL) almost exclusively affecting young children. Strikingly, ETO2-GLIS2 induction in mouse fetal HSC rapidly induced reversible AMKL, while expression in adult mouse BM cells resulted in long latency AML. Chromatin and transcrip - tomic analysis revealed that ETO2-GLIS2 rewired transcription factor activities in an ontogeny-dependent manner. Thus, we established the first in vivo model for ETO2-GLIS2-driven AMKL and showed that the phenotype of pediatric AML is de - termined by ontogeny-dependent susceptibility for transformation by particular oncogenic fusion genes (Lopez et al., 2019). B) Functional characterization of the nuclear interacting SET domain protein 1 (NSD1), a histone methyltransferase involved in a fusion oncogene in pediatric AML, led us to study acute erythroleukemia (AEL). Genetic inactivation of NSD1 in the hematopoietic system of the mouse unexpectedly resulted in development of a fully penetrant disease with several hallmarks of human AEL. Functional studies revealed that despite abundant expression of the erythroid transcriptional master regulator called GATA1, differentiation of Nsd1-/- erythroblasts was significantly impaired. Expression of wildtype but not a catalytically-inactive NSD1 mutant res - cued differentiation associated with increased GATA1 chromatin occupancy and target gene activation. Collectively our work indicates that the NSD1 methyltrans - ferase is a novel regulator of GATA1-controlled erythroid differentiation and leuke - mogenesis (Leonards et al., 2020). AEL is a rare but very aggressive human cancer. To better understand its molecular pathology, we genetically characterized a series of world-wide collected primary AEL samples. We found at least three molecular subgroups including patients carrying TP53 mutations, epigenetic mutations, and others. We established a transcriptomics-based space in which, independently of the genetic subgroup, most AEL samples exhibited a unique mapping that was clearly different from other AML or MDS. In >25% of the cases, we found aberrant expression of transcriptional regulators related to impaired activity of GATA1.

This work indicates that AEL is a genetically heterogeneous disease with an erythroid identity that results in part from the aberrant activity of key erythroid tran - scription factors like GATA1 (Fagnan et al., 130 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a group of blood diseases characterized by aberrant proliferation of precursors of the myeloid, erythroid and megakaryo - cytic lineages. They represent clonal stem cell disorders with a tendency towards leukemic transformation. Currently, no curative therapy is available. MPNs com - prise 3 entities: polycythemia vera (ET) and pri - mary myelofibrosis (PMF). The goal of our studies is to advance the understanding of the molecular events that initiate MPN and influence its progression to leuke - mia. A recurrent mutation Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene that substitutes a valine to phenylalanine at position 617 ( JAK2 -V617F) is present in a majority of patients with MPN. This mutation leads to activation of the Jak2 tyrosine kinase and rep - resents a driver for the proliferation of hematopoietic cells. Activating mutations Calreticulin (CALR) and the Thrombopoietin receptor (MPL) genes represent other frequent driver events. Despite this progress, several questions remain unsolved including what determines whether a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) after acquir - ing a driver gene mutation expands to initiate MPN disease, or stays inactive and eventually disappears, what determines the progression to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia, and how a single JAK2 -V617F mutation causes three different MPN phe - notypes. We are examining these questions by combining three approaches: mo - lecular studies in patients with sporadic MPN, genetic analysis of familial MPN and transgenic mouse models that mimic the human disease. Analysis of MPN disease initiation The discovery of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and the fact that JAK2 -V617F is one of the most frequent CHIP mutations in healthy indi - viduals showed that acquisition of JAK2 -V617F not the rate-limiting step in MPN pathogenesis, as only a fraction of individuals who carry JAK2 -V617F eventually de - velop MPN disease. We are examining which factors promote the expansion of the JAK2 -mutant clone to MPN disease initiation (Fig. 1). We determined that addition - al mutations in epigenetic regulator genes, e. g. Ezh2, or Dnmt3a, or inflammatory signals (e. g. IL-1), as well as inherited predisposition mutations can favor clonal expansion and MPN predisposition for MPN syndromes resembling MPN can be grouped into two classes: 1. Inherited disorders with high penetrance and polyclonal penetrance, clonal somatic mutations, e. g. in JAK2 -V617F. We identified for the first time a mutation in the erythropoietin (EPO) gene that causes familial polyclonal erythrocytosis with elevated erythropoietin levels. This mutation, a single-nucleotide deletion (c.32delG), introduces a frameshift in exon 2 that interrupts translation of the main EPO messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript but initiates excess production of erythropoietin from what is normally a noncoding EPO mRNA transcribed from an alternative promoter located in intron 1. Families with \"class 2\" phenotype are more common than generally assumed. These germ line mutations increase the likelihood of transition from JAK2 -V617F CHIP to MPN disease. We are using genetic methods to identify such pre-disposing mutations. Mouse models for MPN We generated JAK2-V617F transgenic mice that express the human JAK2 -V617F and develop MPN phenotype.

Clinical Practice Prof. Jakob Passweg, Dr. Beatrice Drexler and Dr. Pontus Lundberg Division of Hematoloy, University Hospital Basel New therapeutic approaches to treat MPN: From bench to bedside A collaborative study with Dr. S. Mendez-Ferrer showed that a 3-adrenergic receptor agonist re - stored Nestin-positive cells within the stem cell niche, and thereby normalized blood counts and improved myelofibrosis in our JAK2 -V617F MPN mouse model (Arranz et al., Nature 512:78-81, 2014). Based on these observations, we performed a clin - ical phase-II study with JAK2 -V617F-positive MPN patients (Drexler et al., 2019). While the pri - mary end point (reduction of JAK2 -V617F allele bur- den of 50 %) was not reached, we observed in - crease in Nestin-positive niche cells and decrease in reticulin fibrosis in Mirabegron-treated patients. These results are encouraging and show that Mi - rabegron can modify the microenvironment where the JAK2 -mutant stem cells are maintained and thereby diminish the fibrotic manifestations of MPN. Fig. 1: Model of MPN disease initiation. Somatic mutations can occur in all cells including he - matopoietic stem cells (HSCs). A single HSC in bone marrow that acquired a driver gene mu - tation (marked in red), e. g. JAK2 -V617F, can either divide and increase the number of mutant HSCs, or divide and differentiate to mature cells of limited life span, thereby eliminating the mu - tant clone. This \"pre-CHIP\" phase is not yet detectable in peripheral blood. The JAK2 -mutant clone has to expand to become self-sustaining and to generate sufficient numbers of mature blood cells to become detectable in peripheral blood (CHIP-phase). Further expansion and clonal dominance of the JAK2 -mutant HSCs is required to initiate MPN disease characterized by increased numbers of erythrocytes and/or platelets (MPN-phase). Several factors (marked in red) can favor the transition from CHIP to MPN and the progression to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia (AML).

We demonstrated that MPN can be initiated by transplanting single hematopoietic stem cells that carry JAK2 -V617F as the sole genetic altera - tion and that loss of function mutations in Ezh2, Dnmt3a promoted, while loss of IL-1, the inflammatory master regulator, decreased MPN disease initiation from single HSCs. We are using our mouse models for pre-clinical screening of Jak2 in- hibitors and other potential therapeutic agents. We also found that mutant JAK2 induces metabolic reprogramming of hematopoietic cells causing increased ener - gy requirement that can be targeted by inhibitors of metabolism (Rao et al 2019).

Its catalytic subunit p110 exists at the plasma membrane in two complexes, either bound to the adapter subunit p84 (also dubbed p87PIKAP) or p101. The p84-containing com - plex operates in a cholesterol-rich submembrane compartment and requires activated Ras to produce phosphoinositide (3,4,5)-tris phosphate [PI(3,4,5) P3]. Using isoprenylation inhibitors of Ras, we could demonstrate sensitivity in mast cell PI3K signaling operating via p84, and resistance on macrophages with both p101 and p84 (Jin et al., 3-kinase (PI3K) - mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis is key to cancer progression, but also regulates inflammatory, allergic and meta- bolic events and plays a role in neurodegenerative disease. The four class I PI3Ks are the only PI3K family members to produce PtdIns(3,4,5) P3, which acts a docking site for effector proteins with phosphoinositide-binding domains. While class IA PI3Ks associate with phosphorylated growth factor receptors and their substrates, the sole class IB, PI3K , is activated protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). The PI3K catalytic subunit p110 is bound to either a p84 or p101 adapter subunit. We have demonstrated with various approaches that the p84 and p101 subunits have non-redundant functions, and that the full activation of the p84-p110 complex re - quires activated, GTP-loaded Ras proteins. This makes mast cells, expressing exclu- sively p84, susceptible to drugs interfering with Ras membrane attachment, while macrophages with p84 and p101 maintain GPCR signaling [Fig. 1]. This suggests that targeting of p84-p110 complexes provide a cell-selective path to alleviate al - lergic responses, without impairing host defense mechanisms (Jin et al., 2020).

In spite of major efforts, only a handful of PI3K inhibitors (PI3Ki) have been approved up-to-date. Besides the investiga - tion of mechanisms of PI3K isoform activation in cancer, inflammation and allergy, we have developed a number of drug-like molecules targeting the PI3K-mTOR pathway. Of these, the PQR309/bimiralisib pan-PI3Ki (Beaufils et al., 2017) has been explored in phase II clinical trials in solid tumors and lymphoma. A conse - quence of targeting all class I PI3Ks are mechanism-based systemic feedbacks loops, such as drug-induced hyperglycemia and compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Especially the latter interferes with optimal drug action of PI3Kis, and might oc - cur because of a simultaneous inhibition of PI3K and PI3K . Moreover, we have elucidated off-target effects of PI3K inhibitors that are chemically closely relat - ed to PQR309: while BKM120/buparlisib and PQR309 have potencies as PI3K inhibitors, BKM120 also interacts with tubulin. In consequence, the dominant BKM120-induced cell fate in 66-cell lines was mitotic arrest. A subsequent struc - tural, chemical and biological analysis revealed how BKM120 binds to the colchi - cine-binding pocket of tubulin, an off-target interaction that is structurally prevent - ed in PQR309. Exploration of PQR309/BKM120 target engagement also revealed a corrected orientation of BKM120 in PI3K [Fig. 2; (Bohnacker et al., 2017)]. Department .

A spin-off company of the University of Basel, PIQUR Therapeutics, has completed phase I clinical trials with PQR309. PQR309 is a potent, brain penetrable pan-PI3K inhibitor with moder - ate action on mTOR kinase activity. Initial studies showed hyperglycemia, an adverse effect typical for this class of compounds, which could be atte- nuated by intermittent dosing schedules. Phase II studies have been carried out in lymphomas, sol - id tumors, and in a drug combination trial using PQR309 with eribulin (piqur.com; clinicaltrials.gov). Recently, a topical formulation of PQR309 has been developed to be tested in cutaneous T-Cell Lym - phoma (CTCL) and plaque by Swiss CTI and Innosuisse has promot - ed research at University of Basel and allowed the generation of a number of novel lead compounds targeting PI3K and mTOR with de fined selectivity profiles. Besides cancer, other TORopathies were explored, including Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Another collaboration with AstraZeneca (Go- thenburg, Sweden) elucidated a novel class of PI3K inhibitors with a novel mode of action involving con- formational changes of the PI3K catalytic subunit. These inhibitors are destined to unleash myeloid cells' anti-tumoral responses. The currently established chemical space at UniBas provides further target specificities and opportu - nities, which are currently explored. Further ques - tions aim to understand the biology of tumor drug resistance to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, and include novel tools generated for chemical genetics.investigations spurred to the discovery of novel microtubule disrupting agents, and the development of dual PI3K/mTOR (PQR514, PQR530) and highly selective mTOR kinase inhibitors (mTORKi), (Rageot its (Borsari et al., 2020). tan-8-yl})-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl]-4-(difluoro- a High - ly Potent and Selective mTORC1/2 Inhibitor for Cancer and Neurological Disorders.

In contrast to pan-PI3Kis, PQR620 and PQR626 did not provoke hyperinsulinemia, and seem well tolerated. These compounds were therefore successfully used in animal models to attenuate lymphoma and ovarian cancer. As PQR620 and PQR626 are brain permeable, they were evaluated in other diseases emerging from an overactivated mTOR pathway (TORopathies). In patients with Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) mutated, benign hyperplastic lesions (hamartomas) are present in brain, kidney, heart, skin, lung, and liver. Morbidity is often dominated by neurological effects, including subependymal nodules (SENs >90 %), subepen - dymal giant <20 mental impairment, and epilepsy (~90 %). PQR620 and PQR626 displayed an excellent efficiency in the attenuation of epileptic seizures in a TSC-induced (GFAP-Cre x Tsc1flox/flox) mouse model with frequent spontaneous seizures [Fig. 3]. The elimination of seizures in the mouse TSC null model above, and an increased seizure threshold in a mouse model of chronic epilepsy (Brandt et al., 2018) are a clear demonstration of the efficacy of mTORKi action in the central nervous system.134 Department of Biomedicine .

Thus, cancer immunotherapy is increasingly consid - ered to be one of the most important advances in the field of medicine following out- standing clinical successes with adoptive T cell therapies or blockade of immune checkpoints (Nobel Price in Medicine, 2018). Yet, therapeutic benefits are current - ly limited to a minority of treated patients and many patients are either refractory ab initio or develop resistance to such therapies, through yet poorly understood mechanisms. Our research group is a translational science laboratory in cancer immunology and immunotherapy. We are applying basic science research in im - munocompetent murine tumor models and primary human tumor specimens and translating our discoveries and knowledge directly into early clinical testing (clini - cal trial unit including a phase I unit). The understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy allows for designing novel combination immunotherapy approaches to overcome these resistance mechanisms. In the last years, our research has been dedicated to mechanistically understand the immu - no-modulating capabilities of novel anti- cancer therapies in order to pave the way for rationally designed treatment algorithms. We have recently provided insights into the therapeutic activity of immune-modifying chemotherapy that can elicit strong anti-tumor immunity in patients and mouse models. In addition, we showed that resistance to immunotherapy can be successfully overcome by synergistic combinations of immunotherapeutic agents and approaches specifically target - ing immune-suppressive pathways. Figure 1 provides an overview with references. A major barrier for effective cancer immunotherapy is intra-tumoral immune cell exhaustion. A comprehensive understanding of molecular initiators and promoters of T cell exhaustion is key to develop more effective strategies to restore antitumor immunity. Our group is interested in dissecting mechanisms underpinning T and NK cell exhaustion in human cancer patients; accordingly, recent work elucidat - ed the diversity and functional impact of inhibitory T cell receptors expressed in cancer patients. To develop strategies to overcome tumor-induced T cell dysfunc - tion, immunotherapeutic agents endowed with specific immune-activating capac - ities have been evaluated to induce a functional T cell recovery, thereby enhanc - ing the effector functions in tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Figure 2 provides an overview with references. We are currently working on implementing emerging technologies for multidimen - sional characterisation of the tumor microenvironment. E. g. CODEX is a novel mul - tiplex imaging platform, which is capable of providing information on expression of up to 50 markers from a single tissue slide coupled with spatial coordinates of the cells (Figure 3). It is an excellent tool to study immune cells in their in situ en - vironment. In addition, CyTOF (mass cytometry) is a multi parameter tool allowing for detailed quantification to study the cell subsets in suspension. Therefore, com - bining CyTOF with CODEX allows for through immune and tumour cell characteri - sation, also in the samples where material for analysis is limited.

Report 2017-2020X XxxxxxxImmunology Gennaro De Libero Department of Biomedicine University of Basel and University Hospital of Basel Christoph Hess Department of Biomedicine Division of Medical Out-patient Clinic/Clinical Immu-nology University Hospital BaselThe Immunology Focal Area comprises 31 Principal Investigators, which partic - ipate in the University of Basel Immunology Community (uBICo) group. uBICo promotes scientific collaboration, training of PhD students and organizes weekly Immunomeetings, an annual retreat, the PhD-club and seminars presented by dis - tinguished guest speakers. Significant basic immunological questions are investigated. Important topics are: i) the mechanisms of thymic development and the role of thymic epithelial cells with focus on their genetic and epigenetic control; ii) The role of T follicular helper memory cells and their use as ideal candidate targets for innovative vaccines; iii) the regulation of lymphocyte trafficking, with emphasis on the role of the direction and nature of chemokine gradients; iv) the function of small regulatory microRNAs and of miR-17~92 on T cell co-stimulation and fine-tuning of the T cell response to antigen; v) the relevance of Innate Lymphoid Cells, the mechanisms how they rec - ognize and kill target cells, how their antigen presentation is influenced by tissue- specific signalling cascades. Another main topic is the influence of cellular metabolism on the immune response. Seminal work showed that in T cells the metabolic state changes over time, and influences both their early response and late diminished function. T cell metabol - ic changes are facilitated by a dynamic physical association of cellular organelles and of cytoplasmic enzymes. Changes in cellular metabolism occurring within cells which become T cell targets is also object of studies. Alterations in key metabolic pathways may lead to the accumulation of unique metabolites, which bind the antigen-presenting molecule MR1 and stimulate metabolite-specific MR1-restricted T cells. These novel T cells are gaining great interest because mostly tumor cells accumulate the stimulatory metabolites and thus are primary targets of this type of immune response. A direct correlation between innate immunity with metabolism regulation is being investi - gated in diabetes patients. The role of inflammatory processes in the failure of in - sulin production was demonstrated and the close association of metabolic stress with IL-1-mediated immune response provided novel understanding of the patho - genesis of type 2 diabetes. Many translational studies address the mechanisms of disease and innovative im - munotherapy approaches. Liver and gut diseases are main topics. Predictive biomarkers for response to treatments in Hepatocarcinoma (HCC) are studied using combination of molec - ular and bioinformatic approaches. Organoid models of HCCs are used for drug screening and to reveal phenotype-genotype correlations with clinical data. Another investigated liver disorder is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The capac - ity of various hepatic cells in presenting microbial metabolite antigens to Mucosal Associated Invariant T cells is under scrutiny. Patients with cirrhosis have been studied to define the role of attenuated immune response to microbial challenge. This curbed immune response has been asso - ciated to increased numbers of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells ex - pressing TAM receptors. Inflammatory bowel disease is being studied with a fo - cus on metabolite-sensing receptors in macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells, 137 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020possibly relating microbial metabolites to disease pathogenesis. A link of colon macrophage numbers with glucose homeostasis was clearly documented, infer - ring a role of these cells as sensors of local microenvironment. Autoimmune diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Systemic Lupus Ery - thematosus (SLE) are also investigated. In MS patients during infections, autoreac - tive B cells can be activated upon co-capture of microbial and self-membrane an - tigens. In MS, neurofilament light chain has been validated as marker of neuronal damage to measure disease activity and drug response. In SLE, molecular mimic - ry is a mechanism activating C1q-reactive B cells due to the striking sequence ho - mology between a major linear epitope of C1q and an antigenic site of Epstein Barr Virus. In SLE patients another important alteration is reduced disposal of apop - totic cells, which in turn promotes immunogenicity of self-antigens that usually re - main intracellularly. The immunology of infectious diseases represents another major focus. Compelling studies revealed that upon yearly influenza vaccinations protective im - munity is affected by the previous vaccination history. Prospective studies address whether adaptations in the vaccine formulation recruit na\u00efve B cells and broaden the immune repertoire, or instead mostly boost the pre-existing immunity, thus skewing the response. Epidemiological studies focus on transmission events. The infection with human influenza viruses, and most recently the pandemic SARSCoV-2 are being investi - gated, with emphasis on spatio-temporal dynamics. A new assay based on micro - bial genome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis has been established to very rapidly predict antibiotic resistance. Cellular immunotherapy is being implemented in patients with severe infections with Cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus. Virus-specific T cells from immuno - compromised patients are expanded and reinfused, thus reducing the outcomes of such infections. Other topics are the HIV-1 reservoir formation, stability and dynamics during ear - ly therapy of patients with HIV infection. These studies revealed that the main con - tributors to HIV-1 persistence reside outside circulating blood cells. Primary immunodeficiencies, also known as inborn errors of immunity, are be - ing molecularly characterised. Novel disease-causing immune gene variants have been identified and personalised treatment strategies have been devised in such patients. Cell engineering and immunotherapy of cancer are also fields of main investiga - tions. Novel approaches to gene engineering have been established. TCR gene transfer has been validated in animal models of cancer. Finally, clinical trials with NK and T cells have been approved and are in progress.138 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020The translational immunology lab focuses on human immunology. We are interest - ed in antigen-specific immune responses in the context vaccinations and autoim - mune disease. Evolution of the humoral immune response following repeated seasonal influenza vaccination Viruses mutate and thereby evade the host immunity. If this happens at a high rate, as in influenza, such 'escape' is a major challenge for vaccine design. An influenza vaccine protecting us from all potentially occurring viral variants remains the holy grail of influenza vaccine research. The current influenza vaccination strategy of yearly vaccination with adapted strains aims to counteract viral escape. To better understand the factors influencing vaccine responses in healthy and immunosup - pressed individuals, we study the immune responses following influenza vaccina - tion in these subjects. In the setting of seasonal influenza vaccination, we found that in immunosuppressed subjects (i. e. HIV infection) the response profiles (i. e. a multidimensional vector that includes time and antigen specificity) are similar to those in healthy, whereas the magnitude of the response is dampened (Berger C T. Human Vaccine Immunother, 2015). In a follow-up study on healthy subjects we could show that the vaccine response to the influenza vaccine is moreover strong - ly affected by the previous vaccination history. We found evidence that the vaccine response can become skewed, rendering the subject prone to viral escape (Big - ler, M. B. et al. (in preparation)). We are currently expanding these findings in a prospective clinical study of repeat - ed annual influenza vaccination over three consecutive seasons from 2018-2021. We investigate the evolution of the B cell responses by immunophenotyping and B cell receptor sequencing, and by defining the antibody functions and cross-reac - tivity. Specifically, we aim to dissect whether adaptations in the vaccine formula - tion recruit new na\u00efve B cells to the overall influenza response (i.e. broaden the re - sponse) or mainly boost/adapt the preexisting immunity (i.e. skew the response). Using a systems approach, this data may allow formulating predictions based on the pre-vaccination profile and repertoire. This may help identifying (i) who is in need for yearly vaccination, and (ii) which antigenic difference between subse - quent vaccinations induce diversification of the vaccine response. Ultimately, we aim to apply this towards more personalized rather than one-size-fits-all vaccina - tion strategies, to reduce the risk of vaccine failure. The immunological targets in autoimmune vasculitis Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system attacks self-proteins. Un - derstanding the target of the immune response in autoimmune disease may enable developing therapies interfering with the cause of immunopathogenesis directly. Target identification moreover allows developing tools to measure autoimmunity. Clinically relevant autoantibodies have been described in various autoimmune dis - ease. Immunological biomarkers in predominantly T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases have not yet been established for clinical use. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a T cell-mediated, inflammatory disease of unknown etiology. GCA exclusively affects the large arteries. Disease manifests as an in - flammatory syndrome and ischemic symptoms resulting from stenosis of inflamed arteries. There is strong evidence that T cells play an important role in disease in - duction and/or maintenance. The pathogenesis remains, however, unknown. One of the goals of our lab is to unravel the events leading to disease and more specif - ically the immunological target of the T cells.

Ann Rheum Dis. 2019 Jul;78(7):1012-1014.Connection to Clinical Practice PD Dr. Thomas Daikeler and Prof. Dr. Christoph Hess Division of Rheumatology, University Hospital Basel The Swiss Giant Cell Arteritis Cohort Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most prevalent of the primary vasculitis syndromes with an increas - ing disease incidence. Patients typically present with constitutional symptoms, headache, and a systemic inflammatory syndrome. To date thera - py of GCA is based largely on steroids, and guided by parameters reflecting disease activity only par - tially, as indicated by recent imaging-studies. Fur - thermore, intensity and duration of steroid thera - py remain a matter of debate, and no consensus exists in defining remission. Both GCA itself and the steroid based therapy are associated with sig - nificant morbidity. Improving diagnostic accuracy and monitoring of disease activity thus would be of great importance. To study these clinical prob - lems, we established in 2011 a prospective inter - disciplinary cohort of patients with GCA at the Uni - versity Hospital Basel. Since 2020, we co-lead a Swiss Cohort for GCA that involves all Universi - ty Hospitals in Switzerland. In the Relevant clini - cal data, laboratory parameters, serum and pe - ripheral blood mononuclear cells from all patients are collected at longitudinal time-points. Vascular disease activity is assessed using new technolo - gies such as color-coded duplex ultrasound and positron emission tomography. Thereby we aim at integrating clinical data, imaging studies, and extended immunological and histomorphologi - cal assessments for a more detailed understand - ing of the immunopathogenesis of GCA. This may help to (i) further develop precise, ideally non-inva - sive, tools to diagnose and monitor disease activity, and (ii) generate strategies towards interfering with specific pathways associated with disease activity and/or complications.of a prospective single-center GCA cohort at the university hospital Basel that we are running with the rheumatology clinic. All patients seen at our institution with clinical suspicion of GCA are enrolled. The cohort-data entails a comprehensive set of clinical, routine laboratory, pathological (biopsy), and vascular diagnostic (ultrasound duplex studies and PET studies) information, as well as the longitudi - nal biobanking of blood and serum samples. This cohort is a precious source to address translational research questions (e.g. Kistner A et al., Rheumatology 2017; Berger CT et al., Rheumatology 2018; Berger CT et al., Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases 2019). The main current focus is to analyze the inflammatory infiltrate in the artery biop - sies of GCA patients. We use next-generation sequencing of the TCR repertoire to identify the expansion of dominant T cell clones in biopsies from patients. Us - ing the collected information on the TCR repertoire, we then aim to identify the tar - get of the expanded T cell clones. To do so, we established a workflow to transfect the identified TCR of expanded T cells into TCR -deficient Jurkat. The there - by generated set of transfected TCR -Jurkat cells is used as reporter cell lines to screen against putative targets of the transfected TCR. For this antigen discovery studies we use an unsupervised ('MHC class II ligandome of artery tissue') and a supervised (viral antigen) screening approach (Bigler MB et al., Arthritis and Rheu - matology 2018). Identifying the source of the antigen that T cells recognize in GCA will inform on the potential disease-causing processes. This may pave the way for novel approaches (i) to prevent GCA by identifying subjects at risk, and (ii) to de - velop immune-therapies aimed at improving antigen-specific tolerance.

Report 2017-2020Cirrhosis of the liver is a systemic inflammatory condition depicted by its high mor - bidity and mortality and raising prevalence worldwide. There is no treatment option other than transplantation, applicable to only a minority of patients. Infectious com - plications are highly frequent and independent predictors of adverse prognosis - being the leading cause of acute decompensation, \"acute-on-chronic\" liver fail - ure (ACLF) and death. The distinct infection susceptibility in patients with cirrhosis has been attributed to a state termed immuneparesis defined by attenuated im - mune responses to microbial challenge. A detailed understanding of the mecha - nisms underlying immuneparesis is desired in order to identify prognostic markers and define potential future immunotherapeutic targets that may enhance immune responses and reduce recurrent infection, need for liver transplantation and death. Our research group seeks to decipher the pathophysiology of immuneparesis in relation to monocyte and macrophage differentiation and function in patients with cirrhosis. Over the previous years we identified specific immune-suppressive and immune-regulatory monocytic subsets accumulating in the systemic circulation along with disease progression of cirrhosis where they attenuated responses to microbial challenge. Immune suppression by monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSC) In association with infectious morbidity and mortality reduced expression of the MHC class II receptor human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR on circulating mono - cytes from patients with advanced cirrhosis had been observed a decade ago. The mechanism underlying infection susceptibility remained indeterminate. We recently described that expression of HLA-DR on circulating monocytic cells gradually de - creased while severity of cirrhosis increased, and was attributed to the generation of M-MDSC (CD14+CD15CD11b+HLA-DR). Functionally, circulating M-MDSCs from patients with cirrhosis ex vivo were typified by distinct immunosuppressive properties, i.e. reduced T cell activation, TNF- and IL-6 production in response to toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation and phagocytic capacity. M-MDSC accu - mulated in response to systemic inflammatory responses (SIRS) and circulating pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In vitro the immune stimulant poly(I:C), reduced abundance of suppressive M-MDSC and augmented their an - timicrobial function. Immune regulation by TAM receptors Also, we specifically focussed on the regulatory function of tyrosine kinases of the TAM receptor family (Tyro-3, AXL and MERTK). TAM receptors are expressed on monocytes and macrophages and play a pivotal role in regulating innate im - mune responses to microbial challenge by inhibiting TLR signalling and immune homeostasis by promoting efferocytosis, i.e. phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. We have recently discovered the expansion of circulating immune-regulatory AXL- and MERTK-expressing monocyte subsets in patients with cirrhosis at different stages of disease that were characterised by preserved phagocytosis of bacteria, enhanced efferocytosis but suppressed cytokine responses (TNF- and IL-6) to lipopolysaccharide and attenuated T cell activation. AXL expressing cells accumu - lated in response to phagocytosis bacteria, efferocytosis PAMP exposure. MERTK- and AXL- inhibition, respectively, restored cytokine responses in vitro .

Report 2017-2020Diabetes is a serious and growing health problem, affecting 463 million people worldwide in 2019. Chronic inflammation is a hallmark in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and obesity. However, the initiating mechanisms of glucose dysregula - tion and inflammation in obesity remain poorly understood. Our research focuses on gut mucosal immunity as a potential starting point of in - flammation and glucose dysregulation in metabolic disease. Thereby, we are inter - ested in elucidating the role of the mucosal immune system, especially intestinal macrophages. Intestinal macrophages constitute the largest macrophage com - partment within the body and could serve as crucial \"sensors\" of environmental or external factors (i. e., food intake or environmental toxins such as air pollutants or cigarette smoke particles) for the host's immune system. We are interested in how intestinal macrophages respond to such environmental stressors and how their re - sponse ultimately affects glucose homeostasis and systemic inflammation. We found that pro-inflammatory/ monocyte-derived colonic macrophages are el - evated in mice fed a high fat diet, suggesting a link between colon macrophage numbers and glucose homeostasis. Indeed, we were able to establish a direct link between colon macrophages and glucose metabolism as colon-specific macro - phage depletion ameliorated glycemic control and beta-cell function. Besides classical risk factors like unhealthy food or sedentary lifestyle, also en - vironmental toxins like air pollution or cigarette smoke increase the risk for type 2 diabetes. We showed that air pollution particles mediate diabetes via the gas - trointestinal tract rather than via lung exposure as previously thought. Oral expo - sure to pollutants occurs via mucociliary clearance of particles from the airways with subsequent swallowing of the particles. Particles reaching the gastrointes - tinal tract caused a distinct inflammatory shift of colon macrophages. This local gut inflammation was associated with impaired insulin secretion and glucose in - tolerance. Similarly, we are assessing how cigarette smoke particles and e-liquids from e-cigarettes impact on mucosal gut immunity and glucose homeostasis. Also, we are studying the differential effects of air pollution particles on atherosclerosis when they are administered via lung or gut exposure. In addition, we are also interested in therapeutic aspects of gut mucosal immunity. As weight- loss surgeries are associated with a rapid improvement in glucose ho - meostasis, we aim to address the question whether weight loss has beneficial ef - fects on gut mucosal immunity and hence glucose tolerance. In sum, the aim of our laboratory is to better understand the changes of gut muco - sal immunity upon environmental stimuli and how this connects with glucose in - tolerance and systemic inflammation in metabolic disease to potentially find im - mune-modulatory treatments.

Human intestinal macrophages in metabolic disease In order to translate our findings to human disease, we compare human gut biopsies of patients with different environmental \"toxins\" (i.e., normal weight versus overweight individuals or smokers versus non-smokers). We found an inflammatory shift in intestinal macrophages in obese individuals, simi - lar to our findings in obese mice. To assess whether these changes in gut innate immunity are revers - ible, we plan to study intestinal macrophages from individuals before and after weight loss surgery. The ultimate goal is to potentially find immune- modulatory treatments at the interface between the environment and the host's metabolism. 144 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020T lymphocytes recognize a variety of antigens and exert important functions in im - mune response. The activation of T cells is mediated by engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes antigens on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. T cells may recognize antigens of different chemical composition, including short peptides, lipids, and small metabolites. Upon interaction of complexes formed by antigen-presenting molecules and antigens with TCR, T cells become activated and exert their effector functions. We study the nature of the antigens that stimulate T cells. Recently, we have focused on a new population of T cells that we identified and called MR1T cells and that recognize endogenous metabolites presented by the antigen-presenting molecule MR1. We found that MR1T cells use a polyclonal TCR gene repertoire, they have different functional capabilities, including killer and helper functions, and are pres - ent in healthy individuals with frequencies similar to those of peptide-specific T cells. They also show different gene regulatory mechanisms, thus indicating that they are a functionally heterogeneous population of T cells, resembling adaptive T cells spe - cific for peptide or lipid antigens. An important characteristic of MR1T cells is that they mostly recognize tumor cells and not healthy cells. This unexpected tumor recognition bias is due to the preferential accumulation of unique metabolite anti - gens within tumor cells. Our laboratory has started a multi-disciplinary approach to identify the nature of these novel tumor antigens using molecular approaches to reveal genes relevant to metabolite accumulation. We also have established tools to perform HPLC separation of metabolites from tumor cells, which are then tested for their stimulatory capacity and structure by mass spectrometry and NMR. We have generated a large number of MR1T cell clones that have been tested against >50 tumor cell lines. These studies revealed that MR1T cells recognize patterns of tumor cells. Transfer of TCR genes confirmed TCR specificity. Furthermore, tumor cells were also grouped according to their capacity to stimulate most or only some of tested MR1T cells. We interpret these findings with the presence of MR1T TCR that recognize metabolite antigens shared among many tumors, and with the pres - ence of multiple types of metabolic alterations that occur in tumor cells. The com - bination of both induces a pattern-type recognition of tumor cells by MR1T cells. These findings have raised major interest in using MR1T cells in novel types of an - ti-tumor cell therapy. This is justified by several reasons as follows, i) the metabo - lites stimulating individual MR1T cells accumulate in many tumor types, indepen - dently of their tissue origin; ii) metabolite antigens cannot be readily modified by tumor cells, limiting recognition escape associated with antigen modification as the case with peptide antigens; iii) MR1 is ubiquitously expressed and even tumor cells expressing very low levels of MR1 on their membrane may efficiently stimu - late specific MR1T cells; iv) the MR1 gene is not polymorphic and thus the same MR1T TCR recognizes tumors from different individuals; v) MR1T cells show killer and helper functions, which are both required for optimal anti-tumor cell therapy.

B cells and their targets in MS (Derfuss group) B-cells have a major role in the pathogenesis of MS. Depletion of B-cells leads to a remarkable amelioration of the disease. The mechanisms by which B-cells im - pact MS are however incompletely understood. Our research focuses on the iden - tification of novel B-cell autoantigens and the characterization of the interaction of auto-aggressive B-cells with the CNS. We could show that antibodies against na - tive myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) identify a subset of patients with neuromyelitis optica and are also found in SLE patients with CNS involvement. Us - ing transgenic animal models, we were able to prove a new concept how infec - tion could lead to the development of autoantibodies like those against MOG. We identified the co-capture of membrane antigens by the B cell receptor as a key step in initiating an autoimmune response in the context of an infection. This work is now continued by analyzing the capacity of B cells to migrate to peripheral tis - sues including the CNS and harvest their cognate and non-cognate antigens from the tissue. The phenomenon of membrane capture can also be used to purify B cells of a certain specificity from blood (Fig. 1) and to identify novel B cell autoan - tigens in MS. Defining biomarkers for disease progression and therapy response (Kuhle group) Despite modern MS therapy almost completely suppresses acute disease activity (\"relapses\"), chronic worsening of neurological functions (\"progression\") contin - ues to affect almost all persons with MS. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a bioflu - id marker of neuronal damage and has been established by us as a blood-based precision medicine tool to measure disease activity and drug response (Fig. 2), and to predict the long-term outcome of disability on the group level. We pursue now to establish NfL as a diagnostic tool for individual patients for therapeutic de - cision making. We aim to better characterize the pathophysiology of NfL based on innovative MRI techniques and to establish a normative data base from controls over eight decades of age to be used as reference values for individual testing. Fur - ther, we investigate other biofluid markers to contextualise NfL signals with regard to state and stage of MS, and for differential diagnosis vis-\u00e0-vis other inflammato - ry neurological diseases. This project is based on patient information and biolog - ical samples from the Swiss MS Cohort Study, a consortium of Swiss academic MS centres founded in 2012, and a number of international collaborations in Eu - rope and the US.Molecular and immunological analysis of Multiple Sclerosis147 Department of Biomedicine .

This provides access to a population of MS-patients in different stages and states of disease, treated with all state-of-the-art therapies. The close col - laboration with the Translational Imaging in Neu - rology (ThINk) group at the Department of Bio - medical Engineering, the Medical Image Analysis Centre (MIAC) and the Division of Neuroradiology enables characterization of patients with cutting edge neuroimaging techniques. The Clinical MS Research Group plays a key role in conceptualis - ing and conducting international therapeutic trials to bring novel therapies to persons with MS. These trials provide unique possibilities for a translational medicine approach by connecting basic research and clinical studies for a better understanding of disease, and specifically for progressive MS. The development of biomarkers needs prospec - tive, standardized, and high-quality clinical and neuroradiological data from large patient cohorts to allow for validation on the individual patient level, and hence application in clinical practice as Preci - sion Medicine tools. The Swiss MS Cohort Study (SMSC), initiated in 2012 and coordinated by our MS Group since then, is the mainstay of research efforts in Clinical Neuroimmunology; it provides an internationally unique long-term follow-up of over 1200 Swiss MS patients with clinical and MRI data, and blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples for bio - marker research.Fig. 2: NfL is the first blood-based measure to quanti - tate the neuroprotective effect of MStherapy Geometric means of plasma NfL with 95 % confidence in - tervals.

Key findings and applications are translated into clinical applica - tions to improve patient diagnostics of infections. Transmission of clinically relevant viruses. We study transmission events in the context of local outbreaks and global trans - mission using human influenza viruses, and most recently the pandemic SARS- CoV-2. For both viruses, we have established whole genome sequencing (WGS) and analysis pipelines and humoral immune assays. Together with our collaborat - ing partners, we explore transmission events and spatio-temporal dynamics and models across the Basel region. With these tools we investigate viral evolution in clinically relevant contexts, such as the role of superspreading events, the effect of socioeconomics and transportation, and treatment of hospitalized patients. We explore specific mutations in the viral genome as markers for epidemiological modelling and detection of antiviral resistance.

Together with col - leagues from the Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, we explore these pa - tients and use the new discoveries and insights to improve the diagnostic process. In parallel, there is a constant need to accelerate diagnostics, provid - ing the best of new technologies for patients, and much of our work also focuses on this aspect. We want to translate our findings into clinical practice, developing novel diagnostic strategies and pre - ventive measurements to reduce pathogen trans - mission and expedite patient treatment. An example is the combination of mass-spectrom - etry and antibiotic resistance profiles. Using ma - chine learning, we have developed together with Prof. Karsten Borgwardt (ETH Zurich) an algorithm to predict antibiotic resistance about 24h before classical phenotypic assays.Understanding pathogens and populations. Our research group also focuses on pathogen dynamics and prediction of invasive - ness within a single host. In a SNF-funded project, we are also developing metage - nomic tools to determine MDR colonization status of hospital patients directly from swabs, aiming to monitor microbiota changes over time within the patient during hospitalization. In a Gebert-R\u00fcf funded project, we look into the dynamics of ESBL E. coli colonization and carriage in healthy individuals who travelled to high en - demic regions. Our goal is to identify (i) microbiological factors affecting whether the subject remains colonized or spontaneously clears the pathogen and (ii) which pan-sensitive natural microbial displace resistant bacteria such as ESBL E. coli . Finally, we also study the factors driving invasiveness of colonizing E. coli iso- lates causing pyelonephritis and uro-sepsis. We use WGS data to predict ribosom - al marker masses in order to determine phylogroups in MALDI-TOF MS spectra. These phylogroups allow the prediction of clinical phenotypes.Figure 2 Figure 3 152 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells represent the most abundant T cell type in human liver. MAIT cells respond to bacterial metabolites presented by MHC-like molecule MR1 on antigen (Ag)-presenting cells (APCs). In mouse mod - els, activated liver MAIT cells were described as profibrogenic and MAIT cells from patients with liver cirrhosis showed functional alterations consistent with pro-fi - brotic functions. Gut dysbiosis has also been implicated in progressive liver fibro - sis in fatty liver disease in mice. Since liver MAIT cells respond to bacterial metabo - lites and exhibit pro-fibrotic properties, they likely also contribute to pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In our research, we investigate which cells in the human liver are involved in MAIT cell activation and how their profibro - genic function could be prevented. We also study influence of the gut microbiome on the phenotype of MAIT cells, with an emphasis on a pathogenic role of MAIT cells in fibrosis and NAFLD. We found that several classes of primary liver cells, including hepatocytes, hepat - ic stellate cells (HSCs), liver endothelial and biliary epithelial cells, have the capac - ity to present bacterial Ag to MAIT cells. Liver cells exposed to bacterial Ag precur - sor had the capacity to generate active Ag endogenously. The identified interaction between HSCs and MAIT cells supports the pro- fibrogenic function of these cells. The finding that activated liver MAIT cells produce large amounts of IL-17, suggests the involvement of this pro-fibrotic cytokine in liver disease pathogenesis. The ob - served repression of MAIT cell activation by non-stimulatory MR1 ligands creates a therapeutic opportunity to interfere with MAIT cell pro-fibrogenic properties. To better understand the role of MAIT cell stimulation in liver disease, we are cur - rently studying molecular signatures of MAIT cells derived from liver in compari - son to colon and blood and we are also correlating MAIT cell phenotypes with the gut microbiome of patients with liver diseases. Mechanisms of MAIT cell regulation in the liver - physiological functions and pro-fibrotic properties We assessed the localization of MAIT cells by immunofluorescence staining of cryopreserved human liver tissue and found them to dispersedly localize with - in the liver parenchyma, thus being in close contact to cells within the sinusoidal compartment (Fig. 1). We have found that distinct primary liver cell types, includ - ing hepatocytes, HSCs, cells (BECs), act as strong drivers of MAIT cell activation, with the poten - tial of increasing liver fibrogenesis (Fig. 2). Presentation occurred in response to both pure synthetic Ag 5-OP-RU (5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-D-ribitylamino - uracil) and bacterial lysate from E. coli. Presentation capacities differed markedly among the investigated liver cell types, with hepatocytes being the most efficient liver-derived APCs (data not shown). MAIT cell activation was prevented by pre-treating APCs with - tory MR1 ligands 6-formylpterin (6-FP) and Acetyl-6-FP and was diminished in the presence of the acetylsalicylic acid derivative 5-formylsalicylic acid (data not shown). These findings create a therapeutic opportunity to prevent pro-fibrogen - ic properties of MAIT cells. Human polyclonal liver-derived MAIT cells produced large amounts of Interleukin 17 (IL-17), a cytokine with strong pro-fibrotic proper - ties, when interacting with distinct liver-derived APCs, including hepatocytes and HSCs. Moreover, liver cells exposed to an Ag precursor (5-A-RU) had the capacity to generate active Ag 5-OP-RU, as assessed by Ag-presentation assays and mass spectrometry (data not shown).Characterization of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in liver diseases Group Members Dr. Maxime Jacquet (Postdoc) Dr. Tina Jaeger (Technical Martin Lett (Postdoc) Magdalena Cells Liver 153 Department of Biomedicine .

Connection to Clinical Practice Characterization of liver- and gut-derived human MAIT cells Most liver diseases are characterized by an inflam - matory response in the liver, driven by numerous triggering conditions, such as exposure to alcohol, excess fat, medication, infection or autoimmunity. A prolonged inflammatory state leads to progres - sive fibrosis that can result in liver cirrhosis asso - ciated with serious complications including loss of liver function or development of hepatocellular car - cinoma. Since liver MAIT cells respond to bacterial metab - olites and exhibit pro-fibrotic properties, they likely also contribute to pathogenesis of various liver dis - eases. To date, only few studies have addressed a role of these cells in human liver tissue and using primary human material. Our projects are being performed in close collab - oration with the Department of Gastroenterology/ Hepatology at the Basel University Medical Clinic in Liestal (PD Dr. E. Burri and Prof. J. Leuppi), the Visceral Surgery Department at the Kantonsspi - tal Baselland (Prof. R. Rosenberg), the Divisions of Gastroenterology/Hepatology and Visceral surge- ry, Clarunis University Center for Gastrointesti - nal and Liver Diseases (Prof. M. Heim and Prof. O. Kollmar), the Department of Interventional Ra - diology of the University Hospital Basel (Prof. C. Zech), and with the laboratories of Prof. D. Stroka and Prof. A.

Report 2017-2020In the last decade, we have gained substantial knowledge on the function of in - nate lymphoid cells (ILCs), a group of immune cells, which immediately respond to \"danger signals\" with the release of cytokines. They protect mucosal surfaces in the gut and lung, but are also involved in diseases such as inflammatory bow - el disease, asthma and cancer. Our previous research has shed light on how ILCs were regulated by environmental cytokines. More recent work has demonstrated that ILC3s have tissue-restricted properties and a metastable transcriptional sig - nature. The identification of molecular pathways that regulate ILC differentiation and function is essential for a better understanding of how ILCs contribute to pro - tective or pathological responses. ILCs, unlike adaptive lymphocytes do not express variable antigen receptors that serve as master activators in T and B cells. Instead ILCs sense the environment by a concerted action of surface molecules, and the outcome of ILC responses de - pend on the integration and cooperation of different downstream signaling path - ways. We defined a new role of NKp46, an activating receptor expressed by all ILC1s and a subset of ILC3s. We found that the expression of TRAIL, a TNF su - perfamily member with known tumoricidal function, depends on NKp46. Lack of NKp46 lead to the reduction of normal levels of TRAIL expression on the surface of lLCs. The reduced cytotoxic potential of NKp46-deficient ILC1s towards TRAIL-re - ceptor positive targets provide an additional role for NKp46 in tumor surveillance. Another focus of our research is the regulation of T-cell immune responses by group 3 ILCs. Tissue-specific factors regulate the expression of transcripts asso - ciated with MHC class II antigen presentation in ILC3s. Splenic ILC3s are relative - ly efficient antigen presenting cells, whereas ILC3s of the small intestine are poor in presenting antigen and stimulating T cells. We identified tissue specific signal - ing cascades that affect the antigen presentation by ILC3s. The intestinal microbi - ota induces the release of IL-23 by myeloid cells, which silences the expression of MHC class II in ILC3s, thereby reducing their capacity to present antigen. More - over, mTORC1 and STAT3 phosphorylation are part of the IL-23-signaling cascade responsible for downregulation of MHC class II (Figure 1). Altogether this might be essential to maintain immunological tolerance at barrier tissues like the intestine. In contrast in the spleen IFN-gamma induces the expression of MHC class II mol - ecules, thereby increasing the antigen presenting capacity of ILC3. Both signal - ing cascades might be relevant to balance T-cell tolerance and immune reaction by affecting antigen presentation by ILC3s. Our current interest is to better under - stand the tissue-specific sub-localization and the cellular interaction of ILC3s with the adaptive immune system. In a third line of research, we investigate ILC development. ILCs like all hematopoi - etic cells develop from hematopoietic stem cells. However, the sequence of devel - opmental stages and molecular events that lead to the generation of ILC- commit - ted progenitors as well as the exact identity of such cells remains poorly defined. Using a systemic approach including single cell molecular and bioinformatical analysis, we are able to reconstruct developmental trajectories from a hematopoi - etic stem cell into an ILC progenitor or alternative developmental lineages. With a comprehensive molecular map of developmental transitions that result in the gen - eration of a committed ILC progenitor we are now dissecting the role of individual genes and signaling pathways that control ILC lineage specification.Development and immune functions of innate lymphoid cells Group Members Philipp Cedro (Community Service Helper) Nicola Davaz (Undergraduate Student) Martha Gaio (Secretary) Benedikt Gutbrod* (Community Service Helper) Edit Horvath Dr. Frank Lehmann (Postdoc) Neu* (PhD Student) Annick Peter (Technical Claudia Teufel* (PhD Student)Dr. Gleb Turchinovich (Postdoc) Wagner* (Undergraduate Student) * left report periodDaniela Finke Department of Biomedicine University Children's Hospi - Developmental .

Report 2017-2020Worldwide, liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the second most frequent cause of cancer-related death, with an estimated 854,000 new cases and 810,000 deaths per year. 90 % of liver cancers are hepatocellular carcino - mas (HCCs). Over 95 % of HCCs develop on the background of chronic liver dis - ease and indeed, more than 80 % of HCCs occur in cirrhotic livers. Treatment op - tions for advanced stage HCCs are still very limited, and a better understanding of the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of HCCs is urgently needed. In the frame - work of a clinical study protocol we generated a clinically annotated tumor- and liver-biopsy biobank and blood bank. This unique research resource is being used to study the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of HCC with the aim to generate clinically meaningful molecular classifications, to identify predictive biomarkers for response to treatments, and to identify new therapeutic targets and strategies. A major obstacle in preclinical drug development is the lack of appropriate cell cul - ture model systems. Current in vitro cell culture models of HCC are based on con - ventional hepatoma and hepatocarcinoma cell lines that fail to recapitulate key features of tumor tissues such as three-dimensional tumor architecture, cellular he- terogeneity, and cell-cell interactions. We have developed a pipeline to generate and characterize organoid models of HCCs (Nuciforo et al., 2018). These HCC organoids maintain the histological and genomic features of their originating tumors during long-term culturing for up to 32 weeks. The models can be used for preclinical drug screenings and testing and to generate phenotype-genotype correlations tables (Fig. 1). HCC tumor biopsies can also be used to generate xenograft mouse models (Blumer et al., 2019). Again, these models closely resemble the originating tumors and can be serially passaged. Xenograft mouse models preserve the heterogene - ity of HCCs and are a valuable research tool for preclinical drug testing. The most important underlying liver diseases that predispose to HCC are chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Our lab has a long-standing research interest in viral hepatitis with a special focus on innate immune responses to vi - ral hepatitis. The host response to hepatitis C is controlled by a genetic polymor - phism of the interferon lambda (IFNL) gene locus. Paradoxically, individuals who cannot produce IFNL4 due to a frameshift mutation in the IFNL4 gene have a bet - ter immune response to HCV and can control and eliminate the viral infection. On the other side, individuals with a wild-type IFNL4 usually cannot eliminate the vi - rus and develop chronic hepatitis that can lead to cirrhosis, despite a strong induc - tion of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (Boldanova et al., 2017). This so called \"IFN lambda 4 paradox\" is currently not understood, and is a focus of ongoing re - search in the lab. Contrary to HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) does not stimulate the induction of an in - terferon response in the liver. Using liver biopsies of patients with HBV infections, we could show that this lack of innate immune response is not due to an active in - hibition of sensory pathways or interferon expression by HBV, but because HBV is a \"stealth virus\", i. e. HBV is not recognized by pathogen associated molecular pat - terns (PAMP) receptors, most likely because of a very low expression of cGAS and STING in hepatocytes, two components of the intracellular sensory pathway that detects viral DNA (Suslov et al., 2018; Baumann et al., unpublished). Ongoing proj - ects in the lab investigate the molecular mechanisms that control HBV viral repli - cation in chronic hepatitis B, with a main focus on disease stage transitions during the natural history of chronic hepatitis B.

Report 2017-2020Fig. 1: From Bantug et al., Nat Rev Immunol 2018 Jan;18(1):19-34Our research is focused on basic and translational aspects of lymphocyte function and its metabolic basis. Conceptually, our recent work has led us to propose the idea that a spectrum of immune cell metabolic states can provide a basis for cat - egorizing diseases (Fig. 1). In that scheme, acute resolving infection represents properly regulated cellular metabolism. Exploring this notion experimentally, we tested how acetate - a short chain fatty acid - is regulating T cell metabolism during resolving infection in mice. We found that acetate transiently increases in the blood circulation upon acute in - fection. This leads to acetylation of the enzyme GAPDH in memory CD8+ T cells, which enhances their glycolytic switch and interlinked inflammatory capacity. At sites of prolonged inflammation, by contrast, acetate accumulates but now cata - lyzes glutaminase activity and develops suppressive capacity by buffering calcium (Balmer et al. Immunity 2016 and Cell Metabolism 2020). These findings support the idea of an orchestrated early hypermetabolic-, followed by a hypometabolic T cell state jointly enabling resolution of acute infection. Two disease categories were investigated to further probe our metabolism-cen - tric categorization scheme (Fig. 1), namely cancer and primary antibody deficiency (PAD). In cancer patients, we investigated how tumor-derived TGF- suppresses the key antitumor function of CD4+ T cells, IFN- production. Suppression re - quired expression and phosphorylation of Smad proteins in the TGF- signaling pathway - but not their nuclear translocation, and it depended on oxygen avail - ability, suggesting a metabolic basis for these effects. Indeed, TGF- substantial - ly impaired the ATP-coupled respiration of CD4+ T cells and specifically inhibited mitochondrial complex V (ATP synthase) activity. Inhibition of ATP synthase alone was sufficient to impair IFN- production by CD4+ T cells.

In PAD, we previously found that loss-of-function mutations can lead to immunodeficiency by causing a hypometabolic T cell phenotype (Kolev et al., Immunity 2015). In the cur - rent reporting period we built on this observation and prospectively screened gly - colysis and mitochondrial respiration in B cells from patients with PAD. The high - est oxygen consumption rate values were detected in three study participants with persistent polyclonal B cell lymphocytosis succinate dehydrogenase sub - unit A, in all three patients with PPBL. SDHA gain-of-function led to accumula - tion of fumarate in PPBL B cells, which engaged the KEAP1-Nrf2 system to drive the transcription of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines. In a single patient tri - al, blocking the activity of the cytokine interleukin-6 in vivo prevented systemic in - flammation and ameliorated clinical disease. Overall, this study thus identified a hypermetabolic phenotype, driving pathological mitochondrial retrograde signal - ing, as a disease modifier in PAD (Burgener et al. Nat. Imm., 2019) (Fig. 2). In our basic research efforts we aimed to understand, at the molecular level, how glycolysis is linked to the rapid response of memory CD8+ T cells (Gubser et al., Nat. Imm., 2013). We found that rapid activation of AKT by mTORC2 leads to inhi - bition of GSK3 at mitochondria- endoplasmic reticulum (ER) This en - recruitment hexokinase I (HK-I) to the voltage-dependent facili tating metabolite into Glucose tracing pinpointed pyruvate oxi - dation in mitochondria, which was the metabolic requirement for rapid generation of IFN- in memory T cells. Subcellular organization of mTORC2-AKT-GSK3 at mitochondria-ER contact sites, promoting HK-I recruitment to VDAC, thus under - pins the metabolic reprogramming needed for memory CD8+ T cells to rapidly ac - quire effector function (Bantug et al. Immunity 2018), (Fig. 3). 160 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020The research group \"Transplantation and Clinical Virology\" focuses on trans- lational aspects of clinically relevant virus infections in humans. Our approach is in - cludes contrasting acute versus chronic viral infections with respect to pathogen - esis and immune control using community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs) versus persisting human herpesviruses or human polyomaviruses in immunologi - cally na\u00efve, in immunodeficient, or in immunosuppressed patients. Regarding CARVs, we have been actively engaged in several studies character - izing the epidemiology and impact in solid organ transplantation (SOT) patients participating in the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS) and in hematopoiet - ic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients. We contributed to prospective studies of lung transplant recipients and to evaluating a novel antiviral drug (presatovir) tar - geting fusion of respiratory syncytial virus in HSCT patients. We reviewed the avail - able literature and contributed to CARV- and CoVID19-guidelines in the frame - work of ECIL and EHA. The year 2020 has been dominated by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for which we established a robust in-house assay to diagnose patients and identified its rapid replacing all commonly circulating CARVs (Leuzinger et are the most relevant challenges. Epidemiol - ogy and impact have been evaluated in collaborations with the STCS and locally with Profs Schaub/Steiger. We established phenotypic acyclovir testing for HSV, genotypic resistance for HSV and CMV including the new drug (letermov - ir). We established CMV-DNAemia as the major form of plasma CMV loads result - ing from naked unprotected viral genome fragments. This explains the long-known difficulty of CMV culture from blood as opposed to broncho-alveolar lavage flu - ids despite high CMV-DNA loads. Our observations have pathophysiological, di - agnostic, and therapeutic relevance, and entered the international TTS consensus guidelines on CMV management in SOT. Regarding human polyomaviruses, we focus on BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) and characterized its epidemiology and impact in collaborations nationally with the STCS, locally with Profs Schaub/Steiger in kidney transplant patients as well as in - ternationally, with the pediatric kidney and HSCT programs in Helsinki, Finland. We improved BKPyV-detection establishing that BKPyV-DNAemia is the major form of \"viremia\" in transplant patients similar to CMV. These observations impact con- cepts regarding the use of neutralizing antibodies for protection and therapy. To- gether with Prof Parmjeet Randhawa, Pittsburgh (PA, USA) and AST-IDCOP, we provided the 2019 clinical guideline on BKPyV in kidney transplantation. Our experimental virology studies focus on BKPyV in primary human renal tubu - lar epithelial cells as key target of BKPyV nephropathy in kidney transplants. For the first time, we identified an evolutionarily conserved functional role of viral agno- protein, which promotes innate immune evasion by disrupting the mitochondri - al membrane potential, fragmenting the mitochondrial network, and targeting the damage mitochondria for autophagy (Manzetti et al. 2020; Fig. 2 ). Regarding adaptive immunity, we identified more than 70 immunodominant 9mer- epitopes recognized by BPyV-specific CD8 T-cells controlling BKPyV-DNAemia. a novel peptide expansion protocol of BPyV-specific CD8 T-cells in vitro en route to a safe peptide-based protection by adoptive T-cell trans - fer and vaccination (Wilhelm et al. 2020; Fig. 3). We also identified variant ami - no acid exchanges in the conserved BKPyV-early protein, which mediate escape from CD8 T-cell control (Leuzinger et al. 2020 10.3390/v12121476).

Key viral threats are being addressed according to their importance as defined by fre - quency, severity, and available medical treatment. Thus, we are interested in - Community-acquired respiratory virus (CARV) infections in populations without sufficient im - mune control including SARS-CoV-2; - Emerging epidemics including vector-borne viral (tick-borne encephalitis virus, dengue, Chikungunya, West Nile virus, Zika virus) Viruses affecting immunocompromised patients (HIV/AIDS; solid organ ders). Acute virus infections are exemplified by CARVs, while persistent virus infections are represented by human herpes- and polyomaviruses. Both, acute and chronic virus infections are naturally widespread in the general immunocompetent pop - ulation, but may take a severe course in patients without functional immune memory either because of primary infection, primary immunodeficiency, acquired immunodeficiency or immunosuppres - sion. We aim at characterizing: 1) key determinants of vi- rus pathology; 2) potential targets of antiviral inter- vention; 3) relevant innate immune mechanisms; 4) protective targets of adaptive immune memory; 5) modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors in pa- tients to tailor and optimize interventions.for pre-clinical models of viral immune control and to design phase I clinical vacci - nation studies in healthy volunteers.

Report 2017-2020The thymus is the anatomical site where T cells are generated and instructed to provide protective immunity against pathogens whilst ignoring the individual's own tissues. Thymic epithelial cells (TEC), an essential component of the organ's 3-di - mensional scaffold, attract T cell precursor from the peripheral blood, foster their differentiation in a bespoke micro-environment, and help to select developing T cells based on their antigen specificities. Based on their distinct structural, phe - notypic, and transcriptomic features, TEC are differentiated into distinct subtypes which anatomically define them as either cortical (c) or medullary (m) subpopula - tions (Figure 1). cTEC are instrumental in committing hematopoietic precursors to a T cell fate and in selecting cells with a T cell receptor (TCR) capable to inter - act with an individual's antigen presenting cells. mTEC express collectively an al - most complete repertoire of an individual's protein coding genes and thus create a library of self-peptides essential for the induction of T cell self-tolerance. This unique ability is achieved by a yet incompletely understood process of promiscu - ous gene expression of peripheral tissue-specific antigens that is unique to a sub - population of mTEC. The research of the laboratory of Pediatric Immunology seeks to detail the genet - ic and epigenetic control of TEC development and function combining multi-para- meter flow cytometry, advanced histological and molecular methods and tran - scriptomic analyses at both population level and single cell resolution. Recent and ongoing experiments focus on: \u2014 The transcription factor FOXN1, a TEC master regulator. We identified in vivo the DNA binding motif of FOXN1, characterized the factor's molecular structure binding to that motif and ascertained the factor's molecular interactome essen - tial for its ability to form nuclear condensates which prompt its regular transcrip - tional activity. \u2014 The complexity of the TEC lineage development. Using single cell transcriptom - ic analysis of TEC across the life course of mice, we identified at least 9 sepa - rate TEC subtypes and demonstrated that TEC progenitor cells are the principal targets of ageing (Figure 2). Specifically, an early-life precursor cell population present in the cortex postnatally is virtually extinguished at puberty. Concom - itantly, a medullary precursor cell quiesces, thereby impairing maintenance of the medullary epithelium. Hence the quiescence of TEC progenitors is a ma - jor factor underlying thymus involution and affects thymic regeneration and the preservation of central immune tolerance. \u2014 The epigenetic control of TEC development and function. We showed that inter - ference with DNA methylation, histone modifications or miRNA generation pro - foundly impairs TEC and consequently also overall thymus biology including or - gan size, TEC differentiation and function embracing the capacity to maintain a broad repertoire peripheral tissue-specific antigens. Interestingly, some of these changes are only apparent in adult mice thus revealing a differential de - pendence of perinatal and adult TEC on epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. \u2014 The relevance of metabolism on TEC function. We found that modifications in the homeostasis of adenine nucleotides imparts significant quantitative and qualitative changes in the compartments of both cortical and medullary TEC. These alterations include changes in mitochondrial mass and superoxide pro - duction and are apparently paralleled by deviations in TEC differentiation and thymopoietic function.

The RNA binding pro - tein Lin28 regulates miRNA biogenesis and serves as a gatekeeper controlling the transition between pluripotency and committed cell lineages. Adult mice in which Lin28 overexpression was targeted to TEC failed to achieve a regular thy - mus size and showed defects in cTEC differentiation and consequently positive and negative thymocyte selection. Remarkably, these defects are not apparent in young mice hence demonstrating a differential susceptibility of perinatal and adult cTEC to Lin28 controlled RNA biology.

Report 2017-2020The mammalian immune system is important to fight infections but immune cells are also involved in many other processes such as tolerance to the growing fetus, wound healing and eliminating tumors. To this end the immune system is com - posed of many cell types and soluble molecules. Many layers of regulation ensure proper functioning of the immune system as a whole since mistakes can lead to severe clinical disease. In the past decade immunology has taken center stage in clinical medicine. Im - mune cells and inflammation are important in diseases affecting virtually any or - gan. Nevertheless, until recently, therapeutic interventions targeting the immune system were rather limited. Although vaccines are among the most effective (pre - ventative) measures in medicine, only a limited number of vaccines were avail - able and modulating the immune system therapeutically usually came at the cost of non-specific immune suppression. With the availability of \"biologics\", i.e. ther - apeutic antibodies or cytokines, this started to change. Cytokine blockade allows more specific intervention with specific pathways and is nowadays established in many different disciplines. In addition, antibody-mediated blockade of receptors on immune cells led to a long- awaited revolution in oncology. Since the turn of the century it was known that inflammation and cancer are closely linked. However, only in the last decade \"cancer immunotherapy\" has become clinical routine. Can - cer can suppress immune responses by engaging inhibitory receptors on immune cells. Blocking such interactions with therapeutic antibodies can successfully \"un - leash\" the immune system. Thus, in this approach, the therapeutic target are im - mune cells and only indirectly cancer cells. This broke a longstanding dogma that the cancer cells themselves are targeted in oncology. However, despite great suc - cess, not all patients respond. Therefore, we are investigating poorly studied mol - ecules involved in immune regulation. Our group has been studying small regulatory RNAs called microRNAs (miRNA) for over a decade. miRNAs inhibit specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by direct - ly binding them. We previously demonstrated that a specific miRNA cluster (miR- 17~92) is upregulated during T cell activation. When T cells recognize their target antigens they get activated. Two signals are required for this process: a) stimu - lation of the T cell receptor and b) a second signal called costimulation. The pro - totypical costimulatory signal is triggered by engagement of CD28. Based on the literature and our own work we hypothesized that miR-17~92 might mediate im - portant signals during T cell activation. In the past reporting period we found that transgenic miR-17~92 can at least partially substitute for many of the functions that are defective in CD28-deficient T cells. We characterized the target genes that are bound and regulated by miR-17~92 and demonstrated that several path - ways key for T cell activation and function are promoted by miR-17~92 (Doelz et al., unpublished). In parallel, we investigated if miRNAs that are relevant for T cell function could be targeted by small molecules. We identified small molecules that inhibit T cell func - tion and proliferation of cancer cell lines. We are currently investigating the precise mode of action of these molecules (Matter & Jeker, unpublished). Finally, cellular therapies are emerging as effective treatment modalities beside small molecules and biologics (Jeker, Trillium Immunologie). We have developed CRISPR/Cas9-based protocols to engineer the genome of T cells (Kornete, JI). More recently we have initiated projects involving more sophisticated engineering to explore cellular therapies for autoimmune diseases and transplantation. Thus, we are increasingly focusing on translating our research results to clinical practice.

Modern proce - dures including complex surgeries, cancer treatment and transplantation are as - sociated with high risk of infections. Emerging resistance of pathogens are seri - ous threats increasingly limiting the effectiveness of the antimicrobials in use today. Our research group explores host- and pathogen-specific aspects of infectious diseases in a strong translational setting - with the overarching goal to identify new treatment strategies. New treatment strategies for staphylococci Health care associated/nosocomial infections - the fourth leading cause of dis - ease in industrialized countries - are a major health issue. Together with Gram- negative microorganisms, Staphylococcus aureus is one of the major causative agents. Staphylococcal strains are highly virulent and are increasingly becoming resis - tant to every clinically available antibiotic. One particularly important unmet medi - cal need for anti-S. aureus therapies is to treat biofilm-associated infections. Nov - el approaches to combat staphylococcal biofilm infections are therefore urgently needed. Together with our collaborators from the Department of Biosystems Sci - ence and Engineering (D-BSSE, ETH Z\u00fcrich) we demonstrated that engineered designer cells containing a synthetic genetic circuit expressing lysostaphin under the regulation of human Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR6, and aureus (MRSA) implant-as - sociated infections by detection of blood reporter proteins and prevent as well as cure infections in our tissue cage infection mouse model. This novel mamma - lian cell-based anti-infective approach was superior to conventional antibiotics (Fig. 1/2). (www.cell.com/action /doSearch?searchType=quick&searchText=imm unomimetic+cells&searchScope=fullSite& occurrences=all&code=cellsite&cont entType=video&startPage=). Translation to clinics Adoptive transfer of pathogen-specific donor-derived T cells is to date the most promising and feasible immunotherapeutic strategy in transplant recipients restor - ing the lacking T-cell function. Its potential as prophylactic or therapeutic treat - ment for viral infections after transplantation has been demonstrated. We have pioneered virus-specific T-cell therapies in Switzerland. In a phase I/II study, in which we assess the feasibility of directly isolated virus-specific T cells using the cytokine capture assay, we test their safety in patients with treatment- refractory adenovirus, cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr hematopoietic cell transplantation (Clin Trials ID NCTO2007356). Current - ly, ten patients of which five patients each received CMV or EBV virus- specific T cells have been included. We are currently working on an improved cell expansion protocol for clinical use (Fig. 2). In December 2019, the University of Basel has received the grant to establish the National Center of Competence (NCCR) in Research \"AntiResist\", directed by the Biozentrum. Together with researchers at the Biozentrum, and the D-BSSE we will establish a unique interdisciplinary center for the development of new strategies in the fight against antibiotic-resistant pathogens (https://nccr-antiresist.ch/).

Virus-specific T cells for T-cell ther - apy (derived from the original stem cell donor or from a matched third party donor) can be obtained either by ex vivo expansion (top) or direct isolation via immunomagnetic sorting (bot - tom). For ex vivo expansion peripheral blood mononuclear cells are stimulated with antigen in the presence of cytokines for 10 days to several weeks to expand and enrich antigen-specific T cells. For immunomagnetic sorting antigen-specific T cells are directly isolated from peripheral blood by multimer technology or Cytokine capture assay (Miltenyi Biotech) within 1 to 2 days.Selected W\u00fcthrich Cu\u00e9nod A, Hinic V, A, R (2019).

Using a combination of single cell and sys - tems immunology approaches we are addressing the biology and therapeutic po - tential of mucosal immunity to combat globally relevant pathogens including influ - enza and tuberculosis. T follicular helper memory cells: a new target for vaccination: Much of the research on CD4 T cell memory is focused on T central memory (TCM) cells, which due to their persistence and multipotency are considered an optimal target for vaccina - tion. In contrast, T follicular helper (TFH) cells, specialized to support antibody production by B cells, are thought to disappear within one to two months after vi - ral clearance. We recently reported that TFH cells are exquisitely sensitive to NAD induced cell death. By inhibiting NAD-induced cell death we found that TFH cells comprise a robust portion of the memory cell compartment, are metabolically fit, and survive to at least 400 days after infection. Surprisingly, TCM cells were ab - sent at this very late time point. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) we determined that long-lived TFH cells transcriptionally distinct from TCM cells, maintain stemness and self-renewal gene expression, and a high degree of differ - entiation plasticity. We also demonstrated that long-lived TFH cells actively sup - port antibody production by splenic plasma cells, making a key contribution to systemic antibody titers at very late time points after infection when the immune response has supposedly died down. Taken together, these data highlight memo - ry TFH cells as an attractive target for vaccination. Tissue resident CD4 memory T cells: division of labor in the lung: Using an influ - enza model of infection we characterized the dynamics and transcriptional regu - lation of lung resident and lymphoid CD4 T cells; our analyses led to the defini - tion of a \"universal\" residency signature which is agnostic to Th cell subset. We further identified a population of T resident helper (TRH) cells that require intrinsic Bcl6 expression as well as B cells for their differentiation, but arise independently from TFH effector cells in the lymph node. Using quantitative histology, we deter - mined that TRH cells co-localize with B cells in tertiary lymphoid structures known as inducible Bronchus Associated Lymphoid Tissue late dele - tion of Bcl6 in CD4 T cells led to their exit from iBALT and impaired mucosal anti - body production following heterologous challenge. These data indicate that CD4 T cell mediated protection involves the coordination of heterogeneous and special - ized Th cell subsets. These findings also suggest that specific targeting of TRH cells will bolster mucosal immunity, and have additional implications for reinvigo - rating or dampening T cell responses in tissue or tumors where tertiary lymphoid structures are present. T cell receptor signal strength and chronic infection: There is an ongoing debate about whether the strength of T cell receptor (TCR) signals alone can independent - ly instruct one Th cell fate over another. Importantly, although cumulative TCR sig - nal strength is influenced by the cellular microenvironment, whether or not TCR signal strength plays a primary role in CD4 T cell fate decisions occurring within distinct infectious contexts is unknown. To address this, we generated a panel of variant viruses by introducing mutations into the immunodominant peptide of both acute and chronic strains of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. By characteriz - ing the response of adoptively transferred TCR transgenic T cells we discovered that the impact of TCR signal strength is not uniformly maintained between resolv - ing and persistent viral infections. Particularly interesting is that weak TCR signals during chronic infection support the accumulation of Th1 effectors. Since loss of the Th1 cell compartment correlates with CD8 T cell dysfunction/exhaustion dur - ing chronic infection, our findings suggest that targeting low affinity CD4 T cell ex - pansion may be a strategy to improve viral control.

Although several groups have reported transcrip - tional signatures that discriminate individuals with various disease comorbidities, it is difficult to in - vestigate the mechanistic basis of these pathways in humans. Similarly, despite the deeper mecha - nistic insight that can be gained by animal stud - ies, not all findings can be translated to humans. We are bridging this divide by conducting in-depth, systems biology analyses of immune cells from humans and mice, focusing on pathways that are shared across the species. Our goal is to uncover biomarkers in the periphery that can be used to predict immune status in the tissue and, by proxy, disease status. We are complementing these stud - ies by developing novel mouse models to induce cell intrinsic gene deletion in a tissue restricted manner. Manipulation of species conserved path - ways in mice will allow us to unravel the immuno - logical basis of disease comorbidity. 170 Department of Biomedicine .

We have shown that the viral tropism for CXCR4-expressing cells but also that of silently infected cells, corre - lates with poorer outcome in therapy-na\u00efve individuals. We hypothesized that this might trigger superior HIV control during effective treatment. We aimed at char - acterizing HIV inside key T-cell populations in early therapy periods to identify cell populations driving this selective virus elimination to understand the preservation or re-establishment of crucial immune functions. Recent studies suggest that only few PBMCs harbor integrated HIV-1 genomes, mostly defective, in most assays counted as part of the \"latent HIV-1 reservoir\". We developed a new, highly sensi - tive method, 'GERDA' (Gag and Envelope Reactivation Detection Assay) to iden - tify cell populations in peripheral blood that contribute to viral replication and to understand viral dynamics during therapy (Fig. 1). To dissect the contribution of specific cell reservoirs, we assessed viral activity on DNA, RNA and protein lev - el, showing that viral activity quickly declines during therapy. Cells with lymphoid homing properties maintained the highest viral activity, which was overall very low. Our data strongly suggest that main contributors to viral persistence reside out - side the periphery, likely in lymph nodes and gut. Next steps of our work will focus on biopsy material from these compartments. Improve coreceptor prediction for HIV-1 subtype CRF01_AE isolates, common to South-East Asia (Nina Marty) The algorithm Geno2pheno[coreceptor] (G2P) is a widely used genotyping tool for predicting co-receptor usage (=viral tropism) of HIV-1 isolates, critically im - portant when using a coreceptor-antagonist for therapy. Especially for HIV-1 sub - type CRF01_AE, a massive overcalling of X4-tropic isolates was observed with standard G2P settings. Aim of this study were the phenotypic validation and ex - perimental proof of algorithm adaptations to better predict the tropism of clinical HIV-1 CRF01_AE isolates. For this, V3 env-sequences of 20 clinical HIV-1 subtype AE samples were sequenced and analyzed by G2Pco. In parallel, coreceptor us - age was determined by phenotyping in human cells applying specific X4- or R5- inhibitors. When exchanging only the CRF01_AE V3 region in a subtype B cas - sette no replication-competent viral progeny could be produced, necessitating a full genome-replacement strategy to obtain an infectious CRF01_AE cassette (gag and pol sequences of AE were crucial). Replicative phenotyping confirmed the suspected overcalling of X4-tropism for CRF01_AE with the current G2P ver - sion. By lowering the False positive rate cut-off from 10 % to 2.5 % minimized this X4-overcalling yet permitting a predictive value for administrating the coreceptor- drug maraviroc (Fig. 2). Our study shows the complementing power of phenotyp - ing and genotyping for validating new bioinformatics tools. Transdominance of premature Rev expression (Yuepeng Zhang) HIV replication requires the viral Tat protein to initiate its gene expression. It re - mains unclear, how the expression of other proteins is regulated. Viral Rev e. g. is needed for late expression (Env and Gag). We used specific mutations in our mo - lecular HIV-1 clone and an LTR-lacZ reporter cell for studying these kinetic as - pects. Wild type produces extended and blue Env-mediated syncytia, and high levels of released (= particle-associated) RT activity. Fusion of the AUG codon of tat to the gene body of rev led to a perplexing result: Large syncytia formed (like wild type), but without any blue X-gal stain. This demonstrated that late gene ex - pression events (syncytia) are possible even in the absence of Tat (no blue). It is HIV Reservoirs and Identification of Obstacles to a CureHIV .

Report 2017-2020Connection to Clinical Practice Niklaus Labhardt Research Group Leader, University Hospital Basel; Scien - tist at STPH, Basel HIV-1 Viremia Children/ Adolescents on HIV Therapy: An Open-Label Randomised Clinical Trial Jennifer Brown (as joint PhD student with N. Labhardt) Background for our 'GIVE MOVE' resistance study in HIV-Infected children and adolescents is that this study group is the most vulnerable patient group and experiences high rates of treatment fail - ure. Unnecessary switching to a second-line ART regimen can increase pill burden, side-effects, and cost and will limit future therapy options, whereas maintaining a regimen during emerging resistance increases the risk of progression to AIDS and mor - tality. In many African countries, access to resis - tance tests is extremely limited. Our trial assesses the clinical impact and cost-ef - fectiveness of resistance testing (GRT) in children and adolescents with HIV with therapy failure. This open-label, parallel-group randomised clinical tri - al recruited so far 276 children and adolescents living with HIV in 7 sites in Lesotho and Tanzania. The study compares standard of care with an in - tervention arm (GRT to inform onward treatment). Endpoint is the occurrence of i) death due to any cause ii) disease-related hospital admission, iii) clinical exacerbation, and iv) no documentation of viral suppression. With increasing availability of GRT for African countries, and while rates of pre-treatment drug resistance rise, the clinical impact and feasibility of broader implementation must be explored, espe - cially among children and adolescents. Current - ly, enrollment is ongoing, with 56 participants en - rolled by December 8, 2020.

Only then late genes, i. e. env and gag, can be expressed. Our studies reveal a modulating role of Rev in the 'kinetic crosstalk' of events early in viral infection. Moreover, we observed that an \"artificial, premature Rev expres - sion\" creates a dominant negative phenotype, interfering with the wild type virus production (Fig. 3). Our finding of a non-complementable negative impact of Rev when expressed prior to HIV infection or before Tat expression shows that i) func - tions of Tat and Rev can be uncoupled (Env expression without Tat) and ii) a strict kinetic dependence is critical for a productive HIV infection in vitro . We now ana - lyze, if this property can be exploited for HIV control in vivo and towards new drugs. HF, Metzner KJ; Swiss HIV Cohort Study (2019).

Report 2017-2020The research of the Experimental Rheumatology (ER) group is focused on the pathogenetic mechanisms of inflammatory rheumatic diseases including chronic arthropathies such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), con - nective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (SS) and systemic sclerosis (SSc), autoimmune vasculitides (AAV) as well as the crystal arthropathies gout and calcium pyrophosphate deposition dis - ease. In several research projects, including collaborations with academia and pharma/biotech industry, we investigate the immunopathogenesis of some of these diseases with special focus on mechanisms of the innate immunity. The research topics include - the regulation of inflammatory pathways during macrophage differentiation and polarization. - immune-modulation by extracellular vesicles and the identification of their func - tional load in rheumatoid arthritis. - the screening of novel inhibitors targeted against inflammatory pathways and autoimmune disease- relevant factors - the role of neutrophil extracellular traps and cell-free mitochondrial DNA in the pathogenesis of various rheumatic diseases. We follow a translational approach, using patient materials such as blood and sy - novial fluid. In vitro cell cultures with primary cells are set up and phenotypic and functional analyses are performed in vitro . In our recent work one of the main topics was the analysis of microRNA (miR) as epigenetic regulators of inflammatory signaling pathways (Figure 1). In a search for microRNA expressed by in vitro differentiated macrophages stimulated via TLR li - gands we have identified miR-221-3p as a driver of a polarization of macrophages towards a proinflammatory M1 phenotype. We found that miR- 221-3p in anti-inflammatory M2-macrophages is - ing that governs anti-inflammatory IL-10 secretion in cells. inhibition of JAK3 but also imposed a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile in M2- mac - rophages, including an increased secretion of IL-12 and IL-6. We hypothesize that this mechanism may contribute to chronic inflammation and destruction in rheu - matoid arthritis (RA). Our results add to existing evidence suggesting microRNAs as tarpeutic targets. Currently we are involved in an Innosuisse funded collabora - tive project searching for small molecular inhibitors of microRNA. Another focus is the role of neutrophil extracellular traps and cell-free mitochondri - al DNA in the pathogenesis of various rheumatic diseases. Activated neutrophils have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and the ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV). Recent data suggests that subjects with SLE are characterized by impaired NET degradation, disseminating the avail - ability of extracellular DNA as a pro-inflammatory stimulus to the innate immune system. NETs may also contain mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), a dsDNA molecule which is phylogenetically evolved from bacteria and rich in hypomethylated CpG sequences, thus especially suited to trigger TLR9 signaling and disease flares. The main goal of the particular study is to analyse the extent and nature of circu - lating extracellular DNA species (mtDNA vs. nDNA) in SLE and AAV and determine if mtDNA plasma concentrations can serve as a marker for diagnosis and disease The role of innate immune mechanisms in the patho- genesis of chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases Experimental RheumatologyInnate Immunity .

Report 2017-2020Migration of immune cells plays an important role in protective immunity but also in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. Directed migration of immune cells is gov - erned by chemokine gradients acting as extracellular guidance cues. During the last years we have developed various microfluidic devices to study migration prop - erties of primary immune cells on a single cell level. These devices allow to gen - erate precisely controllable stable diffusion-based and/or immobilized chemokine gradients of various shapes. This allows studying basic aspects of signal integra - tion of migrating cells, including the question how cells sense the direction of che - mokine gradients and what sustains migration along potentially irregular gradients in non-inflamed and inflamed tissues. Consensus exists that chemokine gradients offer the main guidance cues for mi - grating immune cells. Only limited data is available regarding how such gradients are generated and maintained. Atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs) are able to scavenge chemokines, hereby shaping the distribution of chemokines locally. The expression of chemokine-scavenging ACKRs in inflamed multiple sclerosis lesions suggests that ACKRs also play an important role in shaping chemokine distribu - tion -and hence immune cell recruitment to sites of inflammation. We aim to under - stand, how expression of ACKRs on glial cells impacts on the distribution of che - mokines in inflamed CNS tissue. Vaccinations, immunosenescence and multiple sclerosis Vaccinations are important measures of global health, not only since the Corona - virus pandemic. Consensus exists that all persons with MS should be immunized according to the local vaccine standards. Physicians and other healthcare providers caring for persons with MS are often faced with questions concerning vaccinations, particularly in patients receiving disease modifying therapies (DMTs). We aim at understanding how DMTs and also how treatment histories impact on vaccine responses. We further link these data to the degree of immunosenescence in individual patients, since immunotherapies can result in accelerated aging of the immune system.Chemokines, atypical chemokine receptors and chemotaxis in multiple sclerosis Group Andrea Amstad* (MD Student) Blanc* (Intern) Collaborator) Friedrich Jakob Multiple Sclerosis Matthias Mehling Department of Biomedicine und Neurology Clinic University Hospital Basel 175 Department of Biomedicine .

To date more than 450 different PID entities have been elucidated. The main current basic immunology focus of the research lab is to characterise the role of a yet poorly studied transcription factor in the generation and mainte - nance of human memory T lymphocytes. This is done by analysing functional con - sequences of T cell intrinsic over- expression vs. knock-out of the transcription factor complemented by a detailed clinical immunology assessment of patients carrying homozygous loss of function mutations in the gene encoding the tran - scription factor. The aim is to molecularly define a non-redundant role for this transcription factor in the generation of human T cell memory and to characterise drugable targets to potentially restore immunity in patients carrying loss of function mutations in the gene encoding this transcription factor.

Patients are treated with immunoglobulin supplementation and, if available, specific immuno-active compounds. Since 2015, patients with the diagnosis of primary (genetically determined) immunodeficiency are inc- luded into a prospective research cohort. Follow - ing informed consent, a standardised documenta - tion of the physical status of the patient is combined with analysis of clinically validated and/or research based immunological lab data and next generation immune-gene sequencing. This allows us to pro - spectively study the disease course but also to de - termine the molecular mechanism of disease and at best to treat the patients in a targeted, personalised manner. Currently, more than 225 patients have been includ - ed into the prospective cohort and selected patients are further molecularly characterised in the research lab. Novel disease causing immune gene variants have been identified in CTLA-4, SP110, SDHA, SAMHD1, Ligase 4 and many others. Novel targeted personalised treatment strategies have been or are currently clinically evaluated in patients with disease causing mutations in CTLA-4, SDHA, POLA1, SAM - HD1 and others. 180 Biomedicine .

The complex pathogenic mecha - nisms leading to and being involved in this autoimmune-inflammatory syndrome are not well understood. However, complement C1q, the first component of the classical pathway, seems to play a central role. By analysing the role of C1q as well as it's interaction with autoantibodies targeting C1q (anti-C1q) in SLE, we aimed at elucidating 1) mechanisms being involved in the initiation of autoimmunity, 2) mechanisms of secondary acceleration of inflammation, and 3) processes being associated with atherosclerosis and thromboembolism. With regard to mechanisms being involved in the initiation of SLE, homozygous C1q deficiency is the strongest genetic risk factor for the development of SLE. Vice versa, in SLE patients without primary C1q deficiency, C1q is consumed dur - ing disease flares, deposited in affected tissues and becoming a target of auto - antibodies (anti-C1q). The identification of a major linear epitope of C1q targeted by anti-C1q having a striking sequence homology with an antigenic site of Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) suggests cross-reactivity between anti-C1q and anti-EBV anti - bodies through molecular mimicry. This was an important observation since EBV infection is considered to be an essential step in the development of SLE. We now could demonstrate that EBV-derived antigenic peptides indeed can induce anti - bodies cross-reacting with complement C1q in vivo . Secondly, C1q of apoptotic cells, a mecha - nism that is defective in SLE patients. In the context of a defective clearance, dy - ing cells can become antigenic and trigger the autoimmune response. In previous studies I could show that anti-C1q specifically recognize C1q when being bound to apoptotic cells and that anti-C1q induce a proinflammatory phenotype in macro - phages being associated with reduced phagocytic capacity. We are currently ex - ploring these mechanisms of secondary inflammation, in particular how C1q and anti-C1q affect macrophage-mediated T-cell activation. Thirdly, our previous analyses of bone marrow-derived human anti-C1q identified sequence homologies with von Willebrand Factor (vWF). In striking analogy to an - ti-C1q, vWF also binds to C1q leading to consecutive platelet rolling and adhesion, and the lack of C1q is associated with increased bleeding in vivo , thus establish - ing a novel link between C1q and primary hemostasis. In addition, binding of vWF to C1q on cholesterol crystals substantially affects phagocytosing macrophages. This is of importance since both, C1q and vWF, have been shown to be implicat - ed in atherosclerosis and thromboembolism, both being typical comorbidities in SLE patients. Taken together, our projects elucidate the role of complement C1q and anti-C1q in interaction with EBV infection, macrophages, the clearance of apoptotic cells and primary hemostasis, all having been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE. Our data improve the understanding of immune-mediated pathology occurring related to but also independently of autoimmunity.Complement-dependent pathogenic mechanisms in C, Thanei S, Trendelenburg M.

In addition and thanks to the participation in the Swiss SLE Cohort Study (SSCS) we are also study - ing the role of other autoantibodies and serum cyto - kines in SLE. Independent from anti-C1q studies, we are study - ing the role of complement split products (i.e. acti - vation parameters) and complement mannan-bind - ing lectin (MBL) in clinical settings. MBL is strongly related to C1q and has been shown to play an im - portant role in the defense against infectious agents. More recent studies suggest that MBL also binds to apoptotic cells and plays a pro-inflammatory role in experimental settings of ischemia-reperfusion inju - ry. The high frequency of functional MBL deficiency in the general population (about 25 %) predestines MBL for clinical studies investigating its role in hu - man disease.182 Department of Biomedicine . Report 2017-2020Dendritic cells (DCs) are a specialized immune subset dedicated to the sensing of pathogens and the induction of the appropriate immune response. Under steady state conditions DCs can be subdivided into conventional DCs (cDCs) and plas - macytoid DCs (pDCs). cDCs are specialized in antigen uptake and presentation to na\u00efve T cells and can be further subdivided into IRF8- and IRF4-expressing cDC1 and cDC2, respectively. pDCs are a distinct lineage dedicated to the production of high amounts of type I IFNs in response to viral infections. Development of DCs occurs in the bone marrow (BM) and requires a complex transcriptional network, where progressive lineage specification gradually limits and excludes alternative fates. A common DC progenitor (CDP) able to give rise to both cDCs and pDCs, had been identified in the BM. However, while cDCs arise in the periphery, mature pDCs are present in BM suggesting that their development is accomplished be - fore entering the circulation. Furthermore, the evidence that CDPs can generate pDCs and cDCs at a clonal lev - el is conceivable with a pre-determined and cell-intrinsic transcriptional induction of lineage specification, already at the CDP stage. In recent years precursors of cDC1 and cDC2 were identified, as several TFs involved in their commitment. How - ever, the molecular mechanisms leading to DC-lineage specifications are still un - clear. Moreover, the evidence that both hematopoietic branches, namely the lym - phoid via CLP and the myeloid via CMPs, can both give rise to DCs has further complicated our understanding of their ontogeny. In order to characterize the de - velopmental pathway of DCs and in particular of pDC we searched for a committed precursor. The expression of the E protein Transcription factor 4 (TCF4), also re - ferred as E2-2 was shown to be essential for pDC development and identity, how - ever the exact stage at which this TF is expressed is unclear. The requirement for this TF for pDC development appears shared across species as in humans haplo- insufficiency, referred as Pitt-Hopkins syndrome, results in impaired pDC besides mental retardation and cranio-facial dysmorphia. It was hypothesized that devel - opment of pDCs and cDC1 is regulated by the expression and mutual inhibition of TCF4 on pDCs and the inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (ID2) on cDC1, respectively. Fur - ther, the zinc finger E box-binding homeobox 2 (Zeb2) was recently identified as key regulator of early DC development as Zeb2 deficient mice have reduced pDCs, and increased cDC1. The proposed mechanism of action suggested repression of ID2 by ZEB2. However, while this molecular regulation is compatible with the pDC phenotype observed in Zeb2 deficient mice, it does not explain Zeb2 transgenic mice, which have unaltered pDCs and reduced cDC1s. Collectively, these results suggest a dual origin of pDCs, where the requirement for TCF4 and ZEB2 is lineage as well as stage specific. A CDP independent origin for pDCs is further supported by the evidence that the pool is only partially reduced in Itgax-cre but totally absent in Mx1-cre conditional deficient mice. Given the complexity of the transcriptional in - teractions happening at different stages during DC commitment, and the possible developmental convergence into one phenotypically unique lineage, we decided to explore in depth the paths leading to pDC and cDC development. Contrary as previously hypothesized, we could recently show that pDCs mostly develop from CLPs and not CDPs. Within the BM we were able to dissect the progressive stag - es that lead to the formation of mature pDCs. The expression of SiglecH and Ly6D identifies on IL7Rexpressing bone marrow precursors pre-pDCs. At this stage high expression of IRF8 appears to be essential to promote pDC lineage specification through the induction of TCF4, while we hypothesize that within the immediate up - stream progenitor expression of EBF1 leads to the induction of TCF3 along the B cell pathway (Figure 1).

This subset is present as a small fraction of cells that fall within the pDC gate but appears to share hallmark fea - tures not only with pDCs but also cDCs. Recent evidence has shown the presence of this subset also within the peripheral circulation of healthy donors. It appears that pDC-like cells are an immature cDC-progenitor subset capable of differenti - ating upon activation in efficient cDCs. The functional properties of pDC-like cells as well as their differentiation capacity remain to be investigated. Fig. 1: pDC and DC Differentiation.
