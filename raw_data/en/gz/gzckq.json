We conducted cross -sectional flow 3 cytometric immune profiling on peripheral blood from 826 individuals [stage 3 T1D (n=240), 5 negative unaffected controls (n=252)]. We construct ed an immune -age predictive model in 6 unaffected participants and observed accelerated immune ag ing in the T1D cohort (p<0.001) . We 7 used generalized additive models for location, shape, and scale (GAMLSS) to obtain age -corrected 8 data for 192 flow cytometry an d complete blood count readouts, which can be visualized in our 9 interactive portal (ImmScape; https://ufdiabetes.shinyapps.io/ImmScape/ ); 46 parameters were 10 significantly associated with age only, 2 5 with T1D only, and 2 3 with both age and T1D. 11 Phenotypes associated with accelerated immunological aging in T1D included increased CXCR3+ 12 and PD -1+ frequenci es in na\u00efve T cell , despite reduced PD -1 expression levels 13 (MFI) on memory T cells . Phenotypes associated with T1D after age -correction were predictive 14 of T1D status (AUROC=82.3%). Our findings demonstrate advanced immune aging in T1D and 15 highlight disease -associated phenotypes for biomarker monitoring and therapeutic intervention s. 16 4 INTR ODUCTION 1 With improved diabetes classification tools, it is now appreciate d that the onset of type 1 diabetes 2 (T1D) may occur throughout the human lifespan (1, 2) , although diagnosis peaks between ages 3 five to seven years and near puberty (3). Individuals with high genetic risk for T1D , which is 4 largely driven by the human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) region, are more likely to receive diagnos es 5 during these peak time periods (4, 5) , and exhibit islet cell-reactive autoantibodies (AAb) 6 indicat ive of disease progression before age two (6, 7) . Addit ionally, t he cellular composition of 7 insulitis has been demonstrated to depend upon the a ge-at-onset of T1D (5, 8) , with a shift from B 8 cell-dominated insulitis seen under age 7 to primarily T cells and macrophages over age 13 (9, 10) , 9 suggesting that the immune populations involved in disease pathogenesis vary by age at diagnosis. 10 The quest for cellular biomarkers of T1D pathogenesis is limited to recirculating immune 11 cells that do not perfectly reflect the populatio ns in priming lymph nodes and autoimmune lesion 12 (11), and is further confounded by age- and environment -driven variations in peripheral blood 13 immune cell subset composition (12). To address these confounding technical and biological 14 factors masking disease -related changes in the immune system, the Human Immuno phenotyping 15 Consortium (HIPC) developed a recommended set of flow cytometry panels aiding aggregation 16 and comparison of data across studies (13). The HIPC panels were designed to quantify memory 17 T cell, regulatory T cell (Treg), effector T cell (Teff), B cell, dendritic cell (DC), monocyte, and 18 natural ki ller (NK) cell subset proportions and phenotypes (13). These standardized panels have 19 been successfully used to identify immune modulation due to vaccination (14, 15) , infection (16, 20 17), autoimmunity (18, 19) , and cancer (20, 21) , although to our knowledge, full HIPC 21 phenotyping of T1D has not been previously performed. 22 5 The impact of aging on immune phenotypes is well-established (22, 23) \u2014 environmental 1 exposures , particularly infection by cytomegalovi rus (CMV) , are known to drive expansion of a 2 large circulating pool of antigen -specific memory T cells (24, 25) . However, previous 3 investigations have primarily been limited to cohorts of adults. Here, we studied a more ex pansive 4 age range (2-83 years ) to capture the immune dynamics of childhood and adolescence , wherein 5 the majority of T1D diagnoses occur . In order to study disease -mediated perturbations of the 6 immune system , our cross -sectional cohort (n=826) was designed to include unaffected controls 7 (CTR, n=252) , unaffected first-degree relatives of individuals with T1D (REL , n=310), rare at- 8 risk participants who have two or more islet AAb (RSK, n=24), and those diagnosed with T1D 9 (n=240). 10 In this study , we categorize d major patterns of immune subset trajectories in unaffected 11 individuals over the pediatric and adult age range , allowing for detection of modulated trajectories 12 in T1D . We further model ed the immunophenotyping data to estimate immun ological age (26) as 13 compared t o chronological age in individuals with T1D versus those without diabetes . Age- 14 corrected individual phenotypes contributing to differences in immunological age were compared 15 across all participants binned by progressive T1D risk or status (27) to understand whether each 16 was likely to contribute to immune activation and disease pathogenesis as opposed to a 17 consequence post-onset (e.g., dysglycemia -induced inflamma tion (28)). Lastly, we assess ed 18 associations between T1 D genetic risk (29-31) and immunophenotypes , and found limited genetic 19 associations with accelerated immune aging in T1D . Notabl y, all immunophenotyping data 20 generated herein are available for visualization and analysis via an interactive R/Shiny application 21 (ImmScape ; https://ufdiabetes.shinyapps.io/ImmScape/ ). 22 6 RESULTS 1 Impact of age on immune population dynamics 2 We used six flow cytometry panels adapted from HIPC recommendations (13) as previously 3 published (18, 32) , to generate detailed immunophenotyping data encompassing proportions of 4 innate and adaptive immune cells (Figure 1A, detailed gating in Figures S1-S6). Assay 5 reproducibility was demonstrated in an initial cohort of 12 individuals wherein the biological 6 coefficient of variance (CV) largely outweighed variance \u00b1 7 25.66% vs. 8.87 \u00b1 7.56 %, Figure 1 B), in agreement with previously established guidelines for 8 replicability in flow cytometric studies (33). These studies were then extended to characterize flow 9 cytometric immunophenotypes with accompanying complete blood count (CBC) measurements , 10 for a total of 192 total outcome measu res, on a large cross -sectional cohort of n=826 persons 11 (Table 1 ). The majority of CBC values were within normal range with the following exceptions: 12 low mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) , low neutrophil percentage , and high 13 lymphocyte percentage were observed across CTR, REL, and T1D groups, presumably related to 14 transport and storage time (Table S1 ). The T1D group displayed increased proportions of 15 individuals with hematocrit percentage and platelet count above the nor mal range , potentially 16 reflecting dehydration and hyperglycemia, respectively (34) (Table S1 ). Covariates including age, 17 sex, BMI percentile , and race differed between groups (27) (Table 1 ). The AAb - and T1D cohort s 18 both ha d bimodal age distribution s with different proportions in each component , as is common in 19 pediatric T1D cohort s with unaffected individuals comprised largely of siblings and parents. Upon 20 noting this age discordance, we quantified how each immune phenotype changed with age . We 21 performed Spearman correlation analyses between age and all peripheral blood phenotypes 22 obtained by CBC and flow cytometr y in AAb negative (AAb -) unaffected individuals (CTR and 23 7 REL), demonstrating that the majority of age -related associations appeared in the adaptive immune 1 compartment (Figure 1C-D). Visualization of the dynamics of major subsets defined by our flow 2 cytometry panels revealed relatively consistent proportions of innate cells across age, including 3 monocytes, DCs, and NK cells , in contrast to distinct age -related contraction of na\u00efve and 4 expansion of memory subsets within the adaptive B cell and T cell compartments ( Figure 1 E-L). 5 Age-associated immune traject ories in T1D 6 To assay the impact of age on the composition of the peripheral immune system , we characterized 7 major trajectory patterns of the 172 flow cytometry outcome measures in unaffected islet AAb- 8 CTR and REL between 5 -75 years of age . Smooth ing splines were fit to model each phenotype's 9 trajectory over age . Hierarchical clustering analysis of normalized , centered and scaled phenotype 10 trajectories (Figure 2A ) revealed fou r distinct patterns : 1) increasing (n=66 phenotypes ), 2) 11 upward parab olic (n=20), 3) decreasing linear (n=74), and 4) stable (n=12) relationships with age 12 (Figure 2B ). Using these defined cluster assignments (Figure S7 ), we also fit smooth trajectories 13 on T1D samples and overlaid these on AAb- CTR and REL (Figure 2 C-D). When organized using 14 the clustering structure from the unaffected individuals, t he T1D immune trajector ies appear ed to 15 have similar overall trends ( Figure 2C ). Indeed, t rajectory -specific difference revealed that the 16 vast majority (86%) of phenotype trajec tories initially trend in the same direction (increasing or 17 decreasing) , and t hose with differing initial trends cross at least twice, indicating sampling 18 variation in the trajectory rather than disease -driven divergence . However, direct comparison 19 revealed an average upward shift in Cluster 1 (p<0.001) and a downward shift in Cluster 3 20 (p=0.034 , Figure 2D ) for . Over time , trajectories tend ed to shift 21 further apart ( Figure S8), altogether suggest ing that individuals with T1D exhibit distinct age- 22 dependent alterations in immune trajectories . 23 8 Accelerated immune aging in T1D 1 To quantify the extent to which T1D immune profiles deviate from unaffected individuals across 2 chronologic age, we created a model to estimate an \"immunological age\" parameter from our CBC 3 and flow cytometry data. Due to hierarchal dependence and correlation among flow cytometry 4 readouts (Figure S 9), we trained a random lasso (35) model on islet AAb- CTR to identify 5 phenotypes predictive of age in individuals without autoimmunity . Our approach retained 69 6 immune features (Figure 3A ) with a test set prediction performance of R2=0.70. Model 7 consistency was observed by training on a combined AAb - cohort in which 45 variables were 8 commonly retained and R2 = 0.70. Providing support for this immune age model , we saw expected 9 shifts from na\u00efve to memory populations in both T and B cells over the lifespan (36-38). CD4+ T 10 cells increased concom itant with a decline in CD8+ T cell frequency, consistent with the CD4/8 11 ratio increasing with age (39). 12 We then applied our mo del to the full AAb- CTR , AAb - REL , and T1D cohorts to examine 13 differences in predicted age and chronological age. We observed the highest predictive 14 performance of the immune age model among younger individuals regardless of risk cohort, which 15 we confirmed by training two separate random lasso models for AAb - CTR younger than the age 16 of 30 (R2 = 0.66) and those older (R2 = 0.56). Given that the model plateaus after age 30 ( Figure 17 3B), we focused the rest of the analysis for Figure 3 on subjects under 30 years of age (Table S2 ), 18 where we observed the T1D group displayed accelerated immune aging relative to both AAb- CTR 19 and REL, with an average increase of 3. 36 years (p<0.001 , Figure 3 B). Immunological age was 20 increased by 1.71 years on average (p=0.016) in the recent -onset T1D subset of our cohort under 21 30 years of age (Figure S 10A), consistent with observations in the overall T1D group. The 22 observed accelerated immune aging in T1D did not appear to be related to history of CMV 23 9 infection , which , perhaps surprisingly (24, 40) , was not a significant driver of accelerated immune 1 aging in our young cohort (average increase of 1.62 years associated with CMV infection history , 2 p=0.086 , Figure S 10B-C). We also explored nine disease -relevant features for potential 3 associations to the residual predicted age in T1D (Figure 3C ). The average increase of 3.36 years 4 was not associated with hemoglobin A1c (HbA 1c), polygenic T1D risk (genetic risk score [GRS1] 5 (5)), or demographic variables such as sex, race, or ethnicity (Table S3 ). Disease duration and 6 clinical covariates BMI percentile and rested blood glucose were significant ly associated with 7 accelerated immune aging in T1D (p=0.003, p<0.001, and p=0. 029) (Figure 3D-F) but not in 8 AAb - CTR or REL (Figure S1 1). The standardized regression coefficients in a multivariable 9 regression model of predicted age indicated that BMI percentile had the largest contribution 10 (=1.75), followed by disease duration (=1.47), and rested blood glucose level (=1.10). The 11 increased residual age variations observed , and their association with clinical features , reflects the 12 additional immunological burden s of T1D. 13 Age correction of immunophenotyping data in a T1D prediction model 14 Given the diverse and heterogeneous phenotypic distributions across the 192 flow and CBC 15 measures, along with their non -linear association with age, we chose to use a semi-parametric 16 modeling framework to investigate the specific flow cytometric readouts contributing to the 17 accelerated immune ag ing observed in T1D. We obtained age -corrected phenotype data for all 18 further analyses by using generalized additive models for location, shape, and scale (GAMLSS) 19 (41, 42) . Using this approach , we model ed each phenotype as a smooth -function of age using the 20 combined AAb - CTR and REL cohorts , obtained fitted distribution parameters for all ages, then 21 obtain ed the centile s of their phenotypes from the estimated cumulative distribution function . The 22 advantage of this approach is that in addition to age -adjusted comparison testing , it provides the 23 10 framework for an immunophenotype centile reference range . We built a n R/Shiny 1 (ImmScape; https://ufdiabetes.shinyapps .io/ImmScape/ ) for interactive explor ation and 2 visualization of study data as illustrated in Figure 4A-C. After applying GAMLSS age correction , 3 none of the phenotypes associated with BMI percentile or T1D duration using false discovery rate 4 (FDR ) correction for multiple testing. With these age -corrected data, we were able to identify 48 5 total features that were significantly different in T1D as compared to CTR subjects following 6 multiple testing correction (26 increased and 2 2 decreased ) (Figure 4D, Table S 4), including 7 features from all flow cytometry panels and CBC data (Figure S 9, Table S1 ). To quantify the 8 usefulness of the age -adjustment in identifying disease relevant phenotypes, we used logistic 9 regre ssion to predict disease status (T1D versus AAb - CTR) from the 48 phenotypes and obtained 10 an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC ) of 82.3%. This is an 11 improvement over similarly constructed prediction model s on all age-corrected phenotypes 12 (AUROC= 79.6%) and on all uncorrected phenotypes (AUROC=76.8%) . 13 Our immune age model also shows consistency with the previously developed IMM -AGE 14 score in Alpert et al. (26) , which fits a trajectory through a low dimensional repres entation of the 15 data and estimates a pseudotime or relative order of individuals as an indicator of immune aging . 16 Applying the IMM -AGE procedure to all 192 phenotypes , we observe a similar pattern of 17 increased correlation between biological age and estimat ed pseudotime before age 30 , followed 18 by no correlation at later ages. We also find T1D individuals are shifted significantly in pseudotime 19 relative to CTR (p=0.022 ; Figure S12A ). When restricting our analysis to only the phenotypes 20 identified by our Rando m Lasso model , the consistency between the analyses becomes stronger, 21 with a Spearman correlation of 0.92 between the IMM -AGE score and our predicted immune ag ing 22 (Figure S12 B). However, it is important to acknowledge that the IMM -AGE score provides only 23 11 a relative age value and does not correspond to a predicted age . In contrast, our model directly 1 estimate s an immune ag e while identifying relevant phenotypes and their impact on immune ag ing. 2 Immune features influenced by age and T1D status 3 Altogether, 46 features were significantly modulated with age alone versus 25 with T1D status , 4 while 23 features had shared contributions from both age and T1D (Figure 5). Several 5 observations within our age -corrected data confirm previously reported findings in T1D. For 6 example , the age-corrected proportion of na\u00efve CD8+ T cells increased, while the CD8+ T effector 7 memory ( Tem) cell population exhibited decreased age-corrected frequency in T1D (43) (Figure 8 S13A-B). We observed reduced frequencies of CD8+ T cells lacking both activation markers CD38 9 and HLA -DR in T1D with concomitant increase in CD8+CD38+HLA -DR- cells (44) (Figure 10 S13C-D). CD56dim NK cells decreased with expected concomitant increase in CD56bright NK cells 11 in T1D subjects, in agreement with two publications (44, 45) , but in conflict with another (46), as 12 well as a trend (p= 0.095 ) in 2AAb+ RSK subjects ( Figure S1 3E). Furthermore, T1D subjects 13 showed reduced frequency of transitional B cells as compared to A Ab- CTR and REL (Figure 14 S13F) (47). As summarized in Figure 5 , we found a n association of increasing non -class -switched 15 memory B cells with age, while transitiona l B cells declined with both aging and T1D (48, 49) . 16 Finally, CBC parameters showed both age and T1D dependent shifts : MCV and MCH increased 17 with a ge and T1D, while hemoglobin and hematocrit increased in T1D, findings supported by 18 existing literature (50). With the above supporting our approach , we identified themes pertinent to 19 immune dysregulation in T1D : altered expression of the Th1 -associated chemokine receptor 20 CXCR3 and coinhibitory receptor PD-1 on multiple T cell subsets, a s well as increased monocyte 21 expression of HLA -DR (Figure 5 ), which we explore d further as described below . 22 Increased CXCR3 expression on T cell subsets of T1D subjects 23 12 Of all parameters measured, the greatest mean difference between T1D and CTR (without a 1 significant age association) was significantly increased frequency of CXCR3 expression among 2 na\u00efve CD8+ T cells (Figure 5), due to increased CXCR3lo and decreased CXCR3- subset 3 percentages memory CD45RA+ (Temra 4 exhibited the same pattern s of increased CXCR3lo and decreased CXCR3- frequencies in T1D 5 (Figure 6C-D, Figure S1 4C-D). Individuals with T1D also demonstrated elevated 6 CXCR3+ Tfh (Figure 6E, Figure S1 4E) as previously reported (44). Together, these data show a 7 shift toward increased CXCR3 expressi ng populations across T cell subsets in T1D . 8 Altered PD-1 expression on T cells from T1D subjects 9 We observed altered expression of the coinhibitory receptor, PD -1, on T cell subsets (Figure 5). 10 Despite significantly increased frequency of PD -1+ cells expression intensity 12 (MFI) was decreased in T1D subjects on the majority Importantly , due to age - 14 associated changes in PD -1 expression across all clinical groups ( Figure 3A), a number of these 15 T1D-associated differences were most apparent following age correction ( Figure also significantly on memory 17 CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets of AAb- REL as compared to CTR (Figure 6I-L, Figure S1 4I-L), 18 suggesting a potential genetic predisposition to altered expression of PD -1. 19 While some studies in small racially homogenous cohorts have associated single nucleotide 20 polymorphisms ( SNPs -wide association 21 studies (GWAS) in European cohorts have failed to replicate these findings (31, 55) . We surmised 22 that a PDCD1 SNP that has not been ide ntified in GWAS efforts may be enriched in T1D, AAb+, 23 13 and AAb - REL participants from our trans -ancestral cohort ( Table 1 ). To test this hypothesis, we 1 downloaded PDCD1 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for whole blood from the Genotype - 2 Tissue Expre ssion project ( GTEx) (56) and tested for increased presence of each SNP in T1D 3 versus CT R groups via logistic regression . The top enriched SNP was rs6422701 , with the T allele 4 being overrepresented in the T1D cohort (Table S5). The T allele of rs6422701 was associated 5 with decreased PDCD1 mRNA expression in whole blood in GT Ex (Figure S15A). We saw 6 significantly decreased PD -1 expression on Tem CD8 7 Tcm, in CT R and AAb - REL with the T allele (Figure S15B-E), partially mirroring observations 8 in REL vs CT R overall (Figure 6I -L, Figure S1 4I-L). with T1D -associated HLA -DR4 genotype 10 While most of the immune features associated with T1D (Figure 5) were compar able between 11 AAb- CTR and AAb- REL (Figure 3B, Figure 6A-H), some phenotypes showed distinct 12 differences between these groups (Figure 6I-L). As genetic loci contributing to risk for T1D are 13 enriched in REL (5), we performed QTL analysis on genetically unrelated subjects to test for 14 associations between age-corrected flow cytometric phenotypes and genotypes at 240 found at 5% minor allele frequency (MAF) in our cohort , with RSK or T1D 16 status, sex, and population str atification as covariates. Following adjustment for multiple testing 17 of genotypes and phenotypes, a signifi cant association (FDR<0.05 corrected by Benjamini - 18 Hochberg adjustment ) was observed between rs7454108 19 increased HLA -DR MFI on monocytes ( Figure 7A, Table S 6). As rs7454108 tags the high -risk 20 HLA -DR4 -DQ8 haplotype (29, 57, 58) , we asked whether other HLA haplotypes carrying strong 21 risk or protection from T1D likewise impacted this phenotype. However, we did not find evidence 22 of association with monocyte HLA -DR MFI for the high -risk HLA -DR3 -DQ2 haplotype 23 14 (rs2187668 (5, 29) protective HLA -DR15 -DQ6 haplotype (rs3129889 (5, 29) ) 1 (Figure 7A). Monocyte HLA -DR expression showed no age dependence (Figure 7B). The 2 GAMLSS -corrected data demonstrated evidence of a genotype -dosage effect (Figure 7C). 3 Specifically, HLA -DR MFI was increased in subjects heterozygous for HLA -DR4 as compared to 4 those carrying other HLA class II genotypes (DRX /X), and further increased in subjects 5 homozygous for HLA -DR4 ( Figure 7C). Notably, the association between HLA -DR4 genotype 6 and HLA -DR MFI on monocytes was present in all groups , suggesting that this genetic driver of 7 immune phenotype may act independently of AAb positivity or disease status ( Figure 7D-G). 8 15 DISCUSSION 1 We conducted flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood from a well -characterized cross - 2 sectional cohort (n=826), to understand how risk for autoimmune diabetes intersects with age , 3 impact ing the broad immune landscape. These data revealed striking dynamics of immune age 4 within the adaptive compartment , which could be used to predict chronological age with a high 5 degree of accuracy in CTR under 30 years of age . This resulting dataset corrobora tes a list of 6 cellular features that change dramatically as a function of age (e.g., increased CD4+ T cells and 7 decreased B cells and CD8+ T cells, with shifts from na\u00efve to memory populations in adaptive 8 immune cells over the lifespan (36-39)). This complements prior des criptions of age-associated 9 serological changes (59) and alterations in the epigen etic DNA methylation \"clock\" (60). 10 Moreover, our data fill important gaps from prior studies (13, 61 -63) to understand changes in the 11 pediatric immune system - a critical time period for understanding normal frequencies and cellular 12 distributions. 13 Our model revealed accelerated immune aging across the first three decades of life and 14 numerous cellu lar features associated with T1D after GAMLSS age correction. Our age -correction 15 model thus enabled the assessment of phenotypic changes as influenced by T1D, overcoming a 16 challenge of cross -sectional studies where donor age distributions are often skewed. This is of 17 particular value to biomarker studies in pediatric diseases, where sampling of age -matched CTR 18 is often limited. Beyond this, using our cross -sectional immunophenotyping dataset, we built a 19 model capable of predicting T1D status with internal prediction performance at 82.3% accuracy. 20 Evaluation of this model in larger pre -T1D cohorts and longitudinal sampling will be necessary to 21 validate its possible utility for T1D prediction and monitoring. 22 16 Considering age is a key aspect of understanding T1D pathogenesis. The first hallmark of 1 -cell autoimmunity (i.e., emergence of multiple islet AAb) often occurs within the fir st two years 2 of life (6). Younger age -of-onset has also been associated with the highe st risk HLA -DR3/4 3 diplotype (5), a prominent T and B cell insulitic lesion in the pancreas of T1D organ donors (9, 4 10), a bia s toward IFN -:IL-10 T cell autoreactivity (64), and more acute clinical loss of 5 endogenous C -peptide (29). While other studies have considered the impact of age on the changing 6 immune system in T1D (65), we believe our study is unique by covering a large , multi -decade age 7 cohort , including a small group of >2AAb+ (i.e., stage 1 -2 T1D (27)) participants, and 8 implementing a strategy to account for age differences. 9 In an effort to explain the observed accelerated aging , we examined T1D GRS1 (5) and 10 clinical covariates associated with disease duration and glycemic dysregulation. Modest 11 associations emerged with BMI percentile, disease duration, and rested blood glucose level , but 12 not with polygenic risk . Thus, we posit that accelerated immune aging observed may result from 13 chronic inflammation , as has been described previously (66-70), and/or hyperglycemic stress , as 14 key features of T1D. High-risk subjects who progressed to disease in The Environmental 15 Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY ) cohort displayed chronic entero viral sheddi ng 16 (71), evidence of persistent infection and inflammation . In addition, i ncreased risk of infection in 17 all diabetes, but also in T1D when compared to type 2 diabetes , highlights that individuals with 18 T1D have multiple impacts to overall immune function (72). 19 Within this study, we replicated multiple findings in smaller cohort studies of T1D subjects 20 compared to CTR (43-45, 47 -50), as well as immune aging studies (36-39), providing support for 21 both the age prediction and T1D prediction capacity of our model s. Moreover, we identified 22 phenotypes of immune system changes with age and T1D , which to our knowledge, have not been 23 17 previously reported . Our dataset is readily accessible via ImmPort ( accession number : SDY2299 ) 1 and in an interactive format (https://ufdiabetes.shinyapps.io/ImmScape/ ) for public visualization 2 and comparisons to other diseases and cohorts of interest. Phenotypic shifts associated with both 3 aging and T1D generally reflected accelerated aging in their directionality. However, t wo age- 4 associated phenotypes were reversed in T1D relative to CTR aging trends : na\u00efve CD8+ T cell and 5 CD8+CD38+HLA -DR- T cell frequencies were increased in T1D, despite decreasing with age in 6 CTR . These phenotypes may reflect the same cell subset, considering that the majority of na\u00efve 7 CD8+ T cells are CD38+HLA -DR- (Figure S3 ). Peripheral na\u00efve T cells are largely maintained 8 through homeostatic expansion and tonic T cell receptor ( TCR ) signaling (73). CD8+ T cells 9 usually represent a shrinking proportion of the T cell pool over time (74). Their increase in the 10 periphery in T1D subjects herein may reflect thymic output , increased expansion , and/or 11 differentiation to stem cell memory T cells (CD45RA+CXCR3+CCR7+CD27+CD28+CD95+) (75), 12 which could not be di stinguished from na\u00efve T cells in this dataset . 13 The observed increase in CXCR3 expression across multiple T cell subtypes could 14 influence maturation potential, trafficking, and/or polarization to promote disease pathogenesis. 15 Findings from murine models corroborate a role for CXCR3 in T cell trafficking to the islets and 16 autoimmune diabetes development (76), indicating Th1-skewing as a globally dysregulated 17 phenotype in T1D. Higher CXCR3+ memory T cell frequencies were shown in high-risk AAb+ 18 REL compared to low -risk relatives (77), suggesting linkage to disease pro cesses (77). CXCR3+ 19 na\u00efve T cells are reported ly enriched in autoreactivity in mice , and are thought to contain higher - 20 affinity (CD5hi) autoreactive T CRs (78). Additionally, e xpression of CXCR3 on na\u00efve CD8+ T 21 cells has previously been associated with enhanced effector phenotype differentiation (79, 80) . 22 18 The observed shifts in PD -1 expression in T1D extend upon previous findings of decreased 1 mRNA and protein levels in CD4+ T cells of T1D subjects (81) by defining decreased PD -1 indicate that 3 the PD -1 pathway may serve as a critical negative checkpoint for maintaining tolerance to islet - 4 cells (82). Observing reduced PD-1 MFI within REL suggest s a potential genetic predisposition 5 toward impaired PD -1 expression and should be subject to validation in larger cohorts . Our finding 6 regarding monocyte HLA -DR overexpression in HLA -DR4 subjects builds upon the prior 7 observation of this association in cord blood (83). Increased activation and/or antigen presentation 8 afforded by the increased expression could theoretically alter aspects of T cell selection and 9 cellular differentiation . These phenotypic observations regarding expression of CXCR3, PD -1, and 10 HLA -DR warrant future targeted studies on the mechanism and downstream impac t of the 11 observed altered expression levels. 12 In T1D, we noted amplification of immune aging trajectories, but do not have sufficient 13 data in very young subjects (e.g., birth to age seven) to understand when this trend is initiated, and 14 did not assess longi tudinal samples to compare to preclinical status. As result of this data sparsity 15 at either end of the lifespan, our interpretation of findings applies most directly to the impact of 16 diagnosed disease on immunophenotypes after age -correction of data , parti cularly in individuals 17 younger than 30 years . The plateau in model performance over age 30 may result from lack of 18 other indicators of overall aging and inflammation outside the scope of this study. Given the 19 variable duration of disease in our cohort, a ssociation of immune phenotypes with progression of 20 T1D in RSK individuals ( >2AAb+) would be best studied in longitudinal samples. Potential 21 covariates of interest include pubertal status and time of blood sample draw (84), which were not 22 recorded or included in the analysis. Beyond the immunophenotypes and effector molecules 23 19 investigated herein , other immunological compartments of potential interest include mast cells, 1 eosinophils, and basophils (85, 86) , along with tissue resident populations (11, 87 -89). 2 Experiments to address these questions are ongoing. 3 Our efforts to identify a signature of immune system age, as well as cellular phenotypes 4 associated with T1D , provide a number of additional targets for consideration in precision 5 medicine -based therapies (e.g., CXCR3+ T cells, the PD -1 costimulatory axis, antigen presentation 6 on monocytes , specifically in individuals with HLA -DR4 ). Moreover, these results provide 7 cellular and pathway targets for consideration in mechanistic studies of prior trials where efficacy 8 differed according to participant age (e.g., rituximab [anti and TN18]) (90, 91) and in future 10 intervention studies. Importantly, i mmune -directed therapeutic interventions aimed at interrupt ing 11 the autoimmune destruction of -cells, at or prior to clinical diagnosis of T1D, often have outcomes 12 impacted by the age of subjects at the time of drug treatment ( reviewed in (92)). We suggest this 13 observation reflects altered immune system constituents that shape therapeutic response (or lack 14 thereof) , depending on the target and drug mechanism -of-action. The approach of considering 15 immune age , phenotype, and chronological age of trial participants may improve clinical response 16 profiles and progress toward precision medicine -based strategies to prevent and reverse T1D . 17 20 METHODS 1 Study Design 2 Individuals were recruited from the general population and outpatient endocrinology clinics at the 3 University of Florida (UF; Gainesville, FL) , Nemours Children's Hospital (Orlando, FL) , and 4 Emory University (Atlanta, GA) . Following procurement of written informed consent, peripheral 5 blood samples were collected into the UF Diabetes Institute (UFDI) Study Bank from 826 non- 6 fasted participants by venipuncture . Samples were collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 7 (EDTA) -coated vacutainer tubes AAb measurement ; and sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate -coated tubes (BD Biosciences) for 10 rested blood glucose quantification . Samples were shipped or rested overnight in order to 11 standardize duration between collection and evaluation at UF (33). Data were collect ed from all 12 incoming blood samples to the UFDI from 2014 -2018, hence the lack of age -matching between 13 clinical subgroups based on clinical status . Importantly, participants had no reported infection or 14 malignancy at time of blood draw, and sample collectio n preceded the coronavirus disease 2019 15 (COVID -19) pandemic. Demographic and clinical information are presented in Table 1 . 16 Autoantibody Measurement 17 Islet Autoantibody Standardization Program (IASP) -evaluated ELISA s (93) were performed on 18 serum to measure T1D-associated A Ab reactive to glutamic acid 65 (GADA), 19 insulinoma -associated -2 (IA -2A), and zinc transporter -8 (ZnT8A) , which respectively 20 performed with AUROC s of 0.936, 0.876, and 0.917 in the most recent IASP workshop . REL and 21 CTR participants were considered RSK if possessing reactivity to at least two of the screened A Ab 22 specificities (27). 23 21 Flow Cytometry 1 Rested whole blood samples were stained with six flow cytometry panels , as we have previously 2 described (18, 32). Briefly, 200 \u00b5L of whole blood was incubated with antibodies (Table S 7) for 3 30 minutes at room temperature ( RT). Red blood cells (RBC) were lysed using 1-step Fix/Lyse 4 Solution (eBioscience) and cells washed with staining buffer. Data were acquired on an 5 LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences) within 24 hours of staining. Analys es were performed in FlowJo 6 software (v9 and v10 ; BD Life Sciences ) with gating strategies in Figure S1 -S6. 7 Complete Blood Count , HbA1c, and Blood Glucose Measurement 8 Rested whole blood samples w ere characterized using the Coulter AcT 5diff CP (Cap Pierce) 9 Hematology Analyzer HbA1c was measured with the DCA Vantage Analyzer 10 (Siemens) and rested blood glucose with the Contour N ext EZ glucometer (Bayer) . 11 CMV Status 12 A random subset (40.56 %) of the total flow cytometry cohort was assayed for evidence of prior or 13 primary CMV exposure by predicting serostatus from TRBV (TCR ) sequenc es (Adaptive 14 Biotechnologies) derived from PBMCs (94, 95) . CMV status was inferred using methods and 15 trained model described by Emerson et al. (96). Upon testing, predictions over 0.5 were deemed 16 CMV positive. Serostatus from a CMV IgG antibody ELISA (Zeus Scientific) was available for 17 71.04 % of all samples that w ere TCR sequenced from our cohort . We noted reliable concordance 18 between the two methods of CMV status classification, as evidenced by AUROC of 0.886 . In cases 19 of discrepancy (14.83 % of subjects with data from both assays ), CMV classification from ELISA 20 superseded the TCR data as the resul t used for further analysis. 21 Genotyping of T1D Risk Loci and Quantitative Trait Loci Analysis 22 22 Samples were genotyped using our custom UFDIchip single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array 1 (97, 98) , which includes the AxiomTM Precision Medicine Research Array (ThermoFisher 2 Scientific) , all content from the ImmunoChip.v2.0 (99), and previously reported credible T1D risk 3 variants (55). Quality contro l (QC) steps and QTL assessment were performed with plink 1.9 . T1D 4 GRS was calculated as previously established (97). 5 QC measures were performed prior to association testing, as previously described (100) . 6 Subjects were excluded from analysis i f any of the following conditions applied: >2% of directly 7 genotyped SNPs were missing , genetically -imputed sex did not match reported sex , or 8 heterozygosity rate differed \u00b13 standard deviations (SD) from the mean of all samples (2.91% of 9 subjects excluded based on these criteria) . Identity by descent (IBD) calculations were used to 10 remove related individuals with pi-hat >0.2 , randomly retaining one subject in each related p air 11 (101) , resulting in the exclusion of 40.56% of subjects . Genotypes at 277 previously curated T1D 12 risk loci (29-31) were pulled directly from the UFDIchip or if missing from the chip, obtained 13 from imput ation to 1000 Genomes Phase 3 (v5) or Human Reference Consortium (vr1.1) using 14 the Michigan Imputation Server (102) , with imputed genotypes from the reference cohort 15 providing the higher imputation quality used for QTL analysis (mean R2 = 0.952). SNPs that were 16 missing in >2% of subjects, with a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5%, or failing Hardy -Weinberg 17 equilibrium (HWE) at p<1e -6 were excluded. A linear regression analysis was performed using 18 plink (103) for genotype association with GAMLSS -corrected flow cytometric , clinical group (CTR or REL , RSK, T1D) and sex included as categorical covariates , and ten 20 multi dimensio nal scaling (MDS) components as continuous covariates to account for population 21 stratification. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing of genotypes and phenotypes to generate 22 a FDR using the Benjamini -Hochberg method with R/p.adjust. A volcano plot wa s created using 23 23 GraphPad Prism v7.0 depicting -log10(FDR) and the magnitude of the association between the 1 phenotype and the T1D risk allele (beta coefficient) (29-31). 2 Statistic s 3 Phenotype trajectories 4 Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD , and all tests were two -sided unless otherwise specified. 5 Technical and biological CV in the flow cytometric assay were assessed on a cohort of 12 samples 6 that were run in technical duplicate s using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0 . Spearman 7 correlation s between immune phenotypes and age were computed using R/pspearman . 8 For characterizing the flow cytometric phenotype dynamics over age in CTR and REL, 9 missing phenotype data due to failure of visual QC validation of staining (<5.03% of data per 10 phenotype) median -imputed . Smooth ing splines of each phenotype versus age were fit with 11 three deg rees of freedom using the smooth.spline R function (104) . 12 To model the dynamics o f each phenotype across age, we log transformed the imputed 13 data, addin g a constant equal to one or, for phenotypes with possible values less than 1, we added 14 an additional constant to shift all values larger or equal to zero. We then z -transform scaled each 15 phenotype prior to fitting a smoothing spline , as described above , across age with three degrees of 16 freedom. The smoothed trajectory predictions were restricted to a n age range of 5-75 years to avoid 17 predicting outside the observed age range of our other cohorts present . The phenotype trajectories 18 were then clustered using hierarchical clustering with the complete method and the Canberra 19 distance metric to group phenotypes with similar trajectory patterns over age. Heatmaps of 20 processed data from AAb - CTR and REL samples , ordered by subject age on the x -axis and 21 dendrogram c lustering on the y -axis, were created using R/gplots. R/ggplot2 and R/ggpubr were 22 used to create figures of overlaid s mooth splines of phenotypes for four clusters . The same 23 24 procedures were applied to obtain T1D phenotype trajectories, and the T1D smoothed trajectories 1 were plotted keeping the sa me y-axis order for comparison with age -related trajectories in CTR 2 and REL. 3 Comparing smooth trajectory fits 4 To compare the spline fits for the two cohorts (CTR and REL combined vs T1D) , we computed 5 the trajectory shift as the difference in the overall average trajectory value between cohorts. A t - 6 test was used to test for significant shifts for each of the four cluster s. To determine the initial 7 trajectory direction, for each phenotype in each cohort we calculated the mean value of successive 8 differences in the trajectory over years 5 -15, with a positive value indicat ing an increasing 9 trajectory and negative value a decreasing trajectory. W e estimated the number of times the 10 trajectories crosse d by examin ing the number of sign changes along the successive differences 11 across the entire age range obtained. 12 Immunophenotype age model 13 We used the random lasso (35) method on CTR to identify features associated with immune aging. 14 We first imputed missing values within each feature to its median and then z -transform scaled. 15 With chronological age as the response and all features as predictors, we repeated our random 16 lasso pr ocedure on 1,000 random train -test subsets with 80% of the individuals in a training set 17 and the remaining 20% as a held -out test set. The first stage of the random lasso consisted of 1,000 18 bootstrap samples of the training set, with each bootstrap estimat ing the coefficients on 15 -20% 19 randomly selected features . The initial variable importance score for all phenotypes was calculated 20 as the average coefficient value. The second stage of the random lasso used another 1,000 bootstrap 21 samples from the training set and 10% of the features were fit in a lasso model using the initial 22 importance score as the selection probability. For each data split, the overall variable importance 23 25 score was obtained by averaging the bootstrapped coefficients. A final variable importance score 1 represented the average of 1,000 random data splits. 2 Of the 192 features evaluated, 182 had non-zero average coefficients from the random lasso 3 procedure ; thus, we further implemented a procedure to obtain a n importance score cutoff. All 4 variables higher than our cutoff threshold were considered predictive of age. To determine the 5 optimal cutoff value, w e ran 5 -fold cross validation and evaluated the root mean squared error 6 (RMSE ) for each cutoff in the random lasso procedure . We estimated an elbow point per fold to 7 minimize RMSE. We repeated this 5 -fold cross validation 20 times , and the mean of elbow points 8 was the final cutoff. The final linear model is the averaged coefficients from the random lasso 9 models , which we then applied to the CTR , REL , and T1D cohorts to predict immunological age. 10 To internally validate our age prediction model, we similarly trained a random lasso model 11 on additional cohorts: 1) combined CTR and REL, 2) CTR younger than 30, and 3) CTR older 12 than 30 . 13 Age prediction within T1D and control subjects 14 A linear regression model of predicted age was fit on the chronological age and a factor for clinical 15 group (T1D versus combined CTR and REL ). We then fit a multivariable model of predicted age 16 on chronological age, sex, ethnicity, reported race, BMI percentile calculated as previously 17 described (105) , HbA1c, rested blood glucose, and GRS . Continuous variables were z -transform 18 scaled to obtain standardized coefficients. To ensure a sufficient number of individuals were 19 represented across groups, t he model was limited to subjects with reported race of African 20 American or Caucasian ( Table 1 ). 21 26 Within the T1D cohort, we again fit a multivariable model for the variables described above 1 in addition to disease duration and diagnosis age. Due to the correspondence in our cohort bet ween 2 diagnosis age and age at sampling time, delta age between chronological and predicted age was 3 not used as the outcome variable in this analysis . Instead, we used residuals determined from a 4 linear regression of predicted age and chronological age to explain factors associating with 5 differences between chronological and predicted age in T1D. The standardized multivariable 6 model was fit to the CTR and REL cohorts separately. 7 Adjusting for age using GAMLSS model 8 In order to obtain ag e-adjusted centiles of immunophenotypes in CTR and T1D cohorts, we 9 employed a weighted GAMLSS (41, 42) . In CTR and REL, each phenotype was modeled as a 10 cubic spline function of age using either a Box -Cox-t distribution or Normal distribution, 11 depending upon the skewness of the phenotype distribution. A skewness cutoff of 0.5 was 12 determined e mpirically, with distributions having skew larger than 0.5 fit using the Box -Cox-t 13 (BCT) distribution. For phenotypes using the BCT distribution, values were shifted by a constant 14 value to ensure positivity as necessary. Weights were assigned according to the age distribution 15 density such that ages younger than 10 years were assigned a relative weight of 10, ages older than 16 70 years were assigned a relative weight of 0.1, with all other ages assigned a weight of 1. We then 17 used the distribution function (pB CT or pNO) and the predicted parameter values from the 18 weighted GAMLSS model to obtain age -corrected quantile values for all individuals. We note two 19 exceptions to the above: 1) Memory Treg CD25 Index had a skewness of 0.54 but was better fit 20 using the Nor mal distribution, and 2) CXCR3hi (CD8 Temra) was fit using the unweighted 21 GAMLSS model (all weights equal to 1) due to errors using the weighted model. 22 Identifying T1D associated immunophenotypes 23 27 The age -corrected quantile values were used to compare T1D versus RSK, REL, and CTR 1 individuals. A non -parametric Kruskal Wallis test was performed for each phenotype followed by 2 a post -hoc Dunn's test Benjamini -Hochberg multiplicity 3 P-values<0.05 were considered significant. 4 Immunophenotype prediction model 5 We first imputed missing values within each phenotype to its median and then z -transform scaled 6 each phenotype. To handle correlations and dependencies in the ph enotypes, we used princip al 7 component analysis. The first 30 components were selected based on an elbow plot of explained 8 variance and used as predictors in generalized linear model of T1D versus CTR status. The 9 AUROC was averaged over 1,000 independent sa mplings of a n 80:20 train -test set split. 10 Comparison to IMM -AGE score 11 We applied the same approach described in Alpert et al. (26) to estimate an immune pseudotime 12 using the diffusion maps algorithm destiny. Specifically, we used the default options in the 13 DiffusionMap function in the R/destiny package on our phenotype matrix. 14 Study Approval 15 Participants provided written informed consent prior to study enrollment and sample collection, in 16 accordance with ins titutional review board (IRB) -approved protocols at the University of Florida , 17 Nemours Children's Hospital , and Emory University . 18 Data Availability 19 Flow cytometric data are available at ImmPort ( https://www.immport.or g, accession number: 20 SDY2299 ).
