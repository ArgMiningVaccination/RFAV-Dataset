NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE Naturopathic medicine is a distinct primary health care profession, emphasizing prevention and optimal health through the use of therapeutic methods and substances that encourage individuals' inherent self-healing process. The practice of naturopathic medicine includes modern and traditional, scientific, and empirical methods. The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae) Naturopathic medicine recognizes an inherent self-healing process in people that is ordered and intelligent. Naturopathic physicians act to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to facilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process. Identify and Treat the Causes (Tolle Causam) The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere) Naturopathic physicians follow three guidelines to avoid harming the patient: Utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat; Avoid when possible the harmful suppression of symptoms; and Acknowledge, respect, and work with individuals' self-healing process. Doctor as Teacher (Docere) Naturopathic physicians educate their patients and encourage self-responsibility for health. They also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. Treat the Whole Person Naturopathic physicians treat each patient by taking into account individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physicians encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. Prevention Naturopathic physicians emphasize the prevention of disease by assessing risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to disease, and by making appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness Though 20 U.S. States recognize Naturopathic Doctors as physicians, Missouri is not one of them. Dr. Hudson holds a license to practice Naturopathic medicine in the State of Kansas. For this reason she does not offer medical diagnoses or treatment and she strongly encourages you to maintain an active relationship with your primary care physician, which will help facilitate the work that she and you will do together. It is through the integration of traditional and conventional medical models that you can be cared for best. All recommendations discussed at your appointment with Dr. Hudson should be discussed with your doctor. "}
