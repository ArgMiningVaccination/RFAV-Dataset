INTRODUCTION I. Program Description and Relationship to System-Level Goals A. Briefly describe within a few paragraphs the degree program under consideration, including (a) level; (b) emphases, including concentrations, tracks, or specializations; (c) total number of credit hours; and (d) overall purpose, including examples of employment or education opportunities that may be available to program graduates. (a) Level: Masters (b) Emphasis: The program will be distinctive in that our goal is to specifically attract and recruit US military veterans, active duty m ilitary as well as civ ilian students to the program. As such, this program will be an important component to our Veterans Reintegration and Resilience initiative. The Physician Assistant (PA) program at USF will emphasize primary care and offer elective se quences in primary care, mental health management and technical and procedural based interventions. Specific curriculum will include content in understanding and influenci ng social and environmental determinants of health and how to support military culture and families - all in an active, clinically- relevant fashion. The USF PA program will also target st udents who are geographically bound to the Tampa Bay area and pending approval from the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant, Inc. (A RC-PA), we will also explore the ability to offer a decompressed first year curriculum offered via face-to-face and blended learning methodologies. (c) Credit hours: Total 103 credit hours: 39 credit hours plus 64 credit hours for clinical rotation weeks. (d) Overall purpose: With the impe nding physician shortages and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act with its emphasis on increased coverage and disease prevention, there will be a grea ter reliance on the services of mid-level providers such as physician assistants. As such, PA employment is expected to grow significantly between 2008-2018. Physician assistants wi th their generalist educa tion, commitment to team- based practice, and relatively short training are ideally positioned to address both the short-term and long-term needs of the Unite d States and the State of Florida. A PA program at the USF Morsani College of Medicine (MCOM) will help increase the number of licensed medical providers in Fl orida allowing for improved access to quality medical care for more Floridians. B. Describe how the proposed program is consistent with the current State University System (SUS) Strategic Planning Goals. Identify which specific goals the program will directly support and which goals the program will indirectly support. (See the SUS Strategic Plan at http://www.flbog.org/about/strategicplan/ ) January 7, 2013 3 This new PA program is fully aligned with several of the State University System Strategic Planning Goals. Specifically, this PA program will increase the number of degrees awarded in an existing critical needs STEM area by graduating 120 new PA graduates - when program is at full cap acity. With a wholly new curriculum which will emphasize the needs of active military a nd returning veterans and their families, we fully expect this program will meet the goal of becoming an academic program with state, national and or international preeminence and one which increases degree productivity and program efficiency by in cluding returning a dult students. By working closely with our VA partner hospitals and many community health providers this new program will meet the goals of increasing and strengthening the quality and recognition of commitment to community and business engagements. Further, because we will specifically target students who are current residents of the state, this program will likely see graduates who chose to remain in Florida after their education, thereby meeting the goa l of increased community and business workforce. This program is aligned with the USF system strategic plan goals of Academic Excellence, Student Access and Student Success, Impactful Research, Economic Leadership and Community Engageme nt and Increased Academic and Administrative Collaborations. C. If the program is to be included in an Area of Programmatic Strategic Emphasis as described in the SUS Strategic Plan, please indicate the category and the justification for inclusion. The Areas of Programmatic Strategic Emphasis: 1. Critical Needs: Health Professions The United States has long suffered from a shortage of primary care health professionals. The Association of Am erican Medical Colleges estimated the nation would have a shortage of approximately 21,000 primary care physicians by 2015. Without action, expe rts project a continued primary care shortfall due to the needs of an aging population, and a decline in the number of medical students choosin g primary care. Concomitant, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act expands coverage. There will be more patients waiting to see fewe r and fewer doctors. The Association of American Medical Colle ges projects that by 2015, in just three years, we'll be 63,000 (which includes the shor tage of primary care physicians) physicians short of the number we need. This number could double by 2025. Most experts believe that this shor tage can be alleviated, not just by having more physicians, but by having physicians work in teams with other less highly traine d specialists who can deliver good primary care January 7, 2013 4 such as physician assistants and nurses. A physician assistant is a healthcare professional who is authori zed by the state/pr ovince to practice medicine as part of a team with th e direct or, more commonly, indirect supervision of a physician. Not onl y can PAs help reduce the demand on primary care doctors, they can they can extend the reach of physicians. Further, because all PAs are trained as generalists, they're able to provide some of that coordination primary-care -like services even if they're in a specialty practice. It takes a long time to train a fully qualified physician. Training for PAs, however, is typically 24-30 months so PAs with a master's degree can enter the workforce more quickly. 2. Economic Development: Globalization Regional Workforce Demand According to Lisa Shock, CEO of Hillsborough-based Utilization Solutions in Healthcare, \"As millions more become insured through the efforts of healthcare reform, the question of who will treat these patients is a real concern. The United States ha s a deficit of nearly 40,000 primary care physicians, and this s ituation is expected to worsen as the population continues to age and as more patient s enroll in healthcare exchanges. Upcoming PA students will be viewed as valued professionals in the nation's future healthcare workforce and therefore eligible for increased financial support through the National Health Service Corps' scholarship and loan repayment programs. Tapping these health professionals' expertise and ability in a primar y care capacity will undoubtedly improve access to care and also promote workforce diversity.\" 11 This, coupled with research that suggests that the number of and availability of PA programs drives where a PA workforce is ge ographically distributed, leads to a compelling argument to add a PA educational program in the Tampa Bay area. 3 The occupational group with the mo st online ads in July 2012 (as compiled by the Help Wanted OnLineTM data series from The Conference Board) were healthcare practitione rs. Online job demand for STEM was strongest in the large metro ar eas, led by Hillsborough County, Miami- Dade County, Orange County, Browar d County, Palm Beach County, and Duval County. January 7, 2013 5 3. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) January 7, 2013 6 January 7, 2013 7 D. Identify any established or planned educationa l sites at which the program is expected to be offered and indicate whether it will be offe red only at sites other than the main campus. The program will be offered at the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine, on the Tampa (main) campus only. INSTITUTIONAL AND STATE LEVEL ACCOUNTABILITY II. Need and Demand A. Need: Describe national, state, and/or local da ta that support the need for more people to be prepared in this program at this level. Reference national, state, and/or local plans or reports that support the need for this program and requests for the proposed program January 7, 2013 8 which have emanated from a perceived need by agencies or industries in your service area. Cite any specific need for research and service that the program would fulfill. Nationally, employment of PAs is exp ected to increase 30% from 2010 to 2020 - much faster than the average for all o ccupations. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services maintains the National Provider Identifier (NPI) dataset, which listed approximately 70,000 practicing PAs in 2010. The estimate represents approximately 10,000 fewer practicing PAs than projections by the American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA) in a 2008 survey. 2 For job potential, Forbes rated physician assistant No. 1 a nd nursing No. 7 among master's degree programs.4 Physician assistants and nurses made the U.S. News and World Report list of the top 50 best careers, and physician assistant was ranked No. 9 among top jobs for working parents by CNN Money.5,6 Further, the median annual wage for physician assistant in May 2010 was reporte d as $86,410 by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. B. Demand: Describe data that support the assu mption that students will enroll in the proposed program. Include descriptions of surveys or other communications with prospective students. USF has a Pre-PA society with more than 30 active members and an active Facebook group showing 166 members under th e name \"Pre-Physician Assistant Society USF\". Faculty advisors in the USF College of Art and Sciences have indicated that many of the students they c ounsel are interested in a PA program and most all would be very intere sted in pursuing such a degr ee at USF if such a program became available. C. If substantially similar programs (generally at the four-digit CIP Code or 60 percent similar in core courses), either private or public exist in the state, identify the institution(s) and geographic location(s). Summarize the outcome(s) of communication with such programs with regard to the potential impact on their enrollment and opportunities for possible collaboration (inst ruction and research). In Appendix B, provide data that support the need for an additional program as well as letters of support, or letters of concern, from the provosts of other state universities with substantially similar programs. Type of Institution Geographic Location University of Florida Public, Non-Profit Gainesville NOVA Southeastern Private Ft. Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Fort Meyers Barry University Private Miami Shores, St. Petersburg, St. Croix, Virgin Islands Miami Dade Public, Non-Profit Miami South University Private, For-Profit Tampa Keiser University Private, For-Profit Ft. Lauderdale University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences Private St. Augustine January 7, 2013 9 The University of Florida is the only SUS School which o ffers a Master's degree in Physician Assistant Studies. As such, a letter from Stephen Klasko, Dean of the Morsani College of Medicine was sent to Dr. Michael Good, Dean of the University of Florida's College of Medicine in November 2012. The letter provided an overview of the proposed program as well as the key reasons USF is pursuing the development of a PA program. Dr. Klasko i ndicated he welcomed the opportunity to collaborate with Dr. Good on this and other initiatives. We have not received any feedback thus far. D. Use Table 1 in Appendix A (A for undergraduate and B for graduate) to categorize projected student headcount (HC) and Full Time Equivalents (FTE) according to primary sources. Generally undergraduate FTE will be calculated as 40 credit hours per year and graduate FTE will be calculated as 32 credit hours per year. Describe the rationale underlying enrollment projections. If, initia lly, students within the institution are expected to change majors to enroll in the proposed program, describe the shifts from disciplines that will likely occur. The enrollment projections show in Ta ble 1 of Appendix A reflect our goal and vision to primarily recruit students who are geographically bound to the Tampa Bay area - both for students who have recently graduated with a bachelor's degree from USF as well as students from agencies/i ndustries - particularly the military. We expect that less than half of all recrui ted students will be students who graduated from other Florida public unive rsities or who are from out-o f-state. We do not expect student within USF to change majors to enroll in the proposed program. E. Indicate what steps will be taken to achieve a diverse student body in this program. If the proposed program substant ially duplicates a program at FAMU or FIU, provide, (in consultation with the affected university), an analysis of how the program might have an impact upon that university's ability to attract students of races different from that which is predominant on their campus in the subject program. The university's Equal Opportunity Officer shall review this section of the proposal and then sign and date in the area below to indicate that the analysis required by this subsection has been reviewed and approved. We will advertise this program broadly throughout Florida and the US in all publications, including those that focus on student diversity and academic programs. This will include Diverse Issues in Higher Education (formerly Issues in Higher Education) http://www.diverseeducation. com/index.asp and Hispanic Outlook Magazine http://www.hispanicoutlook.com/. We also will utilize the Voice of Hispanic Higher Education magazine. For international and domestic students we will advertise in the International Edu cator magazine, the Chronicle of Higher Education, and the Connections ma gazine through EducationUSA. We will utilize the College's existing mark eting and recruitment strategies through professional associations and conferences and other mediums and venues, such as social networking, together w ith collaborating with other institutional Colleges and the Office of International Affairs to promote the program. We will utilize the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Un iversities, Florida/Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, Nationa l McNair Scholars Research Conference, January 7, 2013 10 the American Biomedical Research C onference for Minority Students and the Southern Regional Education Board meetings and programs. We will consult with USF's partnering internationa l institutions in China, the United Kingdom, India and the City of Knowledge in Panama. III. Budget A. Use Table 2 in Appendix A to display projec ted costs and associated funding sources for Year 1 and Year 5 of program operation. Use Table 3 in Appendix A to show how existing Education & General funds will be shifted to support the new program in Year 1. In narrative form, summarize the contents of both tables, identifying the source of both current and new resources to be devoted to the proposed program. (Data for Year 1 and Year 5 reflect snapshots in time rather than cumulative costs.) If the university intends to operate the program through continuing education on a cost-recovery basis or market rate, provide a rationale for doing so and a timeline for seeking Board of Governors' approval, if appropriate. The PA Program's I&R costs for year 1 are projected to be $1,501,843. The majority of the costs are estimated to come from personnel expenses (87%) with 5.10 Faculty FTE, 7.95 A&P FTE, and 1.00 USPS FTE being on board by June 1, 2015. We anticipate that E&G will be the sole funding source with Tuition bringing in $341,843 and new General Re venue funding being provided on a recurring basis equal to $8,000 per F TE at a program capacity of 145 FTE ($1,160,000). The E&G cost per FTE will be approximately $62k in year 1. By year 5, I&R costs are projecte d to be $3,923,665 which will support 17.48 Faculty FTE, 8.95 A&P FTE, and 1.50 USPS FTE on a continual basis. E&G is estimated to be the sole source of f unding with $3,652,686 of continuing base support (General Revenue and Tuition) a nd $270,979 being generated from expected tuition increases. B. If other programs will be impacted by a re allocation of resources for the proposed program, identify the program and provide a justification for reallocating resources. Specifically address the poten tial negative impacts that implementation of the proposed program will have on related undergraduat e programs (i.e., shift in faculty effort, reallocation of instructional resources, reduced enrollment rates, greater use of adjunct faculty and teaching assistants). Explain what steps will be taken to mitigate any such impacts. Also, discuss the po tential positive impacts that the proposed program might have on related undergraduate programs (i .e., increased undergraduate research opportunities, improved quality of instruction associated with cutting-edge research, improved labs and library resources). We believe that adding this program will add another health care related field of choice for students who are interested in h ealth care professions but who do not meet the more rigorous undergraduate science requirements for the MD degree program. We do not anticipate that any existing programs in the College of Medicine will be January 7, 2013 11 adversely impacted by the proposed program or that exiting e ducational activities will be impacted by any reallocation of resources. C. Describe other potential impacts on related programs or departments (e.g., increased need for general education or common prerequisite courses, or increased need for required or elective courses outside of the proposed major). There should be no impacts on related programs or departments in the Morsani College of Medicine. All accepted student s will be required to have completed a bachelor's degree. The program will be delivered by a number of existing USF Health faculty together with the recruitment of select ed new faculty. The proposed enrollment should not place undue burden on faculty commitment nor the institutional budget. D. Describe what steps have been taken to obtain information regarding resources (financial and in-kind) available outside the institut ion (businesses, industrial organizations, governmental entities, etc.). Describe the external resources that appear to be available to support the proposed program. We believe there may be various grant and sponsorship opportunities to assist with the funding of students and further devel opment of this new degree program. In August 2012, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sibelius announced $2.3 million in grants to train pr imary care physician assistants and help veterans transition from the military to civilian PA careers when they return home. While these awards have already been grante d, we believe that there will continue to be federal funding to help support this and other veteran's reintegration initiatives. Further, USF's Veterans Reintegration and Re silience initiative will be an invaluable asset to the new program. With its mission to provide the best care possible for our veterans and their families and a specific focus on the treatment of behavioral health disorders - one of the unique curricula elemen ts of this PA program, we believe this new PA program will become another st rong component to the USF Veteran's Reintegration Initiative. IV. Projected Benefit of the Program to th e University, Local Community, and State Use information from Tables 1 and 2 in Appe ndix A, and the supporting narrative for \"Need and Demand\" to prepare a concise statement that describes the projected benefit to the university, local community, and the state if th e program is implemented. The projected benefits can be both quantitative and qualitati ve in nature, but there needs to be a clear distinction made between the two in the narrative. There will be considerable benefit to th e Morsani College of Medicine (MCOM), USF Health and the University of South Florida with the development of this program. The USF MCOM PA program will support many of the SUS Strategic Planning Goals as well as the University's goal to increase the num ber of graduates in high work force demand fields - particularly STEM disciplines. Furthe r, this program will contribute to the Board of Governors' and USF goals to increase le vels of community and business engagement. This program will broaden our partnerships with our local VA affiliates, enhance our Veterans Reintegration and Resilience initia tive, and will strengthen our commitment and January 7, 2013 12 ties to the Villages Health System, Tamp a General Hospital, and our new ties with Lakeland Regional Medical Center. Physician assistants with their generalist e ducation, commitment to team-based practice, and relatively short training are ideally positioned to address both the short-term and long-term needs of the nation and the state of Florida. A PA program at the MCOM will help increase the number of licensed medical pr oviders in Florida allowing for improved access to quality medical care for more Floridians. Additionally, we would like to develop a \" bridge\" program for qualified applicants lacking necessary prerequisites as well as a pathway for incoming USF freshman to apply to a 4 + 2 program. This type of program will allow for a direct path for qualified freshmen to acquire the necessary academic prerequisites as well as obtain hands-on clinical experience that will prepare them for the rigors of the program. V. Access and Articulation - Bachelor's Degrees Only A. If the total number of credit hours to earn a degree exceeds 120, provide a justification for an exception to the policy of a 120 maximum and submit a separate request to the Board of Governors for an exception along with notification of the program's approval. (See criteria in Board of Governors Regulation 6C-8.014) Not applicable. B. List program prerequisites and provide assurance that they are the same as the approved common prerequisites for other such degree programs within the SUS (see the Common Prerequisite Manual at FACTS.org). The courses in the Common Prerequisite Counseling Manual are intended to be those that are required of both native and transfer students prior to entrance to the major program, not simply lower-level courses that are required prior to graduation. The common prerequisites and substitute courses are mandatory for all institution programs listed, and must be approved by the Articulation Coordinating Committee (ACC). This requirement includes those programs designated as \"limited access.\" If the proposed prerequisites are not listed in the Manual, provide a rationale for a request for exception to the policy of common prerequisites. NOTE: Typically, all lower-division courses required for admission into the majo r will be considered prerequisites. The curriculum can require lower-division courses th at are not prerequisites for admission into the major, as long as those courses are built into the curriculum for the upper-level 60 credit hours. If there are already common prerequisites for other degree programs with the same proposed CIP, every effort must be made to utilize the previously approved prerequisites instead of recommending an additional \"track\" of prerequisites for that CIP. Additional tracks may not be approved by the ACC, thereby holding up the full approval of the degree program. Programs will not be entered into the State University System Inventory until any exceptions to the approved common prerequisites are approved by the ACC. Not applicable. C. If the university intends to seek formal Limited Access status for the proposed program, provide a rationale that includes an analysis of diversity issues with respect to such a January 7, 2013 13 designation. Explain how the university wi ll ensure that community college transfer students are not disadvantaged by the Limi ted Access status. NOTE: The policy and criteria for Limited Access are identified in Board of Governors Regulation 6C-8.013. Submit the Limited Access Program Reque st form along with this document. Not applicable. D. If the proposed program is an AS-to-BS capstone, ensure that it adheres to the guidelines approved by the Articulation Coordinating Committee for such programs, as set forth in Rule 6A-10.024 (see Statewide Articulation Manual at FACTS.org). List the prerequisites, if any, including the specific AS degrees which may transfer into the program. Not applicable. INSTITUTIONAL READINESS VI. Related Institutional Mission and Strength A. Describe how the goals of the proposed program relate to the institutional mission statement as contained in the SUS Strategic Plan and the University Strategic Plan. The proposed PA program is fully aligned w ith the State Universi ty System Strategic Planning Goals of Access and Degree Production to: Meet Statewide Professional and Workforce Needs Build World-Class Academic Programs and Research Capacity Meet Community Needs Fulfill Unique Institutio nal Responsibilities. It will also respond to State University System (SUS) critical needs in health professions and regional workforce demands . The goals for PA program are a match with the USF system strategic plan goals in relation to: Achieving Academic Excellence Providing for Student Access and Student Success Insuring Impactful Research, Econo mic Leadership and Community Engagement Increasing Academic and Admi nistrative Collaborations. The PA program is being designed to meet and exceed the USF's goal to increase the number of graduates in high work fo rce demand fields - particularly STEM- Health disciplines. Further, the PA pr ogram will contribute to the Board of Governors' continuing focus on increasi ng the level of community and business engagement with a focus on Florida. This PA program will increase the number of degrees awarded in an existing critical needs STEM-Health area by graduating 120 ne w PA graduates each year- when the program is at full capacity. With a new curriculum which will emphasize the needs of active military and returning veterans and their families, USF fully expects this program will meet and exceed the goal of becoming an academic program with state, national and or international preeminence. The PA program affords the opportunity to provide returning adult students furt her their personal career growth through January 7, 2013 14 degree productivity and program efficiency. USF will continue to collaborate with our partners, such as the local VA hosp itals and many community health providers to provide excellent internship and clin ical experiences. The PA program will increase and strengthen the quality and recognition of a commitment to community and business engagements. USF is committed to specifically target students who are current residents of the State of Florida. The PA program is likely to create graduates who chose to remain in Florida after their education, thereby meeting the goal of an better educated health workforce. B. Describe how the proposed program specifically relates to existing institutional strengths, such as programs of emphasis, ot her academic programs, and/or institutes and centers. The USF MCOM PA program will build upon the already strong foundations of the medical, pharmacy, physical therapy and nur sing curriculums to provide the most advanced and focused PA education possible. Our curriculum will respond to the need to increase access to primary care pr oviders and we will also leverage USF Health's unique opportunity to use simulation for tr aining in technical and procedural based specialties. Students will be educated side by side with medical, physical therapy, pharmacy, nursing and othe r health care student s to develop inter- professional collaboration and communication skills that will allow them to become health care providers for our next genera tion. Our affiliations with Tampa General Hospital, two VA hospitals (James A. Hale y and Bay Pines) and our new partnership with Lakeland Regional Medical Center (the fifth largest hospital in Florida and the state's largest single-site emergency depa rtment) will provide many clinical rotation opportunities for these students. Further, the USF MCOM's close partnership with The Villages Health System will allow stude nts to dedicate time to learning about the unique issues affecting geriatric health care. C. Provide a narrative of the planning process leading up to submission of this proposal. Include a chronology (table) of activities, listing both university personnel directly involved and external individuals who participated in planning. Provide a timetable of events necessary for the implementation of the proposed program. Planning Process Date Participants Planning Activity January 2012 - March 2012 Monroe, Ekarius, Barber, Koehler, Strobbe Conducted initial demand and feasibility study April - June 2012 Monroe, Klasko, Ekarius, Petersen, Morrison-Beedy, Sneed, Quillen Discussion of potential USF PA program at USF Health Leadership Meeting Events Leading to Implementation January 7, 2013 15 Date Implementation Activity July 2012 - November 2012 Program planning and development October 2012 Initial discussion with MCOM Curriculum Committee and Graduate Education Council October 2012 MCOM Faculty Council October 2012 APPCC review and approval November 2012 MCOM Curriculum Committee and Graduate Education Council December 2012 Pending: Graduate Council Approval Pending: Academic Campus Environment (ACE) workgroup Pending: Review by ACE workgroup Pending: Review by Board of Trustees Pending: Review of Board of Governors Pending: Program implementation VII. Program Quality Indicators - Reviews and Accreditation Identify program reviews, accreditation visits, or internal reviews for any university degree programs related to the proposed program, especially any within the same academic unit. List all recommendations and summarize the institution's progress in implementing the recommendations. The MCOM PA program is currently listed on the ARC-PA website as an applicant program. Applicant programs are active in the development of PA programs, in preparation for entry into accreditation by th e ARC-PA via the provisional accreditation pathway. The ARC-PA has determined that the institutions listed meet the basic eligibility requirements to apply for accr editation, as noted in the accreditation Standards. They do not yet possess an accreditation status from the ARC-PA, nor is their listing here any guarantee that they will achieve provision al accreditation. Other institutions actively developing a PA program have chosen not to be listed at this point in time. A feasibility study/needs assessment and supporting documentation along with application materials submitted to (ARC-PA) is due in December, 2013. The ARC-PA site visit is currently scheduled for February 24-25, 2014. ARC-PA agenda meeting for accepting provisi onal applications is scheduled for September 2014. VIII. Curriculum A. Describe the specific expected student learni ng outcomes associated with the proposed program. If a bachelor's degree program, include a web link to the Academic Learning Compact or include the document itself as an appendix. Successful graduates of the USF MCOM PA Program will have completed a course of study following the guidelines set forth by A RC-PA and reflected in the Competencies for the Physician Assistant Profession. (http://www.nccpa.net/pdfs/definition% 20of%20pa%20competencies%203.5%20for%20 publication.pdf ). January 7, 2013 16 The competencies are a comprehensive document outlining the necessary skills, knowledge, judgment and attitudes develope d by representatives from the National Commission on Certification of Physician A ssistants (NCCPA), ARC-PA, the Physician Assistant Education Association (PAEA), and the American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA). The Competencies for the PA profession mirror and parallel the competencies utilized for graduate medical education, in general, a nd outlined in \"An Introduction to Competency- based Residency Education\" by the Accr editation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). The objectives and outcomes meas ured by the USF MCOM PA program closely mirror these competencies. Upon the successful completion of the requirem ents for the program of study leading to the MPAS degree, the student will be have demonstrated the following knowledge, skills, attitudes, emotional maturity, leadership skil ls and values across the life span and in multiple settings demonstrating the abili ty to function in a medical team. Medical knowledge Medical knowledge includes an understan ding of the physiological, molecular, biochemical, genetic and cellular systems n ecessary for normal function and associated with the abnormal function of these systems in various disease states.

For degree programs in the science and technology disciplines, discuss how industry- driven competencies were identified and incorporated into the curriculum and indicate whether any industry advisory council exists to provide input for curriculum development and student assessment. In 2003, the National Commission on Certif ication of Physician Assistants (NCCPA) initiated an effort to define PA competencies in response to similar efforts being conducted within ot her health care professions and growing demand for accountability and assessment in clinical pr actice. The NCCPA is the only certifying organization for physician assistants in th e United States. Established as a not-for- profit organization in 1975, N CCPA is dedicated to assuri ng the public that certified physician assistants meet established standa rds of clinical knowl edge and cognitive January 7, 2013 28 skills upon entry into practice and throughout their careers. All U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. terr itories have decided to rely on NCCPA certification as one of the cr iteria for licensure or regul ation of physician assistants. In 2004, representatives from three other na tional PA organizati ons, each bringing a unique perspective and valuable insights, jo ined NCCPA in the effort to define PA competencies. Those organizations were the Accreditation Re view Commission for Education of the Physician Assistan t (ARC-PA), the body that accredits PA educational programs; the A ssociation of Physician Assi stant Programs (APAP), the membership association for PA educators and program directors; and the American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA) , the national membership association representing PAs. The resultant document, Competencies for the Physician Assistant Profession, is a foundation from which each of those four organizations, other physician assistant organizations and educators can chart a cour se for advancing the competencies of the PA profession. It is these competencies that help form the substance of PA educational programs. http://www.nccpa.net/PAC/Competencies_home.aspx F. For all programs, list the specialized accreditation agencies and learned societies that would be concerned with the proposed program. Will the university seek accreditation for the program if it is available? If not, why? Provide a brief timeline for seeking accreditation, if appropriate. Accreditation Review Commission for E ducation of the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA) - accrediting agency that prot ects the interests of the public and physician assistant profession by defi ning the standards for physician assistant education and evaluating phys ician assistant educational programs within the territorial United States to ensure their compliance with those standards. Physician Assistant Education Associ ation (PAEA) - national organization representing physician assistant educa tional programs in the United States National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA) - national certifying organizat ion for physician assistants in the United States American Academy of Physician Assist ants (AAPA) - national membership association representing PA's. The MCOM MPAS program is currently listed on the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician A ssistant, Inc. (ARC-PA) website as an applicant program. Applicant programs ar e active in the development of PA programs, in preparation for entry in to accreditation by the ARC-PA via the provisional accreditation pathway. The ARC-PA has determined that the institutions listed meet the basic eligibility requireme nts to apply for accreditation, as noted in the accreditation Standards. They do not yet possess an accreditation status from the ARC-PA, nor is their listi ng here any guarantee that th ey will achieve provisional accreditation. Other institutions actively de veloping a PA program have chosen not to be listed at this point in time. January 7, 2013 29 A feasibility study/needs assessment and supporting documentation along with application materials submitted to (ARC-PA) is due in December, 2013. The ARC-PA site visit is currently scheduled for February 24-25, 2014. ARC-PA agenda meeting for accepting provisi onal applications is scheduled for September 2014. G. For doctoral programs, list the accreditation agencies and learned societies that would be concerned with corresponding bachelor's or master's programs associated with the proposed program. Are the programs accredited? If not, why? N/A H. Briefly describe the anticipated delivery system for the proposed program (e.g., traditional delivery on main campus; traditional delivery at branch campuses or centers; or nontraditional delivery such as distance or distributed learning, self-paced instruction, or external degree programs). If the propos ed delivery system will require specialized services or greater than normal financial s upport, include projected costs in Table 2 in Appendix A. Provide a narrativ e describing the feasibility of delivering the proposed program through collaboration with other univ ersities, both public and private. Cite specific queries made of other institutions with respect to shared courses, distance/distributed learning technologies, and joint-use facilities for research or internships. The program will be delivered in a traditional style utilizing a combination of classroom lectures, discussions, small group active learning sessions and hands-on laboratory skill sessions. On-line resources and non-traditional web-based learning modules will also be utilized to enhance student learning. An alternative primarily web-based learning option may be offered to non-traditional students to allow for self-paced learning prior to entering the clinical portion of the program. IX. Faculty Participation A. Use Table 4 in Appendix A to identify existing and anticipated ranked (not visiting or adjunct) faculty who will participate in the proposed program through Year 5. Include (a) faculty code associated with the source of funding for the position; (b) name; (c) highest degree held; (d) academic discipline or specialization; (e) contract status (tenure, tenure-earning, or multi-year annual [MYA]); (f) contra ct length in months; and (g) percent of annual effort that will be directed toward the proposed program (instruction, advising, supervising internships and practica, and supe rvising thesis or dissertation hours). PA faculty will teach a numb er of the courses in the PA curriculum, depending on their areas of specialty and their academic and professiona l interests. More than 300 physicians, PA's, basic science faculty and other health care professionals in the MCOM and College of Pharmacy will contribute to prepare and deliver classroom lectures in their areas of expertise to enhance inter-profe ssional educational opportunities. When a non-PA provides classroom instruc tion, a PA faculty member will attends the lecture, take notes, and write the exam questions directed toward the desired knowledge base of the physician assistant students. This concept will ensure that the classroom education and testing pr ovided to PA students remains at the level expected of physician assistants and also ensures continuity of coverage for all January 7, 2013 30 evaluation methodologies. By ARC-PA accreditation standards, a new PA program director will be hired at 1.0 FTE and an existing MD faculty member, Dr. Allan Goldman, will be the medical director for the program with .30 of his e ffort allocated to the program. In addition, several existing PA and MDs will teach in the new program. As is customary in PA training programs, we expect to recruit additional voluntary faculty from the community to assist w ith the clinical precepting performed during the clinical rotations. Like the MD program, it is ou r expectation that all of th e courses will be delivered by a team of qualified faculty members, c oordinated by a \"super\" course director. All faculty participating in the developmen t of the program are/will be selected for their expertise in the various areas of the basic and clinical medical sciences. B. Use Table 2 in Appendix A to display the costs and associated funding resources for existing and anticipated ranked faculty (as identified in Table 2 in Appendix A). Costs for visiting and adjunct faculty should be included in the category of Other Personnel Services (OPS). Provide a narrative summari zing projected costs and funding sources. By June 1, 2015, we expect to have 5.10 Faculty FTE on board and dedicated in some part to the new PA program. Of that first-year facu lty complement, we estimate that 1.50 of existing Faculty FTE w ill be reassigned to the PA program and 3.60 of new Faculty FTE to have been hire d and fully dedicated to the program for the 2015-16 academic year. By year 5, the progr am is expected to be at full capacity from an enrollment standpoint with 17.48 F aculty FTE. Approximately 5.60 Faculty FTE will be new hires that are fully dedi cated to the program and 11.88 Faculty FTE will be reassigned faculty from existing lines. We do not anticipate having any visiting or adjunct faculty supporting the progr am. E&G is expected to be the sole funding source of the program through Tuiti on collections and recurring General Revenue support from the state. C. Provide in the appendices the curriculum vitae (CV) for each existing faculty member (do not include information for visiting or adjunct faculty). D. Provide evidence that the academic unit(s) associated with this new degree have been productive in teaching, research, and service. Such evidence may include trends over time for average course load, FTE productivity, student HC in major or service courses, degrees granted, external funding attracted, as well as qualitative indi cators of excellence. The academic units affiliated with this degree have been very productive and interdisciplinary. The Morsani College of Medicine (MCOM), Nursing, and Public Health generate a substantial portion of the institution's research dollars (MCOM generates over 50% of USF's annual resear ch expenditures) and combined produce a significant proportion of the doctoral and masters graduates at USF. In the 2010- 2011 academic year, the University granted 453 doctoral degrees of which 53 (12%) were granted in the MCOM. In terms of Masters degrees, in the 2010-2011 academic January 7, 2013 31 year, USF granted 2511 M.S. degrees, of which 191 (8%) were awarded by the MCOM. MCOM graduates students in a timely fashion and is nationally competitive in time-to-degree metrics. The enrollment and graduation trends in USF Health have been very positive over the last few year s. In the MCOM, fall 2011 applications for Master's degree programs increased 46% over fall 2010 applications while applications for the Ph.D. program remained constant. X. Non-Faculty Resources A.

Describe additional library resources that are needed to implement and/or sustain the program through Year 5. Include projected costs of additional library resources in Table 3 in Appendix A. We have included some resources in the program budget to permit purchasing access to select on-line journals specially tailored to the profession of PA studies that are not currently accessible through the USF library system. January 7, 2013 36 C. Describe classroom, teaching laboratory, resear ch laboratory, office, and other types of space that are necessary and currently available to implement the proposed program through Year 5. Currently available classroom and office space are adequate to support the program. D. Describe additional classroom, teaching labora tory, research laboratory, office, and other space needed to implement and/or maintain the proposed program through Year 5. Include any projected Instruction and Research (I&R) costs of additional space in Table 2 in Appendix A. Do not include costs for new construction because that information should be provided in response to X (J) below. No additional classroom, laboratory or office space is required for the program. E. Describe specialized equipment that is curr ently available to implement the proposed program through Year 5. Focus primarily on instructional and research requirements. With similar medical and health care program s already in place, this program will be able to make use of our existing Center for Advance Clinical Lab (CACL) - where students receive clinical skills instruction a nd evaluation in a state of the art facility. Additionally, the Center for Advanced Me dical Learning and Simulation (CAMLS), a 90,000 square foot, state-of-the -art, three-story facility wi th every possible form of health professional education and training, for individuals and teams, under one roof, will also be able to be used for this program. CAMLS integrates simulation technology, team training, and evidence- based best practice into innovative programs with measurable outcomes. F. Describe additional specialized equipment that will be needed to implement and/or sustain the proposed program through Year 5. Include projected costs of additional equipment in Table 2 in Appendix A. With similar basic science and clinical pr ograms already in place, there should not be additional specialized equipment n eeded for instructional or research requirements. G. Describe any additional special categories of resources needed to implement the program through Year 5 (access to proprietary research facilities, specialized services, extended travel, etc.). Include projected costs of sp ecial resources in Table 2 in Appendix A. We do not anticipate that any additional spec ial resources will be required for this program. H. Describe fellowships, scholarships, and gradua te assistantships to be allocated to the proposed program through Year 5. Include the projected costs in Table 2 in Appendix A. Since 2009, the total institutional funding for medical student gran ts and scholarship increased while the dollar amount of inst itutional loans decreased. We are hopeful that this trend will continue and that the new PA program will be able to establish additional sources of grants and scholarshi ps to assist students with the costs of January 7, 2013 37 completing the program. I. Describe currently available sites for internship and practicum experiences, if appropriate to the program. Describe plans to seek additional sites in Years 1 through 5. USF Health and MCOM have a large number of existing clinical placements sites at Tampa General Hospital, James A. Haley a nd Bay Pines Veteran's hospitals and our new partnership with Lakeland Regional Me dical Center. We further expect to develop additional clinical placements s ites with new community sites - including with The Villages Health System. J. If a new capital expenditure for instructional or research space is required, indicate where this item appears on the university's fixed capital outlay priority list. Table 2 in Appendix A includes only Instruction and Research (I&R) costs. If non-I&R costs, such as indirect costs affecting libraries and student services, are expected to increase as a result of the program, describe and estimate those expenses in narrative form below. It is expected that high enrollment programs in pa rticular would necessitate increased costs in non-I&R activities. With similar basic science and clinical programs already in place, we do not anticipate new capital expenditures for inst ructional or research space nor do we anticipate the need for additional specialized equipment for instructional or research requirements. With respect to non-I&R costs, IT infras tructure and University Governance Support costs have been calculated - $38,000 the first year of the program, rising to $170,000 in year five of the program. All othe r costs for the program are direct and have been included in Table 2, Appendix A. References: 1.

Gest, PhD July, 2012 My primary interest is in innovative teaching methods for gross anatomy. I have taught gross anatomy at eight medical schools during my training and career, and consequently I have been exposed to a wide variety of teaching methods and styles. I used my teaching experience in directing the gross anatomy course at the University of Michigan Medical School for over a decade. During this period, the course reached the highest measures of success, with record levels of course and faculty evaluations as well as student performance, both on the course and on the Anatomy and Embryology component of NBME Step I. My interest in innovative teaching methods stretches beyond gross anatomy. At the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, I served the school as the Director of Computer Ass isted Instructional Development. I chaired the curriculum committee at a large medical school (Medical College of Georgia), which provided me insight into the broader vision of strategies, methods, and challenges in medical education. I have served as consultant for several medical schools on curriculum matters, and I am currently serving as Dean of Medical Education at a new medical school (St. Martinus, Curacao). Early in my career, I was able to obtain extramural support for the establishment of an anato mical museum and a plastination laboratory (at University of South Carolina). This plastination lab was one of the first such labs in the United States, and shortly thereafter I joined the University of Michigan, with one of my duties being the establishment of a plastination laboratory there. Together with Dr. Roy Glover, who became the director of this pastination lab, we established one of the largest and most widely recognized plastination facilities in the U.S. One focus of my work has been learning technology, beginning at the dawn of the personal computer and laserdiscs up to the present day use of web-based learning, streaming video, and all forms of synchronous and asynchronous online education. Together with Dr. Pat Tank, we established the first major installation of computers within a gross anatomy laboratory (at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences) as well as the largest web site for gross anatomy in the world at that time. Thereafter, I joined the University of Michigan again to accomplish similar goals. Shortly after rejoining Michigan, it became one of the only schools in the world with computers at every dissection table. I have continued web site development through the years at Michigan so that the Michigan anatomy web site (http://anatomy.med.umich.edu) is considered the most complete web sites for gross anatomy in the world. In my current role as director of gross anatomy at USF, I am in the process of establishing an anatomy web site to eclipse the site I built at Michigan. I have endeavored to enhance online anatomy offerings with easy access of resources, such as online access to two atlases (Netter and LWW), and innovative uses of technology, such as cadaver medical histories with full-body CT scans and donor-based clinical cases. I have been active in reporting the results of these educational research projects. By utilizing fifteen years of recorded grades, faculty evaluations, and course evaluations, I have been able to analyze the 92Gest, T.R., CV 16 11/28/12 effects of certain innovative teaching techniques, such as computer learning modules and reduced or eliminated lectures. I served as Director of Anatomical Donations for the University of Michigan Medical School for over a decade. During this time, we instituted many innovations, such as a sophisticated database and barcoding system, that have made our program one of the leading such programs in the nation. Our annual memorial service, attended each year by near ly 1,000 people, has been used as a model for such services at other schools. I am currently the only member of the Anatomical Services Committee of the American Association of Clinical Anatomists from the southeastern US. This committee is delving into national guidelines and policies for willed body programs. Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to receive a number of teaching awards from medical schools and medical students. During my five years at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, I won five Golden Apple Awards, and in 2003, I received the ultimate teaching honor in the form of the University of Michigan Golden Apple Award, thereby becoming the first and only medical school faculty member to receive this university- wide award. Other research interests on which I continue to publish articles include the study of anatomical variations, the development of vascular patterns using corrosion casting, anatomical terminology, and innovative teaching techniques in anatomy. Over the years, I have been active in the American Association for Clinical Anatomists, and as Council Member these last four years, I given my time and energy to promote and facilitate the functions of the Association to benefit all of its members. As Co-Editor of our association's journal, Clinical Anatomy, I assist in efforts to extend the quality of this publication. As Chair of the Educational Affairs Committee, I strove to bring current educational issues into focus and discussion at our meetings and through the AACA web site and listserv during the year. I have served on the Anatomical Services and Clinical Anatomical Terminology Committees as well as several ad hoc committees. A primary focus of my recent intellectual pursuits has been editorial work and textbook development. I am Co-Editor of Clinical Anatomy, and Chief Editor for anatomy for eMedicine, published by WebMD. I wrote several books prior to co-authoring the LWW Atlas of Anatomy with Dr. Pat Tank. Dr. Ben Pansky and I have completed two textbooks for anatomy, we are currently working on the third volume of a three volume set of textbooks for gross anatomy. I find textbook creation to be a stimulating and satisfying endeavor, and I currently have a number of projects in developmen t. My philosophy of education is to present students with opportunities for self-directed learning that have been developed to allow them to acquire knowledge on their own terms. My approach to teaching and learning shifts emphasis from a faculty-centric, lecture intensive environment to a student-centered learning environment in which students learn at their own pace and faculty support and facilitate their efforts. Because physicians must also be competent communicators and teachers with their patients, I have worked to encourage the development of these skills through peer teaching activities. For gross anatomy, I have emphasized learning through dissection, since the gross lab provides a perfect small group, problem-solving learning environment, as well as giving the proper environment for learning clinical relevance in an applicable context. 93CURRICULUM VITAE STEVEN B.
