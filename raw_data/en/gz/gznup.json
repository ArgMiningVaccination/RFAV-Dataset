We used World Health Organization China Study on Global Aging and Adult Health Wave 1 data to determine descriptive statistics of the study population of participants aged 50 years and over. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted controlling for sociodemographic and health factors. A total of 14% of participants utilized a TCM practitioner, and the prevalence of utilization varied significantly by locality. Utilization was more likely in participants living in rural areas [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 12.96; p < 0.001], Hubei (OR = 7.17; p < 0.001), or Shandong provinces (OR = 4.21; p < 0.001) and being diagnosed with chronic lung disease (OR = 1.97; p = 0.005). Hence, rurality, provincial influence, and chronic lung diseases are significant factors associated with TCM practitioner utilization among older individuals in China. These findings may inform policy for preservation and development of TCM nationally as well as its sustainability in an increasingly aging society.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2019-08-25", "cleaned_text": "Utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners in Later Life in Mainland China [https://doi.org/10.3390/geriatrics4030049](https://doi.org/10.3390/geriatrics4030049) [Healthy Aging](/journal/geriatrics/sections/healthy_aging)) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-geriatrics-04-00049)]. The aging population has placed greater strain on health services, especially for chronic diseases, necessitating the need for later-life health and medicine research [ [2](#B2-geriatrics-04-00049)]. In LMICs, traditional medicines and its practitioners are considered an important resource for population health by being perceived to be more affordable, accessible, and culturally acceptable to the communities when compared to modern medicine [ [3](#B3-geriatrics-04-00049), [4](#B4-geriatrics-04-00049)]. Several studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of traditional medicine utilization in older individuals of diverse ethnic backgrounds [ [3](#B3-geriatrics-04-00049), [5](#B5-geriatrics-04-00049), [6](#B6-geriatrics-04-00049)]. [7](#B7-geriatrics-04-00049)]. The health care system of mainland China is unique in that western medicine (WM) and traditional medicine are practiced concurrently at all levels [ [8](#B8-geriatrics-04-00049)]. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) approaches are typically used for improving the immune system and prevention of chronic diseases, while WM is used for acute diseases. [9](#B9-geriatrics-04-00049)]. In Mao's era of post-liberation, around 80% of the elderly were living rurally, predominantly agricultural farmers dependent on their children for financial support and care [ [10](#B10-geriatrics-04-00049)]. In the 1960s and 1970s, a free and basic public health system was introduced and built up in all rural areas where immunization services were free. The barefoot doctor program set up during this era was regarded, both inside and outside of China, as a low-cost solution built around easily available indigenous (Chinese herbal) medicines that were more affordable compared to WM. As there was a gradual increase in WM knowledge, WM was integrated into medical practice with TCM [ [11](#B11-geriatrics-04-00049)]. [11](#B11-geriatrics-04-00049)], and barefoot doctors became private medical practitioners. Because no fees were usually charged for consultations and examinations, village clinics became dependent on profits from pharmaceutical sales to maintain daily operations. Prescribing western pharmaceuticals became even more popular [ [11](#B11-geriatrics-04-00049)]. [12](#B12-geriatrics-04-00049)]. The same qualifying examination is required to be a licensed TCM practitioner [ [12](#B12-geriatrics-04-00049)]. In 2006, there were 166,614 TCM practitioners in hospitals and 7843 TCM practitioners in community health centers [ [12](#B12-geriatrics-04-00049)]. Today, TCM practitioners make up around 12% of all licensed doctors [ [12](#B12-geriatrics-04-00049)]. According to the national health statistics in China, the knowledge structure of candidates for the Excellent Village Doctor Award in China were 69% (Western) and 27.2% (Chinese) in 2005, which has changed to 73.5% (Western) and 25.5% (Chinese) in 2010, showing an increasing trend of village doctors with WM knowledge in rural China [ [13](#B13-geriatrics-04-00049)]. [7](#B7-geriatrics-04-00049)]. Despite what has been argued as a cultural shift towards WM in the general population as a result of westernization and urbanization, the more affordable TCM and TCM practitioners remain widely utilized in rural areas, particularly for chronic diseases [ [14](#B14-geriatrics-04-00049)]. According to the China Health Statistics Yearbook 2018, there are 2641 million visits to Chinese traditional medicines (TCM) practitioners in the year 2017, which is about 32.3% of total visits to medical practitioners [ [15](#B15-geriatrics-04-00049)]. The number and proportion of visits to TCM practitioners in China had increased from 1945 million and 28.2% in the year 2012 to 2642 million and 32.3% in the year 2017, respectively [ see [Appendix A](#app1-geriatrics-04-00049) [Table A1](#geriatrics-04-00049-t0A1)). [9](#B9-geriatrics-04-00049), [16](#B16-geriatrics-04-00049)]. Furthermore, only one national study has focused on older individuals, using data from China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) to estimate 19.3% of the population utilizes TCM [ [16](#B16-geriatrics-04-00049)]. In regional areas around mainland China, varying prevalence have also been recorded [ [17](#B17-geriatrics-04-00049), [18](#B18-geriatrics-04-00049)]. A systematic review also found that perception of TCM varies between regions, with some viewing TCM as a basis for self-care and others as a method of symptom control and recuperation or synergistic use with WM [ [4](#B4-geriatrics-04-00049)]. While these studies may suggest the significance of regional differences in TCM utilization, as of yet, no national study, including different regions, has assessed this. [9](#B9-geriatrics-04-00049)]. [19](#B19-geriatrics-04-00049), [20](#B20-geriatrics-04-00049)]. These findings may also more broadly inform the emerging agenda of healthy aging in other LMICs. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data [9](#B9-geriatrics-04-00049)]. 2.2. Covariates [21](#B21-geriatrics-04-00049)] and literature [ [9](#B9-geriatrics-04-00049)] to control for predisposing factors (age, gender, marital status), enabling factors (education, income quintile, rurality, provinces), and need (self-reported health, chronic diseases, smoking, and drinking behaviors). However, due to a high correlation between self-reported health and the prevalence of chronic diseases, we omitted self-reported health from our final modeling analysis. Health covariates were assessed in the variables of alcohol use, tobacco use at time of the interview, and diagnosis of several major chronic diseases [ [9](#B9-geriatrics-04-00049), [16](#B16-geriatrics-04-00049), [17](#B17-geriatrics-04-00049)]. Every covariate had a 'don't know' or 'not applicable' response options, which were omitted from the analysis. 2.2.1. Demographics 2.2.2. Health and Health Behaviors 2.2.3. Definition of TCM Use [16](#B16-geriatrics-04-00049), [22](#B22-geriatrics-04-00049)]. Previous studies have defined TCM use in the context of the data collected. Some studies have defined TCM use broadly including the consumption of traditional Chinese herbs, herbal products, and utilization of therapies, such as acupuncture, massage, and cupping [ [16](#B16-geriatrics-04-00049), [17](#B17-geriatrics-04-00049), [22](#B22-geriatrics-04-00049), [23](#B23-geriatrics-04-00049), [24](#B24-geriatrics-04-00049)]. Other studies have defined TCM use with regards to visiting a TCM health care provider, such as a TCM practitioner [ [9](#B9-geriatrics-04-00049), [18](#B18-geriatrics-04-00049), [25](#B25-geriatrics-04-00049), [26](#B26-geriatrics-04-00049)]. Due to the available data in SAGE collected in this study, the use of TCM in this study was defined concerning a visit to a TCM practitioner () in the most recent three visits of health care providers in the past 12 months. 2.3. Statistical Analysis [Table 1](#geriatrics-04-00049-t001). In multivariate analysis, Model 1 included sociodemographic covariates and locality (both urban/rural residence and provinces) but excluded health covariates (health behaviors and chronic diseases); Model 2A included all covariates except for province, and Model 2B included all covariates (as our final model). The inclusion and exclusion of different variables in different models enabled us to check the robustness of our results. 3. Results 3.1. Descriptive Statistics [Table 1](#geriatrics-04-00049-t001). A total of 14% of the participants utilized a TCM practitioner. No significant differences in the prevalence of TCM practitioner utilization between sex or age groups were observed. A significantly higher prevalence was observed in participants that never married (31.3%) compared to other marital statuses. Prevalence of TCM practitioner utilization was similar between income quintiles one to four, which were all significantly higher than in the wealthiest quintile five (4%). Significantly higher prevalences were seen in primary (17%) and secondary educated (9.3%) participants compared to those tertiary educated (2.4%). 3.2. Multivariate Analysis [Table 2](#geriatrics-04-00049-t002)), only income quintile, locality, and province covariates were significant. Living in a rural region [odds ratio (OR) = 13.54; p < 0.001], or in Shandong or Hubei provinces, was highly significantly associated with TCM practitioner utilization (ORs ranging from 3.65 to 6.67; p < 0.001), while TCM practitioner utilization was significantly less associated with living in Shaanxi, Yunnan, or Zhejiang provinces (ORs ranging from 0.16 to 0.26; p 0.002). [Table 2](#geriatrics-04-00049-t002), controlling for all covariates, age group, sex, and income quintiles lost significance, while rurality remained highly significant (OR = 12.96; p < 0.001). Living in Hubei (OR = 7.17; p < 0.001) or Shandong (OR = 4.21; p < 0.001) was significantly associated with higher TCM practitioner utilization, while living in Shaanxi (OR = 0.27; p < 0.001), Yunnan (OR = 0.24; p = 0.004), or Zhejiang (OR = 0.16; p = 0.001) was significantly associated with lower TCM practitioner utilization, and this was consistent to the estimates in Model 1. Among the disease diagnoses, having chronic lung disease was the only diagnosis that remained significantly associated (OR = 1.97; p = 0.005) with higher TCM practitioner utilization. No significant association was found between TCM practitioner utilization and smoking or drinking behaviors. 3.3. Robustness Check [Table 2](#geriatrics-04-00049-t002)was run again but replacing the original province covariate with Hubei, Shandong, and the two grouped provinces. The coefficient estimates for Hubei and Shandong remained robust (OR = 13.34 and 7.73, respectively) when compared to the estimated coefficients of model 2B in [Table 2](#geriatrics-04-00049-t002)(OR = 7.17 and 4.21, respectively). [Table 3](#geriatrics-04-00049-t003)). The highest proportions of TCM practitioner utilization were observed in rural Hubei and rural Shandong (57% and 39.5%, respectively) when compared to other areas (less than 6%). These regions also had higher proportions of tobacco use (46.4% and 41.2%, respectively) compared to the rural areas of the grouped provinces (less than 40%). Rural Hubei had a higher proportion of older individuals in the lowest two income quintiles, while urban Hubei and rural Shandong had a higher proportion of older people in quintiles three and four. Additionally, Hubei and the grouped low income provinces (Jilin, Shaanxi, and Yunnan) had a higher proportion of chronic lung diseases in both urban and rural areas (8.8% in rural Hubei, and 11% and 8.2% in urban and rural areas of the grouped low income provinces when compared to 8.5% and 6.9% in the urban and rural areas of the grouped high income provinces). The higher proportion of using tobacco is likely to lead more lung diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), for which the traditional Chinese medicines were perceived to be more effective than the western pharmaceuticals (such as for coughing, having the flu or fever, etc.). 4. Discussion [9](#B9-geriatrics-04-00049)]. However, the significance at the provincial level, including Shandong or Hubei provinces, has not been previously assessed. [9](#B9-geriatrics-04-00049), [16](#B16-geriatrics-04-00049)]. Oyebode et al. (2016), also using the SAGE China dataset, estimated a lower 9.4% national prevalence, and this difference is likely attributable to our analysis focusing on older populations aged 50 and over [ [9](#B9-geriatrics-04-00049)]. Liu et al. (2015), using CHARLS data, had a higher estimate of 19.3% for individuals 45 and older. However, TCM utilization was defined more broadly including personal use of TCM herbs, herbal products, and practices additional to practitioner utilization, such as moxibustion, and Chinese massage [ [16](#B16-geriatrics-04-00049)], while such data was not collected in the SAGE China dataset. [9](#B9-geriatrics-04-00049)]. There are known disparities in the self-reported health and health outcomes between urban and rural provinces in mainland China [ [27](#B27-geriatrics-04-00049)]. These disparities may be reflective of fewer specialized WM healthcare options in rural areas, resulting in most health treatment administered by TCM practitioners, stemming from the historical use of TCM as a low-cost alternative in mending a broken healthcare system in rural areas [ [10](#B10-geriatrics-04-00049), [28](#B28-geriatrics-04-00049)]. These disparities could also be, in part, explained by poorer health behaviors in terms of tobacco use, alcohol consumption, diet, and physical inactivity observed in rural residents compared to urban residents [ [29](#B29-geriatrics-04-00049)]. Our robustness tests confirmed that there were higher proportions of tobacco use in Hubei and Shandong areas, which are also regions with major tobacco planting areas. These local contexts may be important in explaining our finding of the significance of chronic lung diseases in TCM practitioner utilization, and this was consistent with Liu et al.'s (2015) findings as TCM is preferred over WM in treating chronic conditions due to fewer side effects [ [4](#B4-geriatrics-04-00049), [16](#B16-geriatrics-04-00049)]. Chronic lung disease has also been well defined in TCM practice [ [30](#B30-geriatrics-04-00049)]. [9](#B9-geriatrics-04-00049), [16](#B16-geriatrics-04-00049)]. Income quintile three and four were also significant before controlling for province, which is consistent with a study that suggested relatively higher socioeconomic districts within Hubei province were associated with higher TCM use [ [25](#B25-geriatrics-04-00049)]. Although education and sex were found to be significantly associated with TM use for Beijing, Taiwan, and Hong Kong in literature [ [13](#B13-geriatrics-04-00049), [14](#B14-geriatrics-04-00049), [19](#B19-geriatrics-04-00049), [21](#B21-geriatrics-04-00049)], we did not find significant associations for these covariates after controlling for other socioeconomic, health, and locality variables at later life in China. [3](#B3-geriatrics-04-00049), [4](#B4-geriatrics-04-00049), [5](#B5-geriatrics-04-00049)]. While Oyebode et al. (2016) also used SAGE China survey data, they focused on all age groups and controlled for both self-reported health and chronic diseases in their logistic regression model, and sex and education were not included in their models [ [9](#B9-geriatrics-04-00049)]. This study improved estimations by including sex and education while excluding self-reported health from the multivariate regression as older individuals with chronic diseases are generally more likely to report bad health [ [7](#B7-geriatrics-04-00049)]. [31](#B31-geriatrics-04-00049)], there may likely have been underreporting or undiagnosed participants in our dataset on the prevalence of depression. A large-scale national study focused on mental health found that a higher statistic of 2.4% of participants had depressive symptoms [ [32](#B32-geriatrics-04-00049)], while in our study, less than 1% of all participants were diagnosed. [12](#B12-geriatrics-04-00049), [33](#B33-geriatrics-04-00049)]. Additionally, in a study of outpatients at Fudan University's Shanghai Cancer Center, the most common form of TCM use was the use of tonics and Chinese herbal products, which can be sourced independently of visiting a TCM practitioner [ [4](#B4-geriatrics-04-00049), [23](#B23-geriatrics-04-00049), [34](#B34-geriatrics-04-00049)]. TCM practitioner utilization may also be inadequately captured in the three most recent health care provider visits defining our study population. Consequently, the national statistic this study estimates may underestimate both the true prevalence of TCM practitioner utilization and TCM use. Another limitation was that the data did not include reasons for TCM practitioner utilization that may have provided further insight into covariate associations. [35](#B35-geriatrics-04-00049)]. The integrated licensing system and utilization of TCM and WM in China could inform the integration of traditional medicine and WM in other LMICs [ [10](#B10-geriatrics-04-00049), [12](#B12-geriatrics-04-00049), [14](#B14-geriatrics-04-00049)]. However, the clinical efficacy of the integrated approach using WM and traditional approaches to prevent and treat diseases need to be further investigated and evaluated carefully.
