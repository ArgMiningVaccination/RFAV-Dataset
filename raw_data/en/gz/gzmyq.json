The Reason Could Be COVID-19 A rise in negative online reviews of scented candles might reflect one of the weirder symptoms of COVID-19. You've just received some holiday-themed candles, so you strike a match and then settle back to enjoy the lovely scents of cinnamon and pine. But eventually you realize that what you smell is .... nothing. Is it a manufacturing snafu or could this be an early warning sign of [COVID-19](/infectious-diseases/covid-19/)? It was the latter possibility that intrigued Portland, Oregon-based science illustrator Terri Nelson, enough that she began looking at online reviews of scented candles. She found plenty of evidence that something was amiss. [Writing on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TerriDrawsStuff/status/1331362372179554304) in late November, she noted, \"There are angry ladies all over Yankee Candle's site reporting that none of the candles they just got had any smell at all. I wonder if they're feeling a little hot and nothing has much taste for the last couple days too.\" Fever and loss of the ability to taste and smell can be symptoms of COVID-19. An observation too quirky to pass up, Nelson's comment sparked the interest of Kate Petrova, a research assistant with the Harvard Study of Adult Development at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. She decided to do what she calls \"a fun exercise at data visualization\" and began to crunch the numbers, analyzing about 20,000 Amazon reviews for scented and unscented candles.

Petrova's data shows that the top-rated candles fell by one full star compared with previous years \u2014 a decline not shared by unscented candles on the Amazon site. There was also a 4 percent bump in reviews that included phrases like \"no scent\" or \"can't smell.\" \"These numbers may not seem like much, but the trajectory of no-scent reviews over the last 11 months is certainly an interesting one,\" Petrova notes. In an attempt to see if the phenomenon extended to other countries, a PhD student named Moritz Wagner at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine did a quick search through the Amazon UK site for perfume. He found that of the 10 most highly rated scents \u2014 including Boss, Calvin Klein, Vera Wang, and Paco Rabanne \u2014 all showed rating declines in the past year. Of course, these are not true studies, Petrova says, adding that more work will need to be done to determine if there's an association between COVID-19 cases and negative reviews of scented products. But it's possible that keeping track of how well you smell might give you an early warning that you have COVID-19.

[Omid Mehdizadeh, MD](https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/759045-omid-benjamin-mehdizadeh), an otolaryngologist and laryngologist at the Pacific Eye, Ear, and Skull Base Center at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Los Angeles, has some thoughts on why COVID-19 can, for some people, lead to a loss of smell and taste. \"Viruses in general have been known to cause postinfectious loss of smell and taste,\" he says. \"We don't know exactly why, but it's likely due to changes in your olfactory bulb, in the front of the brain.\" Nerve fibers that connect your brain to your nose may become inflamed when you have a virus, he says. It's also possible that a certain type of cell \u2014 called a sustentacular cell \u2014 can begin to die off when the nerves related to your olfactory system are negatively affected by a virus like the novel coronavirus, says Dr. Mehdizadeh. When that happens, it takes a while for new cells to replace them. For some people, that might mean a few weeks, but for others, it could be months. \"Some people with the flu can lose their sense of smell for six to eight months,\" Mehdizadeh says. \"With COVID, we don't know yet. Some people who had the virus early on still haven't regained the ability to smell.\" RELATED: [Meet the COVID-19 \"Long Haulers\"](https://www.everydayhealth.com/coronavirus/meet-the-covid-19-long-haulers/) Why Losing Your Sense of Smell Is a Real Problem Although loss of smell is a much more modest concern than other symptoms like being able to breathe properly, it can be more than just a bummer, Mehdizadeh says. \"We see people lose their appetite, so nutrition becomes a problem, and of course, smell warns us that something is wrong, like in the case of spoiled food, smoke, or a gas leak,\" he says. \"But it's also a quality of life issue. You don't know how much you enjoy your sense of smell until it's gone, even temporarily.\" The takeaway? If you've got some scented candles, this could be a good time to light them. And then maybe leave a good review online. "}
