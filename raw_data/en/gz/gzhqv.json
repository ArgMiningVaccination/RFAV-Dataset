In addition, the company and the communities are undertaking a proactive education campaign to provide as much information as possible so everyone can make an informed decision. Americare has partnered with CVS and Walgreens was part of the federal roll-out program, depending on which pharmacy is more convenient for each facility. Clinics will be established for administering the vaccine at each community and all residents and family members will be communicated with directly about those arrangements. Because the vaccine requires two doses administered approximately 21 to 28 days apart, each community will have two clinic dates set. The educational outreach initiated by Americare in its communities to its residents and their families includes frequently asked questions about the vaccine components, the safety and path to approval, side effects, who can get the vaccine, procedures for vaccinations at each facility, and recommended continued safety procedures after the vaccine is received. \"Since this pandemic began last spring, Americare has taken an aggressive stance in protecting our residents and communicating openly with them and their families,\" says Clay Crosson, President and Chief Operating Officer for Americare. \"We are approaching the vaccine availability and administration with a proactive level of preparation and communication as well. We want to make sure everyone has all of the information required and that each facility is in a state of readiness.\" Even after the vaccine is administered Americare will continue to take all necessary precautions, including wearing of personal protective equipment, and conducting regular testing and temperature checks. Each community will work with public health officials to determine how and when to adjust policies for visitations and social activities after vaccines are administered.

Contacts: 10/5/20: Americare Communities Across the Country Are Active Hosts and Participants in Active Aging Week, October 5 through October 11 The Americare Focus is on Balanced Aging Across Seven Dimensions of Wellness October 5, 2020 (Sikeston, MO) \u2014 Across its communities in Missouri, Kansas, Tennessee, Illinois, and Mississippi, Americare will be an active host and participant in the Active Aging Week (AAW) from October 5 through 11, sponsored by the International Council on Active Aging. AAW is a celebration of all the amazing things older adults do. While exact activities will be customized to each Americare Community, each one will celebrate and focus on the company theme of Balanced Aging. \"We believe that the blueprint for wellness as a person ages is a balance between physical, emotional and spiritual focuses and activities that allow each individual to stay as active and engaged as possible for as long as possible,\" said Mary Eaves, Vice President of Americare and leader of the company Active Aging Week. \"We have a program across our facilities called Balance Academy that is designed to help seniors reduce falls by improving balance and improving confidence. As we thought about Active Aging Week this year, we thought the theme of 'Balance' was perfect, but expanded it to seven areas of focus.\" Each community will have programs and activities that address one or more of the seven dimensions of wellness - Physical, Emotional, Social, Intellectual, Spiritual, Environmental and Vocational. \"Through programs like this, we are evolving the care experience from being a Care Community who provides wellness to a Wellness Community who provides care,\" added Eaves. Physical Wellness promotes participation in personal safety and activities for cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, balance and flexibility. This is a multifaceted dimension relative to ability and disability. Emotional Wellness promotes awareness and acceptance of one's feelings and the degree to which an individual feels positive and enthusiastic about self and life. It involves the capacity to manage feelings and behaviors, self-acceptance, and coping with stress and life's challenges. Social Wellness promotes creating and maintaining healthy relationships. It enhances interdependence with others and nature and encourages the pursuit of harmony and feelings of connectedness. Intellectual Wellness promotes the use of one's mind to create a greater understanding of appreciation of one's self and others. It involves one's ability to think creatively and rationally. This dimension encourages an individual to expand his/her knowledge and skills. Spiritual Wellness promotes seeking meaning and purpose in human existence. It involves developing a strong sense of personal values and ethics and emphasizes an appreciation for the depth and expanse of life and natural forces that exist in the universe. Environmental wellness promotes living in harmony with the earth by understanding the impact of your interaction with nature and personal environment and taking action to protect the world around you. Vocational wellness promotes the process of determining and achieving positive personal and occupational goals and interest. This dimension is linked to discovering an individual's \"calling in life\" and encourages one to be a good giver and receiver of Life's gifts. In addition to its own programs and activities at its communities, by serving as a host community for Active Aging Week, each Americare community can also select from a wide variety of nationally offered virtual activities and ideas.

In early March, when the signs of the COVID-19 pandemic were just beginning, Americare made the investments that have allowed their residents to stay connected with family and friends, even once quarantine procedures were required. On March 13, all outside visitors to its facilities were discontinued and all group gatherings stopped. Americare believed that even though it was necessary to shut out visitors, that did not have to mean shutting down social and informational connections. That meant an extensive investment in equipment, training and learning among staff and residents and families to ensure that residents did not feel isolated or cut off, and that families could feel connected and informed. It also meant an investment in training, protocols and tracking to stay ahead of potential issues across the company. Among the investments were: - iPads shipped to every community for resident use and training of staff to help residents keep in touch with loved ones. - \"Join Me\" accounts for residents and families. - Extra training for the facility Lifestyle Teams on various communications. - Activity software on iPads and computers so residents can be physically active, mentally active and engaged through brain games and exercises. - Enabling staff remote access to all property systems to provide care and help properties creating less need for property visits. - Set up eFax capabilities to replace the multi-function device (print, scan, fax, copy) that is typically used by staff and residents thus eliminating potential cross contamination between non-COVID and COVID areas. - Gathered emails for all resident family members for updates. - Email protocols established and activated in any community with a COVID case to keep everyone informed (did not activate where there was no activity so as not to create alarm). - Creation of an \"our community and COVID\" channel for updates to families online in communities with COVID activity. - Developed a series of surveys and reports so the company and properties could see the impact/progression of the virus, staffing needs, PPE availability. - This snapshot allowed learnings from one community to be shared with others and ensured availability of people and equipment where needed when needed. - An aggressive local media outreach to ensure that when there was a COVID issue at a property, the media would have the facts and no need to bother staff or families, thus protecting everyone. - Extensive use of property level social media to give a window into the facility that helps ease the minds of families outside. The actual medical equipment used was also upgraded for such items as vital signs monitoring so that taking vital signs and uploading them into systems was easier. This created more accessible data that gave a consolidated view for monitoring vitals and spotting areas of concern or trends in advance so that testing, treatment, and even quarantine decisions could be made faster and ahead of the virus' potential progression. \"We believe the investments in technology made at the beginning of the pandemic and as we progressed through the months created an environment of communication to benefit the physical and mental health of residents and families, as well as creating lifestyle opportunities to keep residents engaged during this difficult time,\" said Patricia Cokingtin, Senior Vice President of Americare. \"In addition, our investments in staff training, software and database management put us in a position to identify issues and even potential issues and react to them in terms of supplies, personnel and evasive actions that we believe kept the virus contained within or even away from communities.\" For more information on how Americare facilities are addressing the coronavirus pandemic please visit "}
