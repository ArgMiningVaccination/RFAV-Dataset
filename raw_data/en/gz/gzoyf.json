Title: Preventing Violent Explosive Neurologic Trauma (PREVENT) - Medical Description: The Preventing Violent Explosive Neurologic Trauma (PREVENT) program seeks to understand the causes of blast- induced traumatic brain injury (TBI), an injury that while previously described in the warfighter population, has been referred to as a potential \"hidden epidemic\" in the current conflict. PREVENT will use a variety of modeling techniques based on in-theater conditions to assess potential TBI caused by blast in the absence of penetrating injury or concussion. Research will create a model that can be directly correlated to the epidemiology and etiology of injury seen in returning warfighters, and attempt to determine the physical and physiological underpinnings and causes of the injury. Mitigation and treatment strategies will be formulated based on our new knowledge of blast-induced brain injury with the eventual goal of reducing injury severity across the forces by over fifty percent, improving recovery time, and preventing future injuries. PREVENT is funded in the newly created Budget Activity 6.1 Medical Program Element 0601117E, beginning in FY 2012. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Assessed the effect of commonly available pharmaceuticals in both acute and chronic mitigation of blast brain injury symptoms. - Validated diagnostic criteria for assessment of mild to severe blast brain injury. - Tested and validated fabricated device strategies to ensure that they appropriately mitigate the effects of blast brain injury.

The unique stability afforded biological systems in their ability to adapt to wide extremes of physical and endurance (e.g., heat, cold, and sleeplessness) parameters will be examined and exploited in order to engineer stability into biological systems required for the military (such as blood, bioengineered tissues or other therapeutics). In addition, the fault tolerance present in biological systems will be exploited in order to assemble and manufacture complex physical and multi-functional systems, both biological and abiotic (such as tissue constructs designed for reconstructive surgery). These systems include novel load-bearing bio-interactive materials and composites for repair of severe hard tissue trauma, including complex bone fractures. A key new antibody technology will develop the ideal antibody master molecule for use in unattended sensors that maintains high temperature stability and controllable affinity for threat agents. Using the Freytag triangle structure, the interplay of narratives or stories may reveal how they tap into an array of mechanisms implicated in memory, reasoning, and strategy behavior.

Title: Physics in Biology Description: Understanding the fundamental physical phenomena that underlie biological processes and functions will provide new insight and unique opportunities for understanding biological properties and exploiting such phenomena. Physics in biology will explore the role and impact of quantum effects in biological processes and systems. Using quantum theoretical models and mathematical algorithms, new understanding of quantum effects will enable exploitation in new and existing biomimetic applications. This includes exploiting manifestly quantum mechanical effects that exist in biological systems at room temperature to develop a revolutionary new class of robust, compact, high sensitivity and high selectivity sensors. Investigation into quantitative neurophysics will examine new modalities for biological injury which could yield a new class of non-invasive medical imagers. Leveraging neuroscience and physics will lead to new modeling of acoustic signatures based on perceptibility (detection, classification, recognition, identification and localization) involving ear-to-brain mechanisms.

The Scaffold-Free Tissue Engineering program is developing platforms that would circumvent current limitations by removing the use of a material scaffold and providing simultaneous control of multiple cell/tissue types for the construction of large, complex tissues in vitro and in vivo. The program will provide a paradigm shift versus current tissue engineering approaches using permanent or resorbable protein scaffolds. Such scaffolds are limited to construct sizes of 2-3 square millimeters due to oxygen and nutrient diffusion limitations, which severely limits the complexity of the tissue(s) constructed to a single cell type. In vivo, scaffold-based tissue engineering has not achieved anticipated widespread application due to the inability to properly control the cellular response to the implanted scaffold and due to difficulties in controlling the scaffold integrity/degradation. The initial Scaffold-Free Tissue Engineering program component is the development of non-contact cell positioning procedures. The fundamental goal is to correctly position target cells in a desired pattern for a sufficient period of time to allow the cells to synthesize their own scaffold. Potential approaches include magnetic field and/or dielectrophoretic positioning. Critical to early programmatic achievement is the capability to position at least two cell types through the identification of cellular magnetic taggants, characterization of cellular dielectric characteristics and determination of application dynamics (e.g., duration, cycles, amplitude) to achieve multicellular tissue construction in vitro. A potential transition to an in situ application would allow wound site reconstruction without the need to implant scaffold material. Construction of a stable implantable skeletal muscle construct (5 cm3) with vascular and neural components will be the final programmatic demonstration. FY 2011 Plans: - Identify non-contact approaches such as magnetic fields and dielectrophoresis that provide cell positioning in three dimensions without negatively impacting cell viability. - Demonstrate in vitro construction of multicellular tissue using one or more non-contact cell positioning approaches. - Demonstrate survival and functional implantation of a two cubic centimeter multicellular skeletal muscle scaffold-less construct into an appropriate in vivo model. FY 2012 Plans: - Demonstrate formation of vascular elements from endothelial cells within an existing three-dimensional skeletal muscle construct in vitro. - Demonstrate directed ingrowth of neurons in an existing three-dimensional skeletal muscle construct in vitro.

Title: Strategic Social Interaction Modules (SSIM) Description: *Formerly Training for Adaptability The Strategic Social Interaction Modules (SSIM) program will take military training beyond traditional tactics, techniques, and procedures/standard operating procedures (TTPs/SOPs) to include cultural awareness and the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to develop close collaborative relationships with foreign peoples and leaders and, ultimately, for winning hearts and minds. Counter-insurgency (COIN) missions and stability and support operations (SASO) put U.S. service members in close contact with local populations. Historically, military training has not had to train soldiers on how to skillfully interact with foreign civilians. The current operational environment makes it imperative to develop rapport with local leaders and civilians as their cooperation will be necessary for success in COIN/SASO. SSIM will emphasize the foundational skills necessary to achieve cultural understanding in any social setting and the skills necessary for successful interactions across different social groups. SSIM will develop the requisite training technology including advanced gaming/simulation techniques that incorporate new methods for practicing social agility in cross-cultural encounters, as well as how to discover and learn culturally specific conduct, manners, and practices. FY 2011 Plans: - Conduct basic studies of interactions, negotiations, and relationships in cross-cultural social encounters. - Develop social interaction engines and expressive intelligence technologies for interpersonal simulations. FY 2012 Plans: - Create technologies to generate realistic training scenarios and user challenges, automate the evaluation of user responses, and support the expert authoring/editing of scenarios. - Develop tools to identify skillful performance in a training environment and for predicting the efficacy of the training in the intended operational/cultural environment. - Develop techniques for delivering training through a variety of mechanisms including over limited-bandwidth channels to users in theater.- 8.364 9.500 Title: Engage - 6.600 7.000 Volume 1 - 14UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 15 of 47 R-1 Line Item #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 1: Basic ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCESPROJECT CCS-02: MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Description: The Engage program, previously part of the Training for Adaptability thrust, will develop the means for teaching problem solving in complex real-world settings not amenable to conventional curriculum-based approaches. Traditional modes of education place learning before problem solving, but Engage will take an alternative approach by moving problem solving to the core of the educational experience. This will be accomplished by creating problem-solving games that feature combined human- computer reasoning on complex problems and that provide users with immediate feedback and alternative solutions. Engage will also address the difficult problem of connecting performance in the virtual domain with performance in the real world and then will use this knowledge to drive the creation of more effective game-based training. FY 2011 Plans: - Explore game and problem-solving-based approaches to learning in complex real-world domains. - Develop approaches for extrapolating performance on computer-based training systems to performance in the real world. FY 2012 Plans: - Develop software infrastructure for an educational gaming environment that allows the methods of instruction to be varied in order to determine the best approaches. - Analyze educational methodologies using statistics based on data drawn from a large video game environment. Title: Mathematics of Sensing, Exploitation and Evaluation (MSEE) Description: The Mathematics of Sensing, Exploitation and Evaluation (MSEE) program is an outgrowth of the Focus Areas in Theoretical Mathematics program that seeks to create a comprehensive mathematical theory of information processing, strategy formulation and decision determination. Such a theory would incorporate techniques from diverse mathematical disciplines such as Stochastic Process Theory, Harmonic Analysis, Formal Languages and Theoretical Computer Science to construct a common framework wherein the quantitative value of data acquisition may be assessed relative to dynamically-varying context. In addition, the structure will accommodate the notion that data acquisition and information processing are coupled, requiring some degree of feedback and control, while simultaneously admitting the possibility of different logics, e.g., those that allow for incomplete and time-varying states of knowledge. The result of this effort will produce advances in fundamental domains of mathematics with the potential to reshape current DoD approaches to managing the battlespace. FY 2011 Plans: - Formalize mathematically the notions of information processing, strategizing and decision determination so that these can be modeled as a computational process.- 3.000 7.500 Volume 1 - 15UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 16 of 47 R-1 Line Item #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 1: Basic ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCESPROJECT CCS-02: MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 - Investigate methods for constructing relevant models of DoD-relevant environments, and develop effective strategies for updating these as new information becomes available. FY 2012 Plans: - Incorporate statistical/stochastic concepts exploiting stochastic models and statistical reasoning to understand the nature of computations in human minds. - Explore open system concepts capable of demonstrating the ability to process information and determine best available responses, subject to time-varying context. - Begin to quantify notion of effective utility, which measures the relative value of a sensor or sensor system. Title: Math for Social Networks Description: Social networks are recent phenomena whose pervasiveness has become undeniable. Critical information potentially can be extracted by both observing network state at any given instant as well as by monitoring network dynamics. Standard tools for examining network behavior typically target systems of communication or computer nodes, and evaluate context-relevant yet straightforward metrics such as connectivity. When dealing with social networks, the knowledge that can be distilled is potentially more useful, and hence an entirely new set of techniques must be developed. This thrust will develop new mathematical methods to facilitate more complete analysis of social networks while simultaneously constructing mechanisms by which this elevated understanding may be best communicated. This approach could comprise, e.g., i) the application of spatiotemporal signal processing techniques to monitoring network activity, with an emphasis on identifying precursors to undesirable events; and, ii) incorporating fundamentally that the component nodes are humans (or groups of humans), and hence interact in ways subject to psychosocial evaluation. By incorporating sophisticated signal processing while recognizing the defining role of the human agent, this thrust will change how social networks are monitored and analyzed. Hence, we recast social network analysis into a mathematical framework that captures the biological nature of the component nodes intrinsically and exploits this knowledge to produce a unique DoD capability. FY 2012 Plans: - Create an enhanced network modeling theory that incorporates ability to perform spatiotemporal analysis. - Investigate impact of replacing generic network nodes with human agents whose behavior can be modeled statistically. - Perform small-scale analyses of dynamic networks and demonstrate ability to recognize event precursors.- - 10.000 Title: Foundational Computer Science Description: The Foundational Computer Science program supports research in broad areas of computational science having the potential for revolutionary advances in performance and other relevant metrics above and beyond extrapolations of current approaches.

The Foundational Computer Science program is addressing the need for highly reliable and trustworthy mission-critical information systems, including both software and hardware. New programming languages that facilitate parallel programming on multi-core processors, scalable formal methods, clean-slate execution models, co-design approaches for hardware and software, and other techniques will be used to guarantee the security, reliability, performance and robustness of a design while also reducing its complexity and cost. Research efforts in communications and sensor networks will address challenges related to dynamic heterogeneous multi-modal networks. The Foundational Computer Science program will also address problems that are inherently computationally complex and, in many cases, intractable. For example, the game of Go provides an ideal platform for creating the heuristic approaches and tools necessary to solve problems that typically require either enormous computer resources or simplification that sacrifices accuracy. The resulting technologies will be candidates for future command and control decision aids that can assess the consequences of specific actions and strategies to better predict future results in applications such as irregular warfare, cyber-security, supply chain optimization, networking and robotics.

Deeply layered machine learning engines will be created that use a single set of methods in multiple layers (at least three internally) to generate progressively more sophisticated representations of patterns, invariants, and correlations from data inputs. These will have far-reaching military implications with potential applications such as anomaly detection, object recognition, language understanding, information retrieval, pattern recognition, robotic task learning and automatic metadata extraction from video streams, sensor data, and multi-media objects.

Title: Information Theory for Wireless Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (ITMANET) Description: The Information Theory for Wireless Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (ITMANET) program is creating an information theory for ad hoc mobile wireless networking in the absence of wired infrastructure. Issues being addressed include quantifying network performance in terms of throughput, delay, reliability, and other critical parameters as a function of node mobility, network topology, channel access protocol, bandwidth efficiency, and the overhead incurred through the exchange of channel and network state information. The revolutionary new and powerful information theory developed under ITMANET will enable the next generation of DoD wireless networks and provide insight concerning the acquisition and deployment of nearer-term systems. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Predicted performance in terms of throughput-delay-reliability for modest-sized MANETs with and without feedback. - Developed upper-bounding techniques that go beyond the classical bounds and inequalities for MANETs.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Cyber Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cyber-security. Networked computing systems control virtually everything, from power plants and energy distribution, transportation systems, food and water distribution, financial systems, to defense systems. Protecting the infrastructure on which these systems rely is a national security issue. Cyberspace is not only critical to our national security, it is fundamental to our way of life: over the past decade information technologies have driven the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness. Unfortunately, during the same period, cyber-adversaries, which include nation-states, criminal/terrorist groups, transnational actors, and miscreants, have grown rapidly in sophistication and number. Due to its importance and the emergence of these threats, cyberspace is now recognized as a critical warfighting domain, equal in importance to the more traditional domains of sea, air, land, and space. The Cyber Sciences project will ensure DoD cyber-capabilities survive adversary attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems. Basic research in cyber security is required to provide a basis for continuing progress in this area. Promising research results will transition to both technology development and system-level projects. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 2011 FY 2012 Title: Crowd-Sourced Cyber Description: The Crowd-Sourced Cyber program will develop crowd-sourced approaches for verifying the correctness of software systems. Coding errors are the root cause of many of the most serious security vulnerabilities in software systems. Program verification can reduce coding errors dramatically, but at an unacceptable development cost. Many core problems in code verification are undetectable by computers, so automation in and of itself cannot sufficiently reduce the cost enough to make program verification practical. The Crowd-Sourced Cyber environment will facilitate the mapping from the code/formal specification to the relevant components of the simulation.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Description: The Risk-Managed Access Control (RMAC) program will develop the means to associate risk with access and use this as the basis for more effective identification, authentication, and authorization technologies. Currently, factors for identification and authentication require the user to know something like a password, possess something like a smart card, and/or to exhibit some intrinsic biometric trait like a fingerprint. Once authenticated, the user obtains authorization that defines the user's permissions, for example, what files the user can read. However, none of the current schemes for identification, authentication, and authorization incorporates any mechanism for automatically revisiting previous decisions. RMAC will create techniques and algorithms for quantifying the cumulative risks and benefits associated with a user's actions and incorporate such risk assessments in access control schemes that have additional control loops designed to mitigate the risks associated with large-scale information sharing. FY 2012 Plans: - Conceptualize methods for assigning a measure of risk to user activities. - Formulate new access control mechanisms that manage the cumulative risk associated with user actions. - Expand RMAC concepts to encompass possible approaches to multi-level security. Title: Cross-Layer Network Security Description: The Cross-Layer Network Security project will develop novel approaches for enhanced network security that involve multiple networked layers. This is in contrast to traditional approaches to network security that operate within a single layer, for example, standard Internet Protocol security is implemented in the network layer. Cross-layer approaches for wireless networks can exploit emerging path diversity technologies to introduce route diversity as a mechanism to counter eavesdroppers/jammers and compromised/malicious network nodes. These approaches have potential benefit for mobile ad-hoc networks and distributed sensor networks in adversarial wireless environments. Cross-layer approaches also hold promise for enhanced security for overlay networks and as the basis for new classes of virtual networks that provide security services. These could enable, for example, the capability to maintain quality of service through distributed denial of service attacks. FY 2012 Plans: - Conceptualize cross-layer approaches for enhanced security in wireless networks based on information-theoretic results in the areas of secrecy-capacity and secure broadcast channels. - Develop schemes that exploit path and route diversity technologies across the physical, data link, network, and transport layers. - Formulate new types of overlay/virtual networks that provide security-related services such as privacy and robust availability.- - 4.667 Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals - - 16.667 Volume 1 - 23UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 24 of 47 R-1 Line Item #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 1: Basic ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCESPROJECT CYS-01: CYBER SCIENCES C.

Title: Nanoscaled Architecture for Coherent Hyper-Optic Sources (NACHOS) Description: The objective of the Nanoscaled Architecture for Coherent Hyper-Optic Sources (NACHOS) program is to demonstrate sub-wavelength semiconductor lasers by leveraging recent developments in reduced dimensionality and advanced feedback concepts. The specific program goal is to demonstrate Continuous Wave injection lasers operating at room temperature with cavity dimensions smaller than the vacuum wavelength of light they generate, wavelength < 1.5 micrometers. Nanoscale lasers will enable close integration of photonic and electronic devices needed in emerging high-speed processing-intense computing and communication platforms. In addition to reduced size, these lasers are expected to be power-efficient and offer unprecedented modulation bandwidth.

Title: Optical Radiation Cooling and Heating in Integrated Devices (ORCHID) Description: The objective of the Optical Radiation Cooling and Heating in Integrated Devices (ORCHID) program is to leverage advances in photonics and micro-fabrication to develop integrated chips capable of exploiting quantum optomechanical applications. Although light is usually thought of as carrying energy but relatively little momentum, light confined to a high-finesse cavity can exert significant force on the cavity mirrors. When the mirror is allowed to vibrate by coupling it to a mechanical (spring- like) system, energy can be transferred between coupled optomechanical resonators. Depending on the detuning of the cavity, one can obtain either damping (cooling) or amplification (heating) of the mirror motion. Notable achievements in this field are the demonstration of mirror cooling (damping of the internal degree of motion) to sub-Kelvin (6 mK) temperatures and demonstration of radiation driven high-Q, high-frequency (1 GHz) oscillators. With sufficiently high cavity finesse and Q's of the mechanical system, it is possible to reach a regime in which the mirror motion is no longer thermally limited. Instead, it becomes limited by the quantum mechanical radiation pressure force. Once this limit is reached, it is possible to take advantage of quantum mechanical effects without having to cool the system. It is anticipated this will result in a new generation of mass-sensing devices and ultra high-Q, high-frequency resonators controlled by light. In optical systems, it will be possible to efficiently squeeze light beyond the standard shot-noise limit producing light sources for infrared detection and quantum information applications.

Title: Centers for Integrated Photonics Engineering Research (CIPhER) Description: The Centers for Integrated Photonics Engineering Research (CIPhER) program will explore and enhance fundamental understanding in the development and application of integrated photonics, in which an entire photonic system is fabricated on a single chip. Much like integrated electronics, integrated photonics has the potential to enable photonics systems to reach revolutionary new levels of performance and functionality, but with a wider application range than electronics, including such areas as imaging, energy conversion, signal processing, and computing. The rise of integrated photonics as a viable, practical technology, combined with the utility of integrated photonics to many applications, is slated to result in a more rapid transition of basic photonics research to system applications of importance to the DoD. As such, photonics research that is supported by organizations with both fundamental and commercial interests is ideally suited to fostering the growth of the nation's integrated photonics industry. The CIPhER program will therefore use a government/industrial cost-share funding model to foster the next generation of fundamental university-based photonics research. The CIPhER program is directed toward achieving this objective through the establishment of collaborative theme-based focus centers. Focus centers will be comprised of university-led teams, with industrial partners, engaged in long-term basic research of photonic materials, devices, and microsystems.

Title: Diverse & Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) Description: Prior DARPA efforts have demonstrated the ability to monolithically integrate inherently different semiconductor types to achieve near-ideal \"mix-and-match\" capability for DoD circuit designers. Specifically, the Compound Semiconductor Materials On Silicon (COSMOS) program, in which transistors of Indium Phosphide (InP) can be freely mixed with Silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits to obtain the benefits of both technologies (very high speed and very high circuit complexity/density, respectively). The Diverse & Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) effort will take this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (e.g., GaN, InP, GaAs, ABCS), microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors and actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures. This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true \"systems on a chip\" (SoCs) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions for a wide array of system applications. The Basic Research part of this effort will focus on the development of new hetero-integration processes and capabilities that if successful will ultimately be demonstrated in application specific circuits and transferred into the manufacturing flow.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Description: The Preventing Violent Explosive Neurologic Trauma (PREVENT) program seeks to understand the causes of blast- induced traumatic brain injury (TBI), an injury that while previously described in the warfighter population, has been referred to as a potential \"hidden epidemic\" in the current conflict. PREVENT will use a variety of modeling techniques based on in-theater conditions to assess potential TBI caused by blast in the absence of penetrating injury or concussion. Research will create a model that can be directly correlated to the epidemiology and etiology of injury seen in returning warfighters, and attempt to determine the physical and physiological underpinnings and causes of the injury. Mitigation and treatment strategies will be formulated based on our new knowledge of blast-induced brain injury with the eventual goal of reducing injury severity across the forces by over fifty percent, improving recovery time, and preventing future injuries. This program continues efforts previously funded in PE 0601101E, Project BLS-01. FY 2012 Plans: - Continue longitudinal study on warfighters pre- and post-deployment in order to relate specific in-theater blast exposure to evidence and rates of blast TBI. - Validate diagnostic devices and criteria in large animal models. - Transition and support studies of therapeutic strategies to military medical community. Title: Human Assisted Neural Devices* Description: *Previously Project BLS-01 The Human Assisted Neural Devices program will develop the scientific foundation for understanding the language of the brain for application to a variety of emerging DoD challenges, including improving performance on the battlefield and returning active duty military to their units after injury. This will require an understanding of neuroscience, significant computational efforts, and new material design and implementation. Key advances expected from this research include determining the nature and means through which short-term memory is encoded, and discovering the mechanisms and dynamics underlying neural computation and reorganization. These advances will enable memory restoration through the use of devices programmed to bridge gaps in the injured brain. Further, modeling of the brain progresses to an unprecedented level with this novel approach. FY 2012 Plans: - Assess consistency of primate to retain long-term memory encoding following simulated injury through use of neural codes. - Determine potential for improvements in training and skill retention through the use of neural stimulation during task acquisition in primates. - Identify homogeneity of neural codes involving long-term memory between primates conducting differing long-term memory tasks.- - 14.970 Volume 1 - 50UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 3 of 4 R-1 Line Item #5Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 1: Basic ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0601117E: BASIC OPERATIONAL MEDICAL SCIENCE C.

Title: Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT)* Description: *Previously funded in Synthetic Biology in PE 0601101E, Project TRS-01 The overarching goal of the Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) program is to create an ability to rapidly respond to a disease or threat and improve individual readiness and total force health protection. Service members in deployed settings have limited access to health care. The ability to perform continuous monitoring of physiological status to automatically and autonomously report a warning of a detrimental change and enable immediate diagnostic or therapeutic action would expand healthcare capabilities to these service members. Additionally, in vivo production of a vaccine would potentially eliminate the time to manufacture a vaccine ex vivo. This basic research effort will develop in vivo nucleic-acid circuits to control cellular machinery for diagnostic or vaccine applications and include research to: optimize orthogonality and modularity of genetic control elements; identify methods to increase sensitivity and specificity; and demonstrate methods to control cellular machinery in response to changes in physiological status. An additional strategic thrust is to develop methodologies for measuring health-specific biomarkers from a collected biospecimen to enable diagnostics at the point-of-need, in-garrison or deployed. This basic research effort will: develop new molecular methods for isolating and detecting health-associated biomarkers for application at the point-of-need or resource limited clinical facilities (point-of -care); develop new chemical and material methods for optimizing the analytical utility of minimal sample volumes; and, develop capabilities to archive and distribute biospecimens in a stable dried format without tubes, collection vials, or additional reagents. This program also has applied research efforts budgeted in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01. FY 2012 Plans: - Initiate development of modular and orthogonal nucleic acid-based elements for application within a detect-and-respond circuit. - Demonstrate controlled expression in mammalian cells of synthetic circuit in response to biomarkers associated with health status. - Develop oligonucleotide synthetic construct capable of utilizing cellular control elements to enhance potency, control dosing, and achieve effectiveness.- - 15.000 Volume 1 - 51UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 4 of 4 R-1 Line Item #5Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 1: Basic ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0601117E: BASIC OPERATIONAL MEDICAL SCIENCE C.

Title: Dialysis-Like Therapeutics Description: Sepsis, a bacterial infection of the blood stream, is a significant cause of injury and death among combat-injured soldiers. The key goal of this program is to run the blood volume (approximately five liters) through an external machine (akin to a dialysis system) and literally scrub out harmful bacteria and their toxins. The proposed approach is low-shear/low-resistance fluidic structures to connect cellular and biomolecular purification techniques for blood purification. Initial basic research will develop novel low-shear, low-resistance fluidic structures that enable rapid, large volume blood filtration. Additional research will develop novel intrinsic separation techniques that selectively remove bacteria, toxins and host cells from complex fluids, as well as new methods for continuous sensing of these components. Finally, research into predictive control techniques for directing patient health will close the sense, scrub, and control loop. The applied research portion of the program is budgeted in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01. FY 2012 Plans: - Develop \"label-free\" intrinsic separation technologies that remove pathogens of different classes, toxins, and activated cells from complex fluids. - Design high flow, low shear microfluidics to transport wound fluid and blood without cellular activation. - Design pathogen sensors for continuous use in complex biological fluids. - Establish mathematical models to classify and predict patient state over relevant time scales.- - 5.000 Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals - - 37.870 D.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This Program Element is budgeted in the applied research budget activity because it will focus on medical related technology, information, processes, materials, systems, and devices encompassing a broad spectrum of DoD challenges. Biowarfare defense includes the capability to predict and deflect pathogen evolution of natural and engineered emerging threats and therapeutics that increase survivability within days of receipt of an unknown pathogen. Continued understanding of infection biomarkers will lead to developing a detection device that can be self-administered and provide quicker ability to diagnose and prevent widespread infection in-theater. Other battlefield technologies includes a soldier-portable hemostatic wound treatment system, capability to manufacture field-relevant pharmaceuticals in theater, and a rapid after-action review of field events as a diagnostic tool for improving the delivery of medical care and medical personnel protection. Improved medical imaging will be approached through new physical properties of cellular metabolic activities. New neural interface technologies will reliably extract information from the nervous system to enable control of the best robotic prosthetic-limb technology. To allow medical practitioners the capability to visualize and comprehend the complex relationships across patient data in the electronic medical record systems, technologies will be developed to assimilate and analyze the large amount of data and provide tools to make better informed decisions for patient care. In the area of medical training, new simulation-based tools will rapidly teach increased competency in an open and scalable architecture to be used by all levels of medical personnel for basic and advanced training. This project will also pursue the applied research efforts for dialysis-like therapeutics. B.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Title: Unconventional Previously funded in PE 0602383E, Project BW-01 This thrust is developing unique and unconventional approaches to ensure that soldiers are protected against a wide variety of naturally occurring, indigenous or engineered threats. This program will develop approaches to counter any natural or anthropogenic pathogen within one week. This includes development of countermeasures that do not require prior knowledge of the pathogen and are broadly applicable to multiple unrelated bacterial and/or viral infectious agents. The integration of academic research programs with pharmaceutical development efforts will result in reducing the traditional drug development cycle timeframe. FY 2012 Plans: - Demonstrate various technologies that can increase the median infectious dose (ID50) of a given pathogen by 100-fold in an animal model compared to the untreated control ID50 in order to prevent infection. - Demonstrate a 4-fold increase in survival time after a lethal dose (LD95) challenge of a given pathogen in an animal model due to administered technology. - Demonstrate 95% survival against a first LD95 challenge of a given pathogen in an animal model using a therapy developed within 7 days of receipt of an unknown pathogen. - Demonstrate 95% survival after three LD95 challenges of a given pathogen in an animal model spaced 1 week apart =7 post countermeasure.- Pathogens are well known for the high rate of mutation that enables them to escape drug therapies and primary or secondary immune responses. The Pathogen Defeat thrust area will provide capabilities to predict future threats and to deflect pathogen evolution to non-human spaces such as animals, insects, and bacteria. This area will also determine malicious intent by monitoring key technology acquisitions and commercialization of potential dual-use technologies. Pathogen Defeat focuses not on the threats that are already known but rather on the threats of newly emerging agents and mutations in the future, allowing pre- emptive preparation of vaccine and therapy countermeasures. FY 2012 Plans: - Demonstrate capability of evolutionary pathway of the viral system under multiple selective pressures. - Use demonstrated capability to validate the algorithms' predictions.- - 19.000 Volume 1 - 54UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 3 of 7 R-1 Line Item #9Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602115E: BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGY C.

Title: Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT)* Description: *Previously funded in Synthetic Biology in PE 0601101E, Project TRS-01 The overarching goal of the Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) program is to increase our ability to rapidly respond to a disease or threat and improve individual readiness and total force health protection. Service members in deployed settings have limited access to health care. New methods and devices are needed to address critical conditions on-site, to allow improved care at field hospital, fleet, and air transport settings, and to enable rapid response to emerging threats. This applied research effort will focus on development of devices for integrated diagnostics across multiple echelons of care: 1) Simple to operate diagnostic devices for critical biomarkers at the point of need; 2) highly multiplexed diagnostic devices for broad spectrum diagnostic and response to emerging threats in an automated format; and, 3) the ability to rapidly develop, integrate and distribute new assays for detection of new biomarkers and emerging threats. Research thrusts include: optimization of methodologies for extraction of targeted biomarkers from a biospecimen that has been room-temperature stabilized in a dried format; demonstration of novel molecular detection approaches towards specific biomarkers; optimization of integrated simple-to-operate diagnostic devices (sample in, results out); demonstration of novel molecular approaches for multiplexed analysis over the same or different classes of biomarkers; and, integration of sample preparation and analysis methods. A companion basic research effort is budgeted in PE 0601117E, Project MED-01. FY 2012 Plans: - Develop new materials and methods for low power diagnostics. - Develop new reagents and reagent storage methods for deployable diagnostics. - Develop processes for clinical sample collection and preparation for deployable diagnostics. - Develop methods and optimization criteria for extraction of targeted biomarker classes for the retrospective analysis of a dried and room-temperature stable biospecimen archive card. - Develop approach for biomarker research from archived biospecimen card, as the first step towards rapid synthesis of deployable diagnostic devices against new threats.- - 10.000 Title: Tactical Biomedical Technologies* - - 17.000 Volume 1 - 55UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 4 of 7 R-1 Line Item #9Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602115E: BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGY C. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 Description: *Previously funded in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-02 The Tactical Biomedical Technologies thrust will develop new approaches to deliver life-saving medical care on the battlefield. Uncontrolled blood loss is the leading cause of preventable death for soldiers on the battlefield. While immediate control of hemorrhage is the most effective strategy for treating combat casualties and saving lives, currently no method other than surgical intervention can effectively treat intracavitary bleeding. A focus in this thrust is the co-development of a materials-based agent(s) and delivery mechanism capable of damaged tissue-targeted hemostasis and wound control. This system will effectively treat compressible and non-compressible wounds regardless of geometry or location. Additionally, rapid response to emerging biological threats on the battlefield is impacted by logistical delays of delivering the necessary therapeutics. Creating a \"pharmacy on demand\" will enable far-forward medical providers to manufacture and produce small molecule drugs and biologics in order to ensure that the therapeutics are available when they need them. FY 2012 Plans: - Demonstrate hemostatic material compatibility with Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents that control pain, infection, and inflammation. - Achieve wound treatment system unit specs including coverage of at least 0.20 square meters of tissue area, mass of less than 200 grams, and a volume less than 150 ml. - Demonstrate scale-up for large volume hemostasis agent synthesis. - Demonstrate hemostasis agent stability consistent with operational requirements. - Test and validate the wound stasis system delivery device. - Develop a plan for wound stasis system FDA approval. - Fabricate devices capable of manufacturing six field relevant pharmaceuticals. - Investigate constructing a man-portable device capable of manufacturing four field relevant pharmaceuticals. - Demonstrate limited capability of manufacturing serum, antigen, and vaccine of DoD relevance through directed activity of microbial systems. - Show efficacy and safety of manufactured end products in in-vitro models.

This thrust will also address how to improve the delivery of medical care and medical personnel protection by building a simulated environment for rapid after-action review of field events generated from current military systems. The advanced development of these tools will provide a formidable arsenal of diagnostic tools for warfighter performance and care. FY 2012 Plans: - Demonstrate ability to automatically detect, track, and analyze similar events and incidents in temporal and physical space. - Qualify system based on theater-relevant demonstrations and replications of scenario exercises. - Implement biologic and agent-based models to project wounds, reactions, and injury cascades following simulation of trauma. - Transition reconstructive scenario system to Service partners for pilot programs in in-theater implementation. - Obtain in vivo hydrogen and carbon-13 spectra from animal brain using quantum orbital resonance spectroscopy (QORS). - Using established animal models for traumatic brain injury (TBI) and using QORS, distinguish healthy animals from those with TBI. Title: The Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) program will develop the technology needed to reliably extract information from the nervous system, and to do so at a scale and rate necessary to control many degree-of-freedom machines, such as high- performance prosthetic limbs. This program will complement ongoing neural prosthetic activities funded through other DARPA programs. These other activities study cognition and the mechanisms of higher brain function, as well as construction of upper- limb prostheses. RE-NET will develop neural interface technologies to allow the best robotic prosthetic-limb technology, recently developed by DARPA, to be reliably used throughout the life of wounded warriors that have one or more amputated limbs. FY 2012 Plans: - Refine statistically validated models of neural interface reliability for both central-nervous-system (CNS) and peripheral-system interfaces. - Demonstrate reliable peripheral interface technology to increase the channel count and hence neural information content, while not compromising the already demonstrated reliability. - Develop advanced CNS interface technology to increase operational reliability and functional lifetime, while not compromising the ability to obtain large amounts of neural information.- - 24.500 Title: Virtual Tricorder - - 9.000 Volume 1 - 57UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 6 of 7 R-1 Line Item #9Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602115E: BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGY C. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Description: The Virtual Tricorder program will develop technologies for analyzing and assimilating massive datasets collected on individual test subjects to visualize, understand, and assess health status by modeling and simulating biological systems. The resulting application will enable medical practitioners to visualize and understand complex relationships across patient data in electronic medical record systems. Not only will this technique allow physicians to visualize patients' health status more accurately, but it will also provide tools to predict the systemic impact (positive and negative) of pharmaceutical and other therapeutic interventions on the patient. Achieving this will require modeling the complex, multi-feature, multi-scale interactions in biological systems from the holistic perspective of systems biology rather than the traditional reductionist perspective. Virtual Tricorder will combine multiple physical/biological models to create the capability to realistically simulate numerous simultaneous physical/biological phenomena. Virtual Tricorder technology will have potential applicability in both time-critical medical settings such as a military intensive care unit (ICU) and also long-term recovery settings where patients are being treated for multiple co- morbid conditions with multiple therapeutic approaches. FY 2012 Plans: - Conceptualize modeling and simulation techniques for biological systems. - Develop techniques for registration and fusion of multi-modal medical imagery (PET/MRI/CAT/sonogram). - Develop techniques for modeling physiological impact of medications and other therapeutic interventions. - Develop approaches for integrating physical and chemical measurements that range from the microscopic (pathology data) to the macroscopic (radiology data). - Initiate development of visualization techniques that scale from the tissue to the organ to the whole-body. Title: Training for Rapid Acquisition of Critical Knowledge (TRACK) Description: The Training for Rapid Acquisition of Critical Knowledge (TRACK) program will create computer simulation-based training tools to rapidly increase the level of competence of all military service members in areas where rapid training is critical. The first area that TRACK will address is military medicine. For traumatic injury, it is often the medical response that is received in the first few minutes after injury that determines survival. TRACK-Medical will create tools that can be used to train all military personnel to a level of medical competence to provide potentially life-saving treatment in the interval before a military medical professional arrives. TRACK-Medical tools will be open and scalable to be used both to teach basic lifesaving skills to all military personnel as well as deliver more advanced training for medics, corpsmen, and nurses. The tools will incorporate intelligent tutoring and will be able to test and evaluate mastery of knowledge. TRACK-Medical tools will also provide the capability to author scenarios to recreate injuries not normally seen in the civilian world and to adapt to changing wound patterns being encountered in combat.

Title: META Description: The goal of the META program is to develop novel design flows, tools, and processes to enable a significant improvement in the ability to design complex defense and aerospace systems that are correct-by-construction. The program seeks to develop a design representation of meta-language and a domain-specific component model library from which system designs can quickly be assembled and their correctness verified with a high degree of certainty. Such a \"fab-less\" design approach is complemented by a foundry-style manufacturing capability, consisting of a factory capable of rapid reconfiguration between a large number of products and product variants through bitstream reprogramability, i.e., with minimal or no resultant learning curve effects. Together, the fab-less design and foundry-style manufacturing capability is anticipated to yield substantial---by a factor of five to ten---compression in the time to develop and field complex defense and aerospace systems. The META effort will also explore the initial design of a next generation ground combat vehicle by employing a novel, model-based correct-by-construction design capability, a highly-adaptable foundry-style manufacturing capability, and crowd-sourcing methods to demonstrate 5x-10x compression in the timeline necessary to build an infantry fighting vehicle. Beginning in FY 2012, the specific ground vehicle application work will be funded in PE 0602702E, Project TT-04, Advanced Land Systems. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Began development of a new model-based systems engineering process, novel design, integration, and verification flows, and appropriate supporting metrics. - Began development of a meta-language for the representation of models of both software and physical system components. FY 2011 Plans: - Continue development of supporting tools necessary to implement the model-based design, integration, and verification flows. - Begin development of a foundry configuration toolset to enable the (re)configuration of foundry-style manufacturing capabilities for a given required degree of manufacturing adaptability. - Exercise feedback loop between manufacturability constraints and the system design toolset.14.074 49.000 56.000 Volume 1 - 64UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 5 of 27 R-1 Line Item #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT IT-02: HIGH PRODUCTIVITY, HIGH- PERFORMANCE RESPONSIVE ARCHITECTURES B.

Title: Unconventional Warfighters Description: The Unconventional Warfighters program will create information technologies that enable new classes of participants to contribute to defense missions. One such class includes futurists, inventors, hobbyists, and tinkerers who approach military problems from an unconventional perspective. This latent source of creativity has been successfully tapped in the commercial sector through crowd-sourcing Internet marketplaces that bring human intelligence to bear on tasks for which computers are poorly suited. Information extraction and integration techniques will enable the solutions proposed by individuals to be correlated and fused into meta-solutions for further iterative development. Another class of potential participants is military Veterans, including disabled Veterans, who have deep knowledge of the missions and the operational environment. Machine learning tools will enable individuals with similar interests and complementary capabilities to find each other while advanced collaboration tools will amplify the synergies of diverse dynamic groups. Animals are another class of potential contributors. This is not a new idea, as animals possessing special abilities such as dogs and dolphins have been used before to perform military tasks such as mine detection. The new aspect to be examined under Unconventional Warfighters is the potential for creating new sensor, processing, communication and actuator systems specially adapted to enable animals to execute tasks beyond their natural capabilities. FY 2012 Plans: - Conceptualize and develop tools to enable persons with similar interests and complementary capabilities to find each other and collaborate on military problems. - Develop techniques for correlating and fusing solution concepts put forward by diverse proposers to yield \"meta-solutions\" for complex military problems.- - 25.000 Volume 1 - 66UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 7 of 27 R-1 Line Item #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT IT-02: HIGH PRODUCTIVITY, HIGH- PERFORMANCE RESPONSIVE ARCHITECTURES B.

Title: Integrity Reliability Integrated CircuitS (IRIS)* Description: *Formerly DISCOVER The Department of Defense has become increasingly reliant on electronic parts and systems fabricated outside of the United States. In many cases, these parts have also been designed in foreign countries, and there is currently no method available to decipher the full functionality of these circuits that may contain billions of transistors. Even if the part is designed domestically, there is currently no way of verifying that no tampering has occurred during fabrication, especially as processing technology scales to near atomic length scales, that can compromise the warfighter's mission or safety. Integrity Reliability Integrated CircuitS (IRIS) will advance non-destructive reverse engineering of integrated circuits whose functionality is not known a priori. These tools will be compatible with leading edge 32 nanometer complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) node size. These tools will ensure that an integrated circuits' full functionality is known and will provide verification that no malicious changes have been introduced.

Title: Trusted Software* Description: * Formerly Total Software Understanding (TSU) The Trusted Software program will meet DoD demands for reliable and robust software using technology to diagnose software for inefficiencies, design errors, redundant code, and overall software inconsistencies. Current software projects are massive, dynamic social efforts involving distributed teams of developers, marketers, and users. Without the proper tools, the software engineers create errors and redundancies providing unintended and exploitable security flaws. This program will develop specific techniques to extract information on software products, model the development environment, and integrate the models into low- level software analysis tools to provide a robust diagnostic tool for building and validating trustworthy software. FY 2011 Plans: - Develop a database of legacy software products that could contain exploitable flaws. - Initiate the design of software development models. FY 2012 Plans: - Prototype software development modeling environment. - Compare, for selected software platforms, actual software behavior against intended behavior. - Analyze and determine causes of differences between actual and intended software behavior.- 5.000 10.000 Title: Agile Assured Computing * Description: * Previously Confident Computing The Agile Assured Computing program will radically change the current paradigm of overly complex, unwieldy, and insecure computing platforms. Current commercial off-the-shelf platforms add layer upon layer of functionality and have become hugely complex and difficult to maintain. The current approach to securing these platforms emphasizes large security applications, such as anti-virus programs, that in themselves are difficult to maintain and vulnerable to attack. The Agile Assured Computing program will create more flexible, responsive methods for securing computing systems that operate in challenging environments. The program will develop automated system technologies to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in legacy computing platforms. Agile Assured Computing technologies will reduce security risk without requiring lengthy development cycles or time-consuming maintenance by system administrators.

FY 2012 Plans: - Demonstrate mechanisms to determine outdated and unnecessary system attributes used for attacks. - Demonstrate automated tools for identifying system attributes for attacks. - Demonstrate approaches for modifying those attributes to provide a secure operating pathway. Title: Rapid Planning (RP) Description: The Rapid Planning (RP) program will develop rapid planning and replanning tools based on recent mathematical advances such as topological data analysis (TDA). The program will develop tools and techniques for rapid generation and adaptation of robust plans in the presence of uncertainty, imprecision, incomplete, and contradictory data and assumptions. RP will also provide a capability for monitoring plans, providing continuous replanning capability, and plain text explanations for recommended plans. RP will invest in mathematical methods to improve optimization including new branch and bound, mixed integer programming, and sub-modularity methods; techniques for accelerated simulation where accuracy can be traded for speed; design of experiments through manifold learning and identification techniques that build upon previous DARPA programs; and develop a process that is aware of interdependencies in plans and aids planners in resolving these interdependencies. FY 2011 Plans: - Create overarching system architecture for rapid replanning incorporating environmental and tactical uncertainty. - Design automated identification of the controlling and nuisance parameters to quickly focus attention. - Implement TDA techniques to predict optimal performance in an evolving non-linear environment. FY 2012 Plans: - Develop techniques for rapidly assessing the robustness of plans and create the ability for planners to quickly develop and deploy plan contingencies to address potential failure modes. - Demonstrate and assess the efficacy of the tool to rapidly create and adapt plans more accurately in a military laboratory environment.- 5.000 9.169 Title: Clean-slate design Cyber Immune- 15.000 29.000 Volume 1 - 72UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 13 of 27 R-1 Line Item #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT IT-03: INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND SURVIVABILITY B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 The Clean-slate design of Resilient, Adaptive, Secure Hosts (CRASH) program will develop cyber security technologies using the mechanisms of biological systems as inspiration for radically re-thinking basic hardware and system designs. Higher level organisms have two distinct immune systems: the innate system is fast and deadly but is only effective against a fixed set of pathogens; the adaptive system is slower, but can learn to recognize novel pathogens. Similarly, CRASH will develop mechanisms at the hardware and operating system level that eliminate known vulnerabilities exploited by attackers. However, because novel attacks will be developed, CRASH will also develop software techniques that allow it to defend itself, to maintain its capabilities, and even heal itself. Finally, biological systems show that diversity is an effective population defense; CRASH will develop techniques that make each computer system appear unique to the attacker and allows each system to change over time. FY 2011 Plans: - Develop initial designs of one or more systems, including novel hardware and system features. - Demonstrate through formal methods, simulation, and design walkthroughs that the prototype systems mitigate common technical vulnerabilities. FY 2012 Plans: - Integrate and implement one or more CRASH hardware systems capable of supporting the prototype operating system. - Demonstrate the ability to detect and recover from penetrations. - Red-team systems to verify technical vulnerabilities known by the community have been addressed successfully. Title: Safer Warfighter Computing (SAFER)* Description: *Formerly Securing the Hosts The Safer Warfighter Computing (SAFER) program is creating a technology base for assured and trustworthy Internet communications and computation, particularly in untrustworthy and adversarial environments. SAFER creates automated processes and technologies that will enable military users to send and receive content on the Internet, utilizing commercially available hardware and software, in ways that avoid efforts to deny, locate, or corrupt communications. SAFER is also developing technology for performing computations on encrypted data without decrypting it first through fully homomorphic encryption and interactive, secure multi-party computation schemes. This will enable, for example, the capability to encrypt queries and to create an encrypted search result without decrypting the query. This technology will advance the ability to run computationally intensive programs on large datasets on a cluster of untrusted computers, as in a cloud computing environment, while keeping programs, data, and results encrypted and confidential. FY 2011 Plans: - Develop technical approaches for improving the security of internet-based communications and computation.- 13.275 20.000 Volume 1 - 73UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 14 of 27 R-1 Line Item #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT IT-03: INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND SURVIVABILITY B.

Spatially, ADAMS technologies will apply to systems, individuals, groups/organizations, and nation-states. Temporally, ADAMS technologies will apply to behaviors that emerge over hours, days, months, and years. ADAMS will develop flexible, scalable and highly interactive approaches to extracting actionable information from information system log files, sensors, and other instrumentation as needed. FY 2011 Plans: - Conceptualize approaches for finding indicators of anomalous behaviors buried in enormous amounts of observational data. FY 2012 Plans: - Create a scalable, distributed architecture to collect, store, access, process, and correlate relevant data from heterogeneous sources over extended periods of time. - Formulate techniques for determining whether a system, individual, group/organization, or nation-state is exhibiting anomalous behavior suggestive of an emerging threat.- 4.500 18.000 Title: Cyber Reserve Corps Description: The Cyber Reserve Corps program will develop technologies and tools to enable and educate private citizens to participate in the defense of cyberspace. Private citizens already collaborate on cyber-defense through the numerous blogs and message boards dedicated to issues such as diagnosing problems on home computers/networks and remediating the effects of malware on popular commercial systems. These activities are facilitated through a variety of software tools; additional tools for detecting and diagnosing known exploits and variants of known exploits will be developed. Cyber Reserve Corps will also create technologies for generating shareable host and network log files that are both informative with respect to new exploits yet preserve the privacy of user data, as well as tools for automating the analysis of these log files.

FY 2012 Plans: - Develop concepts for collaborative cyber-defense encompassing public and private hosts/networks. - Develop technologies that enable confidential sharing of detailed host data and configuration information. - Develop techniques for sensing widely distributed probes/attacks on public/private networks. Title: Resilient Networks Description: The Resilient Networks program will create technologies that enable networks to survive cyber attack. Many vulnerabilities have been identified in the networking protocols used in the routers and switches used in home/small business, enterprise, and wide-area networks. While attackers are able to adapt their attacks in a highly dynamic fashion, the capability to respond to such attacks is limited by the complexity of the networking protocols and their typically proprietary, vendor-specific implementations. Resilient Networks will address this by creating advanced routing/switching software that runs efficiently on commodity processors. Such software-defined routers/switches will enable far greater agility in responding to exploits than is presently possible and provide the basis for highly reactive networked defense capabilities. Resilient Networks will also address embedded computing systems such as vehicle/platform/weapon/industrial control systems, which must operate at a high level of assurance in real-world environments. Resilient Networks will develop new verification and validation techniques for embedded networks that must function reliably in complex adversarial environments. Achieving resilience in enterprise networks is also of interest. This would involve techniques for reconfiguring enterprise networking and computing resources to mitigate the effects of attacks and restore services. FY 2012 Plans: - Recast datalink and network layer protocols for parallel execution on commercial multicore processors. - Design high-utilization protocol primitives for implementation in widely used development environments while respecting multi- level security requirements. - Perform an in-depth systems engineering analysis to identify changes required to enable simplified provisioning of secure communications and networking services. - Identify algorithmic advances and protocol re-design opportunities/needs to achieve high levels of assurance in internet-based wide-area communications/networking and in embedded networked computing and control systems. - Develop and apply new algorithms and protocols in high-assurance implementations for use in wide-area communications/ networking and in embedded networked computing and control systems.- - 20.000 Title: Assured Mobile Platform (AMP) - - 18.250 Volume 1 - 75UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 16 of 27 R-1 Line Item #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT IT-03: INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND SURVIVABILITY B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Description: The Assured Mobile Platform (AMP) program will develop and demonstrate the technologies required to secure wireless mobile devices. As in the civilian world, the military is making increasing use of wireless devices such as smartphones and personal digital assistants. These devices integrate computational and wireless networking elements that are controlled by a so-called \"mobile platform\". The mobile platform integrates a computer operating system with software for controlling the wireless component. Because mobile devices have very limited size, weight, and power, the mobile platform must be very efficient and so can devote only a limited share of its computational resources to security. This makes securing mobile wireless devices a challenge. Cross-layer approaches are extremely promising due to the emergence of low-cost electronically-steerable antenna arrays suitable for mobile devices. Another approach is to utilize off-board security resources accessed via the cloud, in effect \"security reach-back\". AMP will develop, mature, and integrate these technologies to produce a mobile platform that provides a high level of assurance for military users. FY 2012 Plans: - Explore cross-layer approaches for securing mobile platforms that incorporate an electronically-steerable antenna array. - Formulate \"security reach-back\" approaches that utilize off-board security resources to secure mobile platforms. - Perform detailed requirements analysis and systems engineering as the basis for a concept of operations and high level design for a mobile platform that provides a high level of assurance for military users. Title: Next Generation Core Optical Networks (CORONET) Description: The Next Generation Core Optical Networks (CORONET) program will revolutionize the operation, performance, security, and survivability of the United States' critical inter-networking system by leveraging technology developed in DARPA photonics component and secure networking programs. These goals will be accomplished through a transformation in fundamental networking concepts that form the foundation upon which future inter-networking hardware, architecture, protocols and applications will be built. Key technical enablers that will be developed in this thrust include: 1) network management tools that guarantee optimization of high density wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) optical channels; 2) creation of a new class of protocols that permit the cross-layer communications needed to support quality-of-service requirements of high-priority national defense applications; and 3) demonstration of novel concepts in applications such as distributed and network-based command and control, intelligence analysis, predictive logistics management, simulation- and scenario-enhanced decision-making support for real-time combat operations, and assured operation of critical U.S. networking functions when faced with severe physical layer attack. These network-based functions will support the real-time, fast-reaction operations of senior leadership, major commands and field units.

Title: Intrinsically Assured Mobile Ad-Hoc (IAMANET) Description: The Intrinsically Assured Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (IAMANET) program continues a series of successful research programs to design a tactical wireless network that is secure and resilient to a broad range of threats which include cyber attacks, electronic warfare and malicious insiders (or captured/compromised radios). Previous programs included the Dynamic Quarantine of Computer-Based Worms (DQW) and Defense Against Cyber Attacks on Mobile Ad-hoc Network Systems (DCAMANET). IAMANET will build upon the successes achieved in both the DQW and the DCMANET programs. IAMANET directly supports the integrity, availability, reliability, confidentiality, and safety of Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) communications and data. In contrast, the dominant Internet paradigm is intrinsically insecure. For example, the Internet does not deny unauthorized traffic by default and therefore violates the principle of least privilege. In addition, there are no provisions for non-repudiation or accountability and therefore adversaries can probe for vulnerabilities with impunity because the likelihood of attributing bad behavior to an adversary is limited. Current protocols are not robust to purposely induced failures and malicious behavior, leaving entire Internet-based systems vulnerable in the case of defensive failure. IAMANET, on the other hand, uses a deny-by-default networking paradigm, allowing only identifiable authorized users to communicate on the network.

Title: Trustworthy Systems Description: The goal of the Trustworthy Systems program is to provide new approaches to network-based monitoring that provide maximum coverage of the network (i.e. from the NIPRNET/Internet gateway to service enclaves) with performance independent of the network's size, and with computational costs that either remain constant or decrease as the network's speed or relative size increases. The end deliverable of this program will provide network defense technologies with: (1) high probability of detection (Pd) of malicious traffic per attack launched and, (2) a false alarm rate of not more than one false alarm per day. This technology will provide gateway-and-below network traffic monitoring approaches that scale at rates that are linear (or less) to increases in network size and transmission speeds.

Title: Security-Aware Systems Description: The Security-Aware Systems program developed and advanced a variety of potentially promising technologies to enable the military to field secure, survivable, self-monitoring, self-defending network centric systems. This program evaluated security aware systems that will avoid brittleness and vulnerability, due to their ability to reason about their own security attributes, capabilities and functions with respect to specific mission needs. These systems also dynamically adapt to provide desired levels of service while minimizing risk and providing coherent explanations of the relative safety of service level alternatives. The systems bolster the reliability and security of critical software systems by reducing vulnerabilities and logic errors, and providing state-of-the-art software analysis techniques augmented with cognitive decision-making techniques. Research efforts also explored provable protection of information and investigate technologies that enable fundamentally new approaches for detecting insider threats. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Investigated the application of Self-Regenerative Systems (SRS) technology to a high value, mission critical, military computing system. - Examined the ability of SRS technology to enable a military computing system to successfully complete a mission in the face of cyber attack or accidental fault.5.397 - - Title: Cyber Insider Threat* Description: *Formerly part of Security-Aware Systems The Cyber Insider Threat (CINDER) program will develop techniques for countering one of the most significant and malicious threats to military networks and systems: the cyber insider threat. Current defenses are based on network and host intrusion detection, and look for \"break-ins\" and abnormal behavior but do not attempt to characterize a user's mission. The CINDER program will build tools and techniques that characterize user mission in a multi-level security environment.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project is developing powerful new technologies for processing foreign languages that will provide critical capabilities for a wide range of military and national security needs, both tactical and strategic. The technologies and systems developed in this project will enable our military to automatically translate and exploit large volumes of speech and text in multiple languages obtained through a variety of means. Current U.S. military operations involve close contact with a wide range of cultures and peoples. The warfighter on the ground needs hand-held, speech-to-speech translation systems that enable communication with the local population during tactical missions. Thus, tactical applications imply the need for two-way (foreign- language-to-English and English-to-foreign-language) translation. Because foreign-language news broadcasts, web-posted content, and captured foreign-language hard-copy documents can provide insights regarding local and regional events, attitudes and activities, language translation systems also contribute to the development of good strategic intelligence. Such applications require one-way (foreign-language-to-English) translation. Exploitation of the resulting translated content requires the capability to automatically collate, filter, synthesize, summarize, and present relevant information in timely and relevant forms. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Title: Global Autonomous Language Exploitation (GALE) Description: The Global Autonomous Language Exploitation (GALE) program will create an integrated product enabling automated transcription and translation of foreign speech and text with targeted information retrieval. When applied to foreign language broadcast media and web-posted content, GALE systems will enhance open-source intelligence and local/regional situational awareness by reducing the cost and effort of translation and analysis. GALE will produce a fully-mature architecture and dramatically improve transcription and translation accuracy by broader exploitation of context. GALE will develop timely alerts for commanders and warfighters. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Exercised language-independent paradigm for new languages essential for military use - Dari, Pashto and Urdu. - Developed methods for porting targeted information retrieval technology into new languages. - Developed methods for using extraction-empowered machine translation, in which the system extracts the meaningful phrases (e.g., names and descriptions) from foreign language text for highly accurate translation into English.38.353 22.945 11.250 Volume 1 - 81UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 22 of 27 R-1 Line Item #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT IT-04: LANGUAGE TRANSLATION B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 - Completed the architecture for a summarization system that incorporates adaptive filtering, focused summarization, information extraction, contradiction detection, and user modeling. FY 2011 Plans: - Achieve high accuracy translation and distillation using shallow semantics with minimal ancillary information. - Achieve translation accuracy and distillation that exceeds human performance. - Provide technology updates to military and intelligence operations centers. FY 2012 Plans: - Incorporate the sophisticated search capabilities developed in the distillation task of GALE into the inserted systems. - Transition to new customers. Title: Multilingual Automatic Document Classification, Analysis and Translation (MADCAT) Description: The Multilingual Automatic Document Classification, Analysis and Translation (MADCAT) program will develop and integrate technology to enable exploitation of captured, foreign language, hand-written documents. This technology is crucial to the warfighter, as documents including notebooks, letters, ledgers, annotated maps, newspapers, newsletters, leaflets, pictures of graffiti, and document images captured in the field may contain extremely important time-sensitive information. The MADCAT program will address this need by producing devices that will convert such captured documents from Arabic into readable English in the field. MADCAT will substantially improve applicable technologies, in particular document analysis and optical character recognition/optical handwriting recognition. MADCAT will tightly integrate these improved technologies with translation technology and create prototypes for field trials. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Developed algorithms for interpreting different regions within a document; removing noise from contaminated and degraded documents; predicting the syntactic structure and propositional content of text; and extracting information from an address field or the axes of a table. - Integrated these technologies with the translation and summarization components of GALE to yield tightly integrated technology prototypes that convert captured documents into readable and searchable English. FY 2011 Plans: - Complete the development of algorithms for interpreting different regions within a document; for predicting the syntactic structure and propositional content of text; and for removing noise from contaminated and degraded documents. - Complete the integration of these improvements with the translation and summarization components of GALE. - Transition tightly integrated technology prototypes that convert captured documents into readable and searchable English to high-impact military systems and intelligence operations centers.14.663 15.375 19.870 Volume 1 - 82UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 23 of 27 R-1 Line Item #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT IT-04: LANGUAGE TRANSLATION B.

Title: Robust Automatic Translation of Speech (RATS) Description: The Robust Automatic Translation of Speech (RATS) program will address noisy and hostile conditions where speech signals are degraded by distortion, reverberation, and/or competing conversation. Robust speech processing technologies will enable soldiers to hear or read clear English versions of what is being said in their vicinity, despite a noisy or reverberant environment. RATS technology will isolate and deliver pertinent information to the warfighter by detecting periods of speech activity and discarding silent portions, determining the language spoken, identifying the speaker, and recognizing key words in challenging environments. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Developed noise suppression and speech exploitation approaches based on multi-microphone arrays. - Started refinement of new speech processing techniques for noisy environments, including echo suppression, speech activity detection, language identification, speaker identification and keyword spotting. FY 2011 Plans: - Optimize new speech processing techniques for noisy environments, including speech activity detection, language identification, speaker identification and keyword spotting. - Develop bio-inspired algorithms to enable RATS processing. - Develop methods for detecting relevant speech segments. - Adapt present technologies for automatic speech recognition systems to cope with highly degraded signals. - Transition tightly integrated technology prototypes to military and intelligence operations centers.

Title: Boundless Operational Language Translation (BOLT) Description: The Boundless Operational Language Translation (BOLT) program will enable communication regardless of medium (voice or text), and genre (conversation, chat, or messaging) through expansion of language translation capabilities, human- machine multimodal dialogue, and language generation. The BOLT program will enable warfighters and military/government personnel to readily communicate with coalition partners and local populations and will enhance intelligence through better exploitation of all language sources including messaging and conversations. The program will also enable sophisticated search of stored language information and analysis of the information by increasing the capability of machines for deep language comprehension. FY 2012 Plans: - Formulate approaches for automatically processing informal genres, interpreting poor pronunciation, coping with incorrect/ incomplete syntax, resolving references, and correlating co-references. - Conceptualize approaches for comprehension of colloquialisms and idiomatic speech. - Enable machines to carry on multi-modal dialogues with humans and to comprehend concepts and generate responses in multilingual environments.- - 15.000 Title: Spoken Language Communication and Translation System for Tactical Use (TRANSTAC) Description: The Spoken Language Communication and Translation System for Tactical Use (TRANSTAC) program is developing technologies that enable robust, spontaneous, two-way tactical speech communications between our warfighters and native speakers. The program addresses the issues surrounding the rapid deployment of new languages, especially low-resource languages and dialects. TRANSTAC is building upon existing speech translation platforms to create a rapidly deployable language tool that will meet the military's language translation needs. TRANSTAC is currently focusing on key languages of the Middle East region.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Cyber Technology project supports long term national security requirements through the development and demonstration of technology to increase the security of military information systems. Over the past decade the DoD has embraced net-centric warfare to enable geographically dispersed forces to attain a high level of shared battlespace awareness that is exploited to achieve strategic, operational, and tactical objectives. This involves networking people, platforms, weapons, sensors, and decision aids to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. The results are networked forces that operate with increased speed and synchronization and are capable of achieving massed effects without the physical massing of forces as required in the past. Adversaries seek to limit this \"force multiplier\" effect through cyber attacks intended to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems. Due to its importance and the emergence of these threats, cyberspace is now recognized as a critical warfighting domain, equal in importance to the more traditional domains of sea, air, land, and space. Technologies developed under the Cyber Technology project will ensure DoD cyber-capabilities survive adversary cyber attacks. Promising technologies will transition to system-level projects. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Title: Cyber Situational Awareness and Response (CSAR) Description: The Cyber Situational Awareness and Response (CSAR) program will develop technologies to enable awareness and understanding of the cyber environment as required for decision making for defensive and/or responsive actions. This includes attack detection, characterization, and assessment, attacker identification, and information/system provenance. Cyber situational awareness is made increasingly difficult by efforts of attackers to elude detection. Approaches to cyber situational awareness will include techniques to exploit data derived from events on hosts and networks that may be quite subtle when examined in isolation but more apparent when correlated in time and space across an enterprise. CSAR will also create new graphical interfaces and Web 2.0 mashups that enable intuitive visualization of anomalous events on hosts and networks suggestive of cyber attack. Toward this end, CSAR will develop, apply and assess pattern detection and analysis and machine learning techniques to create a real-time network forensics capability that can serve as the basis for rapid response capabilities including network reconstitution. This is an area where metrics are difficult to obtain and so CSAR will extend operationally- meaningful measures such as mean-time-to-detect and false-alarm rate to estimate the efficacy of schemes proposed to detect important classes of attacks. FY 2012 Plans: - Identify events on hosts and networks having the greatest potential to provide indications and warning of cyber attack. - Conceptualize new graphical interfaces that enable intuitive visualization of anomalous events on hosts and networks suggestive of cyber attack.- - 17.500 Volume 1 - 86UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 27 of 27 R-1 Line Item #13Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT IT-05: CYBER TECHNOLOGY B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 - Develop canonical classes of cyber attacks and operationally-meaningful metrics to estimate the efficacy of cyber situational awareness and response schemes. Title: Cyber Camouflage, Concealment, and Deception (C3D) Description: The Cyber Camouflage, Concealment, and Deception (C3D) project will develop novel approaches for protecting cyber systems that mimic camouflage concealment, and deception in the physical world. C3D will enable the creation, deployment, management, and control of synthetic entities, objects, resources, and identities that create uncertainties for attackers and make their task significantly more difficult, perhaps even intractable. With C3D, infrastructure and other enterprise resources such as switches, servers, and storage could be virtually replicated to confound enemy targeting. Multiple C3D copies of file systems, only one of which holds correct information, will require attackers (including insiders) to either exfiltrate many times the data they would normally (and then work to identify which data is correct ) or to guess which file system contains operationally meaningful data, thereby greatly decreasing their odds for success. Ultimately, C3D will produce intelligent artificial users that can defeat phishing attacks. C3D will make attackers work harder and take more risks to achieve their goals and will enhance the effectiveness of conventional cyber defenses. FY 2012 Plans: - Develop a framework for the creation, deployment, management, and control of synthetic entities, objects, resources, and identities on enterprise information systems. - Develop approaches for creating multiple plausible versions of file systems and data where provenance will be uncertain for the attacker. - Explore techniques capable of deceiving an attacker into believing they have executed a successful phishing attack when in fact they have been deceived by an intelligent synthetic user.- - 15.833 Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals - - 33.333 C.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Cognitive Computing Systems program element is budgeted in the Applied Research budget activity because it is developing the next revolution in computing and information processing technology that will enable computational systems to have reasoning and learning capabilities and levels of autonomy far beyond those of today's systems. The ability to reason, learn and adapt will raise computing to new levels of capability and powerful new applications. The Cognitive Computing project will develop core technologies that enable computing systems to learn, reason and apply knowledge gained through experience, and respond intelligently to things that have not been previously encountered. These technologies will lead to systems demonstrating increased self-reliance, self-adaptive reconfiguration, intelligent negotiation, cooperative behavior and survivability with reduced human intervention. The Collective Cognitive Systems and Interfaces project will dramatically improve warfighter and commander effectiveness and productivity using advanced cognitive approaches that enable faster, better informed, and more highly coordinated actions than those of our enemies. This will be accomplished by developing revolutionary methods that increase our information processing capabilities, enhance our situational awareness, and enable more cohesive group action by our forces. Critical technical areas addressed in this project include automated coordinated decision support, information sharing, and ensured communications. B.

A key objective is intelligent control of mobile manipulators to independently perform subtasks over a broad range of domains of interest to the warfighter, thereby reducing operator workload, time on target, training time, bandwidth, and hardware complexity. Current mobile manipulation systems have many limitations. For example, while they perform well in certain mission environments, they have yet to demonstrate proficiency and flexibility across multiple mission environments; they require burdensome human interaction and the full attention of the operator; and the time required to complete tasks generally exceeds military users' desires. ARM will create mobile manipulators with a high degree of autonomy capable of serving multiple military purposes across a wide variety of application domains, including but not limited to counter-improvised explosive device, countermine, search and rescue, weapons support, checkpoint and access control, explosive ordnance disposal, and combat casualty care (including battlefield extraction). ARM will enable autonomous mobile manipulation systems to surpass the performance level of remote manipulation systems that are controlled directly by a human operator. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Developed a manipulator platform--a base with arm and sensor heads, each with a multi-fingered hand--to serve as a common development platform.16.490 20.500 11.674 Volume 1 - 91UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 4 of 15 R-1 Line Item #14Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602304E: COGNITIVE COMPUTING SYSTEMSPROJECT COG-02: COGNITIVE COMPUTING B.

Title: Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL) Description: The Personalized Assistant that Learns (PAL) program enables intelligence in information processing systems so critical DoD systems can better support the warfighter. PAL systems will have embedded learning capabilities that will allow them to retain prior learned knowledge, apply this knowledge to new scenarios and ultimately provide faster and more effective assistance. Overall, the ability to learn will enable the performance of a PAL system to improve over time. Cognitive systems technologies developed in this program will be applied and demonstrated in ongoing and future Command and Control Systems programs. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Fine tuned all algorithms for scale-up, response time and throughput. - Finalized human-computer interface and completed the debugging of all PAL software. - Extended the capability of PAL software to learn semantic representations from end users. - Assessed the military impact of enabling users to rapidly integrate and manipulate data, software services and web content.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 learning challenges in processing of sensory inputs, language acquisition, combinatorial algorithms, strategic analysis, planning, reasoning, and reflection. One very promising approach involves transfer learning techniques that transfer knowledge and skills learned for specific situations to novel, unanticipated situations and thereby enable learning systems to perform appropriately and effectively the first time a novel situation is encountered. This is essential because most military operations occur in ever- changing environments; U.S. forces and systems must be able to act appropriately and effectively the first time each novel situation is encountered. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Formulated learning approaches applicable to processing of sensory inputs. - Developed techniques to enable generalization of knowledge across application areas such as language acquisition, strategic analysis, planning, reasoning, and reflection. FY 2011 Plans: - Implement and test machine learning approaches on selected problems in processing of sensory inputs, language acquisition, strategic analysis, planning, reasoning, and reflection. - Develop a platform for visual and tactile input to ground concepts such as objects and actions for language learning. Title: Biomimetic Computing Description: Biomimetic Computing's goal is to develop the critical technologies necessary for the realization of a cognitive artifact comprised of biologically derived simulations of the brain embodied in a mechanical (robotic) system, which is further embedded in a physical environment. These devices will be a new generation of autonomous flexible machines that are capable of pattern recognition and adaptive behavior and that demonstrate a level of learning and cognition. Key enabling technologies include simulation of brain-inspired neural systems and special purpose digital processing systems designed for this purpose.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 - Demonstrate an autonomous robot with a simulated neural system capable of mentally rotating images in order to grasp complex three dimensional objects. Title: Integrated Learning Description: The Integrated Learning program created a new computer learning paradigm in which systems learn complex workflows from warfighters while the warfighters perform their regular duties. The effort focused on military planning tasks such as air operations center planning and military medical logistics. With this learning technology, it will be possible to create many different types of military decision support systems that learn by watching experts rather than relying on expensive and error prone hand-encoded knowledge. The new learning paradigm differs from conventional machine learning in that it does not rely on large amounts of carefully crafted training data. Rather, in the new paradigm the learner works to \"figure things out\" by combining many different types of learning, reasoning, and knowledge. Such a cognitive system will ultimately need the capability to build and update its own internal model of the world and the objects in it without human input. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Expanded the scope of the problems being learned so the systems learn multi-user task models. - Modified the integrated learning systems to be able to abstract the details of the process it is learning and learn general process or meta process knowledge. - Extended capabilities of the integrated learning systems so they can share information (low-level data, mid-level hypothesis, and high-level conclusions) with other learners. - Evaluated systems by having them compete against expert humans.5.102 - - Title: Bootstrapped Learning Description: The Bootstrapped Learning program provided computers with the capability to learn complex concepts the same way people do: from a customized curriculum designed to teach a hierarchy of concepts at increasing levels of complexity. Learning each new level depends on having successfully mastered the previous level's learning. In addition, the learning program will be \"reprogrammable\" in the field using the same modes of natural instruction used to train people without the need for software developers to modify the software code. At each level, a rich set of knowledge sources (such as training manuals, examples, expert behaviors, simulators, and references and specifications that are typically used by people learning to perform complex tasks) will be combined and used to generate concepts and a similar set of knowledge sources for the next level. This will enable rapid learning of complex high-level concepts, a capability which is essential for autonomous military systems that will need to understand not only what to do but, why they are doing it, and when what they are doing may no longer be appropriate.

Title: Machine Reading and Reasoning Technology Description: The Machine Reading and Reasoning Technology program is developing enabling technologies to acquire, integrate, and use high performance reasoning strategies in knowledge-rich domains. Such technologies will provide DoD decision makers with rapid, relevant knowledge from a broad spectrum of sources that may be dynamic and/or inconsistent. To address the significant challenges of context, temporal information, complex belief structures, and uncertainty, new capabilities are needed to extract key information and metadata, and to exploit these via context-capable search and inference (both deductive and inductive). Machine reading addresses the prohibitive cost of handcrafting information by replacing the expert, and associated knowledge engineer, with un-supervised or self-supervised learning systems that \"read\" natural text and insert it into AI knowledge bases especially encoded to support subsequent machine reasoning. Machine reading requires the integration of multiple technologies: natural language processing must be used to transform the text into candidate internal representations, and knowledge representation and reasoning techniques must be used to test this new information to determine how it is to be integrated into the system's evolving models so that it can be used for effective problem solving. These concepts and technology development efforts will continue in PE 0602305E, Project MCN-01 beginning in FY 2011. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Demonstrated the ability of a system to acquire and organize factual information directly from unstructured narrative text in multiple domains. - Developed knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities to support simple temporal reasoning using ordered relationships in text. - Demonstrated the ability of machine reading systems to extract knowledge from texts that employ varied writing styles and require contextualization for proper interpretation. - Demonstrated human-level performance by machines at categorizing text quality preparatory to automatic knowledge extraction.17.404 - - Title: Mind's Eye Description: The Mind's Eye program, previously part of the Machine Reading and Reasoning thrust, is developing in machines, a capability that currently exists only in animals: \"visual intelligence.\" Machines enhanced by Mind's Eye technology will have the capability to learn generally applicable and generative representations of action between objects in a scene, directly from visual inputs, and be able to reason over those learned representations. While current research in machine vision has been5.000 - - Volume 1 - 95UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 8 of 15 R-1 Line Item #14Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602304E: COGNITIVE COMPUTING SYSTEMSPROJECT COG-02: COGNITIVE COMPUTING B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Collective Cognitive Systems and Interfaces project will dramatically improve warfighter and commander effectiveness and productivity using advanced cognitive approaches that enable faster, better informed, and more highly coordinated actions than those of our enemies. This will be accomplished by developing revolutionary methods that increase our information processing capabilities, enhance our situational awareness, and enable more cohesive group action by our forces. Critical technical areas addressed in this project include automated decision support, information sharing, ensured communications, and advanced informatics. Cognitive decision support tools reason about tasks, timings, and interactions so that when plans change or the enemy does not respond as anticipated, U.S. forces can quickly adapt. The quality of such decisions and the effectiveness of our actions depend critically on our ability to take full advantage of all available information in a rapid and flexible manner. This requires the capability to share information and to automatically integrate distributed information bases for broad tactical battlespace awareness. Team cohesion requires effective and reliable communication in difficult environments such as urban settings where radio signal propagation is complex. Here the approach is to develop cognitive communications management and control algorithms that reason about channel conditions, higher-level application connectivity requirements and related factors, and decide what parameters each radio will use. Finally, the use of advanced informatics will help guide user's to information most relevant to them, assist caregivers with treatment, destigmatize the psychological health process, and help alert DoD to emerging psychological health trends and crises. The suite of programs under this project will significantly advance the military's ability to successfully deal with complex situations in operational environments. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Title: Transformative Apps Description: The goal of the Transformative Apps effort is to put mobile, tactical applications (apps) in the hands of warfighters and to create a new military apps marketplace with a vibrant apps development community. The effort will demonstrate a broad array of apps supporting command and control, situational awareness, collaboration, geo-spatial visualization, training, and language translation. Many of these applications will require ongoing network connectivity; others will require occasional data synchronization. While commercial networks benefit from robust cellular networks and the presence of large data centers, tactical networks are notorious for their limited bandwidth, frequent outages, and high-latency links. Specialized backend architecture and middleware will be developed to enable apps to run while providing engaging user experience and without over-burdening the network. Of particular importance is development of a new data synchronization architecture between the handhelds and the backend computing/storage nodes. Additionally, appropriate middleware services and libraries will be developed to facilitate shared capabilities such as map viewing, apps management, and collection of logs, usage statistics and user feedback. Apps, together with handhelds and networks, will be tested in different training environments as well as in deployed environments. Performance and usage will be carefully tracked and user feedback collected to guide rapid enhancement of apps.

Title: Healing Heroes - Medical Description: The Healing Heroes program will develop automated information systems that identify group and individual trends indicative of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI), anomaly detection algorithms to identify emerging physical and psychological crises, and provide guided access to information and educational materials. This will complement commercial on-line resources, interactive media, and social networks that supplement traditional healthcare options but have not focused on issues specific to the Warfighter. Healing Heroes will integrate social networking and medical informatics technologies in a secure web-based platform that provides both functionality and privacy to the user. The program will also provide tools for spouses, caregivers, and children, and will leverage related DoD family outreach efforts. Healing Heroes recognizes that security and privacy are critical to user acceptance and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance and so will incorporate strong authentication and other security mechanisms as needed to protect patient data. The program will also develop partnerships with key DoD organizations working in this area, including the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury, the Defense Medical Research and Development Program6.000 14.948 9.079 Volume 1 - 98UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 11 of 15 R-1 Line Item #14Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602304E: COGNITIVE COMPUTING SYSTEMSPROJECT COG-03: COLLECTIVE COGNITIVE SYSTEMS AND INTERFACES B.

Title: Cognitive Networking Description: The Cognitive Networking program will develop technologies that provide information systems and communication networks with the ability to maintain and self-optimize their own functionality, reliability and survivability. These technologies will allow the military to focus its critical manpower resources on the mission rather than on the maintenance of its information systems and network infrastructure. Cognitive information processing will be used to optimize networked communications based on current conditions, past experience and high-level user guidance. The Cognitive Networking program is also addressing the warfighter's need for actionable situational awareness in complex radio frequency (RF) environments. This work leverages advances in software-defined radio technology to achieve specific military goals. Cognitive Networking funds three programs: SAPIENT, LANDroids, and BOSS. The Situation-Aware Protocols in Edge Network Technologies (SAPIENT) effort will develop a new generation of cognitive protocol architectures to replace conventional protocols that fare poorly in extreme network conditions and do not provide adequate service for key applications. Technology developed in SAPIENT will have military utility wherever tactical communications are deployed. SAPIENT architectures will represent awareness with a knowledge base that is updated based on specification and observation. SAPIENT technology enables the automatic adaptation of protocols to the operational environment to dramatically reduce the effect of network impairments on applications while demonstrating a positive trend in capability as new situations are encountered and learned. The Local Area Network droids (LANdroids) effort will give warfighters reliable communications in urban settings. LANdroids will accomplish this by creating robotic radio relay nodes that move autonomously to configure and maintain a communications mesh by reasoning about their positions relative to one another and relative to the warfighters. LANdroids will move as the warfighters move with the goal of maintaining warfighter connectivity throughout their operations. LANdroids will be pocket-sized so warfighters can carry several and drop or deploy them as they move through an area.

The Brood of Spectrum Supremacy (BOSS) effort will provide actionable situational awareness to the warfighter in complex radio frequency (RF) environments. BOSS adds collaborative processing capabilities to tactical software-defined radios to achieve specific military goals. BOSS exploits cooperative use of computational, communication and sensory capabilities in a software radio to generate breakthrough capabilities in the warfighter knowledge of their surroundings, with a particular focus on RF-rich urban operations. Ultimately this effort will develop Software Communications Architecture (SCA)-compliant waveforms suitable for implementation on a tactical software radio system.

Title: Advanced Soldier Sensor Information System and Technology (ASSIST) Description: The Advanced Soldier Sensor Information System and Technology (ASSIST) effort will develop an integrated information system that exploits soldier-worn sensors to augment the soldier's ability to capture, report, and share information in the field. This includes an integrated system using advanced technologies for processing, digitizing and analyzing information captured and collected by soldier-worn sensors. ASSIST draws heavily on the experiences and lessons learned from previous Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) missions and other surveillance and reconnaissance missions. A baseline system will demonstrate the capture of video/still images together with voice annotations and location-stamping. The advanced system will demonstrate automatic identification and extraction of key objects, events, activities and scenes from soldier-collected data. The system will create knowledge representations that will serve as an input to an array of warfighter products including augmented maps, situational analysis tools, and query and answer capabilities. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Developed the means for efficient transfer of ASSIST information across Army tactical networks. - Integrated with Army battlefield command systems by addressing system latencies and data exchange formats and modalities. - Demonstrated an accelerated capability for recognizing new classes of events, objects and activities. - Integrated biometric feature extraction and comparison capabilities into Tactical Ground Reporting System (TIGR).

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 The Digital Object Storage and Retrieval (DOSR) effort pursued a network-based approach to information storage and management that will enable a network-based repository to hold all digital information. DOSR technology enables and facilitates controlled access to information by approved and authenticated users across administrative domains, and in this fashion it will enable transparent sharing of information across the enterprise. The Data Integration and Exploitation SystEm that Learns (DIESEL) effort addressed a significant problem facing the warfighter: the lack of interoperability of stovepiped information systems. DIESEL created a new suite of intelligent information integration tools that automatically understand heterogeneous information systems and integrate them into the existing information environment. The result is more complete and reliable information for better decision-making by warfighters. FY 2010 Accomplishments: Digital Object Storage and Retrieval (DOSR) - Completed final assessment of architectural approaches to secure controlled access.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Machine Intelligence project is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because it is developing technologies that will enable computing systems to extract and encode information from dynamic and stored data, observations, and experience, and to derive new knowledge, answer questions, reach conclusions, and propose explanations. Enabling computing systems with machine intelligence in this manner is now of critical importance because sensor, information, and communication systems continuously generate and deliver data at rates beyond which humans can assimilate, understand, and act. Since its creation over 50 years ago, artificial intelligence (AI) has gone through several phases. Initially, AI emphasized rule-based and symbolic approaches. These were eventually reconceived using a human-intelligence paradigm (\"cognitive computing\"). Recently, a more powerful approach has emerged, with rule-based, symbolic and human-oriented approaches combined with large-scale statistical approaches that make explicit use of massive distributed data and information bases. These data/information bases are curated (e.g., machine-filtered or human-selected) and raw (e.g., as originally obtained and perhaps of unknown provenance); structured (e.g., tabular or relational) and unstructured (e.g., text documents, multi-media files); static (e.g., historical, unchanging) and dynamic (e.g., real-time sensor data). This explosion in available data/information, combined with the ready availability of inexpensive mass storage and ubiquitous, inexpensive, computation-on-demand, provide the foundation for entirely new machine intelligence capabilities. The technologies developed in the Machine Intelligence project will result in revolutionary capabilities in military command and control, intelligence, decision-making, and situational awareness/indications and warning for a complex, global environment where traditional (e.g., nation-states) and non-traditional (e.g., trans-national) actors and new classes of cyber-physical-human threats have become the status quo.

C. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Title: Machine *Previously funded in PE 0602304E, Project COG-02. The Machine Reading and Reasoning Technology program will develop enabling technologies to acquire, integrate, and use high performance reasoning strategies in knowledge-rich domains. Such technologies will provide DoD decision makers with rapid, relevant knowledge from a broad spectrum of sources that may be dynamic and/or inconsistent. To address the significant challenges of context, temporal information, complex belief structures, and uncertainty, new capabilities are needed to extract key information and metadata, and to exploit these via context-capable search and inference. Cognitive inference has traditionally emphasized deduction via theorem-proving and induction via statistical techniques, but abduction - also known as \"inference to the best explanation\"- is also likely to play a large role. Machine Reading addresses the prohibitive cost of handcrafting information by replacing the expert, and associated knowledge engineer, with un-supervised or self-supervised learning systems, systems that \"read\" natural text and insert it into artificial intelligence knowledge bases, i.e. data stores especially encoded to support subsequent machine reasoning. Machine Reading requires the integration of multiple technologies: natural language processing must be used to transform the text into candidate internal representations, and knowledge representation and reasoning techniques must be used to test this new information to determine how it is to be integrated into the system's evolving models so that it can be used for effective problem solving. FY 2011 Plans: - Extend knowledge extraction capabilities of machine reading systems to acquire simple relationship information in addition to factual data. - Force generality of machine reading systems through introduction of multiple, hidden domains. - Develop knowledge extraction, representation, and reasoning capabilities to support spatial, complex temporal, and event reasoning. FY 2012 Plans: - Develop capability to automatically learn reading patterns by addressing ambiguity resolution and discovering inference patterns. - Demonstrate temporal reasoning over facts and events extracted from text. - Begin developing military transition with DoD organization focused on semantic understanding of heterogeneous knowledge sources in a targeted domain.- 23.896 29.859 Volume 1 - 106UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 3 of 4 R-1 Line Item #15Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602305E: MACHINE INTELLIGENCE C.

Title: Mind's Eye* Description: * Previously funded in PE 0602304E, COG-02. The Mind's Eye program is developing a machine-based capability that currently exists only in animals: \"visual intelligence,\" the capability to learn generally applicable and generative representations of action between objects in a scene, directly from visual inputs, and then to reason over those learned representations. Mind's Eye will add the perceptual and cognitive underpinnings for reasoning about the action in scenes, enabling the creation of a more complete narrative for the visual field. The technologies developed under Mind's Eye will have broad applicability in robotics and surveillance. FY 2011 Plans: - Develop initial visual intelligence implementation and evaluate on relevant dataset(s). - Identify systems integration opportunities and perform initial systems engineering analysis. FY 2012 Plans: - Develop improved visual intelligence capabilities based on initial assessment(s) and evaluate on additional relevant dataset(s). - Integrate visual intelligence into a prototype smart camera and perform concept demonstration.- 10.000 16.000 Title: Web-Scale Information Integration Description: The Web-Scale Information Integration program will create technologies to automatically integrate distributed information bases for broad strategic and tactical battlespace awareness, including technologies to automate the integration of multiple media (text, video, and digital photographs) as well as analyze, index, and store that media, so that it can be easily queried and retrieved by users across the DoD enterprise. A key enabler is the development of advanced document/content/ information-object services including indexing, metadata creation, search, versioning, records management, schema alignment, and information visualization. Program interest extends to semantic web technologies whereby the semantics of information and services are made explicit, enabling machines to understand and satisfy the information requests of users (people and machines). This includes the technologies needed to automatically create and maintain, in real-time, encyclopedic knowledge of critical military, scientific, economic and social-cultural information in formats that are both human readable and machine processable. Such encyclopedic knowledge of the world will provide fundamental context to counter-insurgency, global strike and (near-) peer conflict including strategy, rules of engagement, planning and execution, while semantically-enabled search and processing will automate information discovery and manipulation to enable better decision-making for warfighters.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Description: This thrust is developing unique and unconventional approaches to ensure that soldiers are protected against a wide variety of naturally occurring, indigenous or engineered threats. Past successes in this effort have come from developing therapeutics that are designed to work against broad classes of pathogens. Work in this area has also uncovered new approaches to therapeutics that, rather than attacking specific pathogens, enhance innate human immune mechanisms against broad classes of pathogens. Integral to these efforts is the development of methods that rapidly identify a broad spectrum of pathogens. Not only will these approaches be more effective against known pathogens, they also promise to offer substantial protection against unknown pathogens including engineered and emerging pathogens from third-world environments. A current emphasis is on the discovery and development of technologies that will allow a rapid response (within weeks) to unanticipated threats, whether they are naturally encountered emerging diseases or agents from intentional attack. This thrust has a goal of radically transforming the protein design process by researching and developing new mathematical and biochemical approaches to the in silico design of proteins with specific functions. This significantly decreases the time needed and increases the probability of success for biological warfare vaccine development. An additional focus is the development of entirely new technologies that will allow the rapid, cost-effective manufacture of complex therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies and vaccine antigens; these technologies will reduce the time for biologics manufacture from years (or even decades) to only weeks. The Unconventional Therapeutics efforts will be funded in the newly created Budget Activity 2 Program Element 0602115E, beginning in FY 2012.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Title: Anti-Submarine Vessel (ACTUV) Description: The Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) program has three primary goals: (1) to build and demonstrate an X-Ship with beyond state-of-the-art platform performance based on clean sheet design for unmanned operation, (2) demonstrate the technical viability of operating autonomous unmanned ships at theater or global ranges under a sparse remote supervisory control model, and (3) leverage unique ACTUV characteristics to transition a game changing ASW capability to the Navy. By establishing the premise that a human is never intended to step on board at any point in the operational cycle, ACTUV concepts can take advantage of an unexplored design space that eliminates or modifies conventional ship design constraints such as internal arrangement, reserve buoyancy, and dynamic stability in order to achieve disproportionate speed, endurance, and payload fraction. The resulting unmanned naval vessels must possess sufficient situational awareness and autonomous behavior capability to operate in full compliance with the rules of the road and maritime law to support safe navigation for operational deployments spanning thousands of miles and months of time. When coupled with innovative sensor technologies, the ACTUV system provides a low cost unmanned system with a fundamentally different operational risk calculus that enables game changing capability to detect and track even the quietest diesel electric submarine threats. Key technical areas include unmanned naval vessel design methodologies, ship system reliability, high fidelity sensor fusion to provide an accurate world model for autonomous operation, novel application of sensors for ASW tracking, and holistic system integration due to unique optimization opportunities of the ACTUV system. This effort will also explore a Tactically Expandable Maritime Platform (TEMP) concept to develop and demonstrate macroscopic integrated systems built up from International Organization for Standardization (ISO) modular technologies that can be operated from unmodified commercial container ships and deliver credible naval capability for high priority missions. TEMP will develop critical enabling modular technologies and evaluate the feasible range of naval missions that can be serviced from this highly flexible and cost effective unconventional force structure model.

It also demands new advances in perception, autonomy and locomotion to enable the system to make progress in cluttered, shallow waters, including occasionally exiting the water, traversing ground such as sandbars, and then reentering. The Caiman mission is targeted for the interface between water and land, which will result in the vehicle being able to access riverine and swamp areas which are currently inaccessible. FY 2011 Plans: - Develop, analyze, and assess preliminary designs to achieve a system capable of a hundred kilometers of travel over a 7 day mission. - Simulate water to land to water transitions to validate design.- 6.000 6.855 Volume 1 - 119UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 6 of 35 R-1 Line Item #21Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGYPROJECT TT-03: NAVAL WARFARE TECHNOLOGY B.

Title: Very High Speed Vessel (VHSV) Description: The Very High Speed Vessel (VHSV) program will explore the development of a small tactical surface vessel capable of protecting high value naval vessels in contested littoral environments. The program will evaluate tactical mobility, mission endurance, lethality, and survivability that is well beyond that of any current or proposed littoral warfare platform. The vessel will be designed to operate as an unmanned naval combat system with an integrated control system and weapons suite which will be optimized to defend against irregular naval warfare threats such as fast inshore attack crafts, high speed swarming combatant boats, and conventional diesel submarines operating in shallow coastal waters. The VHSV system will leverage emerging developments in reconfigurable hull forms, fluid drag reduction, hybrid naval propulsion design, and dynamic control in fully cavitated flow to develop a vessel with significantly superior maximum speed, endurance, and seakeeping in elevated sea states. FY 2011 Plans: - Conduct military and tactical utility studies and establish seaframe and weapons development metrics. - Perform advanced hullform technology studies and establish vessel performance limits.- 4.207 - Title: Super-Fast Submerged Transport (Underwater Express) Description: The Super-Fast Submerged Transport (Underwater Express) program will explore the application of supercavitation technology to underwater vehicles, enabling high speed transport of personnel and/or supplies. The inherent advantages of traveling underwater are: the ability to transit undetected, no radar or visible signature, and avoidance of rough sea conditions that may limit or deny mission execution. Supercavitation places the vehicle inside a cavity where vapor replaces the water, and drag due to fluid viscosity is reduced by orders of magnitude, thus reducing the power requirement dramatically. This program will use modeling, simulation, experiments and testing to develop the understanding of the physical phenomena associated with supercavitation and the application to underwater vehicles. Innovative failsafe controls will be required for stability and maneuverability at speed. The program will culminate in an at-sea demonstration of a submerged unmanned vehicle capable of supercavitating operations and autonomous maneuvering.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 - Develop initial virtual environments for assessment in two domains and produce prototype simulation based on a reconfigurable framework. compressed magnetic flux generator (CMFG)-driven magneto hydrodynamically formed metal jets and self-forging penetrators (SFP) with significantly improved performance over explosively formed jets (EFJ) and fragments. EFJ and SFP are used for precision strike against targets such as armored vehicles and reinforced structures. Current technology uses chemical explosive energy to form the jets and fragments. This is highly inefficient and requires precise machining of the metal liners from which the fragments and jets are formed. Generating multiple jets or fragments from a single explosive is difficult and the timing of the multiple jets or fragments cannot be controlled. MAHEM offers the potential for higher efficiency, greater control, the ability to generate and accurately time multiple jets and fragments from a single charge, and the potential for aimable, multiple warheads (multimodal warhead) with a much higher EFJ velocity, hence increased lethality precision, than conventional EFJ/SFP. MAHEM could be packaged into a missile, projectile or other platform, and delivered close to target for final engagement. This could provide the warfighter with a means to address stressing missions such as: lightweight active self-protection for vehicles (potential defeat mechanism for a kinetic energy round), counter armor (passive, reactive, and active), mine countermeasures, and anti-ship cruise missile final layer of defense. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Using theoretical models, began design of flux compression generator (FCG) components in preparation for fabrication and testing of the armature and stator configuration with static and dynamic loads. - Designed and modeled shaped charge liners and magnetically formed penetrators (MFPs) that will provide maximum penetration against hardened targets of interest.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Title: High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System (HELLADS) Description: The goal of the High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System (HELLADS) program is to develop a high-energy laser weapon system (150 kW) with an order of magnitude reduction in weight compared to existing laser systems. With a weight goal of <5 kg/kW, HELLADS will enable high energy lasers (HELs) to be integrated onto tactical aircraft, and will significantly increase engagement ranges compared to ground-based systems, enabling high precision, low collateral damage, and rapid engagement of fleeting targets for both offensive and defensive missions. The HELLADS program has completed the design and demonstration of a revolutionary prototype unit cell laser module. That unit cell demonstrated power output and is demonstrating optical wavefront performance that supports the goal of a lightweight and compact 150 kW high energy tactical laser weapon system. Two unit cell module designs with integrated power and thermal management systems were fabricated and tested; they demonstrated an output power exceeding 34 kW. Based on the results of the unit cell demonstration, additional laser modules will be replicated and connected to produce a 150 kW laser that will be demonstrated in a laboratory environment. The 150 kW laser will then be integrated with beam control, prime power, thermal management, safety, and command and control subsystems all based upon existing technologies to produce a ground-based laser weapon system field demonstrator. The capability to shoot down tactical targets such as surface-to-air missiles and rockets and the capability to perform ultra-precise offensive engagements will be demonstrated in a realistic ground test environment. Additional funding for this integration effort will be provided for HELLADS testing in Project NET-01, PE 0603766E starting in FY 2011.

Title: Aero-Adaptive/Aero-Optic Beam Control (ABC) Description: The goal of the Aero-Adaptive/Aero-Optic Beam Control (ABC) program is to improve the performance of high- energy lasers on tactical aircraft, against targets in the aft field-of-regard. In order to achieve a large field-of-regard, current optical turret designs protrude into the flow. This causes severe optical distortions in the aft field-of-regard due to turbulence in the wake and the unsteady shock movement over the aperture. These distortions decrease the power flux on target (the measure of lethality for a directed energy system) and consequently limit the utility of directed energy systems to targets in the forward field-of-regard. This program will optimize flow control strategies for pointing angles in the aft field-of-regard. The program will also explore the ability to synchronize the flow control system with adaptive optics. This effort will initially focus on wind tunnel testing to prove the feasibility of steady and periodic flow control techniques to reduce or regularize the large scale turbulent structures surrounding an optical turret. These tests will culminate in a hardware-in-the-loop demonstration utilizing flow control with an adaptive optics system in a full-scale wind tunnel test for the turret. Following successful wind tunnel demonstrations, a preliminary design of a flight test turret incorporating flow control will be undertaken. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Developed methods, designed and fabricated optics, electronics, and mechanics for full-scale wind tunnel test of turret. - Conducted wind tunnel tests of selected turret to characterize the uncontrolled flow in preparation for flow control entries.4.446 5.100 5.084 Volume 1 - 131UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 18 of 35 R-1 Line Item #21Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGYPROJECT TT-06: ADVANCED TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY B.

Each array element will possess an adaptive-optic capability to minimize beam divergence in the presence of atmospheric turbulence, together with wide-field-of-view beam steering for target tracking. With each Excalibur array element powered by high power fiber laser amplifiers (at up to 3 kilowatts per amplifier), high power air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements will be enabled that were previously infeasible because of laser system size and weight. In addition, this program will also develop kilowatt-class arrays of diode lasers that will provide the higher spatial and temporal bandwidths needed to correct for the increased air turbulence effects encountered in ground-to-ground engagements. Excalibur arrays will be conformal to aircraft surfaces and scalable in size and power by adding elements to the array. By defending airborne platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles against proliferated, deployed, and next-generation man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), Excalibur will enable these reconnaissance platforms to fly at lower altitude and obtain truly persistent, all-weather ground reconnaissance despite low-lying cloud cover. Further capabilities include multichannel laser communications, target identification, tracking, designation, precision defeat with minimal collateral effects as well as other applications. The Excalibur Budget Activity 2 program will develop the core set of laser components for efficiently driving elements of high- power electronically steerable optical arrays, namely, high-power coherently- and spectrally-combinable fiber laser amplifiers, high-brightness laser diodes for efficiently pumping the fiber laser amplifiers, and kW-class single-mode laser diode arrays.

Title: RealWorld Description: The RealWorld program exploits technical innovation and integration to provide any U.S. warfighter with the ability to open a laptop computer and rehearse a specific mission in the relevant geo-specific terrain, with realistic physics. Because the system will be scalable and distributed, a warfighter can practice by himself, in a small group, or with as many other warfighters as needed for the mission over a local or distributed network, and across all relevant platforms (dismounts, vehicles, helicopters, and fast movers). Most important is the understanding that RealWorld is not a static simulation; it is a simulation builder with applications across the spectrum of modern kinetic and non-kinetic warfare. The program is building tools that allow warfighters to rapidly and easily build their own missions though the introduction of new methodology for building simulation software. This methodology and adherence to a highly modular approach will cause a fundamental paradigm shift in the acquisition, as well as the construction, of DoD modeling and simulation products. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Scaled to 1000 warfighter entities. - Integrated meteorological capability so real-time weather can be imported into training and rehearsal scenarios. - Demonstrated integration of data from Google Earth. - Transformed pictures taken by a cell phone camera into a 3-D model capable of being ingested by a real-time 3-D engine.

Such a system could enable applications such as remote detection of biological and chemical agents, free space communications, advanced photolithography as well as long-range high-resolution laser-radar systems. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Developed concepts for power scaling of pulsed fiber lasers beyond the fundamental nonlinear limitations of individual amplifiers. Title: Efficient Mid-Wave Infrared Lasers (EMIL) Description: The Efficient Mid-Wave Infrared Lasers (EMIL) program evaluated efficient solid-state coherent sources that can cover the atmospheric transmission bands in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR; 3-5 micrometers). Infrared countermeasure (IRCM) systems in particular depend on intense sources at these bands. The current generation IRCM systems utilize diode-pumped Thulium (Tm) lasers used to pump optical parametric oscillators, most commonly based on zinc germanium phosphide. The lasers developed in this program operate across the three relevant bands within the MWIR at 10 W power with wall plug efficiencies of at least 10 percent. By virtue of the enormous volumetric reduction (100-1000 times), power reduction (ten times), and superior pulse format (cw-operation), such sources are enabling new architectures and approaches permitting IRCM systems to be deployed on platforms (e.g., rotocraft) which are highly vulnerable to Man Portable Air Defense Systems and other threats but for which current IRCM systems are prohibitive or are inadequate (e.g., unable to defeat staring sensors).

With a flyable/roadable vehicle, the warfighter has the ability to avoid road obstructions as well as improvised explosive devices and ambush threats, providing flexibility for tactical military and personnel transport missions. The primary focus of this program is to demonstrate the ability to build a ground vehicle that is capable of configuring into a VTOL air vehicle that provides sufficient flight performance and range, while carrying a payload that is representative of four troops with gear. The enabling technologies of interest include hybrid electric drive, advanced batteries, stowable wing structures, ducted fan propulsion, lightweight materials, and advanced sensors and flight controls for stable transition from vertical to horizontal flight. TX vehicles could be dispatched for downed airman recovery, for evacuating injured personnel from difficult-to-access locations, or to resupply isolated small units. TX will also be suitable for enhanced company operations concepts which would provide the warfighter/team increased situational awareness for operations in an urban environment.

Title: Mission Adaptive Rotor (MAR) Description: The goal of the Mission Adaptive Rotor (MAR) program is to develop and demonstrate the capability to achieve dramatic improvements in rotor performance, survivability, and availability through the use of technologies that enable adaptation of the rotor throughout military missions and/or mission segments. Recent research indicates that significant performance benefits could be achieved by actively morphing the shape or properties of the rotor system; additionally, active rotors with on- blade control could eliminate the need for a rotor swashplate. MAR capability will result in dramatic improvements in system performance, operational availability, sustainability, and survivability, including reduction in acoustic susceptibility and rotor vibration while increasing useful payload fraction and range. The MAR program will mature active rotor technologies that enable the effective operation of military rotorcraft in performance- limited environments of high-altitude mountainous terrain and deserts. The MAR program will also focus on development of advanced technologies for application to future helicopter, tiltrotor, and other rotorcraft platforms, with demonstration on a fielded system to enable application to new systems as well as facilitate upgrade of current multi-service rotorcraft systems.

These may include feasibility studies of novel or emergent materials, devices and tactics for air vehicle applications, as well as manufacturing and implementation approaches. The areas of interest range from propulsion to control techniques to solutions for aeronautic mission requirements. The result of these studies may lead to the design, development and improvement of prototypes. FY 2011 Plans: - Conduct feasibility and trade studies of candidate technologies and architectures. - Perform military utility analyses of proposed tactics and concepts of operation. FY 2012 Plans: - Perform modeling of concepts and architectures. - Conduct enabling technology and sub-system feasibility experiments.- 2.000 2.000 Title: Formation Flight Description: The Formation Flight program is exploring the development of drag reduction technologies for aircraft. Drag reduction allows aircraft to fly at increased ranges, reduces fuel consumption, and may allow increased payload capacity. Formation flight is used in nature by geese and other migratory birds to reduce drag, but requires the development of an autonomous system to maintain the optimum position for drag reduction to be practical for long duration aircraft flights. Safety of flight considerations require aircraft separation distances of up to one mile, necessitating automated sensing and tracking algorithms to track the lead aircraft wake. Flight testing a formation flight configuration will allow structural excitation and vehicle dynamic response to be addressed in proximity to the lead aircraft wake.

Title: Helicopter Quieting Description: The goal of the Helicopter Quieting program was to advance the capability for analytical development of advanced rotor technologies to dramatically enhance the survivability of military rotor systems while enabling improvements to performance, affordability, availability and suitability. A critical element toward this goal was the creation and demonstration of a physics- based toolset to enable analytical design of novel rotor systems and rotorcraft for reduced acoustic susceptibility (detection and recognition) by human and electro-acoustic threats. Novel and creative concepts and ideas were employed in this program for accurate aerodynamic analysis of helicopter rotor airloading, flowfield, and wakes using high-end computational fluid dynamics techniques. The program developed tools capable of accurately predicting noise signature of advanced rotor concepts that exhibit a significant reduction in low-frequency in-plane signatures. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Identified acoustic design criteria for new rotor system designs based on operational scenarios. - Transitioned tools to Services, industry, and academia.1.819 - - Title: Nano Air Vehicle (NAV) Description: The goal of the Nano Air Vehicle (NAV) program was to develop a hummingbird-inspired flapping air vehicle technology with less than a five inch wingspan and gross take-off weight of fifteen grams or less. Operations in the urban terrain require sensors that can navigate in difficult terrain and be inserted without being detected. Small air vehicles capable of navigating interior domains without GPS would enable autonomous prosecution of a number of high risk missions that are currently performed by warfighters. Examples of such missions include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) in buildings, underground facilities, caves, tunnels, and confined urban environments.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Network Centric Enabling Technology project provides technology to build mission applications explicitly tailored to exploit the promise of network-centric system architectures. Mission applications include signal processing, detection, tracking, identification, situation understanding, planning, and control functions. These applications will integrate: 1) external sensors and processors that provide data on targets and mission contexts; 2) external platforms, both air and surface, that deliver sensors and munitions to designated areas; 3) intelligence processing systems at all levels of command; and 4) external communications networks that provide connectivity between computing nodes located on the platforms, at field command centers, and headquarters. The mission applications share data to form consistent battlespace understanding tailored to the needs of commanders at each node. The types of tailoring include common operational pictures, timelines, and resource usage descriptions. The mission applications also negotiate plans for future operations based on mission needs presented at each node. To maintain focus on operationally relevant problems, the project's technical goals are posed and evaluated in the context of mixed manned/unmanned forces. Technologies developed in this project enable localized and distributed collaborative processing. This allows networks of sensors to rapidly adapt to changing force mixes, communications connectivity, and mission objectives while enabling distributed command and intelligence systems to effectively collaborate in a dynamic environment. Technologies are demonstrated and evaluated in the laboratory and in hardware-in-the-loop demonstrations. Demonstrations employ both stationary and autonomous mobile platforms. Operational benefits are: 1) smaller forward deployment of image and signal analysts in complex operating conditions including urban battlefields; 2) deeper understanding of the evolving stability and support operational environment; 3) consistent integration of target and environment information; and 4) flexible operational tactics and procedures to find evasive targets in difficult environments. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Title: Video and Image Retrieval and Analysis Tool (VIRAT) Description: The Video and Image Retrieval and Analysis Tool (VIRAT) program will develop and demonstrate a system for video data exploitation that enables an analyst to rapidly find video content of interest from archives and provides alerts to the analyst of events of interest during live operations. The ability to quickly search large volumes of existing video data and monitor real-time video data for specific activities or events will provide a new capability to the U.S. military and intelligence agencies. Currently, video analysis is very labor intensive, limited to metadata queries, manual annotations, and \"fast-forward\" examination of clips. The software tools developed under VIRAT will radically improve the analysis of huge volumes of video data by: 1) alerting operators when specific events or activities occur at specific locations or over a range of locations and; 2) enabling fast, content-based searches of existing video archives. The final product of the VIRAT program is a system that can be transitioned to and integrated within an operational military system, such as the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS).

Title: Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) Description: The Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) program develops and integrates a set of data analysis tools into a unified information system to support Theater Security Cooperation (TSC). The ICEWS system monitors, assesses and forecasts leading indicators of events that make countries vulnerable to crises. ICEWS technologies include quantitative and computational social science modeling and simulation, scenario generation, ontological modeling of security problems, advanced interactive visualization techniques, and agent-based programming. ICEWS will also develop a collaborative, open- source testbed that will facilitate the integration and evaluation of alternative, operationally relevant social theories. Natural language processing is required to identify and extract information that is predictive from text and speech-based media and to distill that information into a form that is actionable by civilian and military leadership. ICEWS will develop a large body of test cases (source data and outcomes) against which the social science theories can be evaluated.

Title: Nexus 7* Description: *Previously funded in Production of Knowledge Bases to Bridge Cultural Divides in PE 0601101E, Project TRS-01 The Nexus 7 program is applying the forecasting, data extraction, and analysis methodologies developed in ICEWS to develop tools, techniques, and frameworks for the automated interpretation, quantitative analysis, and visualization of social networks. Social network theory has emerged in recent years as a promising approach for understanding groups of individuals connected through a variety of shared interests and collaborative activities. For the military, social networks provide a promising model for terrorist cells, insurgent groups, and other stateless actors whose connectedness is established not on the basis of shared geography but rather through the correlation of their participation in coordinated activities such as planning meetings, training/ mission rehearsal sessions, sharing of materiel/funds transfers, etc. The Nexus 7 program will develop and apply emerging methods for edge finding and cluster analysis to detect, characterize, and predict the dynamics of social networks. The resulting capabilities have important application in tactical contexts to aid analysts and operators in connecting the dots amid- - 30.605 Volume 1 - 145UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 32 of 35 R-1 Line Item #21Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGYPROJECT TT-13: NETWORK CENTRIC ENABLING TECHNOLOGY B.

Title: Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance (EXACTO) Description: The objective of the Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance (EXACTO) program is to revolutionize the Service sniper's ability to engage targets at long range, regardless of target motion or crosswinds, with previously unachievable accuracy. The EXACTO system is comprised of an advanced targeting optic, the first ever guided small caliber bullet, innovative guidance and control software, and a conventional sniper rifle. The EXACTO 50-caliber bullet and optical sighting technology will greatly extend the day and night ranges over current state-of-the-art sniper systems allowing sniper teams to engage tactically important moving (or accelerating) targets in high crosswind conditions such as those commonly found in Afghanistan. Current technology is extremely limited in its ability to compensate for high crosswinds, significant target motion, or target acceleration. EXACTO will not only dramatically improve sniper effectiveness, but also enhance troop safety by allowing greater shooter standoff range and reduce target engagement timelines. The EXACTO system combines a command guided bullet with a guidance control system capable of compensating for adverse environmental conditions and tracking mobile targets in real-time. The technology development plan includes risk reduction and system integration of all system components and will culminate in live fire testing of a prototype EXACTO system at a full spectrum of ranges, day/night, and environmental conditions, to fully validate system performance. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Performed component testing, performance modeling, and explored system integration opportunities for all subsystems. - Validated critical sub-system component performance including optical link, electronics packaging, bearings survivability, and turbulence mitigation for target optic. - Successfully demonstrated potential system performance of two competing EXACTO designs through detailed simulation based on established component and subsystem performance data, featuring integrated hardware components, and a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation executed at numerous simulated ranges and environmental and target conditions.16.889 22.218 - Volume 1 - 146UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 33 of 35 R-1 Line Item #21Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGYPROJECT TT-13: NETWORK CENTRIC ENABLING TECHNOLOGY B.

Title: PERsistent Stare Exploitation and Analysis System (PerSEAS) Description: The PERsistent Stare Exploitation and Analysis System (PerSEAS) program will develop and demonstrate a tool to automatically and interactively identify activity-based events of interest from persistent, wide area, motion imagery data with support from signals intelligence and other sources. Persistent, wide area surveillance imagery is an ever increasing source of operational data, but exploitation of this data at present is mostly manual and requires hours to days to produce results. Tools are needed to automatically detect potentially significant adversary activities and to discriminate these from nominal background activity. These tools would be supported by libraries of activity patterns, logic to generate hypotheses about which activities are being observed, and mechanisms to quantitatively score the consistency of the data with each activity hypothesis. Such capabilities are necessary to detect and defeat threats in real-time. The major thrust of the program is the hierarchical processing of extracted features (such as context and tracks) to yield events of interest, which in turn would be linked to form activities and then integrated to discover and infer potential threat patterns. The discovery and identification of the potential threat patterns would then produce alerts and cues for analysts to interactively adjudicate and validate. PerSEAS technologies and system are planned for transition to the Distributed Common Ground System and other intelligence applications. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Formulated approaches to network discovery based on normalcy estimates, improved tracking algorithms using pattern analysis, and contextual analysis for anomaly detection. FY 2011 Plans: - Implement and evaluate techniques on wide area motion imagery data. - Develop a system prototype.7.500 9.000 - Volume 1 - 147UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 34 of 35 R-1 Line Item #21Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGYPROJECT TT-13: NETWORK CENTRIC ENABLING TECHNOLOGY B.

Title: Home Field Description: The Home Field program develops networked video and Laser Detection and Ranging (LADAR) processing technology to rapidly and reliably update a 3-D model of an urban area. It provides 3-D situational awareness with sufficient detail and accuracy to remove the \"home field advantage\" enjoyed by opponents. Detailed mobility maps to support ground vehicle routing will be inferred and generated, and detailed visibility data to support sensor positioning will then be derived to maximize coverage and minimize detectability. High fidelity baselines will be created to support change detection to cue searches for targets and anticipate changes due to current or impending meteorological events. The program will supply real-time context information to sensor managers, maneuver controllers, weapons operators, and commanders. Furthermore, the program will filter natural change from artificial change indicative of human (threat) activity and permit operation of military forces in hostile terrain normally deemed favorable to opponents because of their historical familiarity with hide points, sight lines, and mobility characteristics. Drawing upon technologies developed in the Home Field program, the Urban Photonic Sandtable Display (UPSD) program has developed revolutionary interactive holographic displays for complex volumetric 3-D data to replace current 3-D visualization technologies that are either static or have limited effective field-of-view. Current technologies include traditional holography, computer graphics on 2-D screens, slice stacking, parallax autostereo, and goggles/glasses. These techniques not only give a poor image quality and poor movement, they also are not created quickly and do not allow for collaborative viewer interaction. The desire to improve these components launched the development of the UPSD. Applying the design fundamentals of the monochrome active grouping of pixels for a light modulator element into a single 3-D holographic pixel (hogel-based proof-of- concept) display and further developed module, a scalable and tileable laboratory prototype has been validated by transforming computer data to optical data, making sophisticated integration possible to optimize image quality. The UPSD program developed an affordable 3-D display that operates at full video rate, displays red-green-blue (RGB) color, increases viewing angle, and increases display size. The result will be the world's first full-motion, full aspect 3-D imaging technology system. The emissive micro displays effort will develop technologies to support the fabrication of Low-cost High pixel density Power efficient Direct emission Microdisplays (LHPDM). Current microdisplay systems use light modulation systems (liquid crystal displays, digital micromirror devices,) and by using LHPDM, it will enable the transmission of larger fractions of light from the illumination source.

Title: Tactical Biomedical Technologies - Medical Description: The Tactical Biomedical Technologies thrust will develop new approaches to deliver life-saving medical care on the battlefield, as well as novel technologies for reconstruction and rehabilitation of severely injured warfighters. Implicit in this thrust is the fact that there are unique, warfighter-specific challenges in acute and chronic treatment that are not addressed by civilian research and development. Today, more than half of American battlefield fatalities are due to hemorrhage, particularly due to improvised explosive devices (IEDs). To prevent these deaths, there is an urgent need for technologies that enable relatively unskilled personnel (battlefield medics) to diagnose and treat injuries, including the ability to locate and coagulate non- compressible deep bleeders in the thorax or abdomen. Other critical needs stem from the fact that warfighters are frequently victims of blasts, causing patterns of brain, burn, and orthopedic injuries not seen in civilian medical practice. As such, there is a unique military need to develop systems for pain control that are safe even in medically unmonitored environments, such as an active battlefield. Once lives are saved, there is an unmet need for new methods to restore function, for example, by restoring long segments of bone that were lost due to blast fragmentation. The results of this program will greatly enhance our ability to save lives on the battlefield and provide restoration of normal function to survivors. This effort continues in FY 2012 in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Demonstrated that bone elongation following injury in a neonatal mouse model is achieved through the proper timing, concentration, and placement of bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) at the injury site. - Demonstrated regeneration of complex tissue structures in a neonatal mouse model treated with a synthetic BMP-2 agonist at an injury site. - Initiated selection and screening of candidate hemostatic agents. - Initiated selection and screening of wound-specific targets and target homing agents. - Demonstrated in vivo efficacy of feedback component of the drug delivery system. - Optimized automated algorithms for bleeder detection, localization, coagulation, and cuff control in in vivo and in vitro models.

Title: Neuroscience Technologies Description: The Neuroscience Technologies thrust leverages recent advances in neurophysiology, neuro-imaging, cognitive science and molecular biology to sustain and protect the cognitive functioning of the warfighter faced with challenging operational conditions. Warfighters experience a wide variety of operational stressors, both mental and physical, that degrade critical cognitive functions such as memory, learning, and decision making. These stressors also degrade the war fighter's ability to multitask, leading to decreased ability to respond quickly and effectively. Currently, the long-term impact of these stressors on the brain is unknown, both at the molecular and behavioral level. This thrust area will utilize modern neuroscientific techniques, in conjunction with emerging solutions in neurally enabled human-machine interface technologies, to develop quantitative models of this impact and explore mechanisms to protect, maintain, complement, or restore cognitive functioning during and after exposure to operational stressors. In addition, new approaches for using neural signals to make human-machine systems more time efficient and less workload intense will be identified, developed, and evaluated. This project will also investigate the integration of recently-characterized properties of human brain function and real-time signal processing to enable rapid triage of target- containing imagery. This thrust area will have far-reaching implications for both current and future military operations, with the potential to protect cognitive performance at the individual and group level both prior to and during deployment.

Title: Military Medical Imaging - Medical Description: The Military Medical Imaging thrust will develop medical imaging capabilities to support military missions and operations. Examples include novel technologies to miniaturize and enhance the capabilities and speed of computerized axial tomography (CAT) scanners and to develop non-invasive imaging modalities for use by medics. The emergence of advanced medical imaging includes newly recognized physical properties of biological tissue, or metabolic pathway, or physiological function in order to map it into an image of diagnostic utility and performance. This need is ever increasing as researchers and scientists seek to better understand anatomical, functional and cellular level interactions. This thrust will also address how to improve the delivery of medical care and medical personnel protection by building a simulated environment for rapid after-action review of field events generated from current military systems. The advanced development of these tools will provide a formidable arsenal of diagnostic tools for warfighter performance and care. This effort continues in FY 2012 in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project is focused on the unique challenges facing the DoD in developing and demonstrating advanced power generation and energy storage technologies. It will address critical military needs for improved energy efficiency and availability to support a range of military missions that include the individual warfighter and small unit operations, large platform operations, and sustainment of forward operating bases (FOBs). At the individual warfighter and small unit operations level, efforts are addressing the need for mission extending power generation and energy storage technologies with particular emphasis on portability and robustness challenges that are unique to the DoD. At the large platform and forward operations scale, efforts are addressing needs for deployable energy storage and more efficient power generation and distribution technologies. As electronic systems are common to all scales of power generation and energy storage and management, this project also investigates improved board-level power conversion and regulation strategies to more efficiently convert and distribute high voltages to locally required low voltages for powering integrated circuits and sensors. Included in this project are efforts to improve the utilization of larger generators at FOBs and on large platforms, by improving efficiency and developing multi- fuel capability that will allow for greater use of indigenous sources. Smart energy distribution at the FOB level will allow for more effective energy management, improved overall distribution efficiency, and the effective integration of host country resources. Efforts exploring power generation for FOB operations from ruggedized nuclear-fueled reactors, and ultra-high-efficiency gas turbine engines for power generation on large platforms including Navy cruisers and destroyers, will also be investigated. At the small-scale tactical-level, a new generation of robust fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors will be developed to handle the demanding loads found on portable electronics carried by the individual warfighter and many small military platforms. New storage technologies beyond batteries will be explored that are exploiting novel approaches to electrochemical conversion of carbon-based fuels. Also included in this project are scalable power management systems from integrated circuits that exploit novel magnetic materials through large power controls for efficient grid power management and distribution, novel regenerative or electrochemical storage technologies allowing for the recovery of excess energy produced during low peak periods, and environmentally robust energy sources that can meet the energy requirements for military operations in extreme environments.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Title: Energy Distribution Description: The current paradigm of distributed generation for meeting the electrical needs of forward operating bases involves deploying numerous tactical generators of varying size and capacity in ways that often do not match capacity with demand.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 technologies for resource distribution can be developed for use in military forward operations. These efforts will contribute to improved overall energy efficiency and reduced logistics demands associated with fuel transport to forward operating bases. This thrust will investigate technologies that reduce the dependence on traditional fuel sources and delivery methods, and increase fuel-efficiency to provide more flexibility to military assets in the field. Energy management modeling and design will be utilized to assess host-country resources (e.g. heating fuels, locally-grown biomass, unrefined fuels, waste, and other hydrocarbon rich materials), and advanced power generation technologies (e.g. fuel cells, renewable solar, wind, biofuels, etc.). FY 2012 Plans: - Using data collected from current operations worldwide, construct a baseline modeling tool that depicts how energy is currently generated and distributed in existing military forward operating bases. - Identify emerging smart grid and other energy management tools that may be adapted to a military forward operating environment. - Identify key technology gaps currently precluding the deployment of energy distribution and management systems that can optimally match load with capacity while increasing overall energy efficiency of a forward operating base. - Identify emerging electrochemical and/or electrothermal storage technologies that may facilitate the efficient redistribution of energy resources, including renewable sources such as wind and solar, in a military forward operating environment. - Identify opportunities to leverage host country resources provide feedstocks for on-site generation of fuel and power. - Further develop the energy management modeling tool to incorporate knowledge of indigenous resources, advances in power generation (including renewable - solar, wind, geothermal, etc.), and advances in energy distribution technologies. Title: Extreme Environment Energy Program (EEE) Description: Advanced DoD platforms and missions increasingly demand energy generation, storage, and conversion technologies that can function reliably in extreme environments. Adverse conditions to be managed include, for example, optical and ionizing radiation, extremes of temperature, chemical damage, and harsh mechanical loading. Also of interest are energy generation in anaerobic environments, and the development of materials that enable high temperature power generation processes. In addition, environmentally robust energy sources such as existing primary (disposable) batteries can be improved to considerably improve efficiency and make them adaptable to a wide variety of target systems. Another aspect of this program is to adapt advanced wavelength-splitting photovoltaic cells to high altitude and space environments. The overall focus of this program is on developing technologies that significantly improve robustness and adaptability of energy sources for a variety of mission locations and durations.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 - Design components for photovoltaic devices, advanced materials, power converters, and storage devices capable of operating at extreme temperatures and high radiation environments. - Design power system for resistance to UV and chemical damage simultaneously with extreme temperatures. - Design intelligent disposable batteries with internal electronics to adapt them to a wide variety of target systems and to optimally extract energy from the internal storage cells. - Assess the potential to improve power generation in anaerobic environments. Title: Small Rugged Reactor Technologies Description: True self-sufficiency at forward operating bases (FOBs) requires the development of deployable power plant concepts that can operate without need for refueling or logistics resupply. Such a power plant needs to provide base electricity requirements and produce additional electrical, and/or thermal energy, to drive processes for hydrocarbon fuel and potable water production in sufficient quantities to sustain the base. This will significantly reduce the need for delivery of these items via dangerous and difficult routes. The only known technology that has potential to address the power needs of the envisioned self- sufficient FOB is a nuclear-fuel reactor. The need for an integrated, deployable system that produces electricity, fuel, and water presents technical challenges that are unlikely to be addressed by existing commercial or Government funded advanced reactor concept development efforts. For example, integrating hydrocarbon fuel production with electricity production will require either advanced reactor designs that provide thermal energy at the temperatures required for known hydrocarbon production processes, or the development of novel fuel production processes that are compatible with temperatures achievable with existing reactor concepts. The scale of a reactor needed for a FOB (well below the scale of the smallest reactors that are being developed for domestic energy production) poses unique challenges with materials and reactor design. In addition, non-proliferable fuels (i.e., fuels other than enriched uranium or plutonium) and reactor designs that are fundamentally safe will be required of reactors that may be deployed to regions where hostile acts may compromise operations. This will require development of novel fuels and approaches to effectively shut down reactor operations in a way that leaves any remaining fissile material safely contained and useless for weapons applications. The Small Rugged Reactor Technologies thrust will explore these unique challenges while collaborating with DoE to ensure that existing advanced reactor development activities are being exploited and/or accelerated as appropriate, based on the military's needs. FY 2012 Plans: - Assess and quantify the anticipated total energy, fuel, and water needs of future military FOBs, as they may be deployed in isolated, harsh environments. - Conduct preliminary study of achievable energy density and temperature parameters for existing and emerging reactor technologies. - Identify preliminary, non-proliferable reactor designs that have the potential for being compact, safe, and deployable to FOBs.- - 10.000 Volume 1 - 187UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 38 of 40 R-1 Line Item #22Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602715E: MATERIALS AND BIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGYPROJECT MBT-03: TACTICAL AND STRATEGIC ENERGY TECHNOLOGY B.

Title: Microscale Power Conversion Description: Current DoD electronic systems rely on centralized or board-level power conversion and regulation circuitry to convert from efficiently distributed high voltages to locally required low voltages for powering integrated circuits and sensors. A new approach, and the goal of this work, is to increase the granularity of power management to the module or component level by developing integrated capacitive and inductive energy storage and switching elements.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Space Programs and Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced space systems and provides revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military missions. A space force structure that is robust against attack represents a stabilizing deterrent against adversary attacks on space assets. The keys to a secure space environment are situational awareness to detect and characterize potential attacks, a proliferation of assets to provide robustness against attack, ready access to space, the ability to neutralize man-made space environments, and a flexible infrastructure for maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit assets. Ready access to space allows the delivery of defensive systems and replenishment supplies to orbit. An infrastructure to service the mission spacecraft allows defensive actions to be taken without limiting mission lifetime. In addition, developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space. Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space-derived information and services with terrestrial users. Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness; enabling concepts include solar thermal propulsion, novel ion-thruster applications, payload isolation and pointing systems.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Title: System F6 Description: The objective of the System F6 program is to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a satellite architecture wherein the functionality of a traditional \"monolithic\" spacecraft is replaced by a cluster of wirelessly-interconnected spacecraft modules. Each such \"fractionated\" module would contribute a unique capability, e.g., computation and data handling, communications relay, guidance and navigation, payload sensing, etc., or it can replicate the capability of another module. The fractionated modules would fly in a loose, proximate cluster orbit capable of semi-autonomous reconfiguration or a rapid defensive scatter/re-gather maneuver. Critical to this architecture is a robust, system-level approach to ensuring security, integrity, and availability, while implementing authentication and non-repudiation. While delivering a comparable mission capability to a monolithic spacecraft, System F6 significantly enhances architectural and programmatic adaptability and robustness-reducing risk through the mission life and spacecraft development cycle, enabling incremental deployment of the system, and enhancing survivability. The System F6 architecture provides valuable options to decision makers throughout the life cycle development of future space systems that are absent in present-day monolithic architectures. The System F6 program will culminate in an on-orbit demonstration of a multi-module space system incorporating the F6 Technology Package-a suite of technologies, components, and algorithms which enables semi-autonomous multi-body cluster flight and secure, distributed, real-time sharing of various spacecraft resources at the cluster level. Multiple version of the F6 Technology Package will be developed on the basis of open-source interface standards, software, and reference designs. The on-orbit demonstration will be capable of accommodating one or more spacecraft payload modules supplied by a third-party mission partner. Residual capability to support future payloads with the existing on-orbit infrastructure will also remain, and the infrastructure can be upgraded for a perpetual on-orbit resource capability.

Title: Manned Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) Servicing Description: The Manned Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) Servicing program, an outgrowth of the FREND program, will investigate the feasibility, risks, and technologies necessary for human and robotic servicing of spacecraft in GEO. To date, servicing operations have not been conducted on spacecraft beyond LEO. A large number of national security and commercial space systems operate at GEO altitudes, furthermore, many end-of-life or failed spacecraft drift without control through portions of the GEO belt, creating a growing hazard to operational spacecraft. DARPA has previously pursued technologies for servicing of spacecraft with the expectation such servicing would involve a mix of highly autonomous and remotely (i.e., ground-based) teleoperated robotic systems. The Manned GEO Servicing program will build upon this DARPA legacy, tackling the more complex GEO environment, and developing technologies to allow for both human and robotic servicing.

Title: Single Wafer Integrated Femto Satellites (SWIFT)* Description: *Formerly Advanced Nano/Micro-Satellite Technology for Tactical Applications The goal of the Single Wafer Integrated Femto Satellites (SWIFT) program is to demonstrate critically needed technologies enabling a very small (nano- and micro-) satellite constellation for persistent tactical military applications. SWIFT will develop, fabricate, and demonstrate fully functional \"femtosat\" spacecraft (less than 100 grams) which can enable new missions not currently possible with singular monolithic satellites by means of an adaptable hardware architecture and microfabrication technologies. Swarms of femtosats are ideally suited for distributed missions, such as sparse aperture arrays for remote sensing or fly-around inspectors for larger spacecraft. The U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, intelligence community, and other potential users have identified such small satellites as a potential technical approach for delivering affordable support to the tactical warfighter. By deploying large numbers of very low cost nano-satellites in distributed constellations a persistent effect can be provided to terrestrial forces. Today's technology limits the ability to do this and advances in key areas are needed to make this vision a reality. Specifically, nanosatellites lack sufficient power, communications, propulsion and imaging capacity to address many tactical needs. Key technologies include: deployable communications antennas, crosslink communications, interferometric technologies, small imaging systems, attitude control subsystems, efficient solar electric arrays, efficient maneuver capability, efficient upper stages, and revolutionary manufacturing techniques. The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force. FY 2011 Plans: - Conduct trade study of available technologies and investment opportunities. - Initiate concept design.

Title: Horizontal Launch* Description: *Formerly Responsive, Reliable Access to Space Program (R2A2 Space) The goal of the Horizontal Launch program is to mature and demonstrate technologies for low cost, routine, reliable, horizontal access to low earth orbit (LEO). The program will explore launch to LEO concepts for payload classes between 5,000 and 20,000 lbs, and will consider overall launch architectures to include ground processing flows, ground handling and associated infrastructure, methods for reducing turnaround time, and flexible basing. Combinations of reusable or expendable upper stages and hydrocarbon versus hydrogen fuels will be examined. Enabling technologies include composite or light weight structures, integral load bearing propellant tanks, thermal management systems, high energy density propulsion systems, advanced guidance and controls, rocket back maneuvering for a reusable first stage, and advanced upper stages. The program will validate critical technologies on the ground and, where practical, demonstrate them in flight. Where feasible, flight testing will leverage the substantial ongoing entrepreneurial private sector investments. The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force. FY 2011 Plans: - Conduct market/business case analysis for horizontal launch concepts. - Analyze alternative infrastructure options including cost considerations. FY 2012 Plans: - Perform conceptual design of selected architecture focusing on key technology gaps. - Initiate preliminary design.- 5.000 8.000 Title: Fast Access Spacecraft Testbed (FAST) Description: The goal of the Fast Access Spacecraft Testbed (FAST) program is to demonstrate a suite of critical technologies including high efficiency solar cells, sunlight concentrating arrays, large deployable structures, and ultra light weight solar arrays. These technologies enable light-weight, high efficiency, and high-power satellites of 20kW scalable to 80kW or more. The specific power goal is 130 W/Kg yielding an ultra light-weight power system of approximately 230 Kg for a 30 kW array. Combined with electric propulsion, FAST enables fast-transfer roaming satellites with nearly five times the fuel efficiency of conventional chemical propulsion. For example, FAST will permit on-demand access to any point on the geosynchronous ring or within the high-altitude, super synchronous \"graveyard\" (where derelict systems are regularly repositioned in order to free up orbital slots within the ring), greatly improving our ability to rapidly deploy and reposition satellites, as well as monitor the geosynchronous environment.

Title: Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) Description: The Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) program will develop and demonstrate an advanced ground-based optical system to enable detection and tracking of faint objects in space, while providing rapid, wide-area search capability. A major goal of the SST program is to develop the technology for large curved focal surface array sensors to enable an innovative telescope design combining high detection sensitivity, short focal length, wide field of view, and rapid step-and-settle to provide orders of magnitude improvements in space surveillance. This capability will enable ground-based detection of un-cued objects in deep space for purposes such as asteroid detection and space defense missions. The Air Force will participate in the DARPA funded developmental testing of SST and then take over operation of SST as a sensor in the Air Force Space Surveillance Network. An MOA has been established with Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) for transition. In addition, the program will investigate data fusion and advanced algorithms for correlation of unknown objects. SST is expected to generate a large number of uncorrelated targets (UCTs), and new methods will need to be employed to rapidly characterize and attribute the new objects. Furthermore, the program will investigate methods which combine observations from disparate sensors (such as optical and radar installations) to more rapidly, accurately, and completely provide knowledge about UCTs, as compared to the existing system where no data fusion is employed. Where appropriate, SST will investigate new concepts which would provide complementary or further advances in ground-based deep space object detection and characterization.

Title: Multi-Aperture Geosynchronous (GEO) Imager (MAGI) Description: The goal of the Multi-Aperture Geosynchronous (GEO) Imager (MAGI) program is to demonstrate a segment of a world-wide millimeter wave (MMW) surveillance capability by combining radar and radio astronomy technologies and techniques. By merging interferometric receiving and correlation techniques, used by radio astronomers for decades, with high power narrow- band radar transmitter technologies, MAGI hopes to prove the capability to obtain an order of magnitude improvement in imaging resolution of GEO and near-GEO satellites. A low cost demonstration using the NASA Goldstone X-Band radar and existing radio astronomy assets (the National Radio Astronomy Organization's Very Long Baseline Array) will be conducted to prove the concept at X-band. Based on resolution requirements, the follow-on prototype demonstration will be at MMW (~90GHz) and, to the greatest extent practicable, will utilize COTS MMW antennas and high power narrow-band transmitters.

Title: Front-end Robotics Enabling Near-term Demonstration (FREND) Description: The goal of the Front-end Robotics Enabling Near-term Demonstration (FREND) program is to develop, demonstrate, and fly robotic manipulator technologies designed to allow interaction with geosynchronous orbit (GEO)-based military and commercial spacecraft, extending their service lives and permitting satellite refueling, repair, refurbishment, repositioning or retirement. Existing GEO spacecraft are outfitted with sufficient propellant to provide for needed station keeping, repositioning, and retirement maneuvers, which in many cases defines their useful mission durations. Once the propellant is expended, the vehicle is retired and, in many cases, replaced. FREND technologies can enable significant service extension to these spacecraft through re-boosting near end-of-life. FREND technologies may also be applied to crewed servicing vehicles to provide robotic assistance to manned GEO servicing missions. Recent events have significantly increased the number of objects/debris in low earth orbit (LEO), particularly in orbital planes of most interest to DoD users, causing an increased threat to safe space operations. FREND combines detailed photogrammetric and laser imaging with robotic multi-degree-of-freedom manipulators to autonomously grapple space objects not outfitted with custom interfaces. A FREND-based servicing spacecraft offers the potential for spacecraft salvage, repair, rescue, reposition, de- orbit and retirement, and debris removal. The program will examine possible solutions for all classes of LEO debris to determine the most economical technical solution set to mitigating the problem. In addition, FREND will investigate neurorobotics as a potential replacement for the baseline suite of algorithms (e.g., arm trajectory planning, vehicle pose estimation, grapple feature identification, or compliance control) required to dock multiple robotic arms with a client spacecraft. The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force.

The project will also address thermal management, navigation and positioning technology challenges. The goal of the Mixed Technology Integration project is to leverage advanced microelectronics manufacturing infrastructure and DARPA component technologies developed in other projects to produce mixed-technology microsystems. These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness and security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms. The chip assembly and packaging processes currently in use produce a high cost, high power, large volume and lower performance system. This program is focused on the monolithic integration of mixed technologies to form batch-fabricated, mixed technology microsystems 'on-a-single-chip' or an integrated and interconnected 'stack-of-chips'. The ability to integrate mixed technologies onto a single substrate will increase performance and reliability, while driving down size, weight, volume and cost.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and Integrated Microsystems Technology program is a broad, cross-disciplinary initiative to merge computation and power generation with sensing and actuation to realize a new technology for both perceiving and controlling weapons systems and battlefield environments. Using fabrication processes and materials similar to those used to make microelectronic devices, MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems. The MEMS program addresses issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements. These issues include microscale power and actuation systems as well as microscale components that survive harsh environments. The microfluidic molecular systems effort will develop automated microsystems that integrate biochemical fluid handling capability along with electronics, optoelectronics and chip-based reaction and detection modules for tailored sequence analysis to monitor environmental conditions, health hazards and physiological states. Thermal management technologies will develop heat resistant thermal layers to provide efficient operation for cooling electronic devices. Another focus in micro technologies is to improve navigation, position and timing capabilities for uncompromised navigation and positioning in today's dynamic military field of operations. The major technical focus areas of the MEMS and Integrated Microsystems programs contained in this project are: 1) inertial measurement; 2) fluid sensing and control; 3) electromagnetic and optical beam steering; 4) chemical reactions on chip; 5) electromechanical signal processing; 6) analytical instruments; 7) thermal management; and 8) navigation and positioning technologies. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY the Chip-Scale Technology effort is to enhance Microsystems performance. The current focus of the program is to develop an efficient fluid distribution capability for on-chip vacuum pumps that meet the stress application requirements. Additionally, this program will refine microresonator capabilities to accept very narrow radio spectrum channels while canceling out or eliminating others. The Chip-Scale Technologies have the potential to improve the critical performance of Microsystems such as micro mass spectrometers, nanoscale detectors, RF resonators, and vacuum microelectronic components. There is a pressing need to significantly improve chip-scale micropump performance (capable of operating at ~10^-6 Torr in a volume smaller than 1 CM^3) and this program will develop a high-performance integrated low-power microscale pumping capability.

The program will also develop mechanical gain elements using physical effects such as giant magnetoresistance, buckling, electromechanical phase transitions, van der Waals forces, and Casimir forces to enable very low-noise, high-frequency amplifiers for low-power, low-noise analog signal processing. Mechanical power supplies and mechanical vibrating clocks could facilitate production of electronics that are less susceptible to electromagnetic pulse attacks. Integrating nanomechanical elements in direct bandgap materials will circumvent problems of gate oxide stability, allowing fast logic with optics functionality. This program will transition into DoD systems via industrial program performers.

Title: Thermal Management Technologies (TMT) Description: The goal of the Thermal Management Technologies (TMT) program is to explore and optimize new nanostructured materials and other recent advances for use in thermal management systems. Innovative research is underway to go beyond evolutionary thermal management systems. Modern, high-performance heat spreaders, which use two-phase cooling, are being developed to replace the copper alloy spreaders in conventional systems. Enhancing air-cooled exchangers by reducing the thermal resistance through the heat sink to the ambient, increasing convection through the system, improving heat sink fin thermal conductivity, optimizing and/or redesigning the complimentary heat sink blower, and increasing the overall system (heat sink and blower) coefficient of performance is another thrust of this program. Another element of this effort is focused on novel materials and structures that can provide significant reductions in the thermal resistance of the thermal interface layer between the backside of an electronic device and the next layer of the package, which might be a spreader or a heat sink. The TMT program is an aggregation of: Thermal Ground Plane (TGP), Microtechnologies for Air-Cooled Exchangers Nano Thermal Interfaces (NTI) and Active Cooling Modules (ACM) technology research.

Title: Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Micro PN&T) Description: The Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Micro PN&T) program is developing technology for self-contained chip-scale inertial navigation and precision guidance. This technology promises to effectively mitigate dependence on Global Positioning System (GPS) or any other external signals, and enable uncompromised navigation and guidance capabilities. The program will enable positioning, navigation and timing functions without the need for external information updates by employing on-chip calibration, thereby overcoming vulnerabilities which arise in environments where external updates are not available such as caves, tunnels, or dense urban locations. The technologies developed will enable small, low-power, micro-gyroscopes capable of operating in both moderate and challenging dynamic environments; chip-scale primary atomic clock standards; and on-chip calibration systems for error correction. Advance micro-fabrication techniques allow a single package containing all the necessary devices (clocks, accelerometers, gyroscopes and calibration) to be incorporated into a volume the size of a sugar cube. The small size, weight and power of these technologies and their integration into a single package responds to the needs of guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles and individual soldiers. The Micro PN&T program is an aggregation of Integrated Primary Atomic Clock, Information Tethered Microscale Autonomous Rotary Stages, Microsystem Integrated Navigation and Precision Navigation and Positioning Technologies.

Title: Harsh Environment Robust Micromechanical Technology (HERMIT) Description: The Harsh Environment Robust Micromechanical Technology (HERMIT) program developed micromechanical devices that operate under harsh conditions (e.g., under large temperature excursions, large power throughputs, high g- forces, corrosive substances) while maintaining unprecedented performance, stability, and lifetime. Micromechanical RF switches were of particular interest, where sizable power throughputs and impacting operation constitute harsh operational environments. Other applications such as vibrating resonator reference tanks, gyroscopes, and accelerometers were also addressed. Among the HERMIT implementation approaches pursued were: 1) wafer-level encapsulation or packaging strategies based on MicroElectroMechanical systems (MEMS) technology that isolates a micromechanical device from its surroundings while maintaining a desired environment via passive or active control; and 2) material and design engineering strategies that render a micromechanical device impervious to its environment with or without a package (if possible).

The key approach in this program was to selectively cool. Such an approach benefits a large number of applications where performance is determined predominately by only a few devices in a system, e.g., communications where the front-end filter and LNA often set the noise figure; and sensors, where the transducer and input transistor in the sense amplifier often set the resolution.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The goal of the Mixed Technology Integration project is to leverage advanced microelectronics manufacturing infrastructure and DARPA component technologies developed in other projects to produce mixed-technology microsystems. These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness, security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms. At the present time, systems are fabricated by assembling a number of mixed-technology components: microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microphotonics, microfluidics and millimeterwave/microwave. Each technology usually requires a different level of integration, occupies a separate silicon chip and requires off-chip wiring, and requires fastening and packaging to form a module. The chip assembly and packaging processes produce a high cost, high power, large volume and lower performance system. This program is focused on the monolithic integration of mixed technologies to form batch-fabricated, mixed technology microsystems 'on-a-single-chip' or an integrated and interconnected 'stack-of-chips'. The field of microelectronics incorporates micrometer/nanometer scale integration and is the most highly integrated, low-cost and high-impact technology to date. Microelectronics technology has produced the microcomputer-chip that enabled or supported the revolutions in computers, networking and communication. This program extends the microelectronics paradigm to include the integration of heterogeneous or mixed technologies. This new paradigm will create a new class of 'matchbook-size', highly integrated device and microsystem architectures. Examples of component-microsystems include low-power, small-volume, lightweight, microsensors, microrobots and microcommunication systems that will improve and expand the performance of the warfighter, military platforms, munitions and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs). The program includes the integration of mixed materials on generic substrates including glass, polymers and silicon. The program is design and process intensive, using 'standard' processes and developing new semiconductor-like processes and technologies that support the integration of mixed-technologies at the micrometer/ nanometer scale. The program includes the development of micrometer/nanometer scale isolation, contacts, interconnects and 'multiple-chip-scale' packaging for electronic, mechanical, fluidic, photonic and rf/mmwave/microwave technologies. example, a mixed-technology microsystem using integrated microfluidics, MEMS, microphotonics, microelectronics and microwave components could provide a highly integrated, portable analytical instrument to monitor the battlefield environment, the physical condition of a warfighter, the identity of warfighters (friend or foe) or the combat readiness of equipment. The ability to integrate mixed technologies onto a single substrate will drive down the size, weight, volume, and cost of weapon systems while increasing their performance and reliability. B.

Title: Gratings of Regular Arrays and Trim Exposures (GRATE) Description: The Gratings of Regular Arrays and Trim Exposures (GRATE) program will develop revolutionary circuit design methodologies combined with hybrid lithography tools to enable cost-effective low volume nanofabrication for DoD applications. Moore's law has driven the silicon industry for several decades with the minimum feature size on an integrated circuit (IC) reduced to 45 nm for today's commercial products. Due to challenging patterning requirements and complex circuit designs, costs of lithography tools and masks have become unaffordable for low-volume manufacture, i.e., military electronics or application specific integrated circuit (ASICs). Similarly, the circuit design, verification, and testing costs have also grown exponentially further preventing military electronics from using advanced silicon technology nodes. Military electronics capabilities are currently limited by the high cost of nanofabrication. To solve this important problem, DARPA has invested in a variety of maskless patterning technologies including parallel e-beam arrays, parallel scanning probe arrays, and an innovative e-beam lithography tool. This program will develop revolutionary circuit design methodologies coupled with innovative hybrid maskless patterning tools to realize cost-effective nanofabrication for low-volume defense or commercial ASICs. Such an approach can also address the nanofabrication requirements of other low-volume DoD technologies such as photonics and micro-electro-mechanical systems. This program will transition via industry.

Title: Excalibur* Description: * Formerly Adaptive Photonic Phased Locked Elements (APPLE). The Excalibur program will develop high-power electronically-steerable optical arrays, with each array element powered by a fiber laser amplifier. These fiber-laser arrays will be sufficiently lightweight, compact, and electrically efficient to be fielded on a variety of platforms with minimal impact on the platform's original mission capabilities. Each array element will possess an adaptive- optic capability to minimize beam divergence in the presence of atmospheric turbulence, together with wide-field-of-view beam steering for target tracking. With each Excalibur array element powered by a high power fiber laser amplifier (at up to 3 kilowatts per amplifier), high power air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements will be enabled that were previously infeasible because of laser system size and weight. In addition, this program will also develop kilowatt-class arrays of diode lasers that will provide the higher spatial and temporal bandwidths needed to correct for the increased air turbulence effects encountered in ground-to- ground engagements. Excalibur arrays will be conformal to aircraft surfaces and scalable in size and power by adding additional elements to the array. By defending airborne platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles against proliferated, deployed and next- generation man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), Excalibur will enable these reconnaissance platforms to fly at lower altitude and obtain truly persistent, all-weather ground reconnaissance despite low-lying cloud cover. Further capabilities include multi-channel laser communications, target identification, tracking, designation, precision defeat with minimal collateral effects as well as other applications. This technology will transition via industry. In the Excalibur program, efficient high-power laser amplifier arrays based on coherent or spectral beam-combining will be developed.

This content can include images, video, maps, and database access along with tools for visualization of information, and reach back search capabilities. Ubiquitous access to relevant situational awareness and command and control information throughout the battle space is a key objective. Advances in key enabling technologies in Optical RF Communications Adjunct (ORCA), MAINGATE, and WNaN (all budgeted in this PE), and programs in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01, are enabling high-capacity communications to the edge. However, the current centralized or regional storage and dissemination of information presents security, reliability, and capacity challenges in identifying and getting relevant information to users at the edge. Commercial industry has developed approaches to the autonomous dissemination of high demand information by using distributed servers and advanced networking and information database technologies, combined with highly-reliable fixed networking infrastructure with embedded complex information exploitation tools.

Title: Mobile Hot Spots Description: Military users operating at the edge are facing huge challenges with regard to reporting a whole host of tactical activities to include voice reports, accurate and timely position location information (PLI), texting options for unique missions, and imagery and video requirements for high value targets and site exploitation. This large increase in responsibilities at the Battalion, Company, Platoon, Squad, Team, and Special Operations levels requires improved communications capabilities. All requirements grow exponentially due to the proliferation of high-data rate sensors (video, etc), UAVs, and the emergence of the Soldier/Marine as both an operator and a sensor. Thus, the development of tactical tools exploiting these data sources demands new ways of providing this level and sophistication of high bandwidth communications support. This data growth has created a 100-1000x mismatch of data needs and available network capacity. Mobile Hot Spots will provide an analog to the commercial wired solution to exploding high bandwidth requirements that relies on a hierarchical approach using core networks, regional/neighborhood distribution networks, and finally distributed access points. This program will develop the high data rate mobile communications technologies that are required to close the bandwidth gap and create high-capacity and secure wireless- - 10.000 Volume 1 - 278UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 15 of 24 R-1 Line Item #58Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603760E: COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMSPROJECT CCC-02: INFORMATION INTEGRATION SYSTEMS B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Computer, networking, and communication technologies have rapidly matured in the last decade and have had a profound effect on DoD weapons systems. In many instances the combination of those technologies has become either the integral piece of many of the emerging traditional land, air, and sea based weapon platforms or have become a stand alone, non-platform based virtual weapon system. In recognition of this fact, the Secure Information and Network Systems project will develop and test emerging computer, communications, and network systems where the impact of the systems and the vulnerabilities of the systems are not kinetically based. The project will identify, further develop and integrate, and test prototypes of promising network security technologies generated in projects such as, but not limited to, those developed in DARPA's Information & Communications program element (PE 0602303E), Cognitive Computing Systems program element (PE 0602304E), and Machine Intelligence program element (PE 0602305E).

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Network-Centric Warfare Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts. It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission. The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system. The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations. Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness. Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants. These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable. Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning. Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies. Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required. The Maritime Systems project will identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces role in today's network centric warfare concept. Naval forces play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.

Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required. This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic/operational level by generating targeting options against opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tactical/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms and tools, which acquire targets of opportunity and cue network-based analysis of likely enemy operations thus maximizing the effectiveness of ground forces in stability and support operations. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Title: Geospatial Exploitation (GEO) Description: The Geospatial Exploitation (GEO) thrust will provide a new set of geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) products, continuously updated and maintained in a form that ensures their consistency across both product elements (digital elevation models, traditional maps, 3-D structure models, census summaries, and directories) and spatial nodes (coarse resolution country data for economic analysis to fine resolution building data for platoon-level combat operations). Techniques of interest include model-based image analysis (both object recognizers and change detectors), symbolic correlators (both temporal and spatial), and emerging cognitive methods to identify changes to objects, addresses, names, and functions of natural and human-made structures. These algorithms will be scaled to operate on data streams including full-motion video, Laser Identification Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), multi- and hyper-spectral, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in addition to conventional electro-optical (EO) geospatial imagery. GEO algorithm architectures will be explored to achieve scalability through spatial, temporal and ontological partitioning. GEO technologies are planned for transition to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Activities funded within the GEO research space include: The Urban Reasoning and Geospatial Exploitation Technology (URGENT) program is developing a 3-D urban object recognition and exploitation system that enables advanced mission planning and situation analysis capabilities for the warfighter operating in4.127 7.516 - Volume 1 - 293UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 4 of 18 R-1 Line Item #60Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603766E: NETWORK-CENTRIC WARFARE TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NET-01: JOINT WARFARE SYSTEMS B. Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 urban environments. URGENT will create techniques for the rapid exploitation of EO and LIDAR sensor data at the city scale to recognize urban objects down to the soldier scale. URGENT will apply image processing technology to geospatially registered 2-D/3-D data collected from airborne and terrestrial sources, yielding precise annotations for the objects in an urban area. URGENT will also develop a 3-D reasoning engine to query object shapes, locations, and classifications for advanced geospatial exploitation capabilities. The Geospatial Representation Integrated Dataspace (GRID) program is investigating an automated geospatial data fusion, modeling, and dissemination technology for the tactical warfighter. Geospatial registration algorithms have demonstrated success in automatically fusing geospatial data from multiple ISR sources (e.g., electro-optical, full motion video, hyperspectral, and LIDAR) and encoding the fused data as a temporally indexed volumetric model that can potentially reduce geospatial theater ISR sensor data storage requirements while enhancing image quality for exploitation. In addition, converting sensor data enables efficient delivery of geospatial information to the warfighter even with the bandwidth constraints of tactical networks. Based on the success of previous investigations, GRID is investigating a comprehensive 3-D representation of high-resolution data for a broad range of sensor data, including ISR sources as well as medical imaging and scans, common in the manufacturing process. The establishment of the GRID format as an open standard will enable revolutionary efficiencies in the storage, application, and exchange of 3-D information across myriad industries. FY 2010 Accomplishments: Urban Reasoning and Geospatial Exploitation Technology (URGENT) - Developed capability for rapid retraining on one or more new geospatial areas and object classes. - Developed interactive user environment for military geospatial exploitation. - Began the process of transition of selected object recognition technology to a military geospatial analysis environment.

Title: Human-carried Explosive Detection Stand-off System (HEDSS) Description: Insurgent and terrorist elements are increasingly relying on human carried explosives because they are nearly impossible to visibly detect. The goal of the Human-carried Explosive Detection Stand-off System (HEDSS) program was to develop a system that rapidly and automatically identifies human-carried explosives (HCEs) at stand-off ranges. While alternative technologies exist for HCE detection, they necessitate close-in sensing, are expensive and require extended processing times. Successful development of a HEDSS could provide reliable protection for deployed forces from suicide bombers by allowing enough time and space to interdict bombers before they cause maximum damage. The technology transitioned to the Army, Air Force and Marines.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The objective of the Maritime Systems project is to identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept. Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems. Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces. B.

Title: Unmanned/Minimally-manned Underwater Vehicle (UMUV) Description: Increasing requirements for missions in shallow littoral waters have created a need for a survivable and cost- effective capability to perform intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, antisubmarine warfare, special operations forces, and other missions in the littorals. Today we risk manned submarines in waters that are shallower than the length of our hulls and we pit these high value assets against diesel electric submarines that in some cases pose an overmatching threat against our systems in these shallow waters. The Unmanned/Minimally-manned Underwater Vehicle (UMUV) program will develop a vehicle specifically designed to operate in the littoral battlespace with the capability of performing littoral missions that span a wide range of complexity and can be performed with a small manned crew or autonomously (ie, unmanned) depending upon mission requirements. The UMUV will have the autonomy, range and endurance to drive to the fight from a safe basing location, will be capable of carrying the full range of payloads that are needed to support operational needs in littoral waters, and will provide the capability to perform missions where risk to personnel limits our willingness to execute these missions. The program will explore low-cost derivatives of commercial underwater vehicles, the integration of advanced communication and sensor technologies, and the teaming of the UMUV with manned systems. The UMUV program will transition to the Navy. FY 2012 Plans: - Perform technology trades to address key vehicle capabilities. - Develop concept of operations. - Initiate development of enabling technologies. - Initiate system conceptual design.- - 9.000 Title: Tango Bravo Description: Based on the results of the DARPA/Navy Submarine Design Study, the Tango Bravo technology demonstration program is exploring design options for a reduced-size submarine with equivalent capability of the VIRGINIA Class submarine.5.804 1.000 - Volume 1 - 303UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 14 of 18 R-1 Line Item #60Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603766E: NETWORK-CENTRIC WARFARE TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NET-02: MARITIME B. ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 The implicit goal of this program is to reduce platform infrastructure and, ultimately, the cost of future design and production of submarines. The program is a collaborative effort to overcome selected technological barriers that are judged to have a significant impact on submarine platform and infrastructure cost.

Application of these technologies with state-of-the-art undersea warfare sensors will result in a floating field of smart sensors capable of observing the undersea environment in an area, including the presence of submarines and other undersea vehicles. A range of technologies were considered, including those that rely on the local environment (such as wind, ocean waves, solar energy, temperature differentials, etc.) for their power, miniature geolocation technologies, and technologies for sensor data storage, transmission, and intra-field communications. The Renewable At-Sea Power program focuses on efficient energy capture from the environment in order to achieve capability for fully renewable power at sea. Technology from this program will be available for transition to the Navy. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Completed numerical model of system performance and conducted trade studies to evaluate several design alternatives. - Built instrumented platform to test improved endurance and survivability in high sea conditions. - Conducted at-sea testing to validate performance of technologies and system models.

The River Eye effort provided a new capability to predict or assess, in real time, river and estuary conditions that enable special operations mission planning and execution. New techniques were developed to indirectly determine current speed and direction by remotely sensing advection of scene features. Using advanced modeling techniques, indirectly sensed current data provided bathymetry data. Forward circulation models used the bathymetry data to predict future currents and water heights in a mission planning decision support tool. An initial set of algorithms and processes transitioned to the Navy and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in FY 2010; in FY 2011 the algorithms will be extended to enable night-time capability, and will transition to the Navy and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Improved the automation of the current extraction algorithms to handle clouds and moving objects in the time series data. - Developed a variable grid size to improve current resolution. - Developed capability to identify shoals. - Applied inverse model to new physical environments and improved the efficiency of the model. - Demonstrated the inverse model's capability to estimate bathymetry for a new location having an unknown environment. - Transitioned River Eye current and bathymetry algorithms to the Navy and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Sensors Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability and battle damage assessment. The Surveillance and Countermeasures Technology project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high- performance computing and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems. Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with tactical information needed to succeed in future wars. Additionally, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats. The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor processing technologies and systems necessary for the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) mission. The project is primarily driven by four needs: 1) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; 2) countering camouflage, concealment and deception of mobile ground targets; 3) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near real-time; and 4) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control, tracking, timely engagement and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets. The Exploitation Systems project develops algorithms, software, and information processing systems to extract information from massive intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) datasets. In particular, it develops new technologies for detection and discrimination of targets from clutter, classification and fingerprinting of high value targets, localization and tracking over wide areas, and threat network identification and analysis.

Man portable air defense (MANPAD) systems, guided air defense missile systems, and advanced search and track systems, will be addressed with the development of advanced infrared countermeasures. CLIPPS will leverage the systems and focal plane array (FPA) technologies developed in the near and mid-wave infrared (NMIR), and potentially the long-wave infrared (LWIR) bands of the optical spectrum and the directed infrared countermeasures capabilities currently in the field. CLIPSS will provide a near-term demonstration and transition of the advanced capabilities and serve as a pathfinder for the transition to the Services. The primary technical obstacles are the continued development and integration of high sensitivity infrared Focal Plane Array (FPA) and multi-frequency laser technologies into compact, efficient packages for demanding IRCM environments. The real-time processing of the data over wide-fields-of view to rapidly cue countermeasures poses significant systems integration challenges and will be addressed by this demonstration.

Title: Adaptable Navigation Systems (ANS)* Description: * Formerly Robust Surface Navigation. The Adaptable Navigation Systems (ANS) program (previously funded under PE 0603768E, Project GT-01) will provide the U.S. warfighter with the ability to navigate effectively in all environments, including when Global Positioning System (GPS) is unavailable due to hostile action (e.g. jamming) or blockage by structures and foliage. The ANS approach relies on two major technology innovations. The first is the use of Signals of Opportunity (SoOp) from a variety of ground, air, and space-based sources. These will be received on the Services' forthcoming software-defined radios and use specially tailored algorithms to determine position. The second technology innovation allows SoOp-based position information to be combined with inertial and other sensors to enable flexible navigation systems that can be reconfigured in the field to support any platform or environment. While component technology for positioning, navigation, and timing is advancing rapidly (in the form of MEMS devices, clocks, and new aiding sensors), real-time integration and reconfiguration of these components is not possible given today's navigation filters and centralized processing architectures, which are inherently fragile to change. Recent advances in mathematics, data abstraction, and network architectures could enable \"plug-and-play\" integration of both existing and future navigation components to allow real-time integration and reconfiguration of navigation systems. If successful, major improvements in navigation accuracy and system cost could also be realized. Early transition partners would include all Services, with emphasis on platforms and users that must operate in multiple environments.

Title: Adaptable, Low Cost Sensors Description: The objective of the Adaptable, Low Cost Sensor program is to leverage commercial technology and commercial manufacturing techniques with antenna technologies developed in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01 to significantly reduce the cost of sensors and sensor systems. Military sensors are currently developed as unique designs that fully integrate mission- specific hardware required for sensing, with all of the other non-mission specific capabilities, including sensors (e.g., GPS), processing, memory storage and communications into a single device. Not only does this approach significantly increase the cost of the device, it makes changing requirements extremely difficult and the upgrading of any specific component impossible. However, significant advances have been made in the capabilities of commercial equipment for almost all of those non-mission capabilities, mostly driven by the smart phone industry. This makes it possible to create a mission-independent, designed- to-cost \"commercial smart core\" that can be combined with an applique of mission-specific hardware to provide the overall sensing capability. Because the core can be upgraded independently of any particular mission, sensors can make use of the advances and decreasing cost that is inherent in commercial technology. Because commercial technology can be used in the core, commercial development and manufacturing techniques can also be leveraged, further improving the cost and development time of sensor systems. In addition, this program will enable effective distributed sensor systems that were previously infeasible due to high cost of individual sensors. This program will transition to the Services. FY 2012 Plans: - Manufacture initial version of commercial smart core. - Identify candidate sensors for ground and airborne demonstrations and quantify the required performance, including adaptability. - Define objectives for distributed sensor systems (ground and UAV) and quantify performance against traditional, non-distributed systems. - Develop a distributed ground sensor system using smart core. - Develop smart core re-usable software and ground mission software. - Define objectives for ground system field test and plan field test activities.- - 16.700 Title: Rescue Transponder (RT) Description: Building upon technologies developed in other sensor programs, the Rescue Transponder (RT) program investigated the use of a unique localization and tracking technology to provide a very low probability of detection (LPD) call for help signal.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery. The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets. The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments.

Specific examples of these technologies includes: gigapixel focal plane arrays; advanced digital signal processors for giga-pixel image formation; advanced image processing algorithms for real- time detection, identification, and tracking of elusive and deceptive military targets; and advanced optics, telescopes and gimbals for high-resolution image capture. The Wide Area Video Surveillance program integrates these technologies in proof-of-concept prototypes for demonstration on military platforms including large and small, manned and unmanned aerial vehicles. Wide Area Video Surveillance technologies are planned for transition to the U.S. Air Force.

Several prototype optical surveillance and observation systems will be developed that will: (1) demonstrate probabilities of recognition and identification at distances sufficient to allow stand-off engagement; (2) overcome atmospheric turbulence, which now limits the ability of high-resolution optics; and (3) increase target identification confidence to reduce fratricide and/or collateral damage. The program will develop and integrate the necessary component technologies including high-energy pulsed lasers, receiver telescopes that have a field of view and depth of field that obviates the need for steering or focusing the optical system, computational imaging algorithms to improve system resolution, and data exploitation and analysis tools. Advances in laser systems, digital imagers, and novel image processing algorithms will be leveraged to result in the reduction of the overall size, weight and power of imaging systems to allow for soldier portable and UAV platform integration. MIST will also continue to integrate technologies developed under the Crosswind Sensor System for Snipers (C-WINS) and the Dynamic Image Gunsight Optics (DInGO) efforts. MIST will develop an optical rifle scope that enables a soldier, with minimal training, to shoot a firearm with marksman accuracy at range while also enhancing the capability for close quarters combat.

This system provides the unprecedented capability to collect accurate, high resolution 3-D data over wide areas, to support a wide range of high-value applications, including detailed mission planning, vertical obstruction detection, helicopter landing zone analysis, and imagery geolocation. The pathway to accomplish this goal includes improving the robustness and reliability of the sensor, conducting demonstrations, and training with CONUS flight tests leading to OCONUS operational experimentation in partnership with the Army. HALOE successfully completed the CONUS flight testing phase and has deployed OCONUS to address current and emerging needs of U.S. forces under the direction of commanders in theater.

Title: NetTrack Description: The NetTrack Program is developing feature-aided tracking technologies to enable airborne surveillance radars to maintain track on moving high value targets (HVTs) in traffic and cluttered environments. Ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radars provide excellent potential for tracking HVTs because they operate in all weather and at long ranges. However, maintaining target tracks is very challenging because obscuration and close target spacing make it difficult to associate radar kinematic measurements over time. To address this challenge, NetTrack is developing feature aided tracking technology that automatically collects and exploits target high range resolution (HRR) radar measurements. Specific NetTrack technologies include signal processing to generate HRR measurements from raw radar returns, feature extraction and matching to exploit HRR measurements, multiple hypothesis tracking to associate measurements to tracks and estimate target location and velocity, and sensor resource management to automatically select optimum radar mode parameters and timing sequences. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) has been established for transition of NetTrack to the Navy Advanced Airborne Sensor which is a follow-on to the Navy Littoral Surveillance Radar System.7.890 2.000 - Volume 1 - 325UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 18 of 30 R-1 Line Item #61Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT SEN-02: SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS B.

Title: Large Area Coverage Search-while-Track and Engage (LACOSTE) Description: The Large Area Coverage Search-while-Track and Engage (LACOSTE) program enables persistent, tactical- grade ground-moving target indicator (GMTI) capability in dense urban areas. Wide-area continuous tracking of moving vehicles requires very small coverage gaps, small resolution cells, and target separation and identification features. The ideal sensor has the area coverage rates of GMTI radar and the resolution/identification capabilities of an electro-optical infrared system. The LACOSTE program will provide wide area surveillance, simultaneous tracking, and target engagement with electro-optical and infrared sensors for tactical GMTI operations. The program is developing a sensor with a very wide field of regard, and a wide instantaneous field of view (FOV) that is rapidly scanned in a search-while-track mode, tracking up to thousands of targets in an urban area. Additionally, the LACOSTE sensor will provide next-generation precision tracking to enable engagement on a large number of targets in dense urban areas within that same field of regard with minimal penalty on the search-mode area coverage rate. The program is also developing a rapid \"zoom\" capability for target identification that enables feature-aided tracking through dense target environments, plus sufficient target identification for separating like-targets when back-tracking a particular target via the historical track data. The LACOSTE technology is planned for transition to the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army at the conclusion of the program.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Description: The Crosswind Sensor System for Snipers (C-WINS) program provided optical techniques to correct for crosswinds on ballistic objects. The C-WINS program developed a novel weapon mounted optical correction sighting system for various rifles and machine guns. An eye-safe laser and a high speed camera record motion of eddies in the atmosphere to measure the wind profile that will be used to provide ballistic correction. The system provides offset corrections to the shooter for compensating the aim point affected by the crosswind. Key parameters of interest are: a) bullet hit points less than the target size at any range up to weapons effective range; b) down range profiling up to weapons effective range; c) ranging accuracy sufficient to provide elevation correction; d) automatic ballistic correction; e) day/night operation; and f) no setup or calibration. Additional capabilities could include: increased effective ranges for a wide range of weapons; eye safe ranging; increased ID range during day and night; and shimmer compensation. Smaller size, weight, and power (SWAP) and increased engagement range are additional objectives for FY 2010. This program will transition to the U.S. Army and Marines. Leveraging technologies developed under the Crosswind Sensor System for Snipers (C-WINS) program, the Dynamic Image Gunsight Optics (DInGO) program will develop an optical scope that enables a soldier, with minimal training, to shoot a firearm with marksman accuracy. The ability to engage targets at range with a conventional firearm is currently limited by user training rather than the accuracy of the weapon. The technology developed under this program line will enhance a soldier's ability to observe and engage targets at range as well as enhance the capability for close quarters combat. Technical achievements under other programs in this PE/Project provide the basis for radically new approaches to optical scopes, dynamic imaging systems, and low-power video analytics. By extending the capability of combat optics, DInGO enables a soldier to operate at the limit of the system performance with reduced training requirements. DInGO technology will integrate with the Military Imaging and Surveillance Technology (MIST) program (in this PE/Project). Transition to the Army is anticipated.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 - Verify performance under extended operating conditions via simulation. Title: Multi-Sensor Exploitation Description: The Multi-Sensor Exploitation program provides multi-sensor exploitation capabilities enabling missions such as overwatch, border surveillance, high value target tracking, and threat network detection using mixes of imaging, radar, signals, human intelligence, and other sources. Key challenges in the first two missions include real-time and wide area dismount and vehicle target detection, discrimination, tracking, and pattern of life analysis. Key challenges in the third mission include tracking through periods of obscuration and confusion in environments in which existing sensors and methods are not able to provide high quality signature data. Key challenges in the fourth mission include discriminating threats from large volumes of civilian clutter and determining the behavior patterns of and relationships between those threats. The Multi-sensor Exploitation program will develop new target tracking methods for wide area motion imaging sensors enabling long duration tracking of vehicles and dismounts through the development of new target dynamic modeling methods, new processing methods tailored to dismounts, and new methods for signature aided tracking. Scalable stochastic modeling and inference techniques will yield improved situation awareness and assessment for wide-area EO/IR motion imaging, radar, and multi-sensor exploitation applications in settings where large numbers of interacting entities engaged in complex activities are observed over long periods of time. Techniques intended for use in riverine and maritime environments, where extremist and criminal groups threaten political stability, trade routes, and free commerce, must quickly map navigable tributary systems, rapidly detect and identify threats, and monitor their activity. The program will develop new methods for automatically correlating different sources of information to identify threats, estimate threat networks, and analyze behavioral patterns.

Title: Foliage Penetrating Radar Planning and Exploitation Description: The Foliage Penetrating Radar Planning and Exploitation program will complete final Forester FOPEN radar demonstrations and provide further exploitation capabilities to find dismounted targets in densely forested terrain. Current foliage penetrating radar systems provide an important capability for detecting dismount targets under foliage, but the systems also detect animals, moving water, blowing trees, and other scene clutter moving under or in the foliage that makes situation assessment manpower and radar resource intensive. Further, Doppler signature data that experiments indicate may enable improved automated discrimination of dismount targets from other detections is not currently exploited. Finally, no planning tools are available for optimizing and dynamically replanning collection assets to improve imaging geometries and detectability. This program will provide capabilities to address these issues by exploiting Doppler signature data, automating temporal processing approaches currently used, and automating terrain, weather, and on-line exploitation data to enable planning and dynamic replanning. The result will be significantly improved capability for finding and localizing targets under foliage. The program will transition to USSOUTHCOM and USSOCOM.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Guidance Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it is developing system oriented technologies that will improve our ability to navigate weapon systems with more precision and increase the capability to meet current and emerging threats. Consequently, this program element is merging with the Sensors Technology program element in FY 2011. Many of the guidance programs have ended eliminating the need for such a specifically focused program element. The Guidance Technology project increases the ability of Global Positioning System (GPS) users to operate effectively in the presence of enemy jamming; to increase the versatility of navigation systems applications by developing microelectromechanical sensor inertial navigation system technologies; and to apply the geolocation technologies/techniques to precision threat geolocation of short-dwell emitters or passive air defense systems.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Fire-and-forget stand-off weapons need precise targeting information if critical fixed and mobile targets are to be eliminated effectively with minimal collateral damage and minimum cost-per-kill. This requires that: 1) military surveillance and targeting systems geolocate targets accurately in the same coordinate system in which the weapon system navigates; 2) the surveillance, targeting and weapon systems have precision navigation and guidance systems on-board; and 3) navigation and target location systems robustly operate day/night and in adverse weather. In addition, future systems designed to accomplish precision strike missions must be significantly more affordable. Thrusts are included in this project to improve our ability to navigate when the Global Positioning System (GPS) is jammed or otherwise unavailable; to increase the versatility of navigation systems applications by developing microelectromechanical sensor inertial navigation system technologies; and to apply the geolocation technologies/techniques to precision threat geolocation of short-dwell emitters or passive air defense systems. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 Title: Multifunctional Electro-Optics for Defense of U.S. Aircraft (MEDUSA) Description: The Multifunction Electro-Optics for Defense of U.S. Aircraft (MEDUSA) program developed the technologies and systems to give the U.S. air dominance at low altitude and at night. This program developed technologies to leap-frog reactive end-game countermeasures and enable increased threat warning times, denial of launch, and put Electro Optical-Infrared (EO- IR) air defense threats at risk in the Near Infrared (NIR), Mid-wave Infrared (MWIR) and Long-wave Infrared (LWIR) regimes. MEDUSA 1) conducted phenomenological measurements and developed countermeasures and target classification/identification techniques; 2) developed critical component technologies such as high-power IR laser sources, advanced IR detectors, and fibers for high-power IR transmission; and 3) developed and demonstrated an end-to-end MEDUSA system. The MEDUSA technology is available for transition to the Air Force and Army. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Completed design and fabrication of large format 256x256 Near/Mid-Wave Infrared (NMIR) detector and Readout Integrated Circuits (ROICs) supporting proactive Infrared Counter Measure (IRCM) and other applications. - Completed laboratory and outdoor testing of hybridized 128x128 NMIR detector arrays and ROICs. - Performed analysis of measured-range precision demonstrated by the 128x128 focal plane arrays.7.460 - - Title: Robust Surface Navigation (RSN) Description: The Robust Surface Navigation (RSN) program will provide the U.S. warfighter with the ability to navigate effectively when the Global Positioning System (GPS) is unavailable due to hostile action (e.g. jamming) or blockage by structures and5.239 - - Volume 1 - 340UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 3 of 5 R-1 Line Item #62Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2012 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2011 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603768E: GUIDANCE TECHNOLOGYPROJECT GT-01: GUIDANCE TECHNOLOGY B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 foliage. The RSN program will use Signals of Opportunity (SoOP) from a variety of ground, air, and space-based sources, augmented by judiciously placed RF beacons. These will be received on the warfighter's forthcoming software defined radios and use specially tailored algorithms to determine position. The greater strength and diversity of these signals will provide coverage when GPS is denied due to environmental conditions or hostile activity. This is a two-part program: (1) cataloging and assessing potential exploitable signals followed by analysis and performance modeling and hardware-based concept validation, and; (2) designing, testing, and demonstrating a (non-form-fit) prototype receiver(s) and algorithms for geolocation using the SoOP. Beginning in FY 2011, this program is budgeted in PE 0603767E, Project SEN-01. The RSN technology is planned for transition to the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and the U.S. Army with specific elements of the program transitioning to the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force. FY 2010 Accomplishments: - Initiated development of RSN prototype system and planning for field tests and demonstrations in dense urban environments, including within large buildings and urban canyons. - Developed test plan for total system readiness demonstration. - Conducted Critical Design Review in preparation for development of non-form-fit prototype system. Title: Sub-Surface Navigation (SsN) Description: Building on technologies developed under the RSN program, the Sub-Surface Navigation (SsN) program provided the U.S. warfighter with the ability to navigate effectively underground, where the Global Positioning System (GPS) is unavailable. SsN also enables long endurance or covert underground missions where alternative navigation aids like inertial measurement units (IMUs) or inertial navigation units (INUs) are unsuitable. The SsN program uses specialized low frequency RF beacons and specially tailored algorithms to provide 3-dimensional navigation of personnel and mobile platforms underground. The greater strength and diversity of these signals provide coverage when GPS is denied due to lack of penetration through the earth. The SsN technology is available for transition to the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM).
