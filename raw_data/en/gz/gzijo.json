Boost your immunity in minutes! Chinese Medicine supports the idea that the goal of a good doctor is to prevent illness before it occurs by supporting and strengthening the body and the immune system proactively. Acupressure strengthens our natural resistance to disease by making our bodies and minds stronger and more resilient. This flu season acupressure protocol can be used daily like a natural immune booster. Why deal with an illness when you can simply avoid it or make it a minor issue? These acupressure points below are a great protocol to strengthen the whole body, not just your immune system. If you are not able to get to your favorite acupuncturist on a regular basis, the following points will help you keep the flu or common colds at bay this year! And it's so safe, effective and easy that you can help do this on your kids and elder family members. Immune Boosting Points! | | |Kidney 27 - The Elegant Mansion | Kidney 27 is a superior immune-boosting point especially for the flu and influenza and for people that are extra prone to catch upper respiratory flu symptoms as it strengthens the immune system by enhancing the respiratory system.In Chinese Medicine the Kidneys sand Lungs have a close connection as the Kidneys grasp the Lung Qi as it is breathed in and moves the oxygen through the rest of the body. Kidney 27 is located roughly one inch from the midline on the lower border of the collar bone. | | |Ren 17 - Chest Center / Ren 6 - Sea of Qi | These two points can be pressed at the same time. Ren 17 and Ren 6 both fortify the immune system. Ren 17 regulates the thymus gland, which stimulates the immune system and decrease any anxiety or worry. It is located on the midline just slightly above the nipple level. Ren 6 tonifies and boosts the immune system and maintains overall good health and is located on the midline two finger breaths below the naval. | | |Large Intestine 11 - Brook at the Crook | Large Intestine 11, although better much more as a fever-reducing point, is also used to help prevent colds, flus and other immune-compromising conditions. With this point it's best to palpate around the area to find the most-tender spot. The exact location is determined according to sensitivity in that area. You can find this point at the lateral edge of the elbow crease. | | |Lung 7 - Divide of the Cleft | Lung 7 is a very common point to use for systematic relief of cough, headache and/or stiff neck; though it can be used to increase the defensive qi and your immune system. To locate it simply make a thumbs-up sign. When you do that you'll see a depression at the base of your thumb (referred to as the anatomical snuffbox). From that depression, Lung 7 is located approximately two finger widths up your arm. | | |SJ5 - Outer Gate | Another great point immune boosting point is SJ5, located on the back of the hand, 2 finger breaths from the crease of the wrist between the ulna and radius on the forearm. It helps balance the immune systems and strengthen the whole body, especially useful is you feel a fever coming on. | | |Li4 - Joining Valley | Li4, or Joining Valley is a famous decongestant and anti-inflammatory point; it is a powerful point for any head pain or tension issues and strengthens the immune system. Located between the thumb and first finger from the wrist crease to the fist knuckle. | | |Stomach 36 - 3 Leg Mile | Stomach 36 is one of the most effective acupuncture points for strengthening the immune system, recovering from fatigue and boosts endurance in general. It's like a Vitamin C shot for your body. Acupuncturists often incorporate this point into treatments because it is such an energizing point. Stomach 36 is found about a hand length below the patella of the knee, just outside the prominent tibia bone. Sometimes pressing this point, if it's done firmly enough, will produce a strong sensation that travels down the leg. How to Do the Routine Here are a few quick tips on performing acupressure on these points: Before performing acupressure on any of these points, get into a comfortable position from which you can easily access all points Start from the top down: Begin with Kidney 27 and work your way down the body. So, the order should be Kidney 27, Ren 17 & 6, Large Intestine 11, Lung 7, Stomach 36. For Kidney 27 and Stomach 36, since you have both hands free, press the point on both sides of the body at the same time. For Lung 7 and Large Intestine 11, try pressing the point on each side of the body to determine whether one side is more tender than the other. If so, focus your acupressure sessions on the tender side. If both are equally tender (or not at all), you can pick either, or take turns pressing the points on both sides. Spend one minute on each point. Apply firm pressure while breathing steadily into your abdomen. This routine is very relaxing, so you can also do this over the holidays when you feel overwhelmed by all the things that need to get done, so feel free to repeat it. As a maintenance routine, aim to complete this 10-minute routine once in the morning and once before bed. If you start feeling fatigued, weak or like you might be coming down with something, then repeat up to three times a day. Wishing you a flu-free remainder "}
