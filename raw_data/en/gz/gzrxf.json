They are pushing boundaries, achieving firsts, innovating and breaking traditional rules to improve the world. The [Forum of Young Global Leaders](https://www.younggloballeaders.org/) was founded in 2004 by Klaus Schwab, Founder and Chairman of the World Economic Forum, to create a world where leaders take responsibility for a sustainable future, while meeting increasingly complex and interrelated challenges. Today, the Forum counts 1,300 members and alumni, representing more than 115 countries. Notable members include Yao Chen, actress, Amal Clooney, lawyer, Hilary Cottam, author, Wanuri Kahiu, Filmmaker, Carlos Alvarado Quesada, President of Costa Rica, Jack Ma, Founder of Alibaba, and Jimmy Wales, Founder of Wikipedia. YGLs are active in today's most exciting and dynamic fields and work with a focus on [impact](https://www.weforum.org/our-impact/connecting-the-most-outstanding-young-leaders). In the past year, they have collaborated together to [accelerate refugee entrepreneurship](https://www.weforum.org/our-impact/fostering-entrepreneurship-connects-refugees-with-global-economy) to unlock local talent and inject an estimated GDP of $56 million from Kenya's Kakuma camp into the global economy. They have worked to [solve waste management](https://www.weforum.org/our-impact/toilet-transformation-changing-waste-management-across-india) challenges by focusing on improving treatment capacity in Indian plants, and more broadly, they have [equipped young generations](https://www.weforum.org/our-impact/equipping-future-public-leaders-to-transform-the-way-governments-innovate) with the tools to effectively influence politics and policy. This year, over half the new members are women, [and nearly half of Young Global Leaders are from emerging economies]. They represent a diverse group with an ability to enhance understanding and promote action. Members of the new class will take part in a five-year programme that includes executive education courses, group expeditions and opportunities to collaborate and test ideas with a trusted network of peers. This will also be an opportunity for them to identify ways in which their ground-breaking work can advance new models of innovation and make a difference in their communities. \"By championing these promising and accomplished leaders we hope to create positive ripple effects that benefit entire communities. In response to a startling decline in trust in leadership over the past decade, these Young Global Leaders inspire the world through their dynamism, passion and integrity,\" said Mariah Levin, Head of the Forum of Young Global Leaders at the World Economic Forum.
