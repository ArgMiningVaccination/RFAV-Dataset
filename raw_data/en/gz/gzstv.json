The world of medicine is changing today and the world is leaning towards the holistic approach. There is no doubt about the fact that the world of medicine is highly progressive. But are all the inclusive fields progressing at the same pace? Surveys show that they are not. In fact conventional medicines are proving to be increasingly inadequate in more ways than one. People are turning to natural or unnatural? Traditional Chinese medicine uses herbal medicines and various mind and body practices, such as acupuncture and tai chi, to treat or prevent health problems (National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health). Western medicine is a system in which medical doctors and other healthcare professionals such as nurses, pharmacists, and therapists treat symptoms and diseases using drugs, radiation or surgery.

Medicine helps people who have, for example, Type One Diabetes live and have a good life. It makes people who have blood disorders, which are lethal, live and have normal lives. Modern medicine is not like how it was to be. For instance in the past the Ancient Egyptians used magicians to cure themselves of illnesses, because of them believing in multiple gods will cure them. The Egyptians of all the items developed by the Greeks, I believe that medicine was one of the most important inventions that we could not live without. I also feel as if it would be impossible to live without medicine because it is such a huge deal. The reason I feel as if medicine is the most important is because it is pretty much a cure to save individuals' lives. Just image, every fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, wounded cut, etc. we use medicine to make it all better and get the infection out of our system The interest of a career in medicine developed from my passion for sports from a young age, seeing my favourite bowler Brett Lee injured just before the T20 world cup in 2010. My natural trait to think outside the box sparked my interest in the intricacies of the human body, the delicate balance between health and illness pushed me to be more critical and analytic of our body and the way it works. I started to think about one of the quote of Christopher Morley \"A human being is an ingenious assembly Osteopathic medicine is a type of medical practice which focuses on enhancing the body's ability to heal itself. An Osteopath, also called a D.O or Doctor of Osteopathic medicine puts an emphasis on preventative medicine. This type of doctor additionally believes that all systems in the body work together to repair the body. Just like medical doctors, they are skilled, and licensed to prescribe medicine and do surgeries. They can also practice any medical specialty they select. Osteopathic medicine was Regenerative Medicine and the PCR Technique By Ben Wooddell Science is continuously evolving. Research into new and exciting fields reveals exciting new information on a daily basis. Since the very beginnings of science, science has always been helping mankind live longer and healthier lives. Every day scientists are still discovering new things, and sometimes these discoveries require doing things that stretch the boundaries of animal and human ethics, all for the greater good. Since the ancient Herbalism is one of the traditional or folk medicine practice which is also known as medical herbalism, botanical medicine, herbology, herbal medicine, and phytotherapy. The scope of herbal medicine is extends from plants to fungal and bee products, as well as animal parts (Acharya and Shrivastava, 2008). Study about traditional use of medicines is recognized as a better way to learn about the potential future medicines. Around 80 of the modern medicines used were derived from \"ethnomedical\" plant harmful effects of drugs. For a long time in the history of medicine, the concern and focus has always been on developing new drugs, and little attention was being given to other areas of improvement of the current medicine. The use of digital technology to profile the disease-causing organisms has made it easy for cross references to be carried out by other researchers; this has been instrumental in managing the research information on medicine and their Detoxification Herbal medicine Homeopathic medicine Nutritional counseling Mind and body medicine Stress management Life style Coaching How Does it work? Naturopathic medicine philosophy serves as the basis for naturopathic practice. The current scope of naturopathic practice includes, but is not limited to: Clinical Nutrition A cornerstone of naturopathic practice is that food is the best medicine. Many medical conditions can be treated Organization a medicine cabinet can appear to be amazingly pointless. Things keep adding up, and, if your medicine cabinet is anything else like mine, it's your lone genuine stockpiling for your bathroom. I need to ensure our medicine cabinet is constantly organized, or things begin to advance toward the counter. At the point when that appears, I know the time has come to get things organized! We have next to no counter space, so I get a kick out of the chance to stay the counters as clear as could Like any other structured system, colonial medicine left quite a number of legacies in the world today. Medicine was a very important tool used during colonization and as Keller, in his article Geographies or power, legacies of mistrust: Colonial medicine in the global present, argues: \"biomedicine is a peculiarly western idiom despite its Universalist claims\" (Keller, 2006). This essay will explore two of the many legacies of colonial medicine in the world today namely undermining traditional healers In the later part of the 19th century, and the beginning of the 20th century, medicine was able to claim prestige in America. This was largely due to three factors: the greater role of science, improvements and new developments in technology, and the political alliances that educated medical men were able to form. At this point in time, humoral and miasma theories were being overshadowed by germ theory. Hard, scientific evidence was not present in the great majority of previous medial theories. thought that since Lia got sick in America that they have \"...done this to her, and our medicine cannot fix that\" (p. 258). Again, the Hmong value their ethnic medicine due to the ancestor's progressive, trusted therapy techniques, and therefore utilized their treatments without hesitation.

I feel like there were many misunderstandings about the purpose of the medicinal among thousands of people was syphilis. It spread from sailors from Columbus's first voyage to Spanish soldiers to French troops. The research into the human anatomy began during this period, which led to several medical misconceptions. Renaissance medicine was characterized by a movement Career Issue Research Do the benefits of becoming a sports medicine physician outweigh the possible health risks involved with the career. Sports medicine physicians record athletes' medical histories and perform and maintain records. They also record athletes' medical histories and perform physical examinations\" (\"Sports Medicine Physician\"). The three different branches of the sports medicine field are Primary Care Doctors, Orthopedic Surgeons, and Sports Psychiatrist\" (Cresswell). \"A doctor must Medicine in Medieval Europe was basic and mainly based on superstition. During this era, medical knowledge was very low, and very ineffective but it gradually became stronger and built up along the way. Medicine in that time included many herbal remedies as well as poor surgeries and links to astrology. Many of these ideas and beliefs soon developed therefore, growing the knowledge. How and Who Influenced/ Discovered Medicine Complementary medicine is a range of therapies that do not utilize scientific medicine, but can be used alongside with it, where as alternative medicine is used in place of scientific medicine. Complementary and alternative medicine can be used together and is known as CAM. CAM is, \"a broad range of modalities outside the traditional Western medicine approach to care\" (Ritter & Graham, 68). Some examples of CAM can include acupuncture, yoga, and herbal medicine. Within recent years there has been inspired me to go into medicine, I see people who are not only immersed in their craft but utilize unconventional ways to not only progress the field of medicine but also our understanding of the human condition. People like Oliver Sacks, Atul Gawande, Adam Gazzaley, and the like who practice and have a larger platform delving into utilizing medicine as a tool for larger social purposes\u2014using the power of art along the way.
