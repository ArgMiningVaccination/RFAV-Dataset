DeGaetano, DO, Ted D. Epperly, MD, Andrew C. Hannapel, MD, Daniel R. Miller, MD, and Andree] Lloyd, PhD Background: Varicella infection causes substantial morbidity in young adults. Most military basic trainees are 18 to 21 years old, yet the Army has no varicella vaccination policy. We therefore determined varicella susceptibility in a population of Army basic trainees, examined variables that might predict antibody status, and developed a vaccination strategies model. Methods: Fifteen-hundred ninety-five trainees completed a demographic and historical questionnaire. Varicella antibody status was determined on 1201 volunteers. These data plus information from the literature were used to construct a decision tree of vaccination strategies that was applied to the total population of Army basic trainees in 1995 (n = 65,298). Results: Fifty (4.2 percent) of 1201 soldiers were antibody negative. Trainees who lived with no or 1 sibling while growing up were most likely to be seronegative (P < 0.01). The positive predictive value of a history of varicella was 98.5 percent, whereas the negative predictive value of a negative history of varicella was 23 percent. In the vaccination strategies model, serologically testing soldiers with a negative history of varicella and vaccinating those without protective antibodies was the most cost-effective approach. Conclusions: In young adults a positive varicella history accurately predicts immunity, but verification of a negative history with antibody testing is recommended before vaccination. (J Am Board Fam Pract 1998;11:296-306.) Varicella infections are a major source of morbidity and mortality in young adults. I The risks of vari\u00ad cella infection increase after 15 years of age and are particularly great in those aged 20 years and older.I,2 Seroprevalence studies estimate that 8 percent of adults 20 years and older lack evidence of antibody against varicella virus and are thus con\u00ad sidered susceptible to chickenpox. I,3-S Of these adults an estimated 33 per 100,000 per year will become infected with the varicella virus.2 Fourteen to 18 per 1000 adult cases require hospitalization for their illness (1 in 400 for varicella pneumonitis) compared with only 1 to 2 per 1000 childhood cases, and for every 100,000 adults infected per Submitted, revised, 3 April 1998.

Although military trainees and their age-matched civilian counterparts have simi\u00ad lar susceptibility to varicella infection,3-s recruits are required to live in barracks, an environment that promotes the rapid spread of highly conta\u00ad gious organisms. In studies of military varicella epidemics, up to 70 percent of susceptible adults have become infected.7 Because of the potential for epidemic spread, barracks-d',Velling trainees with chickenpox are routinely hospitalized for isolation purposes. If they miss more than 48 consecutive hours of training, recruits are disenrolled from training and must recycle at a later date, which re\u00ad sults in a considerable financial burden to the Army. In 1995,45 (0.07 percent) of 65,298 active\u00ad duty Army basic training entrants were reported to be hospitalized for clinical chickenpox (LTC Mark on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from Rubertone, MD, MPH, Walter Reed Army Insti\u00ad tute of Research (WRAIR), e-mail, 28 Aug 1996). The actual number of trainees infected is likely to be higher because it is probable that some cases were not accurately reported or went unrecog\u00ad nized and some soldiers might have been allowed to convalesce at home. Although the varicella vaccine was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration in 1995, the Department of the Army has not yet es\u00ad tablished an official policy regarding varicella vac\u00ad cination. Finding and vaccinating susceptible trainees could reduce wasted financial and man\u00ad power resources, but the most cost-effective ap\u00ad proach remains unclear. Several studies have shown that a stated history of having had chicken\u00ad pox correlates well with the presence of antibodies to varicella virus. A negative or unsure history of chickenpox, however, has not reliably predicted negative antibody status in the studies, with 60 to 80 percent of people in these response groups having detectable antibody against varicella.3,5 Even though antibody testing for all soldiers be\u00ad fore vaccination against varicella would be the most accurate way to protect them against chick\u00ad enpox, it might not be the most desirable strategy for economic and logistic reasons. Studies in the pediatric population suggest that presumptive vaccination based on clinical history alone is a more cost-effective approach than first verifying antibody status in children who have a negative or uncertain history of chickenpox before vaccination.8-11 Generalization of results from pe\u00ad diatric patients to soldiers is not appropriate, how\u00ad ever, because susceptibility rates are much higher in children. There are no studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of varicella vaccination strategies in an adult population. Another issue with relevance to any proposed Army varicella vaccination policy is the unex\u00ad plained declining rate of hospitalizations for varicella in the past several years. The number of recruits reported hospitalized annually from 1990 to 1995 has declined from 149 to 45 (LTC Mark Rubertone, MD, MPH, WRAIR, personal communication, 28 Aug 1996). Similar findings\u00b7 have also been reported recently in the US Navy population, which had only 473 hospitalizations (a rate of74 per 100,000 personnel) in all active\u00ad duty Navy and Marine Corps personnel in 1994.12,13 Thus, it is unclear whether suscepti-bility data from even the recent past remain ap\u00ad plicable to recent recruits. The purposes of this study were (1) to define the current prevalence of antibodies to the vari\u00ad cella virus in active-duty Army Advanced Individ\u00ad ual Training (AIT) recruits, (2) to determine whether demographic variables and patient-re\u00ad ported chickenpox history can accurately predict antibody status, and (3) to develop a decision model to explore the effectiveness and costs of var\u00ad ious options for vaccinating susceptible recruits against varicella. Methods Demographic Study Study participants included in-processing AIT stu\u00ad dents from the 447th Signal Battalion located at Fort Gordon, Ga. Newly arrived soldiers reported on a weekly basis to the Connelly Health Clinic, a troop medical clinic on Fort Gordon, during the 8- month study period, which ran from 29 April through 9 December 1996. AIT soldiers are young men and women completing their Army basic training requirement. Participating soldiers were read a standardized statement regarding the purposes of the study and briefed on the risks of phlebotomy. Every soldier then received a copy of the study questionnaire, which contained questions regarding the following demographic variables: sex, age, ethnicity, educa\u00ad tion level, geographic region of origin, population of city of origin, and number of siblings living with the soldier while growing up. One question also required the soldiers to recall whether they defi\u00ad nitely had, probably had, did not have, or were not sure whether they had chickenpox in the past. All soldiers were asked to complete the questionnaire regardless of participation in the phlebotomy por\u00ad tion of the study. After questionnaire completion, soldiers were asked to volunteer for phlebotomy. Volunteers reviewed and signed an informed consent form according to the guidelines established by the research protocol, which was approved by the Eisenhower Army Medical Center (EAMC) In\u00ad stitutional Review Committee. Phlebotomy was performed by medics, nurses, physicians, and physician assistants. Five to 10 mL of blood were collected in red-top tubes according to standard blood-drawing techniques and precautions.

Confidentiality was maintained, as individual serologic test results were only known by laboratory personnel and the investigating physicians. Participating soldiers were mailed the results of their serum assay and directed to their lo\u00ad cal troop clinic for further questions. Data analysis was performed on an IBM\u00ad compatible computer using SPSS for Windows, Version 6.1.3.15 Percentages were calculated for re\u00ad sponses to questionnaire demographic and history questions. A series of chi-square analyses were conducted to compare the responses to the various demographic variables with the results of serologic testing. Discriminant analysis was performed on responses to the varicella historical questions de\u00ad signed to predict serologic status. Vaccination Approaches Model A decision tree (Figure 1, parts 1,2, and 3) was created to outline potential policy options and projected outcomes for varicella vaccination in Army AIT students. Decision tree branches were constructed for both one-and two-vaccination approaches. Although two doses of vaccine are routinely recommended for adult immunization, we wanted to determine whether a single dose might be more cost-effective in a mass protection troop setting. The model assumes that no pa\u00ad tients would be lost to follow-up because AIT student time is accounted for 24 hours a day throughout the training period. Because the ac\u00ad curacy of the ELISA assay is 97.4 percent, all pol\u00ad icy options involving antibody testing include branches for both false-positive and false-nega\u00ad tive test results. 14 Several possible end points for each policy op\u00ad tion might be obtained: natural protection, vac\u00ad cine-induced protection, and no protection. Those with natural protection were presumed safe from chickenpox. A subset of those undergoing vaccina\u00ad tion were assumed still susceptible to varicella based on reported vaccine failure rates for the one\u00ad vaccine (18 percent) and two-vaccine (6 percent) approaches. 16 on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from Differences in demographic data and chicken\u00ad pox history responses between those who were an\u00ad tibody positive and antibody negative (fable 2) were not significant (P> 0.10) when subjected to chi-square analyses with the exception of the num\u00ad ber of siblings who lived with the participant as they were growing up. As the number of siblings increased, the frequency of negative antibody test results decreased (distribution, P < 0.01). Several queries were made regarding the partic\u00ad ipants' recollection of their chickenpox history as noted in Table 2. The response distributions be\u00ad tween seropositive and seronegative participants were significantly different (P < 0.01). In determin\u00ad ing predictive values, definitely had and probably had chickenpox responses were grouped together; likewise, never had and unsure responses were considered together. The positive predictive value of a definite or probable history of chickenpox was 98.5 percent; the negative predictive value of a negative or unsure history was 23 percent. Dis\u00ad criminant analysis was then performed on the re\u00ad sponses to the questions \"did you have,\" having,\" \"did someone tell you,\" and number of siblings to find out whether these quali\u00ad fying questions might result in a more accurate se\u00ad lection of antibody-negative soldiers based on his\u00ad tory. Only the responses to \"did you have\" and the number of siblings contributed significantly to the prediction of serologic status (Wilks' A. 0.89 for both, P < 0.00001). Vaccination Approaches Model Table 3 summarizes the projected number of cases prevented, savings for prevented cases, total cost and cost per case prevented, and net cost for each policy option in the model. Also included are the baseline number of cases of varicella and cost asso\u00ad ciated with these cases assuming no intervention, using the 1995 data from WRAIR. The \"vaccinate all\" model was the most effec\u00ad tive in regard to number of cases prevented, but it was associated with the highest net expense of all strategies. The model of \"test all with negative history and vaccinate if negative test\" resulted in fewer cases prevented but was the least expensive option. The \"vaccinate all with negative history\" option resulted in an identical number of cases prevented as the \"test all with negative history\" approach but was more expensive. Finally, the \"test all\" strategy resulted in an intermediate number of cases prevented, was the next to least expensive strategy overall, and resulted in tlle low\u00ad est cost per case prevented. For all models, the two-vaccination approach was superior in terms of number of cases prevented, and for two strategies (\"test all\" and \"test all with negative history and vaccinate if negative test\") had a lower net cost than for the single-vaccination approach. Discussion The results of this study indicate that 95.8 percent of soldiers tested had antibody to varicella virus, while only 4.2 percent were seronegative. This negative antibody rate is consistent with other pub\u00ad lished rates ranging from 2.8 to 11 percent. 3-5,17,18 Of interest, the 4.2 percent susceptibility noted in this study is considerably lower than the 6.9 per\u00ad cent reported in a highly comparable population of Army recruits in 1989, less than a decade ago.4 This trend, which is in keeping with the decline in recruit hospitalizations for varicella reported by WRAIR, remains unexplained. Most demographic variables did not help to predict varicella antibody status. Although African-American soldiers were relatively over\u00ad represented in the group that declined to partici\u00ad pate in the phlebotomy portion of the study, bias resulting from this disparity is unlikely, because earlier studies have not shown a differential sus\u00ad ceptibility to varicella infection in this group. The overrepresentation of young (17-to 19-year-old) soldiers in the group that declined phlebotomy could conceivably result in a spuriously low rate of seronegativity, since people in this age group are more likely than older adults to be seronegative. Nevertheless, it is unlikely the relatively small dis\u00ad parity would alter significantly the magnitude of our findings, because more than 90 percent of these soldiers would still be expected to possess antibodies to varicella. The lack of influence of geographic region of origin on serologic status differs somewhat from earlier studies suggesting that children and young adults from island countries and territories (espe\u00ad cially Puerto Rico) have higher susceptibility rates.7,19 The bulk of our participants, however, were from the Midwest, Northeast, and South, with very few representatives from Puerto Rico and island nations. One demographic variable, however, was of value: those participants who grew up in households having no or 1 sibling were statis- Varicella Vaccination Strategies 301 on 13 September 2023 by guest.

This finding makes sense based on the de\u00ad creased risk of exposure during childhood for those with few or no siblings. We found the soldier's clinical history of chick\u00ad enpox to be helpful. The positive predictive value for the presence of antibodies when definite and probable history of chickenpox responses were combined was 98.5 percent, whereas the negative predictive value when negative and unsure re\u00ad sponses were combined was 23 percent. The high positive predictive value of the combined \"defi\u00ad nitely had\" and \"probably had\" varicella historical responses has also been noted by Struewing et al,5 who reported a positive predictive value for vari\u00ad cella antibody of more than 95 percent. More troubling is the person who gives an unsure or negative history of varicella. Of this group (152 of 1201 or 12.7 percent of soldiers who had blood drawn), only 35 were antibody negative (23 per\u00ad cent). Therefore, approximately three fourths of those with a negative or unsure history of chicken\u00ad pox turned out to have demonstrable antibody to varicella. A model was developed to help determine the costs and efficacies of various vaccination strategies applied to a large population-all recruits entering the Army in 1995. Clearly the \"vaccinate all\" strat\u00ad egy yields the largest reduction in varicella cases, 73 percent for single vaccinations and 91 percent for two vaccinations. This approach, however, would lead to the unnecessary vaccination of 95 percent of our study population and would likely entail a prohibitively high cost unless complete eradication of varicella was desired. \"No intervention\" is at the opposite end of the spectrum and represents the current policy of the US Anny. Given the potential morbidity and mor\u00ad tality related to varicella infection in young adults, and the potential loss of student training time, re\u00ad duced operational readi~ess, and expensive hospi\u00ad talization for isolation from fellow barracks dwellers, however, we believe this policy would be defensible only if no other option were feasi\u00ad ble.12,18,19 This assertion is supported by our con\u00ad viction that the estimates used in our model very likely underrepresent the costs to the Anny associ\u00ad ated with a case of varicella in an AIT student.

We believe there are many other costs associated with training soldiers that remain hid\u00ad den in the complex Army finance system and were thus not accOlmted for in our models. The other three strategies involve selective vac\u00ad cination. If a negative or unsure history is given, then a soldier can be tested or simply vaccinated . The vaccination of all soldiers without confirma\u00ad tory testing would resuJt in the unnecessary vacci\u00ad nation of about 75 percent of soldiers in this group and was the most expensive of the three ap\u00ad proaches; thus, it will not be considered further. Targeted vaccination only for those soldiers with a negative varicella history who are then found to have negative varicella antibody testing yielded the lowest net expense. A disadvantage of both history\u00ad based strategies was that they resuJted in the lowest reduction in cases (9 percent with single vaccina\u00ad tion and 16 percent with double vaccination). Tar\u00ad geted vaccination might ultimately be an accept\u00ad able compromise, however, since the few soldiers with false-positive tests (1.4 percent), as well as those few soldiers who gave a positive history of varicella but are truly susceptib le, would still have more likelihood of protection by herd immunity than with the present \"no intervention\" policy. he \"test all\" strategy was the second-least ex\u00ad pensive and was associated with a reduction in the number of cases ofvaricella that fell in between the history-based approaches and the \"vaccinate all\" strategy. If future varicella antibody assays with a higher accuracy are developed, or if the test ca.n be 304 JABFP July-August 1998 Vol. 11 No.4 obtained at a cost lower than our estimate, this ap\u00ad proach might become very attractive. In summary, the decision model shows the clear value of obtaining a clinical histo.ry of varicella when caring for adolescents and young adults, in large groups or as individuals, with unknown sus\u00ad ceptibility. We believe that the Army should strongly consider this approach for implementa\u00ad tion a.t the earliest opportunity. For example, the Army might adopt a policy of surveying all recruits regarding clinical varicella history, with subsequent serologic testing for those with negative histories, during their induction medical evaluations. Those with a positive history (definitely had or probably had) of varicella are overwhelmingly likely to pos\u00ad sess antibodies to varicella and require no further testing, and the sma.ll number of antibody-negative recmits who would be missed would be protected by an ever-growi ng herd immunity. For those with negative (never had or unsure) histories, we rec\u00ad ommend antibody testing and subsequent targeted vaccination of soldiers who are confirmed seroneg\u00ad ative (Figure 2). This approach provides the most optimal bal\u00ad ance of number of cases prevented versus total cost of implementation. Also clear from the model is that a two-vacc ination app,roach results in higher protection rates, and thus a lower net implementa\u00ad tion cost, than a single vaccination approach. A policy of antibody testing all young adults and vac\u00ad cinating those with a negative test would be a rea\u00ad sonable second option if dle Army is willing to ab\u00ad sorb a slighdy higher cost for a small increase in the number of cases prevented or if the test can be obtained at a lower cost.

Downloaded from sion model appear to be less desirable from a cost\u00ad effectiveness standpoint. Our models cannot be used to detennine policy in isolation, because they merely provide an esti\u00ad mate of efficacy versus cost for various strategies. For example, if the Army determines that near\u00ad complete eradication of varicella infections in new recruits is warranted at any cost, then vaccinating all recruits might be justified. Army policy makers must first establish a clear goal for any varicella vaccination program, at which point we believe our data would be helpful in selecting the strategy that will best achieve the goal. It should be emphasized that office-based clini\u00ad cians who care for adolescents and young adults might also find our suggested approach useful. For example, students with uncertain varicella anti\u00ad body status who are leaving home to attend col\u00ad lege, particularly if they will live in a dormitory, might benefit from antibody screening and tar\u00ad geted vaccination. Furthermore, health care per\u00ad sonnel responsible for student health policy at high schools, colleges, and such health care training centers as medical schools should be able to extrap\u00ad olate our data to their daily care of adolescents and young adults. \\Vhen screening young adults for varicella sus\u00ad ceptibility, asking them how many siblings they lived with while growing up might also prove worthwhile. Our study design did not allow prospective testing of this variable as a screening tool. Given that those soldiers who grew up with 1 or no siblings were statistically more likely to be seronegative than those with 2 or more siblings, however, the prospective use of this simple ques\u00ad tion might be worthy of investigation as a way to target serologic testing within a group who report a negative history of varicella. Several caveats must be emphasized in regard to our cost information. First, because the many different AlT courses vary widely in duration and associated equipment and costs, we assumed a typ\u00ad ical 6-week AlT course with the cost noted in Table 1. Second, we had difficulty obtaining con\u00ad sistent infonnation from various sources about the true cost to the Army of basic and AlT training. Additionally, we obtained no reliable answers re\u00ad garding which costs were acc:ounted for (over\u00ad head, military pay, equipment, health benefits, etc) in the aggregate cost figures that were quoted. As a result, as noted above, we suspect many hidden costs were not accounted for in our models. Additionally, the costs utilized for vac\u00ad cine and antibody testing are those listed by the manufacturer. Were the Army or another institu\u00ad tion to contract for these materials, it is quite likely these costs would be lower and might change the cost per case prevented ratio for the various options. For all these reasons, our cost analysis was not intended to be exhaustive and should be viewed primarily as a way to give some additional perspective to the utility of the various vaccination strategies. The reported decrease in incidence of varicella infection in young adults during the last 5 years,13,20 coupled with the call for universal vari\u00ad cella vaccination of children issued by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), suggest a dramatic decline in susceptibility to vari\u00ad cella within the next 20 years. Until then, a strat\u00ad egy of targeted history taking and serologic testing appears to be the most prudent approach to pro\u00ad tecting adolescents and young adults from this po\u00ad tentially life-threatening infection.
