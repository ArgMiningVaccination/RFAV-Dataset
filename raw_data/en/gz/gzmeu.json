Department of Health Information Clearinghouses iii INTRODUCTION A significant and frightening public health problem confronts society today--Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome or AIDS. Since its appearance in 1981, it has had a devastating impact on its victims, creating widespread fear and trepidation among the citizen\u00ad ry. The Centers for Disease Control and the New Jersey Department of Health are actively maintaining statistics which reveal that New .Jersey is ranked fifth, surpassed only by New York, California, Florida, and Texas in known or diagnosed AIDS cases. As of June 1, 1987, 35,769 cases have been reported nationally. Of those, 2,173 or 6% are in New Jersey. It is estimated that as many as 100 times that number of people are infected with the\u00b7 virus. The New York City/Northern New Jersey area is considered the epicenter for AIDS cases related .to intravenous drug use; 75% of such cases identified in the country are in this region. In fact, over 50% of ,all drug users in New Jersey are probably infected. Probation has not been insulated from this grave problem. In fact, the situation is exacerbated by the fact that intravenous drug users are the largest group of AIDS sufferers in New Jersey and also make up a significant portion of the population with whom probation officers have court related contact. This heightened probability of involvement with AIDS sufferers coupled with a fundamental concern for the health and well-being of probation personnel prompted the formation of a committee of Chief Probation Officers, line probation personnel and Administrative Office of the Courts staff to prepare probation's response to the AIDS challenge. The committee would like to acknowledge the jhvalu\u00ad able advice and assistance provided by Patricia\u00b7 A. Nisler of the Communicable Disease Operations Program, New Jersey Department of Health. This document presents a brief description of the disease's medical aspects, a discussion of implications .for probation, a recommended training program, and recon~ended policies for supervision. Probation Committee on AIDS 2 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE DISEASE AIDS is the acronym for Acquired Immunodeficiency syndrome.1 This relatively new disease, first described in 1980, has no known cure and in its most active state ~laims 100% mortality. AIDS is trans\u00ad mitted through intimate physical contact; semen and blood have\u00b7 been isolated as vehicles for t,ransmission. Newborn infants can also be in~ected by mothers at birth. Contrary to popular belief, AIDS does not kill its victim. What it does is invade and undermine the human body's natural immune system by destroying certain white blood cells. The victim then becomes susceptible to a range of infections and diseases which would not be life threatening to someone\u00b7 with a heal thy immune system. Those secondary diseases are often highly contagious, the most prevalent in New J.ersey being tuberculosis. Nationally, the most common causes of death are Kaposi's Sarcoma and Pneumocystics Carinii Pneumonia which develop in the infected individual as a result of a breakdown in the immune system,. (Statistics of mortality from these diseases are presented in Appendix A.) The Virus In 1983 and 1984, French and American scientists identified the proba~le cause of AIDS. Called Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) , it is generally believed to be an indispensable requirement to the development of AIDS. It has ~ot been firmly established as the sole cause; there may be co-factors which c~ntribute to the process. A person can be infected with HIV for years, even decades, wi thout ever developing overt symptoms. The virus can be transmi tted EY these persons who ~ asymptomatic. ---- . 1 Th~ commonly used acronym AIDS was derived from the earlier name for the disease, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. The accepted spelling is now Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, but the AIDS acronym is still used. 2 HIV 'was previously known as Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III or HTLV-III. The International Committee for the Taxonomy ('If Viruses has designated Human Immunodefic'iency Virus -(HIV) as the appropriate name. The New Jersey Department of Health and many other health-related agencies have adopted HIV as the official name\u00b7they will use for the AIDS virus. Probation Committee on AIDS 3 Transmission of AIDS AIDS is difficult to transmit . \"There is absolutely no evidence of its transmission through casual contact, such as coughing, hugging, handshaking, shDring eating and drinking utensils, or using the same toilet facili ties. ,,3 The chances of having t~e virus transmitted through biting are less than zero percent. . \"ilhe virus is not very hardy outside the human body. It is tmsceptible to heat, common disinfectants and detergen\u00b7t.s, and to washing with simple soap and water. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the HIV virus appears to be transmitted exclusively through exposure to contaminated blood and semen. This occurs primarily through sexual relations including vaginal intercourse, anal inter\u00ad course, oral-genital and oral-anal contact and through needle sharing in drug use. A number of studies have examined the transmission of AIDS among family members. All have shown that the disease is no'!:. passed to others living in the same household reg'ardless of length of exposure, so long as there has been no exchange of blood or semen. The same is true for the medical profession. If AIDS were an easily transmitted disease , its occurrence would be rampant among those who provide daily care to AIDS sufferers; clearly that is not the case. AIDS Risk Groups 3 The latest available data shows that AIDS most frequently occurs in homosexual/bisexual males and intravenous (IV) drug users. These two groups account for 90% of the cases known nationally. While IV drug users in the national data account for 17%, in New Jersey, they total 46% of the reported cases. Hammett, Theodore M. Options. (Washington, February 1986) Page 2. AIDS in Prisons and Jails: Issues and D.C.; National Institute of Justice, See Appendix B. 4 One letter to the British medical journal \"Lancet\" suggests the possibility that the infection may have been transmitted by a bite. . In that situation, a brother of an\u00b7 infected person developed the HIV infection, and no other means (other than a bite) of transmission was identified. Probation Committee on AIDS 4 Progression of AIDS Clinically, it is impossible to ascribe discrete stages to the illness resulting from HIV infection. Schematically, however, the disease process can be described as follows. ~ Infection of the Human Immunod~ficiency Virus (HIV) fol\u00ad lows. exposure via the routes of transmission described above A seronegative period lasts for six to twelve weeks fol\u00ad lowing infection. Al though infection has already occur\u00ad red, antibody levels have not yet reached a point where they would be termed \"reactive\". Test results during this window period would be deemed non-reactive or negative . . Seropositivity brings positive test results because ade\u00ad quate antibody levels to HIV have been developed. After ini tial infection I seroposi tivioty lasts indefinitely and does not indic'ate whether the d'~~sease is currently active . . ARC (AIDS-Related Complex) signifies the presence of a combination of factors indicative of AIDS: a. unusual prolonged fatigue (not explained by physical activity or other disorders) which may be combined with headache, dizziness, or light headedness; b. rapid weight loss of 10 to 15 pounds or 10% of body weight in less than two months not due to dieting or exercise; . c. persistant fever of 1000 or more; d. recurrent drenching night sweats; e. chroniG! unexplained swollen lymph nodes or glands in neck, armpits or groin lasting longer than three months; and f. chronic, unexplained diarrhea. The usual criteria for ARC include any two of these clinical signs that have persisted for more than three months plus two of the following laboratory abnormalities: a. suppressed helper T-cell counts; b. depressed helper/suppressor cell ratio~ c. elevated serum globulin; Probation Committee on AIDS 5 leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, absolute lymphopenia, or anemia; e. d~pressed blastogenesis; and f. abnormal skin tests (using multitest) Persons with ARC may appear to get better, but since there is no cure for the virus, they remain infected . . Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome is the end stage' ill\u00ad ness caused by HIV lnfection. It includes the onset of opportunistic infections and cancers which would not otherwise affect a heal thy body. AIDS is characterized by the symptoms of ARC with these additional possibilities associated with some of the opportunistic illnesses: a. persistent dry cough unrelated to smoking, colds, or flu; b. shortness of breath; c. thick, whitish coating on the tongue, throat, or in\u00ad side mouth (oral thrush)-; d. unexplained bleeding from any body opening or from growths on the skin or mucous membranes; e. bruises which appear more readily than usual but which do not heal easily; and f. appearance of brownish, reddish, bluish skin spots, usually painless, especially on ankles, or on mucous membranes (mouth, nasal passages, eyelids, around rec\u00ad tum) which do not go away but gradually increase in size. HIV may also attack the nervous system causing delayed damage to the brain. Symptoms of this eventuality include memory loss, forgetfulness, confusion, indifference, loss of coordina\u00ad tion, changes. In gait, partial paralysis, blurring of vision and/or hearing, slurred speech,\"delusions, and mental 'disorder. Progression through these phases is reductionary in nature. In other words, fewer people are found at any given stage of the disease than at the previous one. For example, it is estimated that for every person who has AIDS, there may be as many as 100 more who are HIV infected. Current predictions are that as many as 65% of asymptomatic HIV infected individuals will get sick at some level, be it AIDS or ARC. Between 25%' and 50% of the asymptomatically infected will progress to AIDS. These percentages have been changing over time as the disease has been followed in research cohorts for longer periods. Probation Committee on AIDS 6 An individual who exhibits seropositivity can and should do a number of things which may slow the progression c'f the disease and delay the onset of ARC or AIDS: \".maintain good nutrition; get adequate exercise and rest; reduce stress; avoid drug use -steroids, nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, other illicit substances; do not recei're vaccinations which use live materials; take extra precautions against all types of infect~~n; avoid pregnancy until testing and medical advice is sought; know the signs and symptoms of ARC/AIDS and see a physician immediately if any of them occur; refrain from donating blood, plasma, sperm, body organs, or tissue; and have a physical check-up every six months. ~ntibody Testing In 1985, a commercial test for the antibody to HIV became available. The presence in the blood of antibodies to HIV gives evidence of the immune system I s attempt to fight off infection. It is important to note that the HIV antibody test does not test directly for AIDS, will not predict future illness from AIDS or a related condition, and cannot measure immunity to or protection from the virus. A person with negative test results probably has not been infected with HIV. However, a person tested soon after expo\u00ad sure to the virus might not have developed antibodies as yet, and the test could show positive results at a later date. Also, a few people who are actually infected with the virus will have negative test results nonetheless. ~Such false negatives are a possibility with any laboratory test.) Fur\u00ad ther, a negative test result is never a guarantee that the individual will not become infected by HIV at some time in the future. Positive test results indicate that the individual probably was infected with HIV or similar virus at some time in the past. Although certainty is not possible, it is likely the person who tests positive for HIV antibodies is currently infected and able to t~ansmit the infection to others. (However, it is also possible that the individual has recovered from HIV and is not Probation Committee on AIDS 7 ~~--------------------------------------------~ currently infectious.) It cannot be predicted from the posi\u00ad tive test results whether that person will develop ARC or AIDS at some time in the future. In an extremely small percentage of cases, false positive results are possible, meaning that the person has never actually been infected although the test indicates otherwise. Since the antibody test does not necessarily indicate current infection, it is advisable to follow up on positive outcomes wi th a more specific secondary test, the Western Blot. This combination of tests is especially reliable in predicting current HIV infection for people who have engaged in high risk behaviors since 1977. In spite of the uncertainties which surround the results, it is usually desireable to administer: the HIV antibody test to obtain information which will influence important. decisions. For example, people who are relatively certain they are not generally at risk for AIDS may want reassurances because of a single or rare prior sexual expE:.rience (including rape), a blood transfusion 'or organ transplant, or accidental exposure such as a puncture by a contaminated needle or knife. Second\u00ad ly, people at risk who are cdnsidering pregnancy sli.ould be tested to 'ascertain their antibody status and seek medical advice since the disease can be passed from mother to fetus. Finally, when people are exhibiting symptoms of ARC or AIDS, testing is helpful to diagnosis. Because of the seronegative period in the disease's progres\u00ad sion, testing should be done in series as long as negative results are obtained. Specifically, an anti~ody test should be done immediately after an incident which raises the possibility of HIV infection (such as rape, needle stick accident, etc.). As long as there are negative results, the test should be repeated after six weeks, three months, and six months. Any positive result should be followed by a Western Blot test. (While each HIV antibody test costs only about $6.00\" the Western Blot test costs about $70.00.) Probation Committee on AIDS 8 .;:...;;:....;...;.;.....;,;;...;;;.;:;..;::....;;,;:..~~---,'--------------------------- DISCC'SSION The best available scientific information indicates that AIDS is transmitted through exchange of internal body fluids (blood and semen) in intimate sexual relations or activities engaged in by a \u00b7small subgroup of IV drug users. These behaviors do not occur during the regular conduct of probation supervision. Since the risk of transmission at the work place is very low, few change in p'roba\u00ad tion policies are warranted. While there is no reason to make extraordinary modifications in procedures, any risk at all is a cause for concern given the fact that AIDS .is almost always fatal. Probation admi.nistrators must take prudent acticn to develop policies consistent with the best scientific knowledge, agency pr iori ties and social conscience. A prominent researcher has noted \"right. now, our ogly tools [for controlling AIDS] are education and behavior change.\" Probation's response to the challenge of AIDS must balance several competing interests, all compelling in their own right. The safety of staff must be protected by reducing the risk of exposure. The rights of the person with AIDS to services and to a degree of dignity must be protected. Persons with AIDS could easily become social outcasts. The rights of society to enforcement of court orders and protection through supervision cannot be forgotten. Because or the long incubation period for AIDS~ infected persons are able to carry and transmit the virus without themselves showing symptoms. Those who have contracted the disease or carry the virus may remain quite able to continue behavior associated with transmis\u00ad sion for some time. If they still use intravenous drugs and proba\u00ad tion does not take appropriate steps to stop them, probation is not only remiss in its duty but indirectly contributes to the spread of the disease. In that regard, probation is obligated to work toward assuring the discontinuation of intravenous drugs use. Probation also has a role to educate persons under its supervision about AIDS and high risk behavior and to locate and make available the appropriate services for infected probationers. Historically, pr(;bation has located and provided services for those in much less severe need. The person with AIDS is an individual in the most desperate need. Probation has a moral obligation to respond. 5 Dr. Harold Jaffe of the Centers for Disease Control! addressing a NIC-sponsored meeting of correctional administrators, Novem\u00ad ber 6, 1985. -~--. ---\u00b71 Probation Committee on AIDS 9 RECOMMENDED STRATEGY TO RESPOND TO AIDS Probation's response to AIDS includes procedural changes and educa\u00ad tion. Modified supervision policies for infected probationers and training for staff are designed to achieve safety without sacrific\u00ad ing the integrity of supervision. Training Staff training will educat~ probation personnel about the disease and reduce the level of fear and anxiety which exists. In turn, probation staff will be able to provide accurate information to others, including probationers and court personnel. The New Jersey Department of Health has been providing training about AIDS for some time and has maintained the most up to date information. In order to provide quality training, in a timely fashion, the AOC Training Unit has utilized trainers from the Department ~f Health to conduct ~essions for probation staff. The AOC Training Unit staff will maintain a liaison with staff of the Department pf Health to monitor developments in this area, and provide additional training and/or information as it becomes appropriate. Verification and Medical Treatment A probation staff member may learn of AIDS infection from a probationer or other reliable source. Those with AIDS will probably be getting medical 'tre~tment. Therefore, the simplest and most reliable way of verifying an HIV infection is through the medical provider who informed the probationer of the infection, e.g., the doctor, clinic, the HIV antibody testing site, etc. The medical provider should' be contacted in writing, either directly or by having the probationer hand-carry a written request for information, to verify an A,IDS diagnosis or other stage of HIV' infection. The provider should respond in writing on letterhead or prescription form. Because of the highly confidential nature of this information, the first step must be ,to have the probationer sign a specific records release author\u00ad ization, a copy of which would accompany any written communi\u00ad cation to the medica'l provider. (Having the probationer hand-carry such a request may'expedite matters by allowing the provider to ~eceive personal verification of permission to release the information.) , If this process is unsuccessful, for whatever reason, and the HIV infection reported by the probationer or s'ome other source is still suspected, then an HIV antibody test should be consid\u00ad ered as an alt~rnative means to verify infection. The need for Probation Committee on AIDS 10 an HIV antibody test should be carefully discussed with the probationer. Information should be provided about the poten\u00ad tial for discriminatory use of test results should they become known, for example,. in the insurance and housing markets. (New Jersey has no state law safeguarding against such discrimina\u00ad tion.) Then a referral should be made to either a state-fu'nded counselling and testing site where con:f..:i~dentiality is strictly guarded, or to another medical provi4er mutually agreed upon, where confidentiality mayor may not :be securely preserved. (See Appendix C for a listing.) If a probationer is reluctant or refuseS to submit to antibody testing, the probation staff should make every effort to convince the probationer. of the need fox' testing for personal and public health reasons. Should these efforts fail to persuade the probationer, the case should be re ferred to the sentencing judge, for action in obtaining cooperation. If probationers with HIV infection are not getting adequate medical treatment, probation staff should encourage them to do so and assist with referrals to appropriate f,acilities. (See Physicians' Referral List in Appendix C.) This is very impor\u00ad tant because ~ife-threatening symptoms can develop very quick\u00ad ly. If the probationer's permission is given, medical personnel may be able to provide information to the probation staff which will assis.t in supervision. Confider:tiality Persons with AIDS, ARC, or HIV infection run a significant risk of becoming social outcasts. Probation staff should exercise caution in revealing information about infected persons. Normal restrictions apply, but the potentially damaging nature of this information requires carefu). exercise of discretion. Therefore, information on AIDS infection should be revealed only to those individuals who absolutely must know to effect successful supervision. Urine Monitoring Screening for drug use gains importance due to the high risk of transmission of the virus through sharing of needles. Proba\u00ad tion staff involved with urine monitoring should follow the procedures developed for use by the Centers for Disease Con\u00ad trol, as adopted by the state Intensive Supervision Program. (See Appendix D.) THESE PROCEDURES SHOULD BE FOLLOWED FOR ALL URINE SPECIMENS BECAUSE THEY ARE EFFECTIVE' CONTROLS FOR ANY COMMUNICABL~ DISEASE. (See also Appendix E.) Education With the overlap of one high risk AIDS group (IV drug users) and the probation population, educational materials should be readily available in the.probation offices including informa\u00ad tional brochures and posters. Staff should be knowledgeable Probation Committee on AIDS 11 about AIDS, but when they are unable to answer probationers' specific questions, referral should be made to the New Jersey AIDS Hotline (1-800-624-2377) or other .reliable sources listed in Appendix F. Supervision Policy Statement The probation departments and their e~ployees shall provide supervision ana. services to all persons placed under their jurisdiction by the courts, despite a suspect\u00ad ed or confirmed diagnosis of AIDS or HIV infections. Probation supervision activities should not be eliminated in the face of AIDS, but some modifications may need to be incorporated into standard operating procedures on b a case-by-case basis. Supervision Contacts Testing Probation staff should continue to provide superv~s~on to persons ~erified to be HIV infected. If an HIV infected person's medical condition would rule out or prevent. benefiting from a face-to-face personal contact (e.g., probationer is bedridden or hospitalized due to secondary illness), collateral contacts should be an option. A variety of questions rema~n~ng about HIV antibody testing lend themselves to resolution through policy promulgation by the courts. These issues include the following . ... Can the courts compel testing? . If so, should they? .. For whom? .. Where should testing be done? .... Who should pay for it? Probation officers and other appropriate judicial employees need to be trained'about the advantages and disadvantages of testing. They should also be given the skills and sensitivity needed to counsel probationers on this subject and the knowl\u00ad edge of where to refer for testing and counseling. Although there is no known' cure for AIDS, testing is still advisable' for a number of reasons. If the individual to be tested does not have AIDS, the test can provide reassurances. The results are not foolproof, but they are accurate enough to relieve some of the fear and anxiety associated with the disease. On the other hand, if positive test results are found, certain medications may be beneficial while new ones could be discovered at any time. Also, modificatio.ns of certain behaviors may slow the progress of the disease or help ---~-.-.- Probation Committee on AIDS 12 to prevent the onset of opportunistic infections. Equally important, changes in habits or life styles could help signifi\u00ad cantly in limiting the spread of infection to others. (See Appendixes G and H.) The most reasonable stance to take on 'this issue seems to be an avoidance of wholesale testing in favor of a selective approach based on individual case circumstances. One important criteri\u00ad on should be to conduct tests whenever an individual is put at risk by another person's actions. In such cases as rape or other type of assault where the possibility of, infection is present, testing should be done on the perpetrator if at all possible and the results shared with the victim if that person wants ~o know them. If for any reason the perpetrator cannot be 'tested, then the victim should be counseled about the advisability of being tested. -------~- ~~----~-- Probation Committee on AIDS 13 RESOURCES This document draws heavily on the work on AIDS sponsored by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Department of Justice National Institute of Justice F.ebruary 1986 Ny AIDS in Prisons and Jails: Issues and Options Acquired Immunodeficiency Syn\u00ad drome (AIDS) has rapidly become one of the most difficult and complex public health i3sues facing the United States. Since AIDS was first identified in this country in 1981, over 17,000 AmeJicans have developed the disease. The rapid increase in cases, particularly in the past 2 years, al)d the continued uncertainties as to the future course of the.. disease's spread have led the President to term AIDS \"the Nation's number one health priority.\" In the correctional context, dealing with the problem of AIDS may pose From the Director Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) represents a serious challenge for American correctional systems. Recognizing that many inmate popula\u00ad tions contain a high concentration of individuals at risk for the disease\u00ad primarily because of histories of intravenous drug use and, to a lesser degree, homosexual behavior-correc\u00ad tional administrators are concerned with developing effective policies to ensure the health and safety of both inmates and staff. Often already coping with crowded institutions and limited budgets. they face difficult decisions regarding prevention, institutional management, and the identification and treatment of inmates with AIDS. These decisions are further complicated by a range of legal Theodore M. Hammett even more difficult problems since inmate populations may include high proportions of individuals in AIDS risk groups, particularly intravenous drug users. Correctional administrators must formulate policies that allow them to manage their institutions effectively, while dealing with a serious health problem that may cause fears among staff and imitates. Ad\u00ad ministrators face difficult decisions concerning prevention, housing, and the provision of medical care, decisions which are frequently complicated by legal and cost issues. issues. the high costs of medical care. and the need to control fear and misin\u00ad formation throughout the institution. Recognizing the potential scope of these problems. many correctional administrators have expressed intere~t in receiving information that can help them in formulating policies on AIDS. To address this need, the National Institute of Justice and the American Correctional Association jointly spon\u00ad sored the development of a report entitled AIDS in Correctional Facil\u00ad ities: Issues and Options. Given the urgency of the need, the study was an intensive effort, conducted over a 4-month time period. In addition to the dedication of the project director. Theodore M. Hammett, the cooperation of the National Institute of Corrections. the Association of State Correctional Administrators. the Ct.!nters for Dist.!ase In response to urgent information needs expressed by corrections profes sionals, the National Institute of Justice and the American Corree.ional Association sponsored a study entitled AIDS in Correctional Facilities: /ss{((',\\' alld Options. The study was based, in large part, on responses to a national mail questionnaire from all 50 State correr.tional departments, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and 33 large city and county jail systems. The responses were received between November 1985 and January 1986. Control. and the American Correctional Association should be recognized. This Research ill Brie/summarizes the major findings and conclusions of the full report. Like the full report. it is intended to be informational rather than prescriptive. Certain principles. such as the impor\u00ad tance of inmate and staff education on AIDS, are indisputable. Still. there are many other issues and policy questions that continue to spur debate both within and between the correctional and medical communities. By outlining t~ese debates and provid\u00ad ing the most current information available. the National Institute of Justice and ACA hope that correctional administrators will be better equipped to deal with the problem of AIDS. James K. Stewart Director Nutlonal [n~tltu[e or Justice The study summarizes the latest medical information on AIDS. presents statistics on the incidence of AIDS in correctional facilities. and enumerates the key issues and options facing correctional administrators as they formulate policy responses to this complex problem. This Research in Brief summarizes the major findings and conclusions of t.hat report. Cause and transmission of AIDS AIDS is a serious communicable disease that undermines the human body's ability to combat infections. In 1983 and 1984. the probable cause of AIDS-variously called human t-cell Iymphotropic virus type III (HTL V -III) . and lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV)-was identified. Thus far. most cases in the United States have been among homosexuals and intrave\u00ad nous drug abusers. with cases primarily concentrated in large metropolitan areas on the east and west coasts. End-stage AIDS is almost always fatal. However. a ranl!:e of milder forms of illness. sometimes called AIDS\u00ad Related Complex (ARC). may also appear among those infected with the AIDS virus. ' . Infection with HTL V -III is transmitted throul!:h contaminated blood and semen. primarily during sexual activity and needle-sharinl!: related to intrave\u00ad nous drug abuse. The virus is difficult to transmit and there is absolutely no evidence of its transmission through casual contact. such as coughing, hugging; handshaking, sharing eating and drinking utensils'. or using the same toilet facilities. In 1985, a test was developed and made widely available to detect the presence of antibodies (evidence of the body's attempt to fight off an infection) to HTLV-III. While the test does not detect the presence of the virus itself, seropositivity (i.e, presence of anti\u00ad bodies) means that an individual has been infected with the AIDS virus at Opinillll.l or JII.II/I\"(,. some time. although the body may have subsequently fought off the infection. The likelihood that HTL V -[II seropositivity means current infection . with the virus is coqsidered much greater for individuals in identified AIDS risk groups (e.g., homosexual or bisexual males, intravenous drug abusers). Nevertheless, seropositive . individuals may.never develop any symptoms. let alone develop end-stage AIDS. may be able to transmit the infection to others. even if they never develop symptoms themselves. Exhibit I' summarizes the relationships among exposure, infection, seropositivity. ARC, and AIDS. AIDS in the correctional population Currently. the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimate that 5 to 6 percent of seropositive individuals will develop end-stage AIDS while another 25 percent will develop ARC. How\u00ad ever. recent research suggests that the percentage of seropositive individuals who will develop AIDS may be somewhat higher, Moreover. CDC cautions that seropositive individuals Responses to the study questionnaire reveal that, since 1981, there have been a cumulative total of 455 con\u00ad firmed AIDS cases in 25 State and Federal prison systems. Twenty large city and county jail systems. reported 311 cases of AIDS among inmates. These figures represent cumulative total cases since the responding juris\u00ad dictions began keeping records. As of the period Ncwember 1985 to January 1986, there were 144 cases of Stage E,xposure Infection Seropositivity ARC AIDS Exhibit 1 Relationships among exposure, infection, HTLV-III seropositivity, and development of ARC or AIDS 2 Meaning Individual has contuct with HTL Y -III in a wuy-that makes transmission possible (e.g .. sexual contact or needle\u00ad sharing activity) Individual is infected with HTL Y-III.

IIlne~s characterized by one or more opportunistic infections at least moderately indicative of underlying cellular immunodeliciency. Relationship to previous stage(s) Unknown. although multiple exposures probably increase the risk of infection. CDC considers the HTLY-I11 antibody test a reliable indicator that infection has occurred at some time. Repeat and con\u00ad firmatory testing increase reliability. About 25 percent of seropositive individuals will probably develop ARC (CDC estimate). This estimate is uncertain due I to the lengthy incubation period. About 5 to 6 percent of sero\u00ad positive individuals will probably develop AIDS. (CDC estimate). Recent studies place the fraction as high as one-third. Again. all estimates are uncer\u00ad tain due to the lengthy incuba\u00ad tion period. \". AIDS among State and Federal inmates in 19 systems and 35 cases among city and county inmates in 11 systems. No known AIDS cases have occurred among correctional staff as a result of contact with inmates. Questionnaire respondents reported nine cases of AIDS among current or former staff, but none of these individuals had been involved in an incident with an inmate in which transmission of the AIDS virus might have occurred. Indeed, most were known or suspected to have been in AIDS risk groups. The distribution of AIDS cases across correctional systems is highly skewed (Exhibit 2). Fifty-one percent of the prison systems have had no cases and 80 percent have had fewer than four cases. Among responding city and county jail systems, 39 percent have had no cases and 70 percent have had fewer than four cases. At the other extreme, two State prison systems and only one of the responding city and county jail systems have had more than 50 cases. The regional distribution is also highly uneven. Over 70 percent of the cases, both in State prison systems and in city and county jail systems, have occurred in the mid-Atlantic region, with all other parts of the United States contributing much smililer percentages. The vast majority of correctional AIDS cases, partic~larly in jurisdictions with large numbers of cases, are believed to be associated with prior intravenous drug abuse. There is substantial debate, but little hard data, on the extent to which the AIDS virus is being transmit\u00ad ted within correctional institutions. The two primary means of transmission are prohibited behavior in all correc\u00ad tions systems. However, logic and common sense suggest that, even in the best-managed correctional facilities, there may be at least some transmission of the infection occurring among inmates. Correctional policy issues and options The major9c1icy areas involved in the corr~ctional response to AIDS are education and training; HTL V-III antibody testing; and medical, legal. and correctional management issues.

Education alld training pro\u00ad grams also provide the opportunity to counteract misinformation, rumors. and fear concerning the disease. For example, the majority of systems responding to the questionnaire re\u00ad ported that inmates and staff worried about the possibility of contracting AIDS; many responses referred to fear of casual contact or types of contact not actually associated with transmis\u00ad sion of the virus. As a result, many correctional adminis\u00ad trators feel strongly that education and training are not options ~ut absolute requirements. Ninety-three percent of the responding jurisdictions currently offer or are developing AIDS educa\u00ad tional programs for staff; 83 percent offer or are developing such programs for inmates.

Several jurisdictions reported that timely educational efforts had successfullv averted threatened job actions by correctional staff unions. Experience suggests that training and education programs should be insti\u00ad tuted before deep-seated fears have developed, and repeated periodically so that the latest medical information can be presented and new staff and inmates can be reached on a timelv basis. . Effective education programs may include live presentations by training teams, printed materials. and video\u00ad tapes. Program curricula and materials . should be brief, clear. and straight\u00ad forward and tailored to the particular knowledge gaps and concerns of the audience. They should discuss tbe means of transmission of the AIDS virus and emphasize everyone's re\u00ad sponsibility to avoid behaviors known to be associated with transmission: They should also guard against en\u00ad couraging a false sense of security in any group. At the same time, programs should not create needless fear by advocating unnecessary precautionary measures. UTI. V -III antibody testing There is substantial debate, both in corrections and in society at large, surrounding the uses of the HTL V-III antibody test and the meaqing of the test results. The most controversial testing application in corrections is mass screening: the testing of all inmates or all new inmates, regardless of the presence of symptoms or other clinical indications. Correctional policies on HTL V,HI antibody testing. Only four State correctional systems (Nevada, Col\u00ad orado, Iowa, and Missouri) have implemented or plan to implement mass screening programs for inmates: no city or county systems responding to the questionnaire have instituted or planned such programs. However, almost 90 percent of the responding jurisdictions do employ testing for more limited purposes. These include testing of risk-group members, testing in support of diagnoses of AIDS or ARC, testing in response to incidents in which the AIDS virus, might have been transmitted, testing on inmate request, and testing carried out as part of anonymous epidemiological studies. Exhibit 3 ~ummarizes study findings on correctional testing policies. Mass screening: the debate. The debate over mass screening for anti\u00ad body to HTLV-III in correctional institutions involves the following major questions: Should correctional systems take steps not being taken in t/;e communitv at large? . . Proponents of testing argue that rates of HTL V -III seropositivity are higher among inmates and that the virus is likely to be transmitted within institu\u00ad tions; they believe that screening is necessary to identify infectious indi- . viduals and to target prevention pro\u00ad grams. . Opponents argue that there is no proof of htgher rates of HTL V -III transmis\u00ad sion in prison and therefore there is no legitimate reason to screen.

What are the policy implications of identifying seroposiiive individuals? Proponents of screening argue that seropositive individuals must be identified so they can be given special supervision, counseling. and other programming. Opponents argue that mass ;dentifica\u00ad tion of seropositives would serve no purposes not better addressed by . educational programs and would, in fact, create significant correctional management problems-particularly iflarge numbers of seropositives were identified and there was irresistible pressure to segregate them. How would mass' screening affect education and prevention programs? Proponents argue that screening is necessary to inform and target educa\u00ad tion and prevention programs. Opponents argue that screening need\u00ad lessly and misleadingly divides the inmate population into a stigmatized c1!lSS and a \"safe\" class, thereby undermining the important educational message that everyone should be careful. 4 Is it possible to develop a reliable and confidential screening program? Proponents argue that the antibody test is reliable and that confidentiality of results can be maintained. Opponents argue that the test results are often unreliable and that real and rumored results would inevitably become known to the inmate popula\u00ad tion and others outside the institution, potentially subjecting actual or sup\u00ad posed seropositives to threats and intimidation while in prison and to . discrimination in housing, employ\u00ad ment, and insurability afterdischarge. What are the legal implications of screening? Proponents argue that mass screening is legal and proper and, in fact. that failure to conduct mass screening may result in serious legal liabilities. Opponents point out that laws and policies requiring subjects' informed consent for HTL V-III antibody testing preclude mandatory mass screening and suggest that liability issues can be effectively managed. What are the costs of mass screen\u00ad ing? Proponents of screening argue that the test can be economically administered. Opponents argue that when the costs of repeat and confirmatory tests and the costs of separate correctional programming for seropositives are included, the total price could become prohibitive, particularly for large systems and/or those likely to identify large numbers of seropositive inmates. Will mass screening allay or inflame fears? Proponents argue that screening could help to calm the concerns of inmates and staff if it found low rates of seropositivity. Moreover. regardless of the seropositivity rates, failure to screen could cause serious public relations problems. Opponents argue that mass screening will needlessly inflame fears. particu\u00ad larly if the seropositivity rate is found to be high. Are there feasible alternatives to screening? Proponents argue that screening is the Qest method of obtaining the necessary information on HTL V -III seropositiv\u00ad ity and transmission. Opponents argue that there are better ways to identify high-risk individuals and diagnose AIDS and ARC that avoid the negative consequences of mass screening. These include astute medical surveillance and alternative laboratory work for diagnoses. II) addition, anonymous epidemiologi\u00ad cal studies may permit estimation of HTL V-III seropositivity and transmis\u00ad sion rates while avoiding the corre~\u00ad tional management and contldentiality problems of mass screening. Implementation issues. Correctional administrators who decide to imple\u00ad ment any mass or selective testing program face a range of issues, includ\u00ad ing when and where to administer the test, and whether testing should be voluntary, mandatory, or on request. In 60 percent of the responding juris\u00ad dictions, all testing is either voluntary . or on inmate request. In 15 percent of the jurisdictions, all testing is manda\u00ad tory. There are serious legal and ethical issues involving both whether inmates can be compelled to submit to testing and whether they have a right to testing on request. Laws in some jurisdictions (e.g., California and Wisconsin) prohibit HTL V -III antibody testing wl(hout the informed consent of the subject. Those who oppose mandatory testing argue that, because of the potentially serious negative effects of testing (e.g., discriQlination in housing, employment, insurability), medical ethics require that there be a right of refusal, regardless of law or policy .. Some also argue that correctional systems have an obligation to provide the test to any or all inmates who request it. However, if such testing is provided, many physicians believe that inmates should be fully and accurately informed of the potential personal and psychological effects of testing before they make any decisions and that those who are tested be counseled on the meaning and implications of the results. Medical, legal, and correctional management issues Correctional administrators responding to the challenging problem of AIDS in prisons and jails must balance medical considerations and medical advice against complex correctional manage\u00ad ment factors. Decisionmaking is further complicated by legal and cost concerns. The following section discusses these issuf:s. Medical issues. Perhaps the highest priority in the correctional response to AIDS is providing timely, profes\u00ad sional, and compassionate medical care to inmates who become ill with the disease. As in society at large, pi'Ompt detection and diagnosis are needed to minimize spread of the disease and alleviate the suffering of patients. Whether o'r not HTLV~III testing is used, appropriate diagnostic workups are necessary to identify immuno\u00ad suppression, ARC, and AIDS. Also, certain tests may be able to detect early evidence of opportunistic infections typically seen iii AIDS patients. Careful surveillance and regular follow up are extremely important for 5 ----- ---- patients with AIDS, ARC, and HTL V\u00ad III seropositivity, since life-threatening symptoms can develop very quickly. Because AIDS patients experience serious psychological as well as physical problems, counseling and support systems involving correctional staff and family members are also considered important components of care. Correctional management issues. Ironically, the medical treatment of AIDS patients may be the simplest issue confronting correctional adminis\u00ad trators. Other questions-where to house and treat the inmate, ~ow to prevent the spread of the disease. and how to pay for medical care-are likely to be even more difficult to resolve. Housing policies. One of the most critical and difficult decisions for correctional administrators is where to house and treat inmates with AIDS. ARC, or HTLV -III seropositivity. Of course, medical considerations dictate many of these decisions. Mostjurisdic\u00ad tions place inmates with confirmed diagnoses of AIDS in a medical facility either within the correctional system or in tbe community, although the dura\u00ad tion of such hospitalization varies considerably. . Preventing the spread of AIDS within the prison and protecting. affected inmates from intimidation and violence are important considerations. Other factors in treatment and housing decisions include availability and location. of facilities able to provide appropriate care, costs of any new construction or renovations necessary to prepare special units, and staffin'g of any special AIDS units (correctional as well as medical). Correctional administrators have a number of options concerning treat\u00ad ment and housing placements for' inmates with AIDS, ARC, or HTLV\u00ad III seropositivity. The key options are the following: 1. maintaining inmates in the general population; . 2. returning inmates to the general population when their illnesses are in remission; 3. administratively segregating in\u00ad mates in a separate unit or relying on single-cell housing; 4. hospitalization~ and 5. case-by-case determination of all housing and treatment decisions. Exhibit 4 summarizes the housing policies of the responding systems. Two-thirds of the Federal and State systems! and 70 percent of responding city and county systems have written policies in pla~e or in development for managing inmates with AIDS, ARC, and HTLV-IlI seropositivity. Most jurisdictions hospitalize or administratively segregate at least some of the three AIDS-related inmate categories. City and county jurisdictions are more likely to use segregation: 39 percent of responding city and county jail systems segregate all three AIDS-related inmate categories, as opposed to only 16 percent of State and Federal prison systems. Almost one-third of all responding systems have basic policies involving case-by-case determination of treatment and housing programs. While Exhibit 4 indicates the wide variation in correctional policies on housing and treatment of inmates with AIDS, the four jurisdiction!; with almost 75 percent of the correctional. AIDS cases (New York State, New York City. New Jersey, and Florida) all follow the same combination of policies: I. medical segregation of AIDS patients, but no segregation of inmates with ARC or HTL V-III seropositivity; 2. careful evaluation and ongoing monitoring of inmates suspected of having ARC or AIDS; 3. no mass screening for antibody to HTLV-III; and 4. extensive staff and illmate educa\u00ad tional programs. All f'l>ur of these systems report that equilibrium has been reached on the AIDS issue, with no widespread fear among staff or inmates regarding transmission of the virus within the institutions. Precautionary measures. Correctional agencies have adopted a wide range of precautionary measures to control spread of AIDS within institutions; many are based on Centers for Disease Exhibit 4 Summary of responding jurisdictions' housing policiesD for inmates City/county Polley combination prison systems jail systems , n % n % Segregate AIDS cases; ARC cases and seropositives maintained in general population 3 6% 3 9% Segregate AIDS and ARC cases; seropositives maintained in general population IO 20 3 9 Segregate all categories 8 16 13 41 No segregation of any categories 2 4 0 0 Nopolicy 8 16 3 Combinations involving case-by-case determination 16 31 10 30 Other policy combinations 4 8 3 9 TOTAL 51 101%b 33 101%b \"For the purposes of this categorization. segregation means that the basic policy is to hospitalize (either within or outside the correctional system) or to segregate administratively the particular category of inmate. regardless of whether these inmates are returned to the general population when their sympt0!11s subside. Single-ceiling is also included in segregation. hDue to rounding. Control guidelines for clinical staff. I The CDC guidelines advise clinical and laboratory staff \"to use the same precautions when caring for patients with AIDS as those used for patients with hepatitis-B virus infection ... Spe.\u00ad cifically, patient-care and laboratory personnel should take precautions to avoid direct contact of skin or mucous membranes with blood, blood prod- _ ucts, excretions, secretions, and tissues of persons judged likely to have AIDS.\" Several physicians interviewed for this study believe that, since the AIDS virus is less hardy and more difficult to transmit than the hepatitis-B virus, precautions designed to prevent trans\u00ad mission of hepatitis-B should more than suffice to prevent Some correctional agencies have instituted precautionary measures which go far beyond those recom\u00ad mended by CDC. Many of these measures are designed to limit expo\u00ad sure under extremely unusual cir\u00ad cumstances or to prevent exposure through casual contact. However, all evidence indicates that AIDS cannot be transmitted by a single exposure of any kind or through casual contact. This is a major theme in most AIDS education programs. Precautionary measures addressing very rare or casual modes of contact. even if implemented in a good faith effort to reduce the fears of staff and inmates, may ultimately increase those fears by encouraging the view that the disease is spread by the very sort of unusual or casual contacts they seek to prevent. Such a conflict between . educational messages and practical measures may not only increase fear within the institution, but also may foster suspicion of the correctional system for, in effect, saying one thing about the transmission of AIDS but doing something else. Notification and confidentiality. (i)ne of the most difficult and sensitive issues regarding AIDS in corrections is. who receives information on the medical status of inmates with AIDS, ARC, or HTLV-III seropositivity. Decisions regarding who should receive HTL Y -III antibody test results and who should be notified of AIDS or ARC diagnoses m~y be dictated by . precise legal and policy standards such as requirements for written authoriza\u00ad tion to release test results or other medical records. Two-thirds of State and Federal prison systems and 91 percent of responding city and county jail systems have general or specific confidentiality policies covering AIDS-related medi\u00ad cal information. Some argue that decisions regarding disclosure versus confidentiality of medical information in cases of AIDS or ARC should he based solely on legal reqllirements-that is, 'no information should be reported to anyone unless it is, required by law. This position is based on the premise that correctional systems should bear no greater respon\u00ad sibility for notification than do institu\u00ad tions in the community at large. Where law or policy allows any discretion, decisions regarding disclo\u00ad sure versus confidentiality invariably raise the question of which should take precedence: the inmate's right to have medical information kept confidential or the correctional system's perceived legal and moral responsibility to p,r:Gtect its staff and other inmates, as w.ell as the public, from HTL Y-III infection. 1fhere are valid claims on both sides. 0n the one hand are arguments that correctional staff have a right to know when they are dealing with inmates who may be infectious or who have a serious \u00b7communicable disease, and that other inmates; spouses, or: sexual partners have a right to know who may be carrying a sexually transmitted dis,ease. Notification to public health clepartments and inmates' former andlor subsequent correctional systems may also be considered' important to facilitate treatment, prevention meas\u00ad ures, and contact tracing. Such disci 0-sures may also be designed to reduce or eliminate the correctional system's legal liability should a released or transferred inmate transmit AIDS to others. On the other hand, the most compelling reason for. maintaining confidentiality is that persons known to have AIDS, ARC, or HTL Y .. III seropositivity may suffer.ostracism, threats, and possibly violent intimidation while in prison, and discrimination in employment, housing, and insurance availability after they are discharged. B~cause of their rapid population turnover rates, jails face even more difficult policy decisions and logistical problems regarding disclosure and confidentia'iity of medical information. The most notable study finding regard\u00ad ing disclosure is that a relatively small number of systems provide test results to inmates (31 percent of State and Federal systems and 52 percent of responding city and county systems). No State or Federal system and a small fraction of city-county systems (19 percent) disclose results to inmates only. Seventy percent of State and Federal sy~tems and 61 percent of responding city and county systems provide results to medical staff. No jurisdictions responding to the questionnaire specifically reported that spouses or sexual partners or previ'ous correctional facilities of seropositive inmates are notified of test results. Costs of care aTid associated services. Questionnaire responses showed that correctional systems are almost univer\u00ad sally concerned about the costs of medical care and associated services for inmates with AIDS. Questions regarding range of costs elicited widely varying estimates. but all agreed that medical care for AIDS patients is extremely expensive, whether it is provided in a cor-rectional medical facility, in another public medical facility, or in a hospital in the commu\u00ad nity, particularly because correctional inmates are ineligible for Medicaid reimbursement. Correctional systems should plan on , spending anywhere from $40.000 to over $600,000 for hospitalization and associated medical costs of caring for 7 each inmate with AIDS.2 The costs will vary depending on the amount of acute care required; they will also probably be higher if inmates are placed in hospitals in the community than if they are retained in correctional medical facilities or other public' medical facilities. To the figures for hospitalization and medical care must be added costs of ancillary services such as counseling, possible legal assistance, increased insurance (unless the system is self\u00ad insured), and funerals. Obviously. medical care and associated services for inmates with AIDS could have serious budgetary implications for correctional systems. Legal issues. There is currently very little law specifically on correctional systems' policies regarding AIDS cases, though several cases have been filed in New York and other States. Otherwise, specific AIDS-r~lated legal concerns remain largely hypothetical. Still, there is substantial caselaw on correctional medical care in general. which is important for administrators to consider in developing policies regarding AIDS. Suits on the ~uality of correctional medical care may be brought on the basis of Federal constitutional stand\u00ad ards, State law. or common law. There are three constitutional principles relevant to correctional medical care. First, under the eighth amendment. inmates are entitled to a safe. decent. and humane environment. 4 Second, in Estelle v. Gamble. 5 \"deliberate indif\u00ad ference to serious medical need\" was held to violate the eighth amendment protection against \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" Finally, the constitu\u00ad tional guarantee of \"equal protection of the laws\" applies to correctional . medical care cases, and particularly to 1The low figure is from \"Special Repon: The AIDS Epidemic.\" New Eng/andJourna/ afMedicille 1985: 312:523; the high figure is based on 2 ~ears at Nev. York City's annual estimate of5300.000 for patients requiring acute care. \"This discussion is based largely on the presentation of Clair Cripe. Esq .. of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. at a meeting of Correctional Commissioners on AIDS. sponsor.ed by the National Institute of Corrections. Atlanta. Georgia.

Medical care in correctional institu\u00ad tions is usually governed by the same State laws (e.g., medical practice and nursing practice acts) that apply to care in the community at large. Finally, in some States. correctional medical care may be subject to suits for common law torts such as negligence. Medical malpractice suits are also a possibility. Existing case law on AIDS in correc\u00ad tional facilities falls into the following three major categories: 1. Equal protection. Cases filed by inmates alleging denial of equal protection based solely on the fact that they had AIDS (e.g . Cordero v. Coughlin). 6 This case was decided in favor of the correctional department. 2. Quality of care. Cases filed by inmates alleging inadequacies in h607 F Supp 9 (S.D.N.Y .. 1984) U.S. Department of Justice National Institute of Justice Washing/mI. D.C. 20531 Official Business Penalty for Private Use 5300 medical care and associated services (e.g., Storms v. Coughlin). 7 3. Failure to protect others from ' AIDS. Cases filed by inmates and potentially also by staff alleging inadequate protective measures and .\u00ad seeking additional steps such as mass screening of inmates and segregation of inmates with AIDS, ARC, or HTLV -III seropositivity (e.g., Mtr La Rocca v. Dalsheim).8 The La Rocca case was decided in favor of the correctional department; other cases on these issues are still pending. 7SlOrmSl'. Coughlin was tiled in U.s.

Some of the issues may be mooted by new State regulations. but the plaintiffs attorney believes that there are a number of important quality-of-care issues to litigate. See also Thagardv.

Appendix E This appendix describes information on handling body fluids ir. a safe manner. It was prepared for a school setting, but is applica\u00ad ble to probation. The work of the New Jersey Department of Health and the Connecticut Department of Health Services and Education is acknowledged by this inclusion of their work. ,. -ADAPTED FR01~1: STATE OF CONNECTICUT, DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH SERVICES GUIDELINES FOR. HANDLING BODY FLUIDS IN SCliOOLS Recent concern about how children with AIDS should be educated has raised several questions regarding exposure of teachers and children tb potentially infectious body fluids from children with communicable diseases in the school setting:' -, 1. Does contact with body fluids present a risk of infection? 2. What should be done to avoid contact with potentially infected body fluids? 3. What should be done if direct contact with body fluids is made? 4. How should such fluids when spilled be removed from th~ environment? The following guidelines are meant to provide simpie and effective precautions against transmission of disease for all persons, including pregnant women, potentially exposed to the blood or body fluids of any student. No distinction is made between body fluids from stUdents with a known disease or those from students without symptoms or with an undiagnosed disease. DOES CONTACT WITH BODY FLUIDS PRESENT A RISK? The body fluids of all persons should be considered to contain potentially infectious agents (germs). The term \"body fluids\" includes: blood, semen, drainage from scrapes and cuts, feces, urine, vomitus, respiratory secretions (e.g., nasal discharge) and saliva. Contact with body fluids presents a risk of infection with a variety of germs. In general, however, the risk is very low and dependent on a variety of factors including the type of fluid with which contact is made and the type of contact made with it. Table 1 provides examples of particular germs that may occur in body fluids of children. It must be emphasized that with the exception of blood, which is normally sterile, the body fluids with which one may come in contact usually contain many organisms, some of which may cause disease. Furthermore, many germs may be carried by individuals who have no symptoms of illness. These individuals may be at various stages Gf infection: incubating disease, mildly infected without symptoms, or chronic carriers of certain infectious agents including the AIDS and hepatitis viruses. In fact, transmission of communicable diseases is more likely to occur from contact with infected body fluids of unrecognized carriers than from contact with fluids from recognized individuals because simple precautions are not always carried out. -2- TABLE 1 -------- ---~--------- TRANSMISSION CONCERNS IN THE SCHOOL SETTING BODY FLUID SOURCE OF INFECTIOUS AGENTS BODY FLUID-SOURCE Blood -cuts/abrasions -n~ebleeds -nasal discharge Vomitus Semen ORGANISM OF CONCERN Hepatitis B. virus AIDS virus Cytomegalovirus Salmonella bacteria Shigella bacteria Rotavirus Hepatitis A virus Cytomegalovirus Mononucleosis virus Common cold virus Influenza AIDS virus Hepatitis B ~,'ic:'us Gastrointestinal viruses, e.g., (Norwalk agent Rotavirus) Hepatitis B AIDS virus Gonorrhea ' ... ~ WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO AVOID CONTACT WITH BODY FLUIDS? When possible, direct skin contact with body fluids should be avoided. Disposable gloves sho~d be available in at least the office of the custodian, nurse, or prinCipal. Gloves are recommended when direct hand contact with body fluids is anticipated (e.g., treating bloody n~es, handling clothes soiled by incontinence, cleaning small spills by hand). If extensive contact is made with body fluids, hands should be \u00b7washed afterwards. Gloves used for this purpose should be put in a plastic bag or lined trash can, se~ured, and disposed of daily. WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IF DIRECT SKIN CONTACT OCCURS? In many instances, unanticipated skin contact with body fluids may ocqur in situations where gloves may be immediately unavailable (e.g.; when wiping a runny nose, applying pressure to a bleeding injury outside the classroom, helping a child in the bathroom). In these instances, hands and other affected skin areas of all exposed persons should be routinely washed with soap and water after direct contact has ceased. Clothing' and other nondisposable items (e.g. towels used to -~----------------------------------------------------------~----------------~---~ -3- wipe up body fluid) that are soaked through with body fluids should be rins.ed and placed in plastic bags. If presoaking is required to remove stains, (e.g. blood, feces), use gloves to rinse or soak the item in cold water prior to bagging. Clothing should be sent home for washing with appropriate directions to parents/teachers (see page 4). Contaminated disposable items (e.g., tissues, paper towels, diapers) should be handled as with disposable gloves. HOW SHOULD SPILLED BODY FLUIDS BE REMOVED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT? Most schools have standard procedures already in place for removing body fluids (e.g., vomitus). These procedures should be reviewed to determine whether appropriate cleaning and disinfection steps have been included. Many schools stock sanitary absorbent agents specifically intended for cleaning body fluid spills (e.g., ZGOOP, Pars en Mfg. Co., Philadelphia, PA). Disposable gloves should be worn when using these agents. The dry material is applied to the area, left for a few minutes to absorb the fluid, and then vacuumed or swept up. The vacuum bag or sweepings should be disposed of in a plastic bag. Broom and dust pan should be rinsed in a disinfectant. No special handling is required for vacuuming equipment. HAND WASHING PROCEDURES Proper handwashing requires the use of soap and water and vigorous washing under a stream of running water for approximately 10 seconds. Soap suspends easily removable soil and microorganisms .allowing them to be washed off. Running water is necessary to carry away dirt and debris. Rinse under running water. Use paper towels to thoroughly dry hands. DISINFECTANTS An intermediate level disinfectant should be used to clean surfaces contami\u00ad nated with body fluids. Such disinfectants will kill vegetative bacteria, fungi, tubercle bacillus and viruses. The disinfectant should be registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use as a disinfecta.nt in medical facilities and hospitals. Various classes of disinfectants are listed below. Hypochlorite solution (bleach) is preferred for objects that may be put in the mouth. 1. Ethyl or isopropyl alcohol (7096). 2. Phenolic germicidal detergent in 1% aqueous solution (e.g., Lysol *). 3. Sodium Hypochlorite with at least 100 ppm available chlorine (1/2 cup household bleach in 1 gallon water, needs to be freshly prepared ea~h time it is used). 4. Quaternary ammonium germicidal detergent in 2% aqueo\\Js solution tar or Sage*). Wescodyne*). . *Brand names 'used only for examples of each type of germicidal solution and should not be considered an endorsement of a specific product. -------------------------, \u00b7. -4- DISINFECTION OF HARD SURFACES AND CARE OF EQUIPMENT After removing the soil, a disinfectant is applied. Mops should be soaked in the disinfectant after use and rinsed thoroughly or washed in a hot water cycle before rinse. Disposable cleaning equipment and water should be placed in a toilet or plastic bag as appropriate. Non-disposable cleaning equipment (dust pans, buckets) should be thoroughly rinsed in the disinfectant. The disinfectant solution should be promptly disposed dov;~ a drain pipe. Remove gloves and discard in appropriate receptacles. DISINFECTION' OF RUGS -, Apply sanitary absorbent agent, let dry and vacuum. If necessary, mechanically remove with dust pan and broom, then apply rug shampoo (a germicidal detergent) with a brush and revacuum. Rinse dust pan and broom in disinfectant. If necessary, wash brush with soap and water. Dispose of nonreusable cleaning equipment as noted above. LAUNDRY INSTRUCTION'S FOR CLOTHING SOILED WITH BODY FLUIDS The 'nest important factor in laundering clothing contaminated in the sohool setting is elimination of potentially infectious agents by soap and water. Addition of bleach will further reduce the number of potentially infectious agents. Clothing soaked with body fluids should be washed separately from other items. Presoaking may be required for heavily soiled clothing. Otherwise, wash and dryas usual. If the material is bleachable, add 1/2 cup household bleach to the wash cycle. If material is not colorfast add 1/2 cup nonclorox bleach (e.g., Clorox II, Borateem) to the wash cycle.

APPENDIX F INFECTION PRECAUTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH AIDS LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY People with diagnosed AIDS who are able to care for themselves at horne can safely' live with both healthy' individuals who do not have AIDS or with other persons with AIDS'. Certain common sense hygienic measures protect both the persons with AIDS as well as their housemates. 1. Care should be taken to not share body secretions, par\u00ad ticularly blood or semen. In order for secretions to be shared, there must be a point of entry into another persons body. Preventing this transfer of body secretions while still maintaining, one's sexuality requires foresight and common sense. Risk reduction counseling for those who wish to remain sexually active is available through the Gay Men's Health Crisis (New York (212) 807-6655).\" This is important both to prevent possible transmission of AIDS to others and also to prevent acquiring other infections which may not be well tolerated by the person with AIDS. There is no reason why persons with AIDS should not continue to have the usual casual social contacts with people that they have had in the past. 2. Maintaining a state of pe~sonal cl~anliness is helpful to both the person with AIDS and others. This includes bathing regularly, washing hands after the use of bathroom facilities or contact with one's own body fluids such as semen, mucus, or blood, and washing hands before preparing food. 3. Kitchen and bathroom facilities may be shared with oth\u00ad ers. Normal sanitary practices in any household will prevent the growth of fungi and bacteria that may potentially cause illness to both immunocompromised and immuno-competent people. These include: o Clean kitchen counters with scouring powder \u00b7to remove food particles. Sponges used to clean in. the kitchen where food is prepared should NOT be the same sponges used to clean up bathroom-type spills. Dirty looking' sponges should not be used to wash dishes or clean food preparation areas. APPENDIX G ---------- ------------- ~---- -- RESOURCE LIST 1.

HTlV-1II1 LAV is transmitted through sexual contact, parenteral exposure to infectild blood or blood components, and perinatal transmission from mother to neonate. HTLV\u00b7IllIlAV has been isolated from blood, semen, saliva, tears, breast milk, and urine and is likely to be isolated from some other body fluids, secretions, and excretions, but epidemiologic evidence has im\u00ad plicated only blood and semen in transmission. Studies of nonsexual household contacts of AIDS patients indicate that casual contact with saliva and tears does not result in transmission of infe<:tion. Spread of infection to household contacts of infected persons has not been detected when the household contacts have not been sex partners or have not been infants of infected mothers. The kind of nonsexual person-to-person contact that generallv occurs among workers and clients or consumers in the workplace does not pose a risk for transmis- sion of HTlV-Ill/LAV. -. I As in the development of any such recommendations, the paramount consideration il! the protection of the public's health. The following recommendations heve !xIen developed for all workers, particularly work'lrs in occupations in which exposure might occur to blood from indi\u00ad viduals .infected with HTLV-Ill/LAV. These recommendations reinfo~ce and supplement the specific recommendations that were published earlier for clinical and laporatory staffs ( 1 ) and for dental-cate personnel and persons performing necropsies and morticians' services (2). Because of public concem about the purported risk of transmi!ision of HTlV-Ill/LAV by\u00b7persons I ~ -129- providing personal services and by food and beverages, these recomrnendati9ns contain infor\u00ad matlon and recommendations for personal-service and food-service workers. Finally, these recommendations address workplaces in general where there is np known risk of transmission of HTLV-Ill/LAV' (e.g\" offices, schools, factories, construction sites). Formulation of specific recommendations for health-care workers (HCWs) who perform invasive procedures (e.g., sur\u00ad geons, dentists) is in progress. Separate recommendations are also being developed to prevent HTLV-IIILl-AV transm'ission in prisons, other correctional facilities, and institutions housing indi\u00ad viduals who may exhibit uncontrollable behavior (e.g., custodial institutions) and in the perinatal setting. In addition, separate recommendations have already been developed for children in schools and day-care centers (3). HTLV-III/LAV-infected individuals include those with AIDS (4); those diagnosed by their physician Is) as having othElr illnesses due to infection with HTLV-III/LAV; and those who have virologic or serologic evidence of infection with HTLV -III/LAV but wh 0 are not ill. These recommendations are based on the well-documented modes of HTLV-III/LAV trans\u00ad mission identified in epidemiologic studies and on comparison with the hepatitis 8 experience. Other recommendations are based on the hepatitis B model of transmission. COMPARISON WITH THE HEPATITIS B VIRUS EXPERIENCE The epidemiology of HTLV-III/LAV infection is similar to that of hepatitis 8 virus (H8V) infec\u00ad tion, and much that has been leamed over the last 15 years related to the risk of acquiring hepatitis 8 in the workplace can be applied to \",nderstanding the risk of HTLV-III/LAV transmis\u00ad sion in the health-care and other occupational settings. 80th viruses are transmitted through sexual contact, parenteral exposure to contaminated blood or blood products, and perinatal transmission from infected mothers to their offspring. Thus, some of the same major groups at high risk for H8V infection le.g., homosexual men, IV drug abusers, persons with hemophilia, in\u00ad fants born to infected mothers) are also the groups at highest risk for HTLV-III/LAV infection. Neither H8V nor HTLV-III/LAV has been shown to be transmitted by casual contact in the work\u00ad place, contaminated food or water, or airborne or fecal-oral routes (5). HBV infection is an occupational risk for HCWs, but this risk is related to degree of contact with blood or contaminated needles. HCWs who do not have contact with blood or needles contaminated with blood are not at risk for acquiring HBV infection in the workplace (6-8). In the health-care setting, HBV transmission has not been documented between hospital\u00ad ized patients, except in hemodialysis units, where blood contamination of the environment has been extensive or where HBV-positive blood from one patient has been transferred to another patient through contamination of instruments. Evidence of HBV transmission from HCWs to patients has been rare and limited to situations in which the HCWs exhibited high concentra\u00ad tions of virus in their blood (at least 100,000,000 infectious virus particles per ml of serum). and the HCWs sustained a puncture wound while performing traumatic procedures on patients or had exudative or weeping lesions that allowed virus to contaminate instruments or open wounds of patients (9-111. Current evidence indicates that, despite epidemiologic similarities of HBV and HTLV-1II1 LAV infection, the risk for HBV transmission in health-care settings far exceeds that for HTLV-Ill/LAV transmission. The risk of acquiring HBV infection following a needlestick from an HBV carrier ranges from 6% to 30% ( 12. 13), far in excess of the risk of HTLV -III/LAV infec\u00ad tion following a needlestick involving a source patient infeeted with HTLV-Ill/LAV, Which is less than 1 %. In 'addition, all HCWs who have been shown to transmit HBV infection in health\u00ad care settings have belonged to the subset of chronic HBV carriers who, when tested, have ex\u00ad hibited evidence of exceptionally high concentrations of virus (at least 100,000,000 infec\u00ad tious virus particles per mil in their blood. Chronic carriers wh(: have substantially lower con\u00ad centrations of virus in their blood have not baen implicated in transmission in the health-care setting (9-11.14'. The HBV model thus represents a \"worst case\" condition in regard to transmission in health-care and other rolated settings. Therefore, recommendations for the control of HBV infection should, if follow~d, als.!t effectively prevent spread of HTLV-/II/LAV. Whether additional measures are indicated for those HCWs who perform invasi ... e procedures will be addressed in the recommendations currently being developed. Routine screening of all patients or HCWs for evidence of HBV infection has never' been recommended. Control of HBV transmission in the health-care 'setting has emphasized the implementation of recommendations for the a;:lpropriate handling of blood, other body fluids, and items soiled with blood or other body fluids. TRANSMISSION FROM PATIENTS TO HEALTH,CARE WORKERS HCWs include, but are not limited to, nurses, physicians, dentists and other dental workers, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors, laboratory and blood bank technologists and techni\u00ad cians, phlebotomists, dialysis personnel, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, medical -130- examiners. morticians. housekeepers. laundry workers. and others whose work involves con\u00ad tact with patients. their blood or other body fluids. or corpses. Recommendations for HeWs emphasize precautions appropriate for preventing transmis\u00ad sion of bloodbome infectious diseases. including HTLV-lll/LAV and HBV infec~ions. Thus. these precautions should be enforced routinely. as should other standard intection-control precautions. regardless of whether HCWs or patients are known to be infected with HTLV -1111 LAV or HBV...!n addition to being infonned of these precautions. all HeWs. including students and housestaff. should be educated regarding the epidemiology. modes of transmission. and prevention of HTLV-III/LAV infection. Risk of HCWs acquiring fiTlV-IIi/lAV in the workplace. Using the HBV model. the high\u00ad est risk for transmission of HTLV-III/LAV in the workplace would involve parenteral exposure to a needle or other sharp instrument contaminated with blood of an infected patient. The risl< to HeWs of acquiring HTLV.dIl/LAV infection in the workplace has been evaluated in several studies. In five separate studies. a total of 1,498 HeWs have been tested for antibody to HTLV-IIIILAV. In these studies. 666 (44.5\u00b0~) of the HCWs had direct parenteral (needlestick or cut) or mucous membrane exposure to patients with AIDS or HTLV-III/LAV infection. Most of these exposures were to blood rather than to other body fluids. None of the HCWs whose ini\u00ad tial serologic tests were negative developed subsequent evidence of HTLV-III/LAV infection following their exposures. Twenty-six HCWs in these five studies were seropositive when first tested; all but three of these persons belonged to groups recognized to be at increased risk for AIDS (15). Since one was tested anonymously. epidemiologic information was availa\u00ad ble on only two of these three seropositive HeWs. Although these two HeWs were reported as probable occupationally related HTLV-III/LAV infection (15.16). neither had a preexposure nor an early postexposure serum sample available to help determine the onset of infection. One case reported from England describes a nurse who seroconverted fol/owing an accidental parenteral exposure to a needle contamInated with blood from an AIDS patient (17). . In spite of the extremely low risk of tr'ansmission of HTLV-III/LAV infection. even when needlestick injuries occur. more emphasis must be given to precautions targeted to prevent needlestick injuriesin.HCWs caring for any patient, since such injuries continue to occur even during the care of patients who are known to be infected with HTLV-IIIILAV. Precautions to prevent acquisition of HTlV-l/t/lAV infection by HeWs in the work\u00ad place. These precautions represent prudent practices that apply to preventing transmission of HTLV-IIIILAV and other blood borne infections and should be used routinely ( 18). 1. Sharp items (needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp instruments) should be consid\u00ad ered as potentially infective ard be handled with extraordinary care to prevent acciden\u00ad tal injuries. 2. Disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp items should be placed into puncture-resistant containers located as close as practical to the area in which they were used. To prevent needlestick injuries. needles should not be recapped. purposefully bent. broken. removed from disposable syringes. or otherwise manipulated by hand. 3. When the possibility of exposure to blood or other body fluids exists. routinely recom\u00ad mended precautions should be followed. The anticipated exposure may require gloves alone. as in handling items soiled with blood or equipment contaminated with blood or other body fluids. or may also require gowns. masks. and eye-coverings when perform\u00ad ing 'procedures involving more extensive contact with blood or potentially infective body fluids. as in some dental or endoscopic procedures or postmortem examinations. Hands should be washed thoroughly and immediately if they accidentally become con\u00ad taminated with blood. 4. To minimize the need for emergency mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. mouth' pieces, resuscitation bags. or other ventilation devices should be strategically located and available for use in areas where the need for resuscitation is predictable. 5. Pregnant HCWs are not known to be at greater risk of contracting HTLV-III/LAV infec\u00ad tions than HeWs who are not pregnant; however. if a Hew develops HTLV -III/LAV in\u00ad fection during pregnancy. the infant is at increased risk of ~nfection resultina from perinatal transmission, Because of this risk. pregnant HeWs should be especially famil\u00ad iar with precautions for the preventing HTLV-III/LAV transmission (19). Precautions for HeWs during home care of persons infected with HTlV-lII/lAV. Per\u00ad sons infected with HTLV-Ill/LAV can be safely cared for in home environments. Studies of family members of patients infected with HTLV-III/LAV have found IJO evidence of HTLV-1II1 LAV transmission to adults who we~e not sexual contacts of the infected patients or to children who were not at risk for perinatal transmission (3). HCWs providing home care face the same -131- risk of transmission of infection as HeWs in hospitals and other health-care settings especially if there are needlesticks or other parenteral or mucous membrane exposures to blo~d or oth body fluids. When providing health-care service in the home to persons infected with HTLV-III/LAV measures similar to those used in hospitals are appropriate. As in the hospital. needles should not be recapped. purposefully bent. broken. removed from disposable syringes. or otherwise manipulat'!.d by hand. Needles and other sharp items should be placed into puncture-resistant containers and disposed of in accordance with local regulations for solid waste. Blood and other body fluids can be flushed down the toilet. Other items for disposal that are contaminated with blood or other body fluids that cannot be flushed down the toilet should be wrapped securely in a plastic bag that is impervious and sturdy (not easily penetrated). It should be placed in a second bag before being discarded in a manner consistent with local regulations for solid waste disposal. Spills of blood or other body fluids should be cleaned with soap and water or a household detergent. As in the hospital. individuals cleaning up such spills should wear disposable gloves. A disinfectant solution or a freshly prepared solution of sodium hy\u00ad pochlorite (household bleach. see below) should be used to wipe the area after cleaning. Precautions for providers of prehospital emergency IH,alth care. Providers of prehospi\u00ad tal emergency health care include the foilowing: paramedics. emergency medical technicians. law enforcement personnel. firefighters. lifeguards. and others whose job might require them to provide first-response medical care. The risk of transmission of infection. including HTLV\u00ad III/LAV infection. from infected persons to providers of prehospital emergency health care should be no higher than that for HeWs providing emergency care in the hospital if appropri\u00ad ate precautions are taken to prevent exposure to blood or other body fluids. Providers of prehospital emergency health care should follow the precautions outlined above for other HeWs. No transmission of HBV infection during mouth-to-mouth resuscita\u00ad tion has been documented. However. ~ecause of the risk of salivary transmissi~n of HTLV-III/LAV during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, special attention should be given to . the use of disposable airway equipment or resuscitation bags and the wearing of gloves when in contact with blood or other body fluids. Resuscitation equipment and devices known or sus- . pected to be contaminated with blood or other body fluids should be used once and disposed of or be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected after each use. Managem.ant of parenteral and mucous membrane exp'osures of HeWs. If a HeW has a parenteral (e.g., needlestick or cut) or mucous membrane (e.g., splash to the eye or mouth) exposure to blood or other bog,y fluids, the source patient should be assessed clinically and epidemiologically to determine the likelihood of HTLV-III/LAV infection. If the assessment suggests that infection may exist. the patient should be informed of the incident and request\u00ad ed to consent to serologic testing for evidence of HTLV-III/LAV infection. If the source patient has AIDS or other evidence of HTLV-III/LAV infection, declines testing, or has a positive test. the HeW should be evaluated clinically and serologically for evidence of HTLV-III1LAV infec\u00ad tion as soon as possible after the exposure, and, if seronegative. retested after 6 weeks and on a periodic basis thereafter (e.g., 3, 6, and 12 months following exposure) to determine if transmiSSion has occurred. During this follow-up period. espeCially the first 6-12 weeks, when most infected persons are expected to seroconvert, exposed HeWs should receive counseling about the risk of infection and follow U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) recommen\u00ad dations for preventing transmission of AIDS (20,21 ).If the source patient is seronegative and has no other evidence of HTLV-III/LAV infection, no further follow-up of the HeW IS neces\u00ad sary. If the source patient cannot be identified. decisions regarding appropriate follow-up should be individualized based on the type of exposure and the likelihood that the source pa\u00ad tient was infected. Serologic testing of patients. Routine serologic testmg of all patients for antibody to HTLV-III/LAV is not recommended to prevent transmission of HTLV-III/LAV infection in the workplace. Results of such testing are unlikely to further reduce the risk of transmission, which, even-with documented needles ticks, is already extremely low. Furthermore, the risk of needlestick and other parenteral exposures could be reduced by emphasizing and more con\u00ad sistently implementing, routinely recommended infection-control precautions (e.g . not recap\u00ad ping needles). Moreover. results of routine serologic testing would not be available for emergency cases and patients with short lengths of stay, and additional tests to determine whether a positive test was a true or false positive would be required in populations with a low prevalence of infection. However, this recommendation is based only on ~onsiderations of occupational risks and should not bo construed as a recommendation against other uses of the serologic test. such as for diagnosis or to facilitate medical management of patients. Since the experience with infected patients varies substantially among hospitals (75% of all -132- -AIDS cases have been reported by only 280 of the more than 6,000 acute-care hospitals i\", the United States), some hospitals in certain geographic areas may deem it appropriate to initiate serologic testing of patients. TRANSMISSION FROM HEALTH-CARE WORKERS TO PATIENTS Risk of transmission of HTLV-III/LAV infection from HCWs to patients. Although there is no evidence that HCWs infected with HTLV-III/LAV have transmitted infection to patients, a risk of transmission of HTLV-III/LAV infection from HeWs to patients would exist in situations where there IS both (1) a high degree of trauma to the patient that would provide a portal of entry for the virus (e,g\" during invasive procedures) and (2) access of blood or serous fluid from the infected HeW to the open tissue of a patient, as could occur if the HeW sustains a needlestick or scalpel injury during an invasive procedure, HeWs known to be infected with HTLV-III/LAV who do not perform invasive procedures need nof be restricted from work unless they have evidence of other infection or illness for which any HeW should be restrict\u00ad ed. Whether additional restrictions are indicated for HeWs who perform invasive procedures is currently being considered. Precautions to prevent transmission of HTLV-III/LAV Infection from HCWs to pa\u00ad tients. These precautions apply to all HeWs, regardless of whether they perform invasive procedures: (1) All Hews should wear gloves for direct contact with mucous membranes or nonintact skin of all patients and (2) HeWs who have exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis should refrain from all direct patient care and from handling patient-care equipment until the condition resolves. Management of J1~renteral and mucous membrane exposures of patients. If a patient has a parenteral or mucous membrane exposure to blood or other body fluids of a HCW, the patient should be.informed of the incident and the same procedure outlined above for expo\u00ad sures of HeWs to patients should be followed for both the source HCW and the potentially ex\u00ad posed patient. Management of this type of .exposure will be addressed in more detail-in the recommendations for HeWs who perform invasive procedures. Serologic testing of HCWs, Routine serologic testing of HeWs who do not perfOl'm inva\u00ad sive procedures (including providers of home and prehospital emergency care) is not recom\u00ad mended to prevent transmission of HTLV-III/LAV infection. The risk of transmission is ex\u00ad tremely low and can be further minimized when routinely recommended infection-control pre\u00ad cautions are followed. However. serologic testing should be available to Hews who may wish to know their HTLV-III/LAV infection status. Whether indications exist for serologic testing of HCWs who perform invasive procedures is currently being considered. Risk of occupational acquisition of other infectious diseases by HCWs infected with HTLV-III/LAV. HeWs who are known to be infected with HTLV-III/LAV and who have defec\u00ad tive immune systems are at increased risk of acquiring or experiencing serious complications of other infectious diseases. Of particular concern is the risk of severe infection following exposure to patients with infectious diseases that are easily transmitted if appropriate precau\u00ad tions are not taken (e.g., tuberculosis). HeWs infected with HTLV-lll/LAV should be co~nseled about the potential risk associated with taking care of patients with transmissible infections and should continue to follow existing recommendations for infection control to minimize\u00b7 their risk of exposure to other infectious agents ( 18. 19). The HeWs' personal physician(s), in conjunction with their institutions' personnel health services or medical directors, should determine on an individual basis whether the infected HeWs can adequately and safely per\u00ad form patient-care duties and suggest changes in work assignments, if indicated. In making this-determination, recommendations of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee and institutional policies concerning requirements for vaccinating HCWs with live-virus vaccines should also be considered. STERILIZATION, DISINFECTION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND WASTE DISPOSAL TO PRE\u00ad VENT TRANSMISSION OF HTLV-III/LAV Sterilization and disinfection procedures currently recommended for use (22,23) in health\u00ad care and dental facilities are adequate to sterilize or disinfect ins'trumants, devices, or other items contaminated with the blood or other body fluids from individuals infected 'with HTLV-IIII LAV. Instruments or other nondisposable items that enter normally sterile tissue or the vascular system \u00b7or through which blood flows should be sterilized before reuse, Surgical instruments used on all patients should be decontaminated after use rather than just rinsed with water. Decontamination can be accomplished by machine or by hand cleaning by trained personnel wearing appropriate protective attire (24) and using appropriate chemical germicides. Instru\u00ad ments or other non disposable items that touch intact mucous membranes should receive high\u00ad level disinfection. Several liquid chemical germicides commonly used in laboratories and health-care facilities have been shown to kill HTLV-III/LAV at concentrations much,lower than are used in practice (25). When decontaminating instruments or medical devices, chemical germicides that are -133- registered with and approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency' (EPA) \"t'- I .. b d' h f . . as s erl ants can e use elt er or sterrllzation or for high-level disinfection depend' t t . \"d h rng on con ac tIme; germlcl es t at are approved for use as \"hospital disinfectants\" and are m ob t ._ 'd I h d . d\" yc ac err CI a w en use at appropflate Ilutlons can also be used for high-level disinf ct' .. . e Ion 0 devIces rnstruments. GermIcIdes that are mycobactericidal are preferred because myco- bacteria represent one of the most resistant groups of microorganisms; therefore. germicides that ar! effective against mycobacteria are also effective against other bacterial and viral pathogens, When chemical germicides are used. instruments or devices to be !;terilized or dis\u00ad infec:ed should be thoroughly cleaned before exposure to the germicide. and the manufactur- er's instructions for use of the germicide should be followed. . Laundry and dishwashing cycles commonly used in hospitals are adequate to decontami\u00ad nate linens, dishes, glassware. and utensils. When cleaning environmental house\u00ad keeping procedures cGmmonly used in hospitals are adequate; surfaces exposed to blood and body fluids should be cleaned with a detergent followed by decontamination using an EPA-approved hospital disinfectant that is mycobactericidal. Individuals cleaning up such spills should wear disposable gloves. Information on specific label claims of commercial ger\u00ad micides can be obtained by writing to the Disinfectants Branch. Office of Pesticides. Environ\u00ad mental Protection Agency. 401 M Street, S.W\" Washington. D.C . 20460. In addition to hospital disinfectanh;, a freshly prepared solution of sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) is an inexpensive and very effective germicide (25). Concentrations rang\u00ad ing from 5.000 ppm (a 1: 1 0 dilution of household bleach) to 500 ppm (a 1: 1 00 dilution) sodium hypochlorite are effective. depending on the amount of organic material (e.g . blood. mucus. etc.) present on the surface to be cleaned and disinfected. Sharp items should be considered as potentially infective and should be handled and dis\u00ad pos\\Jd of with extraordinary care to prevent accidental injuries. Other potentially infective waste should be contained and transported in clearly identified impervious plastic bags. If the outside of the bag is contaminated with blood or other body fluids. a second outer bag should be used. Recommended practices for disposal of infective waste (23) are adequate for dis\u00ad posal of waste contaminated by HTLV-/ll/LAV. Blood and other. body fluids may be carefully poured down a drain connected to a sanitary sewer. CONSIDERATIONS RELEVANT TO OTHER WORKERS Personal-service workers (PSWsl. PSWs are defined as individuals whose occupations involve close personal contact with clients (e.g .. hairdressers. barbers, servictls (tattooing. ear piercing. acupuncture. etc.) require needles or other instruments that penetrate the skin should follow precautions indicated for HCWs. Although there is no evidence of transmission of HTLV-III/LAV from clients to PSWs, from PSWs to clients. or between clients of PSWs. a risk of transmission would exist from PSWs to clients and vice versa in situations where there is both (1) trauma to one of the individuals that would provide a portal of entry for the virus and (2) access of blood or serous fluid from one infected person to the open tissue of the other. as could occur if either sustained a cut. A risk of transmission from client to client exists when instruments contaminated with blood are not sterilized or disinfected between clients. However. HBV transmission has been documented only rarely in acupuncture. ear pIercing. and tattoo establishments and never in other personal-service settings. indicating that any risk for HTLV-III/LAV transmission in personal-service settings must be extremely low. All PSWs should be educated about transmission of blood borne infections. including HTLV-lll/LAV and HBV. Such education should emphasize principles of good hygiene. antisep\u00ad sis. and disinfection. This education can be accomplished by national or state professional or\u00ad ganizations. with assistance fram state and local health departments. using lectures at meet\u00ad ings or self-instructional materials. Licensure requirements should include evidence of such education. Instruments that are intended to penetrate the skin (e.g .. tattooing and acupuncture needles. ear piercing devices) should be used once and disposed of or be thoroughly cleaned' and sterilized after each use using procedures recommended for use in health-care institu\u00ad tions. Instruments not intended to penetrate the skin but which may become contaminated with blood (e.g . razors), should be used for only one client and be disposed of or thoroughly cleaned and disinfected attar use using procedures recommended for use in health-care tutions. Any PSW of HTLV-III/LAV in\u00ad fection status. should refrain from direct contact with clients until the 'condition resolves. PSWs known to be infected with HTLV-m/LAV need not be restricted from work unless they have evidence of other infections or illnesses for which any PSW should also be restricted. Routine serologic testing of PSWs .for antibody to HTLV-III/LAV is not recommended to prevent transmission from PSWs to clients, -134- Food-service workers (FSWs). FSWs are cfefined as individuals whose occupations in\u00ad volve the preparation or serving of food or beverages (e.g., cooks, caterers, servers, waiters, bartenders;airline attendants). All epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that blood\u00ad bome and sexually transmitted infections are not transmitted during the preparation or serving of food or beverages, and no instances of HBV or HTLV-Ul/LAV transmission have been docu\u00ad mented in this setting. All FSWs...should follow recommended standards and practices of good personal hygiene and food sanitation (26). All FSWs should exercise care to avoid injury to hands when prepar\u00ad ing food. Should such an injury occur, both aesthetic and sanitary considerations woulcl dictate that food contaminated with blood be discarded. FSWs known to be infected with HTLV ~IIII LAV need not be restricted from work unless they have evidence of other infection or illness for which any FSW should also be restricted. Routine serologic testing of FSWs for antibody to HTLV-III/LAV is not recommended to prevent disease transmission from FSWs to consumers. Other workers sharing the same work environment. No known risk of transmission to co-workers. clients. or consumers exists from HTLV-III/LAV-infected workers in other settings (e.g . offices. schools. factories. construction sites). This infection is spread by sexual contact with infected persons, injection of contaminated blood or blood products. and by perinatal transmission. Workers known to be infe_cted with HTLV-III/LAV should not be restricted from work solely based on this finding. Moreover. they should not be restricted from using tele\u00ad phones. office equipment. toilets. showers. eating facilities, and water fountains. Equipment contaminated with blood or other body fluids of any worker. regardless of HTLV-III/LAV infec\u00ad tion status. should be cleaned with soap and water or a detergent. A disinfectant solution or a fresh solution of sodium hypochlorite (household bleach, see above) should be used to wipe the area after cleaning. OTHER ISSUES IN THE WORKPLACE The information and recommendations contained in this document do not address all the potential issues that may have to be considered when making specific employment decisions for persons with f-I.TLV-III/LAV infection. The diagnosis of HTLV-lll/LAV infection may evoke unwarranted fear and suspicion in some co-workers. Other issues that may be considered in\u00ad clude the need for confidentiality. applicable federal. state. or local laws governing occupa\u00ad tional safety and health, civil rights of employees. workers' compensation laws. provisions of collective bargaining agreements, confidentiality of medical records. informed consent. em\u00ad ployee and patient privacy rights. and employee right-to-know statutes.
