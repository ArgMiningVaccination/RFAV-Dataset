the world in 2018-19, despite a slight moderation in its GDP growth from 7.2 per cent in 2017-18 to 6.8 per cent in 2018-19. On the other hand, the world output growth declined from 3.8 per cent in 2017 to 3.6 per cent in 2018. The slowdown in the world economy and Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) inFigure 1: Growth rate of real GDP (per cent) 2.03.04.05.06.07.08.09.0 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 (F)WorldEmerging Market & Developing EconomiesIndia Data source: WEO, April 2019 database, CSO for India, 2019 projection for India is survey's projection.For the global economy, the year 2018 was difficult, with the world output growth falling from 3.8 per cent in 2017 to 3.6 per cent in 2018. Growth rate of world output is projected to fall further to 3.3 per cent in 2019 as growth of both advanced economies and emerging & developing economies are expected to decline. Growth of the Indian economy moderated in 2018-19 with a growth of 6.8 per cent, slightly lower than 7.2 per cent in 2017-18. Yet, India continued to be the fastest growing major economy in the world. India maintained its macroeconomic stability by containing inflation within 4 per cent and by maintaining a manageable current account deficit to GDP ratio. The current account deficit to GDP was higher in 2018-19 as compared to 2017-18, primarily due to higher oil prices, which were about 14 $/bbl higher in 2018-19 vis-\u00e0-vis the previous year. However, the current account deficit started to narrow in the third quarter of the year. The manufacturing sector was characterised by higher growth in 2018-19 while the growth in agriculture sector witnessed tapering. Growth in investment, which had slowed down for many years, has bottomed out and has started to recover since 2017-18. In fact, growth in fixed investment picked up from 8.3 per cent in 2016-17 to 9.3 per cent in 2017-18 and further to 10.0 per cent in 2018-19. Net FDI inflows grew by 14.2 per cent in 2018-19. Capital expenditure of Central Government grew by 15.1 per cent in 2018-19 leading to increase in share of capital expenditure in total expenditure. Given the macroeconomic situation and the structural reforms being undertaken by the government, the economy is projected to grow at 7 per cent in 2019-20. \u0015 Economic Survey 2018-19 V olume 2 Table 0.1 : Key Indicators Data categories Unit 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 GDP and Related Indicators GDP at current market prices ` Crore 13771874 15362386 17095005 19010164a GDP at constant market prices ` Crore 11369493 12298327 13179857 14077586a Growth Rate (per cent) 8.0 8.2 7.2 6.8a GV A at constant basic prices ` Crore 10491870 11318972 12104165 12906936a Growth Rate (per cent) 8.0 7.9 6.9 6.6a Gross Savings % of GDP 31.1 30.3 30.5 NA Gross Capital Formation % of GDP 32.1 30.9 32.3 NA Per Capita Net National Income of Industrial Production (growth)(per cent) 3.3 4.6 4.4 3.6 Electricity Generation (growth) (per cent) 5.6 4.7 4.0 3.5 Prices :3,\u0003LQ\u00c0DWLRQ\u0003 DYHUDJH (per cent) -3.7 1.7 3.0 4.3 &3,\u0003 &RPELQHG \u0003LQ\u00c0DWLRQ\u0003 DYHUDJH (per cent) 4.9 4.5 3.6 3.4 External Sector Merchandise export growth (in US$ term)(per cent) -15.5 5.2 10.0 8.8 Merchandise import growth (in US$ term)(per cent) -15.0 0.9 21.1 10.4 Current Account Balance % of GDP -1.1 -0.6 -1.9 -2.6c Foreign 424.5 412.9 Average Exchange Rate ` /US$ 65.5 67.1 64.5 69.9 Money and Credit Broad Money (M3) growth (per cent) 10.1 10.1 9.2 10.5 Scheduled Commercial Bank Credit (Growth Rate)(per cent) 10.9 8.2 10.0 13.3 Fiscal Indicators (Centre) *URVV\u0003\u0003)LVFDO\u0003\u0003'H\u00bfFLW % of GDP 3.9 3.5 3.5 3.4d 5HYHQXH\u0003\u0003'H\u00bfFLW % of GDP 2.5 2.1 2.6 2.3d 3ULPDU\\\u0003\u0003'H\u00bfFLW % of GDP 0.7 0.4 0.4 0.3d Notes: NA: Not Available, a: Provisional estimates, b: Third advance estimate,c: (April-December) 2018, d: Provisional Actual\u0016 State of the Economy in 2018-19: A Macro View 1.2 India is the seventh largest economy in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in current US$ and has emerged as the fastest growing major economy (Figure 2). The average growth rate of India was not only higher than China's during 2014-15 to 2017-18 but much higher than that of other top major economies (measured in terms of GDP at current US$ terms) as well. With Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjustments, India's GDP at current international dollar, ranks third in the world (as shown by the size of circles in Figure 2). forward, the growth of world economy will be bolstered mainly by growth in China and India and their increasing weights in world income. In EMDEs group, India and China are the major drivers of growth. The global economy\u2014in particular the global growth powerhouse, China\u2014is rebalancing, leading to an increasing role for India. Hence, India's contribution has become much more valuable to the global economy.2018 followed the escalation of US China trade tensions, tighter credit policies in &KLQD\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003\u00bfQDQFLDO\u0003WLJKWHQLQJ\u0003DORQJVLGH\u0003WKH\u0003normalization of monetary policy in the larger advanced economies. In 2019, when the world economy and EMDEs are projected to slow down by 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points respectively, growth of Indian economy is forecast to increase (Figure 1). Crucially, India forms part of 30 per cent of the global economy, whose growth is not projected to decline in 2019 (World Economic Outlook (WEO), April 2019 of IMF). 1.3 The contribution of the Indian economy to the GDP of EMDEs and world economy has increased consistently over the years (Figure 3). In a span of less than a decade, India's contribution to EMDEs GDP has increased by around 1.3 percentage points and to the world economy by around 0.7 percentage points. India's share in GDP of EMDEs stood at 8 per cent in 2018.

The Indian economy grew at 6.8 per cent in 2018-19, thereby experiencing some moderation in growth when compared to the previous year. This moderation in growth momentum is mainly on account of lower growth in 'Agriculture & allied', 'Trade, hotel, transport, storage, communication and services related to broadcasting' and 'Public administration & defence' sectors. Acreage in 2018-19 for the rabi crop was marginally lower than last year, which affected agricultural performance. The contraction in food prices may have contributed to inducing farmers to produce less. On the demand side, lower growth of GDP in 2018-19 was accounted for, by a decline in growth of JRYHUQPHQW\u0003 \u00bfQDO\u0003 FRQVXPSWLRQ\u000f\u0003 FKDQJH\u0003 LQ\u0003stocks and contraction in valuables. 1.5 When we examine the growth pattern within the various quarters of 2018-19, we note that the moderation in real GDP growth has been experienced in all quarters of 2018-19 (Figure 4) with the fourth quarter (Q4)registering a growth of 5.8 per cent. The base effect arising from a high growth of 8.1 per cent in the Q4 of 2017-18 also led to this lower growth in Q4 of 2018-19. In this quarter, election related uncertainty may have also contributed to growth moderation. 1.6 There was contraction in 'Agriculture & allied' sector in the last quarter of 2018-19, though growth was reasonable in the previous three quarters. Growth of industry sector also experienced tempering in successive quarters of 2018-19 mostly on account of Figure 3: India's share in GDP of EMDEs and World (per cent) 2.5 2.4 2.4 2.62.83.03.3 3.26.86.46.26.67.17.88.38.1 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Contribution to World GDP Contribution to EMDE's GDP Data source: WEO, April 2019 database Figure 4: Quarterly real GDP 4.2 4.5 4.6 6.5 5.1 4.9 2.8 -0.1 Industry 0.8 6.9 8.0 8.1 9.8 6.7 7.0 4.2 (of which ) Manufacturing -1.7 7.1 8.6 9.5 12.1 6.9 6.4 3.1 Services 9.4 6.8 8.0 8.2 7.1 7.3 7.2 8.4 GV A at basic prices 5.9 6.6 7.3 7.9 7.7 6.9 6.3 5.7GDP at market prices 6.0 6.8 7.7 8.1 8.0 7.0 6.6 5.8 6RXUFH \u0003&HQWUDO\u00036WDWLVWLFV\u00032I\u00bfFH\u0018 State of the Economy in 2018-19: A Macro View decelerated in many segments of the automobile sector, including passenger vehicles, tractor sales, three and two wheeler sales (Figure 5).

However, the decline was much sharper in merchandise imports, which reduced from 21.1 per cent to 10.4 per cent. Growth of merchandise imports declined as oil price driven increase in growth of oil imports was more than offset by contraction in value of gold imports and lower growth in the value of non-oil non-gold imports. The crude oil prices, however, showed movements in both the directions within the year. As the year commenced, crude prices increased and reached above 80 US$/bbl. in October 2018.

First interesting point to note is that the share of food in total consumption is more than 10 percentage points lower in urban areas (in 1999-00, 2004-05 and 2011-12 as well) as compared to rural areas. Secondly, share of food in total consumption has gone down by around 6.5 percentage points in rural areas and 5.5 percentage points in urban areas from 1999-00 to 2011-12. Within food, cereals have accounted for almost the entire decline. The share of cereals has reduced to half between 1999-00 to 2011-12 in both urban and rural areas. Overall, the share of non-food expenditure has increased with the expenditure share increasing for education, medical, conveyance and durable goods (Table B). This shows that the shift towards discretionary spending has been increasing while with the spending on necessities has been gradually decreasing. In 2011-12 as well, the share of non-food expenditure was higher by almost 10 percentage points in urban area as compared to rural areas, same as that in 1999-00. The share of spending on education was almost double in urban areas as compared to rural areas in 2011-12 (Table B).

Credit to, both, large and micro, small & medium enterprises has seen pickup in growth. The growth of bank credit to micro, small & medium enterprises was contracting in 2016 and 2017, but has started picking up in 2018. Credit growth to large industry started declining since March 2016 and entered negative territory by October 2016. It has recovered since early 2017-18 and the momentum has picked up in the second half of 2018 (Figure 21). 1.29 At the sectoral level, investment rates have been declining since 2011-12, though the investment rate in services is displaying signs of bottoming out (Figure 22). In year 2011-12, industry sector had the highest investment rate, followed by services, whereas the agriculture sector had investment rate much less than half of that of services. In 2017-18, investment rate in services sector became the highest. Investment rate in agriculture still continues to lag behind and now is half the investment rate in the industry sector. 1.30 Simultaneously, there has been a decline in savings rate as well, with the household sector entirely contributing to the decline. Household savings declined from 23.6 per cent in 2011-12 to 17.2 per cent in 2017-18. Almost this entire decline is in physical savings of the households, with RQO\\\u0003PDUJLQDO\u0003GHFOLQH\u0003LQ\u0003\u00bfQDQFLDO\u0003VDYLQJV\u0003LQ\u00032016-17 and 2017-18 (Table 3).

Exports are the external component of demand of domestic goods, and imports are a leakage of income of the country for demand of products from other countries. The contribution of exports and imports to GDP would matter in rupee terms for national accounting purposes rather than US dollar. Hence, the discussion in this section is based on growth in rupee terms. Interestingly, the trend of growth of exports and imports was different in 2018-19 in rupee and US dollar terms (Figure 24 & 25). While the growth of both export and import declined in US$ terms, it increased in rupee terms (at current prices) in 2018-19.This happened due to the depreciation of rupee vis-\u00e0-vis US dollar in 2018-19 (Figure 12).

Exports of both service and merchandise (in rupee terms) picked up in 2018-19 in nominal terms. Nominal growth of imports also picked up in 2018-19 but the pickup in nominal export growth was much higher. So although growth of export in dollar terms declined, the positive growth in rupee terms, because of depreciation has insured a steady growth in the export earnings. 1.34 Import prices as compared to export prices in rupee terms increased sharply in 2018-19, vis-\u00e0-vis 2017-18. Growth in Unit Value Index of merchandise exports and imports was 1.1 per cent and (-)1.9 per cent respectively in 2017-18, but increased to 6.9 per cent and 17 per cent respectively in April-December 2018-19.

However, the growth contribution of net exports is positive in many years. In 2018-19, there was improvement in contribution of net exports to GDP growth, owing to higher growth of exports and lower growth of imports at constant prices as compared to previous year. Going forward, the prospects of export growth are dependent on the impact of rising trade protectionism and effectiveness of export promotion measures of Goverment.

There has been a modest compositional shift within the 'Agriculture and allied' sectors i.e., from crop to livestock sectors and within crop sector from cereals to horticultural produce. The share of crops in GV A has reduced from 12.1 per cent in 2013-14 to 10.0 per cent in 2017-18, and that of livestock increased from 4.1 per cent to 4.9 per cent (at current prices) during the same period.\u0014\u001b Economic Survey 2018-19 V olume 2 1.40 The GV A of the private corporate sector, with around 70 per cent share of the manufacturing sector (estimated from available data of listed companies with BSE and NSE) grew by 8.4 per cent at constant prices in 2018-19. On the other hand, production in manufacturing sector as measured by IIP slowed down to 3.5 per cent in 2018-19 from 4.6 per cent in 2017-18 (Figure 27). Growth in IIP is used to estimate the GV A growth of 'quasi-corporate' and 'unorganized' segment of manufacturing sector. Hence, contribution of unorganised sector to growth of manufacturing sector declined in 2018-19. Another positive development in the manufacturing sector has been the gradual improvement in capacity utilisation since Q4 of 2016-17 (Figure 28) along with the pick-up in bank credit to large industry since June 2018. 1.41 The growth in manufacturing sector picked up in 2018-19, although the momentum slowed down towards the end of Table 4: Gross Value Added at Basic Prices by Economic Activity Real growth (per cent) Share at current prices (per cent) 2016-17 2017-18 17.2 16.1 Industry 7.7 5.9 6.9 29.4 29.3 29.6 Mining & quarrying 9.5 5.1 1.3 2.3 2.3 2.4 Manufacturing 7.9 5.9 6.9 16.8 16.4 16.4Electricity, gas, water supply & other utility services10.0 8.6 7.0 2.5 2.7 2.8 Construction 6.1 5.6 8.7 7.8 7.8 8.0 Services 8.4 8.1 7.5 52.7 53.5 54.3 Trade, hotel, transport, storage, communication & services related to broadcasting7.7 7.8 6.9 18.2 18.2 18.3 Financial, real estate & professional services8.7 6.2 7.4 20.9 21.0 21.3 Public administration, defence and other services9.2 11.9 8.6 13.6 14.3 14.7 GV A at basic prices 7.9 6.9 6.6 100.0 100.0 100.0 6RXUFH \u0003&HQWUDO\u00036WDWLVWLFV\u00032I\u00bfFH Note: Data per the Provisional Estimates . 1.39 Growth in industry accelerated during 2018-19 on the strength of improving manufacturing and construction activity (Table 4), which have more than offset the deceleration in the other two sub sectors, 'Mining & quarrying' and 'Electricity, gas, water supply & other utility services'.

This should lead to improvement in agriculture sector growth. However, according to IMD, some regions are expected to receive less than normal rains. This could prove to be detrimental for crop production in certain affected areas. If the impact of stress in the NBFC sector spills over to this year as well, it may lead to lower credit offtake from NBFCs, which may dampen growth in consumption spending. 1.54 Prospects of export growth remain weak for 2019-20 if status quo is maintained. However, reorientation of export policies to target countries/markets based on our own relative comparative advantage and the importing country's exposure to Indian goods can foster export performance. Under status quo, the outlook for the global economy is bleak in 2019, with most of the countries projected to slow down. The major threat facing the world economy is the increase in trade tensions between U.S. and China, which could lead to large disruptions in global value chains, outcome of Brexit and downside risk to China's growth. The lower global growth and the increased uncertainty about trade tensions may negatively affect export demand, including that of India's, which in turn will further lower GDP growth rates of several countries. 1.55 On balance, the prospects of the economy should improve with growth of the economy expected to be 7 per cent in 2019-20.

However, India was still the fastest growing major economy. \u00be This moderation in growth momentum is mainly on account of lower growth in 'Agriculture & allied', 'Trade, hotel, transport, storage, communication and services related to broadcasting' and 'Public administration & defence' sectors. \u00be\u0003 Growth in investment, which had slowed down for many years, has bottomed out and KDV\u0003VWDUWHG\u0003WR\u0003UHFRYHU\u0003VLQFH\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0014\u001a\u0010\u0014\u001b\u0011\u0003*URZWK\u0003LQ\u0003\u00bf[HG\u0003LQYHVWPHQW \u0003SLFNHG\u0003XS\u0003IURP\u0003\u001b\u0011\u0016\u0003SHU\u0003 cent in 2016-17 to 9.3 per cent in 2017-18 and further to percentage of Gross Advances reduced to 10.1 per cent at end December 2018 from 11.5 per cent at end March 2018. \u00be Outlook of Indian economy appears bright with prospects of pickup in growth in 2019- 20 on back of pick up in private investment and robust consumption growth. \u0015\u0016 State of the Economy in 2018-19: A Macro View ANNEX Table: Key data sources and indicators used for each sector during different stages of estimation1of GDP Sector 1st Revised Estimates 2nd Revised Estimates3rd Revised Estimates Agriculture Current price: Crops: Production: Fourth advance estimate for food grain production and third advance estimate/ \u00bfQDO\u0003HVWLPDWH\u0003 DV\u0003DYDLODEOH\u0003E\\\u0003-DQXDU\\ \u0003IRU\u0003area and production of horticulture crops, both published by Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare (MoAgFW).

Hence the king shall ever be active and discharge his duties; the root of wealth is activity, and of evil its reverse.\" -Kautilya's Arthasastra, Chapter XIX, 'The Duties of a King' in Book I, 'Concerning Discipline'. Tabled in the backdrop of an optimistic global scenario of the investment and trade cycle, Budget 2018-19 reiterated the objective of fiscal consolidation with introduction of a new fiscal targeting framework. Revenue augmentation and expenditure reprioritisation and rationalisation continue to be integral to fiscal reforms. Broadening and deepening the direct tax base and stabilisation of Goods and Services tax are the other priorities. Over the last six years, budgetary expenditure of the Central Government, as per cent of GDP , has seen considerable moderation with most of the reduction in the revenue expenditure.Total expenditure fell by 0.3 percentage points in 2018-19 P A (Provisional Actuals) over 2017-18, with 0.4 percentage points reduction in revenue expenditure and 0.1 percentage points increase in capital expenditure. Within revenue expenditure, major subsidies comprising food, fertiliser and petroleum continued their downward trend and have further declined by 0.1 percentage point of GDP in 2018-19 P A over 2017-18. Improving the quality of expenditure remains the key priority. Meeting allocational requirements without diversion from the newly revised fiscal glide path remains the foremost challenge. 2.1 Budget 2018-19 was presented in the backdrop of upswing in global investment and trade in the second half of 2017. The global growth was expected to continue its momentum in 2018.

Moreover, the monetary policy stance was changed to \"accommodative\" in June 2019. 3.5 During 2018-19, the growth rate of monetary aggregates reverted to their long-term trend after experiencing unusual behaviour in 2016-17 due to demonetisation and again in 2017-18 due to the process of remonetisation (Table 2). Reserve Money (M0) as on March 31, 2019, recorded a growth of 14.5 per cent over the previous year (Figure 1). On the component side, the expansion in M0 was mainly driven by Currency in Circulation (CiC).

Increase in net RBI credit to government was mainly from the recourse to open market operations (OMOs) undertaken during the year.

From the component side, the expansion in M3 during the year was broad-based, contributed by both currency and deposits. Deposits with the banking system, both demand and time, recorded acceleration in their growth leading to an increase in aggregate deposits by 9.6 per cent in 2018-19 vis-\u00e0-vis the 5.8 per cent during 2017-18 (Figure 3). Amongst sources, credit from scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) to the commercial sector primarily contributed to an increase in M3 during the year. Bank credit to government, mainly from RBI, also supplemented M3 expansion. 3.8 The money multiplier (M3/M0) expanded sharply between 1996 and 2003 and stabilizing thereafter till 2008.

The threat of promoters losing control of the company or protracted legal proceedings is forcing many corporate defaulters to pay off their debt even before the insolvency can be started. As on February 28, 2019, 6079 cases involving a total amount of R2.84 lakh crores have been withdrawn before admission under provisions of IBC (MCA). Further, as per RBI reports, R50,000 crore has been received by banks from previously non-performing accounts.

All these shows behavioural change for the wider lending ecosystem even before entering the IBC process.3.62 Section 12A, inserted in the IBC in 2018 allows companies to withdraw CIRP proceedings with the consent of 90 per cent of FCs. In less than a year's time, nearly 5 per cent of admitted cases (91 cases) have been withdrawn under Section 12A indicating an acceptable resolution being proposed by the corporate borrower. Out of the above, about 65 per cent cases were withdrawn on account of full/partial settlement with creditors and/or applicant 12. B.

The UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (Model Law) is the most widely accepted blueprint to effectively deal with cross-border insolvency issues while ensuring the least intrusion into each country's internal insolvency and bankruptcy laws. Most sophisticated economies have well-developed cross border \u001b\u0019 \u0007\u008c\u0098\u0097\u0098\u0096\u0092\u008c\u0015\u009e\u009b\u009f\u008e\u00a2 \u0018\u0098\u0095\u009e\u0096\u008e insolvency laws.

Group Insolvency 3.72 It is a common practice for commercial ventures to operate through groups of entities and for each entity in the group to have a separate legal personality. As long as a group of companies remains solvent, the fact the business is formally divided into several FRUSRUDWLRQV\u0003 LV\u0003 D\u0003 QRQ\u0010LVVXH\u0011\u0003 \u0003 +RZHYHU\u000f\u0003 LI\u0003one or more of the companies in the group become insolvent, treatment of such company or companies as separate legal personality or personalities raises a number of complex issues. Presently, the insolvency of different companies belonging to the same group is dealt with through separate insolvency proceedings for each company. A coherent approach can address information asymmetry, provide coordination and prevent delay and clogging up of insolvency infrastructure. 3.73 Recognising the need for a legal framework to deal with insolvency of group companies, the IBBI has recently set up a ZRUNLQJ\u0003JURXS\u0003XQGHU\u0003IRUPHU\u00036(%,\u0003&KDLUPDQ\u0003 Mr. U.

K. Malhotra, former law secretary, has been set up by the IBBI to recommend the strategy and approach for implementation of the provisions of IBC dealing with insolvency and bankruptcy of individuals.

Improving NCLT capacity 3.77 While 32 Members have been appointed to the NCLT recently and 6 additional posts have been sanctioned for NCLAT, the capacity of the NCLT and NCLAT will have to review from time to time and necessary infrastructure support provided. A centralized research wing can assist NCLT to stay abreast with the international best practices. This will be more crucial with the enactment of the Model Law. Although technology is being used to an extent by the NCLT and the IBBI, it is crucial to advance the application of technology to enhance case management by the NCLT for strict timekeeping of insolvency cases. Technology can also be used for data mining and analysis for constant review of the IBC impact on the ground.

The achievement of these goals is an imperative for, not just, any particular country but the global community as a whole. The need for global cooperation in helping the developing countries in achieving the climate targets cannot be overstated. India's development agenda has for long been based on principles that are closely related to those that have been propounded in the 2030 Development Agenda. Climate change requires concerted global efforts and India has been preserving to address the climate challenges along with other developmental imperatives. The country has been making substantial additions to its installation of renewable power capacity. Increasing growth rate and rapid urbanization in India have \"You know that India is one sixth of the global community. Our development needs are enormous. Our poverty or prosperity will have direct impact on the global poverty or prosperity. People in India have waited too long for access to modern amenities and means of development. We have committed to complete this task sooner than anticipated. However, we have also said that we will do all this in a cleaner and greener way\" - Prime Minister Narendra Modi (2018) In adoption of 2030 global agenda, the countries are moving forward for achieving a world free from poverty, gender inequality and economic inequality and thereby ensuring a healthy planet for future generations. These goals are multi-dimensional and integrate various social, economic and environmental dimensions. India continues to target and maintain its economic growth by introducing and implementing various policies and measures relating to VXVWDLQDEOH\u0003GHYHORSPHQW\u000f\u0003FOLPDWH\u0003FKDQJH\u000f\u0003UHVRXUFH\u0003HI\u00bfFLHQF\\\u0003DQG \u0003DLU\u0003SROOXWLRQ\u0011\u0003 India has been progressing rapidly towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With increasing demand for resources to cater to the different developmental needs, policies need to nudge economic agents towards achieving the maximum output from the available resources. Developing countries like India need to endeavor to do the best possible within their own domestic resources, keeping in mind the sustainable development imperatives. It is time for the global community to exhibit the requisite momentum to act upon their responsibilities on establishing the enabling environment for sustainable development and climate actions.\u0014\u0013\u0018 Sustainable Development and Climate Change spurred the demand for natural resources, exerting pressures on the environment and raising sustainability concerns.

Air pollution has emerged as a serious issue in India. National Clean Air Program (NCAP) has been launched by the Government as a pan-India, time bound, national level initiative to address the country-wide issues of air pollution in a comprehensive manner. ACHIEVING THE SDGs 5.2 The SDGs are global goals, built upon the erstwhile Millennium Development Goals. They are exhaustive, universal and integrated and emphasize on core areas of poverty and inequality, economic growth, innovation, sustainable consumption and production, climate change, peace and justice and partnerships. 5.3 Estimates suggest that US$5 to US$7 WULOOLRQ\u0003SHU\u0003\\HDU\u0003LV\u0003UHTXLUHG\u0003IRU\u0003\u00bfQDQFLQJ\u0003WKHVH\u0003goals worldwide and US$3.9 trillion per year in developing countries. However, the current investment in developing countries is around US$1.4 trillion leading to a shortfall of US$2.5 trillion per year (UNCTAD, 2014). Global action of this scale requires strong coordination between different governments, development institutions, private SDGs5.4 Sustainable development requires every nation to prioritize their targets and carefully implement various schemes/programmes in accordance with local challenges, capacities and available resources. India follows a holistic approach for achieving the SDGs by implementing a comprehensive array RI\u0003 VFKHPHV\u0011\u0003 &XUUHQW\u0003 \u00c0DJVKLS\u0003 DQG\u0003programmes contributed to India's progress in this regard. 5.5 In the federal context of India, programmes and schemes are basically implemented at the level of States and Union Territories. Tracking of progress on different SDGs, therefore, is important for appropriate policy actions and building up a competitive spirit among the States and UTs. NITI Aayog has come up with a single measurable index to track the progress of all the States and UTs across 13 out of 17 SDGs (excluding Goal 12, 13, 14 and 17 on account of unavailability of comparable data across States/UTs). This SDG index provides an aggregate assessment of India's progress. This index helps in informed policy formulations as it captures status of both national and state-level social, economic, and environmental parameters across a set of 62 select indicators. The score varies from 0 to 100. States with scores equal to/greater than 65 are considered as Front-Runners (in Green); as Performers (in Yellow) in the range of 50-64 and as Aspirants (in Red) if the score is less than 50. States with an index score of 100 DUH\u0003 FODVVL\u00bfHG\u0003 DV\u0003 Achievers (in Blue) i.e. the states have achieved the national target set for 2030. A score of 0 denotes worst performance. The SDG Index Score ranges between 42 and 69 for States and between 57 and 68 for UTs and is presented in Table 1 below.\u0014\u0013\u0019 Economic Survey 2018-19 V olume 2 Table1: Performance of States/UTs on each StatesSDG (End Poverty)SDG 2 (End 3 EducationSDG 5 Gender EqualitySDG 6 WaterSDG 7 EnergySDG 8 Eco GrowthSDG 9 Infrastructure and IndustrializationSDG 10 InequalitySDG 11 Resilient citiesSDG 15 Ecosystem and BiodiversitySDG 16 Institutions Andhra Pradesh 67 50 68 77 44 59 76 81 31 75 26 87 90 Arunachal Pradesh 52 58 38 44 32 64 44 72 16 47 44 73 77 Assam 53 53 30 54 36 42 18 61 35 75 32 100 53 Bihar 45 39 40 36 24 31 67 58 38 82 43 56 60 Chhattisgarh 50 46 42 53 49 98 36 56 30 73 54 100 65 Goa 62 80 65 71 35 65 61 90 0 50 71 100 87 Gujarat 48 49 52 67 31 100 67 80 65 79 52 71 73 Haryana 50 53 57 65 31 80 50 72 50 55 30 43 78 Himachal Pradesh 60 58 62 82 42 95 62 71 43 98 41 93 91 Jammu & Kashmir 61 60 53 51 39 52 58 43 35 71 23 74 69 Jharkhand 37 35 40 58 32 51 20 52 47 72 52 96 64 Karnataka 52 54 69 76 43 62 77 72 57 68 36 88 74 Kerala 66 72 92 87 50 62 60 61 68 72 46 75 82 Madhya Pradesh 44 41 38 49 33 63 58 57 27 75 39 91 59 Maharashtra 47 47 60 74 43 81 69 74 53 76 34 86 82 Manipur 44 74 67 65 25 44 39 33 72 98 31 100 70 Meghalaya 68 43 52 38 36 40 11 62 42 100 39 94 53 Mizoram 71 69 53 54 43 67 78 65 0 100 32 69 71 Nagaland 59 69 34 45 42 58 45 40 0 80 32 75 87 Odisha 59 46 54 46 43 46 23 53 32 78 34 100 55 Punjab 56 71 71 63 43 60 61 57 48 62 36 67 84 Rajasthan 59 45 49 73 37 43 63 57 62 79 45 68 81 Sikkim 64 67 52 47 50 78 47 57 1 67 56 98 66 Tamil Nadu 76 61 77 75 38 66 89 71 46 85 33 74 61 Telangana 52 53 73 66 43 55 63 75 16 100 44 83 66 Tripura 71 58 53 56 38 38 32 52 38 89 38 86 71 UttarPradesh48 43 25 53 27 55 23 55 29 38 37 55 61 Uttarakhand 65 53 36 68 41 78 55 67 33 62 41 100 86 West Bengal 57 50 66 51 40 54 40 63 45 76 25 88 72 A & N Islands 57 38 60 69 58 71 56 60 0 69 64 84 72 Chandigarh 39 70 23 85 51 100 96 82 76 52 40 83 90 Daman & Diu 58 42 47 46 38 99 84 91 0 100 49 84 79 D&N Haveli 21 40 32 77 41 100 73 84 0 100 6 100 63 Delhi 30 72 47 58 37 62 51 86 100 80 39 77 68 Lakshadweep 43 47 64 62 35 100 60 60 0 100 Null 100 74 Puducherry 61 71 66 69 27 45 61 85 100 94 27 50 92 India 54 48 52 58 36 63 51 65 44 71 39 90 71 Source: NITI Aayog's SDG India Index Baseline Report, 2018\u0014\u0013\u001a Sustainable Development and Climate Change 5.6 India's growth trajectory for achieving SDG 10 (Reduced Inequality) and SDG 15 (Life on Land) is impressive as compared to the other SDGs as several states have achieved 100 in these SDGs. This may be due to performance in worthy initiatives such as PMJDY , Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), the National Environment Policy, National Agro-forestry Policy and Green Highways Policy. India is struggling to achieve its targets of SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) as large number of states are in the 'Aspirants' category'. Goa, a front runner among all the States and UTs in SDG 11, has been doing exceptionally well in waste management. 5.7 NITI Aayog has also developed a composite index for each State/UT which aggregates progress towards each SDG. Kerala and Himachal Pradesh are the front runners amongst all the states with a score of 69. Tamil Nadu is also Figure 1: Performance of States and UTs on SDG Composite India Index 696968666564646464646362626160605959595858585756555553525251515150494842 0 2 04 06 Baseline Report, 2018\u0014\u0013\u001b Economic Survey 2018-19 V olume 2 progressing very fast. Among the UTs, Chandigarh and Puducherry are the front runners with a score of 68 and 65 respectively (Figure 1). Kerala's good performance is attributable to the provision of good health, reducing hunger, achieving gender equality and providing quality education. Himachal Pradesh has performed well on providing clean water and sanitation along with reducing inequalities and preserving mountain ecosystem. Chandigarh, among other UTs, has performed well in providing clean water and sanitation along with affordable clean energy and quality education. 5.8 A close collaboration between the national and sub-national governments as well as active participation of all other relevant stakeholders are required for meeting WKH\u0003FKDOOHQJHV\u0003RI\u0003\u00bfQDQFLQJ\u000f\u0003WHFKQLFDO\u0003VXSSRUW\u0003and continuous monitoring of the progress of each state and UT to achieve the National Sustainable Development Agenda. GANGA - THE LIFELINE OF INDIA 5.9 A key policy priority of the Government towards achieving the SDG 6 (Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all) has been the cleanliness of mighty River Ganga through Namami Gange Mission. The mission was launched as a priority programme with a budget outlay of `20,000 crore for the period 2015-2020. During the period 2014-15 to 2018-19, a total amount of `6,106.25 crore has been spent on the programme indicating a substantial jump over earlier similar programmes (Figure 2). 5.10 For effective implementation and proper synchronization with the State and Local Bodies, National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) was empowered as an Authority under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for fast track implementation and to Source: National Mission for Clean Ganga 1RWH \u00037KH\u0003\u00bfJXUH\u0003IRU\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0014 National Mission for Clean Ganga (Actual Expenditure in `crore) formulate policies for long term sustainability of the Ganga rejuvenation efforts. Major Components of Namami Gange Mission i. Sewerage Project Management: For sewerage projects, the policy decision to use Public-Private Partnership (PPP) approach of Hybrid Annuity Mode (HAM) and 15 years long-term Operation & Maintenance (O&M) included in the project cost and improved governance through 'One City One Operator' approach ensured competitive and positive market participation along with synergy in implementation. ii.

The Mission extended a comprehensive coverage of these cities with construction and rehabilitation of Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) for a prospective year of 2035, inception and diversion of drains, solid waste management through cleanliness drives on ghats and deployment of skimmers for river surface cleaning . iii. Sewerage Infrastructure: 150 sewerage projects (111 on Ganga stem & 39 in\u0014\u0013 Sustainable Development and Climate Change tributaries) at sanctioned cost of `23,130.95 crore has been approved for creation of new STP capacity of 3,729.92 Millions of Litres per day (MLD), 1,114.39 MLD rehabilitated STP capacity and laying of around 4,972.35 km sewerage networks (Figure 3). As of May 2019, 43 of these projects have been completed, which has resulted in laying of 2,645.6 km sewer networks and of 575.84 MLD of STP capacities in Ganga basin (Figure 4). iv.

Estimates suggest that US$1 billion worth of gold can be extracted with mining of urban e-waste. Effective waste management policies can generate 14 lakh jobs and nearly US$2.7 billion opportunity can be created from the extraction of eight million tonnes of steel from the end of life vehicles (TERI, 2019). Table 3 highlights the contribution to the national income of different sectors in the economy, their consumption base of raw materials and import dependency. 5.16 Indian auto industry is fourth largest in the world (TERI, 2019) and India's transport sector is being dominated by internal combustion engine (ICE) based vehicles. Studies estimate that Indian auto industry will consume around 70-80 million tonnes of iron and steel by 2030 which is around 70-80 per cent of the total steel production capacity in India. As India has a fragmented process of scrap collection, nearly 6-7 million tonnes per annum of steel scrap are being imported. Research suggest around 2,18,95,439 vehicles will reach End of Life by 2025 which would generate more than 10 million tonnes of steel scrap (TERI, 2019). 5.17 India consumed nearly 14.5 million tonnes of plastic in 2016 (TERI, 2019).

A great potential exists for RE in this sector by utilizing recycling opportunities that exist. It is estimated that the steel production in India will reach 128.6 Million Tonnes (MT) by 2021 and its consumption will increase to 140 MT by 2023. Thus, there is a need to augment the steel production capacity to 300 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) from 125 MTPA by 2030-31 which will require `10 lakh crore of investment.

Air pollution is a serious issue in India also. Government is executing National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP) covering 312 cities/towns in 29 states and 6 Union Territories of the country. Under NAMP, four major air pollutants viz. Sulphur Dioxide (SO 2), Oxides of Nitrogen as NO2, Suspended Particulate Matter (PM10) and Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) have been LGHQWL\u00bfHG\u0003IRU\u0003UHJXODU\u0003PRQLWRULQJ\u0003DW\u0003DOO\u0003WKH\u0003locations. The smaller PM 2.5is particularly deadly as it can penetrate deeper into the lungs. For PM 2.5, as per the available statistics in year 2017, few cities have been selected to show the concentration of various pollutants from 2015-17. Figure 8, 9, 10, and 11 shows the concentration of SO 2, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 for the selected cities from 2015 to 2017. Figure 8: SO2Concentrations in Major Cities Figure Initiatives 5.21 To tackle the increasing air pollution problem across the country in a comprehensive manner, a number of initiatives have been launched. National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) are the standards for ambient air quality with reference to various LGHQWL\u00bfHG\u0003SROOXWDQW\u0003QRWL\u00bfHG\u0003E\\\u0003WKH\u0003&3&%\u0003XQGHU\u0003 the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. Major objectives of NAAQS are (i) to indicate necessary air quality levels and appropriate margins required to ensure the protection of vegetation, health and property (ii) to provide a uniform yardstick for \u0014\u0014 Sustainable Development and Climate Change assessment of air quality at the national level. 5.22 Air Quality Index (AQI) is a tool for effective communication of air quality status to people in terms, which are easy to understand. It transforms complex air quality data of various pollutants into a single number (index value), nomenclature and colour. There are six AQI categories, namely - Good, Satisfactory, Moderately Polluted, Poor, Very Poor and Severe. 5.23 CPCB has issued a comprehensive set of directions under section 18 (1) (b) of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1986 for implementation of forty-two measures to mitigate air pollution in major cities including Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR) comprising of action points to counter air pollution which include control and mitigation measures related to vehicular emissions, re-suspension of road dust and other fugitive emissions, bio-mass/municipal solid waste burning, industrial pollution, construction and demolition activities and other general steps. \u0018\u0011\u0015\u0017\u0003 7KH\u0003*RYHUQPHQW\u0003KDV\u0003QRWL\u00bfHG\u0003D\u0003*UDGHG\u0003 Response Action Plan for Delhi and NCR, which comprises of the graded measures for each source framed according to the AQI categories.

CLIMATE CHANGE 5.26 Since the adoption of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, the global community has strengthened the response mechanisms to the threat of climate change through various milestones. The journey since then witnessed the adoption of various related instruments to address climate change including the adoption of Kyoto Protocol in 1997 and the latest most ambitious one being the Paris Agreement. The ultimate objective of UNFCCC is to stabilize GHG concentration in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development. The main aim of the Paris Agreement is to hold the increase in the global average temperature well below 2 oC above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 oC above pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement sets a roadmap for all nations in the world to take actions against climate change in the post-2020 period. 5.27 Human anthropogenic activities have raised the global average temperature. As per the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global warming of 1.5 oC, human-induced warming reached approximately 1\u00b0C (likely between 0.8\u00b0C and 1.2\u00b0C) above pre-industrial levels in increasing at (likely 0.1\u00b0C olume 2 SHU\u0003GHFDGH\u0003 KLJK\u0003FRQ\u00bfGHQFH \u0011\u00037KH\u0003UHSRUW\u0003KDV\u0003 warned of a warmer planet and has raised the demand for unprecedented efforts to reduce GHG emissions.

The report shows that emission intensity of India's GDP came down by 21 per cent between 2005 & 2014 and its achievement of climate goal for pre-2020 period is on track. A total of 2.607 billion tons of CO 2 equivalent of GHGs were emitted from all activities (excluding Land use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF)) in India. Energy sector accounted for 73 per cent, Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) 8 per cent, agriculture 16 per cent and waste sector 3 per cent. About 12 per cent of emissions were offset by the carbon sink action of forestland, cropland and settlements (Table 4).\u0014\u0015\u0014 Sustainable Development and Climate Change Katowice Climate Package 5.30 Parties to the Paris Agreement made concerted efforts to develop the modalities, procedures and guidelines for implementing the Agreement and the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) was adopted at the 24 th session of the UNFCCC Climate Change Conference, held from 2 to 15 December in 2018 in Katowice, Poland.

The World Economic Outlook (WEO) in its April 2019 issue has projected growth in world output at 3.3 per cent in 2019, down from 3.6 per cent obtained in 2018. Heightened US-China trade tensions has been stated as one of the reasons behind the global slowdown that has spilled into other economies including India through the channel of exports. Beginning 2019 global slowdown has made advanced countries persist with their accommodative monetary policy stance. This has escalated portfolio investment into emerging market economies making their currencies stronger and imports cheaper. 6.2 The WEO further states that growing trade protectionism in the world, of which US-China trade tensions is the most recent India' s macroeconomic situation on the external side continues to be stable. Though the olume 2 manifestation, places at risk the low relative price of machinery and equipment that over the years has declined, partly due to increasing trade integration, and supported the rise in real investment rate in developing FRXQWULHV\u0011\u00037KH\u0003:(2\u0003DOVR\u0003FODUL\u00bfHV\u0003WKDW\u0003WUDGH\u0010protectionism will only divert bi-lateral trade imbalances from one WEO accordingly advises that at the multi-lateral level, the main priority is for countries to resolve trade disagreements cooperatively, without raising distortionary barriers that would further destabilize a slowing global economy. It seems countries are well advised to do so as beginning 2019, crude oil prices have begun to harden following production cuts by oil exporting countries with the US also cutting out oil supplies from Iran, while prices of other commodities have also risen due to supply distortions. These developments increase the vulnerability of external sector of emerging market economies like India, which are dependent on crude imports for fueling their economic growth. 6.4 In its April 2019 Press Release, WTO has also stated that world trade growth in 2018 at 3 per cent has been much below the growth rate of 4.6 per cent in 2017 following the introduction of new and retaliatory measures around the world that by affecting widely-traded goods has caused weaker global HFRQRPLF\u0003JURZWK\u0003DQG\u0003YRODWLOLW\\\u0003LQ\u0003\u00bfQDQFLDO\u0003markets.

World commercial services on the other hand recorded a strong growth of 7.7 per cent in 2018 but was still lower than 8.4 per cent in 2017. However, goods related services growth shot up to 10.6 per cent in 2018, up from 8.3 per cent in the previous year. 6.5 Along with the slowing down of world trade seen in 2018 there has been a spatial shift in the nature of BoP balances as well in the last few years.

INDIA'S BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DEVELOPMENTS Overview of Balance of PaymentsCurrent Account Developments 6.7 India's balance of payment situation showed some signs of stress during H1 of 2018-19 as sharp rise in crude oil prices caused current account GH\u00bfFLW (CAD) to deteriorate. However, CAD moderated somewhat in Q3-2018-19 as international crude oil prices eased. Until end of Q3 for which data is available (April-December 2018-19), India's CAD stood at US$51.9 billion (2.6 per cent of GDP) as compared to US$35.7 billion (1.8 per cent of GDP) a year ago for the same period. The widening of the CAD was largely on account of a higher trade GH\u00bfFLW driven by rise in international crude oil prices (Indian basket) making merchandise imports grow relatively faster than exports. The trade GH\u00bfFLW increased to US$145.3 billion during the same period from US$118.4 billion in the corresponding period of previous year. 6.8 India's CAD has been increasing for some years now after attaining a high of 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2016-17. It increased to 1.8 per cent of GDP in 2017-18 and has been projected at 2.4 per cent for the full year of 2018-19.

Annual growth rate of merchandise imports also fell from 21.1 per cent in 2017-18 to 10.4 per cent in 2018-19.

However, from Q1 of 2018-19, the growth rate of POL exports has been declining continuously and turned negative in Q4. Be that as it may, petroleum products continue to have the largest share in India's export basket at 14.1 per cent in 2018-19. 6.12 The growth in merchandise imports from 0.9 per cent in 2016-17 to 10.4 per cent in 2018-19 can also be attributed to a sharp rise in growth rate of POL imports from 4.8 per cent in 2016-17 to 29.7 per cent in 2018-19. The non-POL imports also increased from -0.2 per cent in 2016-17 to 4.5 per cent in 2018-19 (Figure 6), possibly depicting a downturn in the economy. This appears to be all the more so as in Q4 of 2018-19 both POL and Non-POL imports registered negative growth rate. Even then, Crude petroleum continues to be the largest imported commodity in 2018-19 with a share of 22.2 5.2 per cent respectively, in the import basket.

The acceleration in growth of POL imports from 2016-17 to 2018-19 was on account of both price increase in the international market and volume consumed by India. However, growth of POL exports was only driven by price rise as volume exported by India actually contracted from \u0015\u0013\u0014\u0019\u0010\u0014\u001a\u0003WR\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0014\u001b\u0010\u0014 \u0011\u00037KLV\u0003UH\u00c0HFWV\u0003WKDW\u0003,QGLD\u0003is more dependent on POL imports than the world is on India's POL exports. 6.14 Within Non-POL imports, sharp movements can be seen with respect to annual growth rates of gold and silver imports, which increased from -17.3 per cent in 2016-17 to 25.6 per cent in 2017-18, and then reduced to -0.6 per cent in 2018-19.

The level of foreign exchange reserves can change due to change in reserves on BoP basis as well as valuation changes in the assets held by the Reserve Bank of India. The foreign exchange reserves in nominal terms (including the valuation effects) decreased by US$29.0 billion during April-December 2018 as against an increase of US$39.1 billion during the same period of the preceding year. However, on a balance of payments basis (i.e., excluding valuation effects), the foreign exchange reserves decreased by US$17.5 billion during April-December 2018 as against an increase of US$30.3 billion during the corresponding period of the same year. 7KH\u0003 YDOXDWLRQ\u0003 ORVV\u000f\u0003 PDLQO\\\u0003 UH\u00c0HFWLQJ\u0003 WKH\u0003appreciation of the US dollar against major currencies, of US$11.5 billion during April-December 2018 followed a valuation gain of US$8.8 billion during the same period of the preceding year.

This constancy of share has been in evidence since 2014. Short term debt grew by 1.7 per cent in end-December 2018 compared to end-March 2018, primarily due to increase in trade related credits. 6.23 Foreign Exchange cover to total external debt deteriorated to 75.5 per cent at end-December 2018 from 80.2 per cent at end-March 2018, with the ratio of short term debt by original maturity to foreign exchange reserves rising to 26.4 per cent in end-December 2018 from 24.1 per cent at end-March 2018 (Figure 15).

Terms of Trade 6.44 While depreciation of REER indicates that India's exports must have become more competitive, appreciation of REER indicates less competitive exports. Price competitiveness of exports can however be better assessed by looking at how Terms of Trade (ToT) have fared across a time period.Commodity or net terms of trade (NTT) of a country is the ratio of the unit value (price) of export to the corresponding unit value (price) of import measured relative to a base year. If this ratio increases, it implies that the country, for every unit of exports it exchanges for LPSRUWV\u000f\u0003LV\u0003UHFHLYLQJ\u0003UHODWLYHO\\\u0003PRUH \u0003LI\u0003WKH\u0003ratio decreases then the country is receiving relatively less. Two other commonly used terms of trade indices are gross terms of trade (GTT) and income terms of trade (ITT). The GTT is a ratio of total quantity of imports to that of exports of a given country. The ITT is the value of exports divided by the XQLW\u0003YDOXH\u0003 SULFH \u0003RI\u0003LPSRUWV\u0003WR\u0003UH\u00c0HFW\u0003KRZ\u0003better or worse a country's purchasing power to imports has become. Figure 29 plots the movement in these three indices from 1999-2000 to 2018-19. Compared to 2017-18, India's NTT and GTT have declined by 8.9 per cent and 2.1 per cent during 2018-19 respectively while income terms of trade have increased by 3.4 per cent. However, all indices of terms of trade have been on an upward trend since 2015-16.Figure 28: Net Foreign Portfolio Investment data of Reserve Bank of India.\u0014\u0018\u0014 External Sector 6.45 ITT comes out to be the most relevant ToT indicator for developing countries as they are more worried about changes in their capacity to import particularly when they are heavily dependent on commodity imports, such as India being dependent on crude imports. With a rising trend of ITT since the year 2000, India has been steadily increasing its purchasing power to import. In order to understand what drives the changes in ITT, Figure 30 decomposes change in ITT in terms of changes in NTT and export quantity LQGH[\u0003IRU\u0003$SULO\u0010-DQXDU\\\u000f\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0014\u001b\u0010\u0014 \u0011\u00037KH\u0003\u00bfJXUH\u0003UH\u00c0HFWV\u0003WKDW\u0003FKDQJHV\u0003LQ\u0003,77\u0003DUH\u0003PRUH\u0003FORVHO\\\u0003tracked by changes in export volume than by changes in relative unit prices of export and imports. Since increase in export volumes is directly correlated with increase in growth of world output, a slow-down in world output has eroded the capacity to import during April-January of 2018-19 even when import prices of India have declined faster than the country's export prices. Perhaps it would take a much larger drop in import prices to counter-balance the slow-down of world output to generate a positive ITT effect for the country.Figure 29: Terms of Trade (Base Year 1999-2000) \u0003 050100150200250300 Gross Net Income Source: DGCI&S, available till Q3 of 2018-19 Figure 30: Decomposition of change in Income Terms of Trade, 2018-19 -10-5051015202530 Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec JanMonth on Month % change in 2018-19 over 2017-18 Net terms of trade Export Quantity Index Income terms of trade Source: Based on data of DGCI&S, Kolkata.

The development strategy for agriculture should prioritise smallholder agriculture in order to promote sustainable livelihoods and for reduction of poverty in India.

If credit is not available to purchase seeds at the time of sowing, or if lack of credit delays the administering of fertilizers, it can severely impact agricultural productivity. The regional distribution of agricultural credit in India (Figure 9) shows that the distribution of credit is highly skewed. It is seen that the distribution of agricultural credit is low in North Eastern, Hilly and Eastern States. The share of North Eastern States has been less than one per cent in total agricultural credit disbursement.

According to the 19 th Livestock Census, India has vast resource of livestock comprising about 300 million bovines, 65.1 million sheep, 135.2 million goats and 10.3 million pigs. Livestock farming in India is part of a composite farming system characterized by crop-livestock interactions. The by-products from several of the crops (crop residues, hay and straw) are used as input for dairy production, in addition to other inputs for which they have to directly incur costs (cattle feed, veterinary medicines DQG\u0003DUWL\u00bfFLDO\u0003LQVHPLQDWLRQ \u0011\u0003$QLPDO\u0003GXQJ\u0003DQG\u0003urine are used as inputs (bio-fertilizers and bio pesticides) by farmers to improve soil fertility.

But there exists wide inter-state variability in milk production (Figure 10). The per capita availability of milk is determined by the production of milk in the State.

There are three key drivers of increasing milk demand viz; (i) population growth (ii) urbanization and (iii) income growth which leads to an increase in the price of milk 10. 7.38 Of the total milk produced in rural areas around 52 per cent is the marketable surplus. Of this surplus less than half of the milk sold is handled by the organized sector comprising of dairy cooperatives and private dairy companies and the rest by the unorganized sector. Small Ruminant Sector 7.39 As per the 70th round of NSSO, livestock rearing was the principal source of income to about 3.7 per cent of the agricultural households. Sheep and goat are collectively known as small ruminants. India supports 16.1 per cent of the world's goat population and 6.4 per cent of its sheep (Food & Agriculture Organisation). Nationally, total livestock population is 512.1 million, of which goat and sheep population stands at 200 million (39 per cent of the country's total livestock population). Sheep/Goat rearing is practiced mainly by resource-poor families and is a supplementary source of income for farmers during lean seasons especially for marginal, women and landless farmers. 7.40 Small ruminants have higher survival rates conditions compared WR\u0003 ODUJH\u0003 UXPLQDQWV\u0011\u0003 0RUHRYHU\u000f\u0003 QXPEHUV\u0003 FDQ\u0003 EH\u0003 restored more rapidly.

The Government has initiated a number of measures in crucial sectors to accelerate higher manufacturing growth such as Start-up India, Ease of doing Business, Make in India, Foreign Direct Investment Policy reforms.

Its growth rate moderated to 7.5 per cent in 2018-19 from 8.1 per cent in 2017-18. The segments that saw deceleration are tourism, trade, hotels, transport, communication and services related to broadcasting, public administration and defence. Financial, real estate and professional services category accelerated. An important finding is that India' s services sector does not generate jobs in proportion to its share in GVA. This contrasts with the international experience. India received 10.6 million foreign tourists in 2018-19 compared to 10.4 million in 2017-18. Foreign exchange earnings from tourism in India stood at US$27.7 billion in 2018-19 compared to US$28.7 billion in 2017-18. Many of the high frequency indicators, such as bank credit to services sector, decelerated in 2018-19. However, the IT-BPM industry grew by 8.4 per cent in 2017-18 to US$167 billion and is estimated to have reached US$181 billion in 2018-19.

This was due to a deceleration in the sub-sectors 'trade, hotels, transport, communication & broadcasting services' to 6.9 per cent and 'public administration and defence & others services' to 8.6 per cent in 2018-19.

Over the last few years, efforts in this direction have been accelerated by the Government through the mantra of inclusiveness 'Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas', further elaborated by ensuring 'Sabka Vishwas'. As India is a developing economy with resource constraints, we have to prioritize and optimize the expenditure on social infrastructure to promote sustainable and inclusive growth. It is critical at this juncture to focus on public investments in human capital and strengthen the delivery mechanisms of government interventions to ensure transparency and accountability. With India having the demographic advantage, improving educational standards, skilling the youth, enhancing job opportunities, reducing disease burden and empowering women will help in realizing the potential of a buoyant economy in the future. 1\u0003)LUVW\u0003IHPDOH\u00033ULPH\u00030LQLVWHU\u0003RI\u00031RUZD\\\u0011\u0003%UXQGWODQG\u0003&RPPLVVLRQ\u0003V XEPLWWHG\u0003LWV\u0003UHSRUW\u0003\u00b52XU\u0003&RPPRQ\u0003)XWXUH\u00b6\u0003ZKLFK\u0003EURXJKW\u0003WKH\u0003 FRQFHSW\u0003RI\u00036XVWDLQDEOH\u0003'HYHORSPHQW\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003JOREDO\u0003DJHQGD\u0011\u0003\u0015\u0018\u0015 Economic Survey 2018-19 \u0003KDV\u0003LPSURYHG\u0003VLJQL\u00bfFDQWO\\\u0003RYHU\u0003WKH\u0003\\HDUV\u0003EHWZHHQ\u0003\u0014 atDGGUHVVLQJ\u0003JOREDO\u0003FKDOOHQJHV\u0011\u00037R\u0003PHDVXUH\u0003 ,QGLD\u00b6V\u0003SHUIRUPDQFH\u0003LQ\u00036'*\u00b6V\u000f\u00031,7,\u0003$D\\RJ\u0003has developed the SDG India Index for all States and UTs.
