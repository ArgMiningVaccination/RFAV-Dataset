Copyright \u00a9 2002 National Science Council, ROC and S. Karger AG, Basel Introduction Autism is an early-onset disorder of the developing central nervous system (CNS), the etiology and pathogen-esis of which is not known. The disorder causes severedeficits of higher mental functions such as social interac-tion, language, communication, imagination and cogni-tion. While autism affects over one half of a millionAmericans and many more worldwide, very little isknown about the etiology and pathogenesis of the disor-der. Current theories include genetic factors, immune fac-tors, environmental factors, neural factors and yet otherunidentified factors. Owing to faulty immune regulationin autistic children [10, 12, 16, 21, 23], we focused ourattention on autoimmune mechanism of pathogenesis forautism [14-17, 19, 20]. Because autoimmune diseases aregenerally suspected of being triggered by viruses, werecently studied virus serology in autism [15, 17]. We360 J Biomed Sci 2002;9:359-364 Singh/Lin/Newell/Nelsonfound that many children with autism had elevated levels of antibodies to measles virus (MV) but not of antibodiesto human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), cytomegalovirus orrubella virus (RV). Moreover, the elevated level of mea-sles antibodies was strongly associated with brain autoan-tibodies, which led us to postulate a pathogenetic associa-tion of MV to autoimmunity in autism [15, 17]. To fur-ther determine the source of this measles infection, weexplored the possibility of an abnormal or inappropriateantibody response to MMR in relation to CNS autoim-munity. As described here, several children with autismhave unusual MMR antibodies that showed a temporalassociation with myelin basic protein (MBP) autoanti-bodies that was used as a marker of CNS autoimmunity inautism. Materials and Methods We conducted a laboratory study of MMR antibodies and MBP autoantibodies in sera of autistic and control children. Since thisstudy was an extension of our ongoing research, we used previouslycollected serum samples that were stored frozen at -20 \u00b0C [14-17]. The study included a total of 217 children: 125 autistic children (aged4-10 years) and 92 control children (58 normal children aged 5-13years, 6 normal siblings aged 6-9 years, and 28 other disease childrenaged 4-12 years with behavioral disturbances other than autism).The immunization records showed that all children had their MMRimmunization but none had any history of a rash or wild-type MVinfection. The clinical diagnosis of autism was made essentiallyaccording to the standard DSM-IIIR criteria of the American Asso-ciation of Psychiatrists, Washington, D.C., USA, as previouslydescribed [14-17]. The study included children with a firm diagnosisof autism only. The Institutional Review Board reviewed andapproved our research protocol that involved the use of humanserum samples only. At the time of blood sampling or a minimum of2 weeks before the blood drawing, none of the patients or controlswas taking any prescription medications such as antipsychotic orneuroleptic drugs. The MMR antibodies were detected initially byenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for titration,but afterwards they by immunoblotting assay forserum screening. In each assay method, the Measles-Mumps-Rubella(MMR)-II Vaccine (Merck, West Point, Pa., USA) was used as theantigen. Autoantibodies to brain MBP (Upstate Biotechnology, LakePlacid, N.Y., USA) were detected by immunoblotting as routinelyperformed in our laboratory. All immunoassays were developed in-house, simply because of the unique nature of the study and becausethey are presently not available from any commercial source. The MMR antibody ELISA was adapted from our previous ELISA method [18]. Briefly, the microwells of a Costar microtiterplate (Corning, Corning, N.Y., USA) were coated with MMR antigendissolved in PBS buffer, pH 7.4. The plate was washed three timeswith PBS-Tween (0.05%) buffer. 100 \u00ccl/well of PBS buffer in the blank microwells or human serum, prediluted to four were pipetted. The platewas incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After three washings withPBS-Tween buffer, 100 \u00ccl/well of 1:500-diluted goat anti-human- IgG-alkaline phosphatase (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., USA) were pipet-ted. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The platewas washed three times again, followed by the addition of 100 \u00ccl/well of a substrate solution (1 mg/ml of p-nitrophenylphosphate in 50 m M sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, containing 1 m M magnesium chloride). The color reaction was stopped with 20 \u00ccl/well of 1 N NaOH and the plate was read at 405 nm using a Microplate Readermodel 3550 (Bio-Rad, Richmond, Calif., USA). After blank subtrac-tion, the absorbance readings were converted to arbitrarily definedEIA units (0.01 OD = 1 EIA unit). Immunoblotting assay was performed essentially according to our published method [17, 20] with MMR or MBP as the screeningantigen Briefly, nitrocellulose by with bovine serum albumin inTBS buffer. The membranes were room tem-perature. For immunoassay, narrow blots (3-4 mm wide) were incu-bated with appropriately diluted patient or control sera for 1 h. Afterfour washings with TBST (TBS buffer containing 0.05% blots were developed in substrate solutionaccording to instructions from the manufacturer of the AP substratekit (Bio-Rad). A reaction was scored positive only if a purplish-blueband was visualized. In some experiments, the presence of viral pro-teins in MMR blots was detected with monoclonal antibodies to (HA), MV nucleoprotein (MV-NP), RV or MuV(Chemicon International, Temecula, im-munodetection with goat anti-mouse-IgG-alkaline phosphatase; allother assay conditions were the same as aforementioned. For molec-ular weight determination, we simultaneously ran prestained SDS-PAGE protein standards (Bio-Rad) that included aprotinin (7.5 kD). Results At first, it is important to point out that we chose to use MMR as the screening antigen, simply because it is theimmunizing antigen when children are vaccinated withMMR vaccine. Therefore, the antibodies to MMR will bea true measure of seroconversion for this triple or polyval-ent vaccine, instead of antibodies to measles, mumps orrubella viral proteins that are individually used for mea-suring virus serology in routine practice. Initially, to studythe effect of serum dilution, the MMR antibody level wasmeasured by ELISA in sera of randomly selected 24 autis-tic children, 14 normal children and 16 other childrenwith conditions besides autism. As quantified by ELISA,the serum level of MMR antibodies is summarized in fig-ure 1. Autistic children, at each of the four serum dilu-MMR-Autoimmunity in Autism J Biomed Sci 2002;9:359-364 361Fig. 1. ELISA detection of MMR antibodies in autism. At various serum dilutions, theMMR antibody levels are shown for autisticchildren (n = 24, solid circles, top line), nor-mal children (n = 14, solid squares, middleline), and other disease children (n = 16, sol-id triangles, bottom line). Statistically, asevaluated by Student's t test, the MMR anti-body level was significantly increased in au-tistic children. Data are shown as means B SE. tions tested, had a significantly higher level of MMR anti- bodies when compared to normal children or other dis-ease children. The greatest increase (over 7-fold) wasobserved at 1:50 dilution of autistic sera. The ELISAmethod was used mainly to determine a suitable screen-ing dilution of serum that was found to be a 1:50 dilution.Subsequently, all sera were screened at this serum dilutionby the immunoblotting method because this method per-mits the analysis of proteins to which antibodies specifi-cally bind to, and that was the primary objective of thisstudy. Immunoblotting analysis of all 217 sera revealed that 75 out of 125 autistic sera, but none of the 92 control sera,had antibodies to MMR and MBP. As shown in figure 2,autistic sera showed an immunopositive reaction to a pro-tein band of 73-75 kD in the MMR blot (fig. 2, lane B)but control sera did not show this reaction (fig. 2, lane A);no other protein band was immunopositive in this assay.Moreover, the same protein band showedan immunopositive reaction to MV-HA monoclonal left lanes) but not to MV-NP monoclonalantibodies (fig. 3, right lanes). The MMR blots wereimmunonegative for monclonal antibodies to RV or MuV(fig. 4). Consistent with previous reports [5, 15, 19, 20],autistic sera contained autoantibodies to 18.5- to 20-kDMBP (fig. 2, lane D), which is the known molecularweight of the authentic bovine brain MBP used in thisstudy. The control sera were negative for MBP autoanti-bodies (fig. 2, lane C).Based on immunoblotting data analysis, we found that 75 out of 125 (60%) autistic children were positive forMMR antibodies whereas 70 out of 125 (56%) autisticchildren had MBP autoantibodies (fig. 5). Neither of thesetwo types of antibodies was detected in control children(normal children and other disease children). Further-more, according to our immunoblotting data analysis, theautistic group showed an intriguing correlation betweenMMR and i.e. autoantibodies (fig. 5). This correlation wasabsent in the control group because the children in thisgroup were negative for MMR antibodies as well as MBPautoantibodies. Discussion Several studies worldwide have suggested that immune factors such as autoimmunity may play a critical role inthe pathogenesis of autism [10, 12, 14-17, 19, for immunogenetic susceptibility factors [24]and family clustering of autoimmune diseases amongstfamilies with autistic (NK) cells 12, of MMR antibodies and MBP autoantibodies. As described in the text, proteins in MMR and MBPblots were incubated with autistic anti-human polyvalent immu-noglobulins. Note that the sera (lanes B and D), but not thecontrol sera (lanes A and C), showed antibody-positive reactions with73- to 75-kD protein in the MMR blot and 18.5- MMR pro-tein band (Rf = migrated slightly faster than the bovineserum albumin (Rf = 16.4 mm) when compared to other prestainedprotein standards (Cat.

Many autisticchildren Furthermore, a considerable number of autistic chil-dren show significant improvements of autistic character-istics when treated with immune therapy such as oralautoantigen [15], immunoglobulin [7] ortransfer factor [5]. Collectively, abnormali-ties and/or immune therapies are consistent with anautoimmune basis of pathogenesis in autism. Viruses are commonly associated with autoimmune diseases, albeit the paucity of experimental evidence. Thetrigger mechanism for autoimmunity in autism is notknown but viral associations have been described [2, 8].Autistic children harbor significantly higher than normallevels of measles but not of [15, 17]. The specific increaseof measles antibody level was also consistent with a sero-logical association between MV and autoimmunity inautism, which led us to postulate an etiological link of MV with autism [15, 17]. As reported here, a significantincrease of MMR antibody level was found in autisticchildren. Moreover, the MMR antibody showed immu-nopositive reaction to a 73- to 75-kD protein of MMR in60% of autistic children in the study. This was an impor-tant finding because the molecular weight of MMR pro-tein that reacted positive for MMR antibodies resembledthe molecular weight of a measles protein, known as HAantigen. Indeed, the MMR band contained anti-gen as it immunopositive for antibodiesto MV-HA, but not for monoclonal antibodies to MV-NP.In preliminary data not included here, we recently foundthat the MV-HA monoclonal antibody but not the MV-NP monoclonal almost completely blocked thebinding of MMR antibody autisticsera) to the MMR protein band on immunoblots. There-fore, these indirect studies suggest that MMR antibodiesin autistic sera are most likely directed towards HA anti-gen of MV. Moreover, the 73 to 75-kD band of MMR didnot contain RV or MuV as this band was immunonega-tive for monoclonal antibodies to either of these twoviruses. Relative to autistic children, the control childrenMMR-Autoimmunity in Autism J Biomed Sci 2002;9:359-364 363 Fig. 4. Representative MMR immunoblots reacted with monoclonal antibodies to RV or MuV. The MMR blots from 4 separate SDS-PAGE runs were with antibodies (1:100 dilu-tion) to RV or MuV, probed with goat anti-mouse-IgG-alkalinephosphatase. Note that the MMR blots were negative in these immu-noassays.Fig. 5. Distribution of MMR and MBP antibodies in autistic and control children. After antibody screening by immunoblotting, thepercentage of antibody-positive sera was calculated in each studygroup. This was plotted against the antigen source assayed. Note thatonly the autistic group showed positive reactions (vertical bars) butthe control group that included normal children (baseline box 1), nor-mal siblings (baseline box 2), and other disease children (baseline box3) was negative. had low levels of MMR antibodies that were immunonega- tive for MMR-derived MV-HA antigen. Thus it seemsplausible that autistic children elicited an inappropriate orabnormal antibody response to MMR that was directedagainst the MV-HA antigen. Undoubtedly, more researchis necessary on this topic but we are tempted to speculatethat a faulty immunoregulation or immunogenetic factorsmay determine why only autistic children produce theseabnormal antibodies to MMR-derived protein (73-75 kD)that appears to be the HA antigen of MV. Alternatively, thedifference between the autistic and control children may bedue to a structural modification (or mutation) of antigenicdeterminant that is recognized by MMR antibodies. Immunization with vaccines is the best preventive measure against deadly infections available to mankindtoday. Because vaccines are given to healthy subjects,almost exclusively to children, the safety of vaccines mustbe as absolute as humanely possible. Although the risk-to-benefit equation strongly favors vaccination, there aresome serious side effects, albeit extremely rare, thatdeserve scientific attention. instance, aseptic menin- with MMR. However, the basis ofhow vaccines react adversely in some cases remains vir-tually unknown. It is quite possible that vaccines in asmall population of genetically predisposed children mayreact inappropriately, simply because of their immatureimmune system or some other unknown risk factors suchas immunodeficiencies, allergies, chemical toxins orchronic psychological stress [3]. However, none of thesefactors has so far been investigated in autism. In recent years, the immunization-autoimmunity topic has gained quite a bit of public attention. This is quitepossibly because autoimmune diseases are the common-est manifestations of immunizations [1, 13]. The MMRhas been insinuated as a culprit of gastrointestinal prob-lems in some children with autistic characteristics [22].Approximately one half of the parents with autistic chil-dren reported autistic regression after the MMR immuni-zation [17]. Moreover, Sci 2002;9:359-364 Singh/Lin/Newell/Nelsonwith autoimmunity was found in autistic children who did not have a wild type measles infection but they didhave the MMR immunization [17]. And, as describedherein, autistic children showed a sera also had autoanti-bodies to brain MBP. This is quite an intriguing observa-tion in favor of a connection between atypical measlesinfection and autism; an atypical infection usually refersto infection that occurs in the absence of a rash. An atypi-cal measles infection in the absence of a rash and unusualneurological symptoms was recently described to suggestthe existence of a variant MV in children and adults [9].In light of these new findings, we suggest that a consider-able proportion of autistic cases may result from an atypi-cal measles infection that does not produce a rash butcauses neurological symptoms in some children. Thesource of this virus could be a variant MV or it could bethe MMR vaccine. Scientifically, therefore, it is instruc-tive to consider both these possibilities and uncover themthrough experimental research. We think that this is anextremely important public health issue, quite simply because some scientists have recently warned us about theemergence of a mutant MV that causes fatal illnesses inman [9]. If this is the case, then new vaccination strategieswill be required to combat mutant measles infection.While more research is necessary to establish a pathogno-monic role for MMR/MV, we are currently exploring therole of virus-induced autoimmunity and our future re-search is aimed at characterizing the molecular basis ofcellular and humoral immunity to viral antigens in chil-dren with autism.
