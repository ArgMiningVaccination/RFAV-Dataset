These oils provide aromatherapy, so you experience beneficial changes in your mind and body as you inhale their fragrance. Massages that use essential oils, either blended with massage oils or in a diffuser, have been proven to be more effective than those without aromatherapy. Some specific studies have found that essential oils can help ease menopausal symptoms as well as the pain of menstrual cramps, among other ailments. There are dozens of essential oils - not to mention different combinations - that can have a range of benefits to your body. This basic guide to essential oils can help you enhance your massage service. Calming: chamomile, lavender, frankincense and geranium oil Uplifting: ylang-ylang, clary sage, rose, and neroli oil Energizing: rosemary oil Decongesting: eucalyptus, pine, and tea tree oil Here are five common essential oils and what each offers for massage clients at spas in Atlanta This precious oil has been sought after since the ancient times and is often used for grounding and relaxation. This oil blends well with lavender or its complex aroma can be enjoyed on its own. If you're feeling under the weather, it can deepen breathing, soothe coughs, and even has anti-inflammatory and antidepressant properties. If you're looking to relieve stress and anxiety while boosting your immune system, try requesting frankincense at your next massage. Geranium, which comes from the flower, is known for its relaxing and rejuvenating effects on the body. The lovely flowery fragrance adds to the relaxing effect, transporting you to a fresh garden during your massage. In traditional medicine, geranium is used to improve circulation, soothe and stimulate nervous system functions, and contract body tissue, acting as an astringent to give you a better, more toned look. So, clearly, it's a good match for a massage. For female patients, this essential oil can be particularly helpful with menstrual and menopausal symptoms. Lavender is one of the most popular essential oils out there, due to its fresh and sweet aroma that promotes a soothing atmosphere. It is one of the most versatile oils, and is an adaptogenic or balancing oil, meaning it does what the body needs it to do. It helps your body adapt to stress, which is why it's commonly used in spas in Atlanta. Lavender is also effective for pain relief, promoting sleep, and boosting stamina and energy levels. Coriander, which comes from the Cilantro plant, is a sweet and warm essential oil, and has a relaxing and soothing effect. This oil can also help promote healthy digestive and circulatory systems. Some even believe it can help relieve cramps - both in the muscles and in the throat which causes coughing. During your next visit to our [spas in Atlanta](/spa-locations/locations), ask if there is coriander essential oil available. Bergamot has been used for hundreds of years in Italy to reduce feelings of stress and to soothe skin. It has a pleasant, spicy citrus aroma, similar to Earl Grey tea, as this flower provides that tea's flavor. It's a versatile essential oil that can be used to relieve feelings of depression, improve mood, and help with anxious and sad feelings. It's unique due to its ability to be both uplifting and calming, so you'll feel rejuvenated and refreshed after an aromatherapy session. Aromatherapy has a range of benefits on the body when used in a massage at [spas in Atlanta](/spa-locations/locations). What essential oils are you most excited to try?
