We are all seeking a fine balance in our lives as a cornerstone of health, happiness and wellness. In our fast paced lives this is often easier said than done and the deep impacts of stress and im-balance in our lives are largely overlooked. In any system, ecosystem or human system, physiologically we are programmed for homeostasis. We are innately born to stay in balance and create harmony in the body. We are very good at it and the younger we are the more we take advantage of this ability. As we age our nervous systems can start to get overloaded, the stress in our lives magnifies with jobs and kids and financial woes, love and life and death. Our digestion changes with stress and over time we need different things to support this pull towards center. Our ability to remove toxins can get sluggish, hormones start to get pulled in the wrong direction, blood sugar is dysregulated by pumping more cortisol into the system, our metabolic processes slow down, get distracted...and slowly but surely, over time, possibly over decades, we are off balance and cant seem to find our central axis again. This process can be slow and easy, or fast and furious, depending on who you are, what type of environment you were raised in, access to clean food and water or not, genetic and family history influences. The variables are endless. A young child raised in foster care, experiencing early loss and malnutrition will have a completely different set of physiologic tools to deal with stress than the child raised by two at home parents versus the tools a 19 year old has after experiencing war and may be suffering from PSTD without therapeutic support. The point is we all have the ability to cope with stress but after multiple heavy hits our system will start to struggle with this mechanism. The cause and the outcome will be different for us all.
