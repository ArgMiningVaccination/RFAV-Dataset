In accordance with natural laws of healing, homeopathy seeks to cure by re-establishing the body's internal homeostasis or balance. This correction can strengthen the immune system, enhance emotional balance and restore health. Homeopathic remedies are prescribed according to the 'Law of Similars', an age-old principle that recognizes the body's ability to heal itself. The medicines or 'remedies' are derived from animal, vegetable, and mineral. They are prepared in such a way that they are non-toxic; taken in such small doses there are no known side effects. Dr. Thomas has studied homeopathy extensively and uses the remedies as a compliment to other treatments. For example, a remedy may be recommended in addition to chiropractic care to assist with arthritis, a sprained ankle or headache. In addition to an acupuncture treatment, homeopathy may be used to reduce symptoms related to menopause, asthma or constipation. Dr. Thomas incorporates homeopathic remedies as an adjunctive treatment for her patients. Individuals seeking homeopathic services for serious disabilities or life-threatening illnesses are referred elsewhere for such care. "}
