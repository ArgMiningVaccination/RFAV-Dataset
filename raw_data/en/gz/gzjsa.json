(before the common era, often designated B.C.). Legend recounts that after Siddhartha confront- ed the realities of old age, illness, and death, herenounced his privileged social position to seek spiri-tual salvation. Through years spent studying spiritualpractices and practicing disciplined meditation he dis-covered a kind of transcendent clarity of perspective,which is referred to as enlightenment or nirvana. Theprince Siddhartha thereafter became known as theBuddha (Enlightened One) and Shakyamuni (Sage ofthe Shakyas). Buddhism spread throughout Asia and divided into three major branches, each with distinctive beliefs,practices, and cultural nuances: Theravada Buddhismin southern and Southeast Asia (the modern coun-tries of Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos,Cambodia, and Vietnam), Mahayana Buddhism ineastern Asia (China, Korea, and Japan), and VajrayanaBuddhism in central Asia (mainly Tibet). Each majorbranch includes various sub-branches and groups; forinstance, Chan Buddhism in China (known as ZenBuddhism in Japan) and the Dalai Lama's Gelugpalineage in Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism. A volumi-nous body of scriptures developed among theseBuddhist traditions, including texts of the Buddha'steachings, known as dharma , as well as monastic dis- ciplinary rules and commentaries by later religiousauthorities. 1The Buddhist Tradition Religious Beliefs and Healthcare Decisions by Paul David Numrich Contents Beliefs Relating to Healthcare 2 Overview of 3 Religious Morality and Ethics The Individual and 4 the Patient-Caregiver Relationship Family, Sexuality, and Procreation 5 Genetics 6 Organ and Tissue Transplantation 7 Mental Health 8 Medical Experimentation 9 and Research Death and Dying 9 Special Concerns 11 Part of the \"Religious Traditions and Healthcare Decisions\" handbook series published by the Park Ridge Center for the Study of Health, Faith, and Ethics THEBUDDHIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSBBuddhism adheres to the basic Indian view, one shared with Hinduism and Jainism, that human existence is part of an ongoing cycle ofmultiple lifetimes ( samsara ) the circumstances of which are governed by one's deeds or actions(karma) . Death is an inevitable part of existence and subsequent rebirth reflects the outcome ofone's karmic dispositions, which may occur atthe human or another level, such as that of ani-mals or disembodied beings. Liberation fromthe cycle of samsara occurs through enlighten-ment, which is also known as nirvana or theBuddha nature inherent in all living beings. Itis, however, accessible only from the humanrealm of existence. Nirvana is impossible to explain in ordinary terms \"because human language is too poor toexpress the real nature of the Absolute Truth orUltimate Reality which is Nirvana.\" 3Buddhists believe that upon death, an enlightened persondoes not experience rebirth within samsara.What occurs in such cases cannot be fathomedby the unenlightened mind, other than to saythat worldly existence comes to an end, alongwith all its unsatisfactory aspects. The belief innirvana results in a somewhat dualistic view ofreality for Buddhists, who distinguish betweenthe conventional realm (the samsaric world) andthe ultimate realm (the nirvanic perspective).However, Mahayana philosophy pursued theconclusion that, actually, \"there is not the slight-est bit of difference between the two,\" since thesamsaric world can have only apparent reality inthe face of an ultimate nirvana. 4The Buddha's most fundamental insights con- cerned the predicament of human existence andthe way of salvation from it, insights he gainedfrom personal experience. In his first sermonfollowing enlightenment, called \"Setting inMotion the Wheel of the Dharma,\" the Buddhalaid out the Four Noble Truths: that life isunsatisfactory, 5that our own desires cause life's unsatisfactoriness, that there can be cessation orliberation from life's unsatisfactoriness (i.e., nir-vana), and that there is an Eightfold Path lead-ing to this liberation. The Buddha has beenlikened to a great physician who diagnoses theunderlying human dissatisfaction or \"dis-ease\"with life\u2014which includes physical illnesses aswell as mental discomforts\u2014isolates the cause,then prescribes the cure. In ways not availableto medicine, but compatible with medicine'sconcern for alleviating suffering, Buddhismoffers the ultimate remedy for human affliction. 6 All existing things have three characteristics or \"marks.\" The first is impermanence\u2014changeis the only constant, nothing remainsunchanged. Second, and deriving from the first,nothing contains an unchanging essence or core.Therefore, human beings have no unchanging,essential identity or soul, and there is no God inthe Western sense of an almighty and unchang-ing creator who made living souls in the divineimage. The Buddha did recognize the existenceof \"gods\" or spiritual beings above the humanrealm, but they too exhibit the three marks ofexistence. Human beings consist of five aggre-gates, mental and physical strands, factors, orIn recent times Buddhism has spread outside of Asia through population migration and con-versions, today constituting more than 350 mil-lion people worldwide. Perhaps as many as threemillion Americans now consider themselvesBuddhists, the majority being ethnic-Asianimmigrants and their descendants. Ethnic-AsianBuddhists are a double minority in Americansociety, differing both racially and religiously from the majority population. Over Buddhism's150-year history in America, reception has beena mixture of hostility, primarily linked to anti-Asian sentiment, and fascination, as seen inBuddhism's attractiveness to some segments ofthe larger population. 2 2BELIEFS RELATING TO HEALTH CAREaspects that include the body and consciousness. The third mark of existence, unsatisfactoriness,derives from the other two marks: as we attemptto grasp onto that which changes continuously,ever seeking permanence in a sea of imperma-nency, we create dissatisfaction in ourselves. Asnoted above, the Four Noble Truths explain howto overcome this dilemma. Ancient Buddhist texts portray the Buddha and other enlightened notables as exhibitinggreat mental composure under circumstances ofphysical pain, even suppressing bodily illnessesin some cases. Such notables offer an ideal eventhough the vast majority of Buddhists in allperiods would not consider themselves capableof reaching such a state of enlightenment intheir present lifetime. For any patient, regardlessof the level of spiritual attainment, the textualtradition encourages cultivation of a wholesomemindset through contemplation of the dharmaand consideration of one's own spiritual virtues.These activities are portrayed as having healingefficacy. The texts also distinguish two types ofpain, physical and mental, explaining that whena person suffering from the former adds the lat-ter, it is as if that person were shot with twoarrows instead of just one. 7Thus the Buddha taught his monastic followers to distinguishbetween the two: \"You should train yourself:Even though I may be sick in body, my mindwill be free of sickness. . . . [A Buddhist disci-ple] is not obsessed with the idea that 'I am the body' or 'The body is mine.' As he is notobsessed with these ideas, his body changes andalters, but he does not fall into sorrow, lamenta-tion, pain, distress, or despair over its changeand alteration.\" 8 Buddhist tradition and iconography include celestial Buddhas, which are not to be confusedwith the historical Gautama Buddha, and bod- hisattvas , beings that postpone their own final enlightenment in order to facilitate enlighten-ment in others. These beings carry implicationsfor health, healing, and general well-being. Faithin Bhaishajya-guru (Master of Healing) Buddha,for instance, is considered efficacious in times ofillness and in overcoming negative effects ofkarma at death. The bodhisattvaAvalokiteshvara's very name invokes notions ofcelestial care: the Lord Who Looks Down (withCompassion), known in China in female form asKuan-yin, which translates to the One WhoRegards Cries or the One Who Hears Prayers. Many Buddhists seek the services of Buddhist monks trained in ancient Indian medical prac-tices known as Ayurveda . According to some scholars, Buddhist monastic practitioners playeda key role in the historical development ofAyurvedic medicine, although it is usually asso-ciated with Hinduism. 9Buddhist monks also receive training in the ritual use of special vers-es that carry protective and healing properties. 10 3 THEPARKRIDGE CENTEROVERVIEW OF RELIGIOUS MORALITY AND ETHICS TThe Fourth Noble Truth taught by the Buddha delineates the Eightfold Path to liberation. This path is often symbolized as a wheel witheight spokes. By cultivating each spoke, a personapproaches the enlightened hub of the wheel,that is, nirvana. Three spokes comprise the ethi-cal aspect of the path: right speech, right action,and right livelihood. Under right action we findthe five precepts, the basic moral commitmentsincumbent upon all Buddhists: not to destroylife, not to steal, not to engage in sexual miscon-duct, not to tell falsehoods, and not to take intoxicants that cause careless behavior. 11Some consider the principle of non-harm to livingbeings, encapsulated in the first precept, to bethe heart of Buddhist ethics. 12The behavior of Buddhist monks and nuns is governed bynumerous additional precepts and monastic dis-ciplinary rules. The renunciant lifestyle of theBuddha and his monastic community continuesto provide a powerful ethical ideal for manyBuddhist individuals, groups, and cultures.AAlthough classical Buddhism did not develop the modern concept of individual human rights, the notion that all persons possess thepotential for enlightenment nevertheless offersBuddhist grounding for respect of the individ-ual's inherent worth and dignity. Buddhistteachings about ethical duties imply individualrights for the beneficiaries of one's dutifulactions. 13 The Buddha's compassionate behavior as attested in the ancient texts offers a model forBuddhist caregivers, both healthcare profession-als and others. One day the Buddha and hisbeloved disciple, Ananda, happened upon amonk suffering from acute dysentery. The twoattended to the ill monk's physical needs,bathing him in warm water, after which theBuddha taught other monks that \"He whoattends on the sick attends on me.\" Anothertime the Buddha showed similar compassionatecare to a monk with a repulsive affliction thathad turned other monks away. The Buddha also taught that a good nurse should be knowledgeable of both medical proce-dures and the needs of the patient, and shouldperform tasks out of a sense of service rather thanfor the sake of salary alone. Loving-kindness andcompassion should be guiding virtues. Moreover,the Buddha expected nurses to attend to apatient's mental state by imparting spiritual guid-ance through the truths of the dharma. On thepatient's part, the Buddha expected honest disclo-sure of the nature of the illness, cooperation withthe treatment plan, and forbearance of pain. 14CCLLIINNIICCAALLIISSSSUUEESS Self-determination and informed consent The ancient Buddhist monastic codes offer ethical principles relevant to issues of patientchoice and consent. A person lacking knowledgeof what is occurring, whether through mentaldisruption or extreme physical pain, is not con-sidered morally culpable for their actions. Also,the intention underlying an action can some-times absolve a person of wrongdoing, as incases of accidental death. 15Applying these stan- dards, patients must have the capacity for fullknowledge of the situation to be consideredcapable of giving consent, and the intentions ofall parties involved\u2014patient, relatives, medicalstaff, researchers, healthcare administrators, andothers\u2014must be weighed in the decision-makingprocess. Truth-telling and confidentiality The notion of right speech and the precept prohibiting falsehoods pertain here. Lying andcertain forms of speech can harm others; break-ing the trust of confidentiality can lead to harm-ful gossiping or idle chatter, expressly forbiddenby Buddhist tradition. Withholding the truth in certain cases may be acceptable, for instance, when dealing withBuddhists from cultures that subsume an indi-vidual's right to the truth about their conditionto the impact of disclosure on the general well-being of the family. 4 THEBUDDHIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSTHE INDIVIDUAL AND THE PATIENT -CAREGIVER RELATIONSHIPOther Buddhist virtues and ethical insights impinge upon healthcare issues. Following theexample of Gautama Buddha himself, Buddhistsseek to embody wisdom and compassion in theirown lives. A traditional subject for meditationwith clear ethical connotations is the four \"sub-lime states\": loving-kindness, compassion, sym-pathetic joy, and equanimity. Cultivation of thesesublime states will root out the fundamental causes of evil actions in human beings, namely,ignorance and delusion. In Buddhist ethical discourse, great emphasis is placed upon intent. In many circumstances, aperson may not be held culpable for the tragicconsequences of an act performed with puremotivations.THEPARKRIDGE CENTER 5Proxy decision-making Casey Frank, a Zen Buddhist attorney in the bioethics field, advises Buddhists to prepareadvance directives and to appoint a healthcareagent. These can insure follow-through on specifically Buddhist wishes, as in treatment ofthe body following death (see below underDeath and Dying). 16 FAMILY , SEXUALITY , AND PROCREATION TThe Buddha established a community of full time renunciant followers, thus valorizing a celibate lifestyle for the unencumbered pursuitof spiritual progress. Although most Buddhistsmarry and raise a family, they typically valuerenunciant ideals even in Asian cultures wheremonasticism no longer prevails. Buddhism'semphasis on the ultimate goal of liberation fromsamsara renders family issues secular, or \"world-ly\" by definition, bound by desire to the ongoingcycle of existence. Since Buddhism has no anal-ogy to the biblical injunction to be fruitful andmultiply, marriage and divorce are typically con-sidered cultural or civic rather than religiousaffairs. Monogamous marriages and extendedfamilies are normative in Asian Buddhist cul-tures. The Buddha taught that children shouldrespect their parents, that parents should raisetheir children properly, and that husband andwife have mutual duties and responsibilities. 17 For Buddhist monks and nuns, the third pre- cept regarding sexual misconduct is interpretedas prohibiting all sexual activity, whether hetero-sexual, homosexual, or autosexual. Someobservers have remarked about Buddhism's rel-atively benign attitude Harvey summarizes the views inBuddhism's Asian homelands: \"Homosexualactivity among lay people has been sporadicallycondemned as immoral in Southern [Theravada]and Northern [Mahayana and Vajrayana]Buddhism, but there is no evidence of persecu-tion of people for homosexual activities. An atti-tude of unenthusiastic toleration has existed. InChina, there has been more tolerance, and inJapan positive advocacy.\" 18Attitudes toward homosexuality among American-convertBuddhists Contraception Buddhism has permitted natural contracep- tive methods like rhythm and withdrawal sinceancient times. By extension, some modernmethods may be considered permissible as longas they do not function as abortifacients. Thelack of clear guidance from textual sources hascreated disagreement over the normativeBuddhist stance on contraception. Buddhismviews contraception with some ambivalence. Onthe one hand, since conception represents a lifeseeking rebirth, many Buddhists would be reti-cent to block it; on the other hand, the lack ofan imperative to procreate leads other Buddhiststo approve of contraception in certain circum-stances. 19 Sterilization The same ethical considerations apply here as in the case of contraception, if sterilization vol-untarily serves that purpose. Involuntary sterili-zation would have to follow egalitarian protocolsand not target one group, such as the poor orminorities, over others. New reproductive technologies Not surprisingly, given ancient Buddhism's valorization of renunciant celibacy, Buddhisttexts offer little direct guidance in such modernissues as artificial insemination and in vitro fer-tilization (IVF). As Buddhist ethicist DamienKeown observes, the feeling may have been\"that the proper purpose of medicine in themonastery was not the satisfaction of lay desires,such as that of women to bear children.\" Keownconcludes his discussion as follows: \"We mightTHEBUDDHIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSsum up the Buddhist attitude to reproductive technology by saying that the use of donorgametes would not be acceptable, and IVF usingthe couple's gametes could only be counte-nanced in the simplest cases where the embryoswere immediately implanted.\" Such practicalrestrictions would probably preclude IVF forBuddhists, according to Keown. 20 Abortion Traditionally, abortion has been considered aviolation of the first precept against destroyinglife. Ancient monastic texts, for instance,expressly forbid monks from causing an abor-tion, specifying some of the common methods ofthe day as \"scorching, crushing, or the use ofmedicine.\" 21However, debate has arisen in recent years regarding such issues as whenhuman consciousness enters the embryo or fetus and the demands of Buddhist compassion incertain circumstances, such as unwanted orunsafe pregnancies. Abortions are performed inAsian countries where Buddhism has been cul-turally influential. The Japanese have developeda ritual for addressing the loss of fetal life aswell as the associated mental anguish of the par-ents. Most Buddhists would place responsibilityfor the final decision about abortion with thepregnant woman. 22 Care of severely handicapped newborns Handicapped human persons deserve the same ethical considerations as others. Buddhistsmay consider handicap conditions to be theresult of karmic predispositions, but compas-sionate care would be provided nonetheless. 6GENETICS AAncient Buddhist texts and commentaries define human life as the interval between the moment that consciousness arises in the embryo,generally understood as conception, and themoment of death, a period of up to 120 years. 23 This constitutes the temporal span of human per-sonhood, though Buddhists see it as bracketedboth before and after by other existences, not allof which are human. Michael G. Barnhart pointsout that, in the Buddhist view, genes impinge ononly one of the constituent aspects of the humanbeing\u2014the body. Thus Buddhism does not sup-port a \"hard\" genetic determinism: \"The bodyand its associated genetic endowments do not ...determine the rest of our nature in any interest-ingly lawlike manner.\" 24 In discussing genetics and biotechnology gen- erally, the Dalai Lama counsels compassion andthe non-harming of sentient beings. He alsorejects profit, personal preferences, and mereutility as legitimate motivations for geneticmanipulation. 25Genetic experimentation involv- ing the destruction of human embryos or otherliving organisms would fall under basic Buddhistproscriptions against harming life. Compassion for the suffering of one living being does notjustify inflicting suffering upon another sentientbeing, including animals (see below underMedical Experimentation and Research). 26 Barnhart suggests that Buddhism does not condemn genetic engineering, gene therapy,cloning, and other new biotechnical proceduresper se. Buddhist moral judgment would evaluateboth motivations and consequences of particularactions. Egocentric motives would be disap-proved and procedures that distract or deter aperson in their path toward enlightenmentwould be rejected. 27 CCLLIINNIICCAALLIISSSSUUEESS Sex selection and selective abortion According to the Dalai Lama, gender and other preferences for offspring arise from parental preju-dices that should not be exploited for profit. 28 Ethical considerations about selective abortionwould follow the reasoning on abortion generally.7 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERGene therapy and genetic screening Assuming proper motivation and concern for consequences, Buddhism could approve suchprocedures. For instance, parents may wish toprotect their offspring from heritable diseasesout of compassion and the hope that their chil-dren might pursue their own \"life of enlighten-ment and compassion.\" 29Cloning The Dalai Lama cloning of semi-human creatures as human \"spare parts\"factories on the principles of compassion andnon-harming. 30Should a human clone ever emerge, Damien Keown suggests that Buddhismwould not deny the status of human individuali-ty to such a case. 31 ORGAN AND TISSUE TRANSPLANTATION BBuddhism's emphasis on compassion and the alleviation of suffering has led some Buddhist spokespersons to encourage organ andtissue donation upon the donor's death.However, the belief in some Buddhist traditionsthat consciousness remains with the body for aperiod after physical death complicates the mat-ter. Many Buddhists will not allow any tamper-ing with the body for three days so as not to dis-turb the release of consciousness as it movestoward its new mode of existence. Of course, thisdelay compromises organ and tissue harvesting.In China and Japan, where indigenous traditionshave influenced Buddhism historically, taboosagainst desecrating the body hamper thisprocess. 32Generally, however, the Buddhist understanding of human existence as an aggre-gation of mental and physical strands allowsindividuals to disassociate personal identity fromthe physical parts of the body, thus opening thepossibility of transplantation. CCLLIINNIICCAALLIISSSSUUEESS For recipients Buddhism's ethical imperative of compassion has universal rather than selective scope; trans-plant recipients should therefore be chosenaccording to compassionate criteria fairlyapplied to all candidates. Two guidelines, rightaction and right livelihood, imply just and equi-table treatment of others that they, too, mightpursue happy and fulfilling lives. This has fur-ther implications for the allocation and cost oftransplants, which should not arbitrarily favor some recipients over others. The notion that allpersons possess the potential for enlightenmentalso argues for egalitarian transplant allocationprocedures. At the same time, Buddhists may evaluate recipients differently following transplantationdepending on the use to which their lives areput. In some cases the recipient's extendedhuman lifespan may make the most of one'spotential for enlightenment or nirvana, whereasin other cases the recipient may squander thatopportunity by living a life of negative deeds. 33 Some recipients may express concern about thekarmic status of their transplanted organs/tissue,and may even attribute biological rejection asindication that the donor's karma was incompat-ible with their own. 34 For donors A contemporary Vajrayana teacher suggests that some Buddhists may not be mentally pre-pared to donate their organs. It is best to devel-op a mind that is strong, stable, and wiseenough to understand all the implications oforgan donation procedures and the relationshipbetween mind and body. 35Two contemporary teachers from the Chan/Zen tradition havestressed the importance of the compassionateact of donation over any potential disturbance ofthe release of the donor's consciousness duringthe three-day waiting period. Buddhists maysign advance directives or appoint a healthcareagent to address post-mortem donation. 36THEBUDDHIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONS 8MENTAL HEALTH DDecades ago psychoanalysts Carl Jung and Erich Fromm investigated the potential com- patibility of Buddhist thought and Western psy-chology, the latter collaborating with noted Zenauthor D.T. Suzuki. The first comprehensivebook on Buddhism in America, written by a psy-chologist in the 1970s, included a chapter enti-tled \"Buddhism, Psychology, and Psychotherapy\"which predicted increasing therapeutic use ofmeditation. 37At the popular level this has indeed occurred; witness the recent profusion of self-help meditation books and the increase in medi-tation centers. 38In Western mental health gener- ally, the field of transpersonal psychology hasgone furthest in integrating Buddhist insightsinto its approach. A few Buddhist psychothera-pies have been imported from Asia. 39 In a sense Buddhism has followed an interac- tive mind/body model of human personhood for2,500 years. \"In Buddhist psychology and in themedical texts of Buddhist culture, mind andbody are not separate,\" explains Mark Epstein,Buddhist psychologist and author of the booksThoughts without a Thinker and Going to Pieces without Falling Apart . \"Mind extends into body and body extends into mind.\" 40 The human being is an aggregation of one physical and four mental strands, factors, oraspects. In Buddhist understanding, \"mind\" isincluded as one of the sense organs or facultiesof the body\u2014as other organs sense objectsaround us through sight, hearing, smell, taste,and touch, the mind senses mental objects suchas thoughts, ideas, and imagination, and alsointerprets and assimilates input from the physicalsense organs. Such input affects our thoughts.Buddhism places great emphasis on the mind'sability to control various states of health, bothphysical and mental. Clarity of mind is essential;meditation helps achieve it. This is underlined bythe prohibition against intoxication in the fifthprecept. Ancient Buddhist beliefs and mythological views can be interpreted in modern psychologi-cal terms. For instance, the six defilements\u2014 greed, anger, ignorance, pride, doubt, and falseviews\u2014can be seen as universal human neurosesbeyond individual neurotic tendencies. 41The six realms of existence\u2014human, animal, hell, heav-en, hungry ghosts, and jealous gods\u2014can standfor various states of mind. 42 Buddhists attribute much mental health and illness to a person's spiritual progress along thepath to enlightenment. The Dalai Lama, forinstance, advises his readers that by \"being bet-ter grounded emotionally through the practice ofpatience, we find that not only do we becomemuch stronger mentally and spiritually, but wetend also to be healthier physically.\" He goes onto explain, \"I attribute the good health I enjoy toa generally calm and peaceful mind.\" 43 A respected Theravada Buddhist scholar- monk writes, \"He who has realized the Truth,Nirvana, is the happiest being in the world. He isfree from all 'complexes' and obsessions, theworries and troubles that torment others. Hismental health is perfect.\" 44 CCLLIINNIICCAALLIISSSSUUEE Psychotherapy and behavior modification Most Buddhist psychotherapists consider Western psychotherapy and Buddhism to becomplementary rather than incompatible,although they would argue that Buddhism deep-ens the insights of conventional psychology. RyoImamura, a Japanese-American Buddhist priest-therapist, sees Buddhist psychotherapy as \"anexpansion of Western psychotherapy. It appendsdimensions of compassion and nonduality to therational clarity and precision of Western psy-chotherapy.\" Imamura gives the example ofhuman suffering and happiness: both Westernand Buddhist psychotherapies seek to relievesuffering and enhance happiness, but only theBuddhist approach reveals the true meaning ofsuffering and offers the \"complete transforma-tion\" necessary to attain true happiness. 45THEPARKRIDGE CENTER 9Electroshock and stimulation Considerations of compassion and non-harm would enter into decisions about use of any pro-cedure that would cause pain to a patient.Psychopharmacology Buddhists would want clouding of the mind kept to a minimum in pharmacological therapy. MEDICAL EXPERIMENTATION AND RESEARCH TThe key ethical consideration here concerns whether a particular experiment or research procedure violates Buddhism's first preceptagainst destroying life and the principle of non-harm to living beings. If so, even the purportedbenefits of alleviation of suffering would be out-weighed by these fundamental Buddhist ethicalimperatives. CCLLIINNIICCAALLIISSSSUUEESS Damien Keown's summary of the Buddhist position on human embryo experimentation canbe generalized to similar kinds of research: \"InBuddhist terms, destructive experimentation onembryos represents a direct assault on the basicgood of life and a breach of the first precept. If the goal is theoretical knowledge, it wouldamount to the subordination of life to knowl-edge, and as with any instrumentalisation [sic]of a basic good would be impermissible.\" Keownnotes that the Buddhist position makes no ethi-cal distinction here between animated andunanimated embryos. 46Likewise, Buddhist ethi- cal prescriptions about human research applyequally to animal research since animals aresentient beings that suffer pain. \"What aboutissues like vivisection,\" asks the Dalai Lama,\"where animals are routinely caused terrible suf-fering before being killed as a means to further-ing scientific knowledge?\" To a Buddhist, heanswers, such practices are \"shocking.\" 47 DEATH AND DYING AAccording to Buddhism, death for the vast majority of people falls within the cycle of samsara as a passage to rebirth into a new lifeform, another change amidst the impermanenceof existence that is governed by one's ownkarmic dispositions. Although penultimate inthis sense, human life is nevertheless highly val-ued as the only possible venue for the ultimategoal of enlightenment, the final liberation forthose who attain it. Dying Buddhist patients mayponder their progress\u2014or lack of it\u2014along thepath toward final liberation, and may experienceanxiety about being reborn into less desirablehuman circumstances or even as a lower lifeform. Discussion of impending death is not typi-cally avoided, though positive thoughts andencouragement are preferred over sadness orgrief so as to encourage an auspicious mindset for the transition. Some Buddhist patients mayattest to visions or intimations of the circum-stances of their next rebirth. Buddhist clergyoften chant bedside blessings or protective ritu-als, and dying patients may wish to meditate orto contemplate sermons on the dharma. 48 Buddhism recognizes that the person is not the body\u2014the body being only one of five aggre-gates comprising a human being\u2014thus the bodyis not sacred in some sense at death. Neither isthe person essentially a soul, since Buddhismdoes not recognize such an entity. At death aperson's aggregated organism disassembles, tobe reassembled in the next rebirth\u2014or not, inthe case of the enlightened few.THEBUDDHIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONS 10CCLLIINNIICCAALLIISSSSUUEE Determining death Little scholarly or ethical attention has been paid to constructing a Buddhist definition ofdeath in the light of modern biomedical issues. 49 Basing his view on the ancient Buddhist notionof death as the disaggregation of the humanorganism, thatBuddhism conceives integrated organic functioning.\"Thus Buddhism's criterion for individual deathis irreversible brain stem death, since the brainstem controls integrated organic functioning. 50 Pain control and palliative care Buddhism's emphasis on clarity of mind\u2014 recall the fifth precept eschewing intoxicants\u2014may lead some Buddhists to forego pharmaco-logical palliation in order to maintain mindful-ness in the midst of pain and the dying process.On the other hand, Buddhists may approve ofpharmacological palliation as an expression ofcompassion for physical suffering. Improvements in pain management that mini- mize mental impairment have been welcomed. 51 Buddhist patients may also attempt alleviation ofphysical and mental pain through concentratedmental efforts in meditation or through ceremo-nial acts. Some Buddhist-influenced hospice and other programs for the dying have emerged in recentyears, including the Zen Hospice Project in SanFrancisco ( http://www .zenhospice.or g) and the work of Buddhist Joan Halifax in SantaFe, New Mexico ( http://www .peacemakercommuni - ty.org). A small study of women in Thailand indi- cated that \"meditation can be a useful interven-tion to support women with HIV/AIDS and toprovide a measure of control, to enhance theirimmunological response to stress, to reduce theside effects of treatment, and to diminish anxietyand fear.\" 52The Dalai Lama counsels that wis- dom might dictate submitting to the karmicmanifestations of physical suffering at the end ofthis life rather than face their prolongation intothe next life. 53Foregoing life-sustaining treatment In discussing the case of patients in a Persistent Vegetative State (PVS), DamienKeown notes that the Buddhist prohibitionagainst destroying life does not imply an impera-tive to prolong life in all circumstances. \"Thereis no obligation, for example,\" Keown writes, \"toconnect patients to life-support machines simply to keep them alive .\" 54PVS patients should con- tinue to receive nutrition and hydration, Keownexplains, since such patients have not sufferedbrain stem death and are therefore still alive. 55 \"There would, however, be no requirement totreat subsequent [medical] complications.\" 56 Suicide, assisted suicide, and euthanasia Despite examples of suicide and other types of voluntary death by religious notables inancient texts, Buddhism generally condemnsdeliberate attempts to end one's own life. Thisprohibition extends to any agent, such as aphysician, who assists another's suicide\u2014thetexts label such an agent a \"knife-bringer\"\u2014oreven encourages it out of compassion for tragiccircumstances. 57Based on this Phillip Lecso argues that Buddhism advocates hospice careover euthanasia. 58As to the latter, Peter Harvey observes that \"Euthanasia scenarios present atest for the implications of Buddhist compas-sion, but the central Buddhist response is one ofaiding a person to continue to make the best ofhis or her 'precious human rebirth', even in verydifficult circumstances.\" 59 Autopsy and post-mortem care Post-mortem care of the body should be kept to the barest minimum, and, if possible, anautopsy should be delayed for three days due tothe Buddhist belief in the slow release of con-sciousness from the body (see above underOrgan and Tissue Transplantation). Buddhisttexts are often recited or chanted at death,though not necessarily in the presence of thebody. Buddhist clergy usually officiate at theserituals. In fact, officiating at the occasion ofdeath became the special province of monks inmany parts of Asia.11 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERBurial and mourning traditions Decorum in the face of death is typical and does not necessarily indicate lack of either con-cern or grief. The Buddhist beliefs about imper-manence and multiple lifetimes tend to create astoic regard for the passing of a person from thepresent existence, though the belief in karmamay raise concerns over the destination of cer- tain individuals. Cremation is the traditionalmethod of final disposition, following the three-day waiting period. Departed ancestors are peri-odically remembered and revered by family,especially in those Asian cultures influenced byChinese traditions. SPECIAL CONCERNS TThe multiple expressions of Buddhism in America call for sensitivity to variations in beliefs, practices, and cultural nuances amongBuddhist patients and others involved in healthcare. The major distinction between the so-called \"two Buddhisms\" of America deservesspecial attention. Due to immigration and con-version patterns in American history, we find, onthe one hand, Buddhists whose faith is anexpression of their cultural heritage as Asiansand, on the other hand, non-Asian Buddhistswho converted to Buddhism as adults.Buddhism fulfills a different sociological func-tion for each group\u2014affirming ethnic Buddhists and transformingperspective con-verts. 60Within each of these \"two Buddhisms,\" of course, variations of expressions and under-standings also exist. Diet and drugs Although the first precept against destroying life and the ethical imperative of non-harmingimply an ideal of vegetarianism, most Buddhistsdo not practice this ideal. Some Buddhist clergyand laity may prefer vegetarian meals as a mat-ter of piety, and a few Buddhist groups mayexpect their members to follow the ideal. MostBuddhist monks and nuns are restricted bymonastic disciplinary rules to two meals per day,to be completed before noon. After noon theymay consume liquids and soft foods that do notrequire chewing. Pious laity taking religiousvows at certain times of the year may also adoptthese dietary restrictions. Drugs that include intoxicants as ingredients are generally avoidedunless overriding medical benefits are indicated. Religious rituals and observances Buddhism is primarily an individual and fam- ily oriented religion, although regular congrega-tional gatherings have become more common inthe United States as immigrants adopt the typi-cal American style of religion. The concept of\"worship\" does not capture the religious experi-ence of most Buddhists, who instead practicemeditation or a ritual veneration of the histori-cal Gautama Buddha and various celestialBuddhas and bodhisattvas. Candles, incense,flowers, gongs or bells, sacred statues and paint-ings, beads, meditation cushions, and other ritu-al accoutrements may be used. Chanting, dhar-ma sermons, and reading/reciting of scripturaland liturgical texts are common practices. EachAsian culture celebrates its own set of religiousfestivals, most tied to the lunar calendar. Specialimportance is attached to the observation of thehistorical Buddha's birth ( W esak , observed tradition, usually in March/April)or combined birth/enlightenment/death(Visakha , observed in the Theravada tradition, usually in May). An important cultural festival isNew Year's, held at various times depending onthe Asian culture. These occasions draw largenumbers of Buddhists and others to templeactivities across the United States.12 THEBUDDHIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSNOTES 1.

The common translation for the term dukkha in the First Noble Truth is \"suffering,\" but that does notcarry the full weight of meaning. Dukkha refers tolife's fundamental unsatisfactoriness, which we readilyacknowledge in times of suffering but also experiencein the best times of life, which do not last forever andleave us wanting more. 6.

The author wishes to thank Damien Keown and Edwin DuBose for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this work.RReligious beliefs provide meaning for people confronting illness and seeking health, par- ticularly during times of crisis. Increasinglyhealth care workers face the challenge of provid-ing appropriate care and services to people of dif-ferent religious backgrounds. Unfortunately,many healthcare workers are unfamiliar with thereligious beliefs and moral positions of traditionsother than their own. This handbook is one of aseries that provides accessible and practicalinformation about the values and beliefs of dif-ferent religious traditions. It should assist nurses,physicians, chaplains, social workers, and admin-istrators in their decision making and care giving.It can also serve as a reference for believers whodesire to learn more about their own traditions. Each handbook gives an introduction to the history of the tradition, including its perspectiveson health and illness. Each also covers the tradi-tion's positions on a variety of clinical issues,with attention to the points at which moraldilemmas often arise in the clinical setting. Final-ly, each handbook offers information on specialconcerns relevant to the particular tradition. The editors have tried to be succinct, objec- tive, and informative. Wherever possible, we haveincluded the tradition's positions as reflected inofficial statements by a governing or other formalbody, or by reference to positions formulated byauthorities within the tradition. Bear in mindthat within any religious tradition, there may bemore than one denomination or sect that holdsviews in opposition to mainstream positions, orgroups that maintain different emphases. The editors also recognize that the beliefs and values of individuals within a tradition may varyfrom the so-called official positions of their tradi-tion. In fact, some traditions leave moral deci-sions about clinical issues to individualconscience. We would therefore caution the read-er against generalizing too readily. The guidelines in these handbooks should not substitute for discussion of patients' own reli-gious views on clinical issues. Rather, they should be used to supplement information com-ing directly from patients and families, and usedas a primary source only when such firsthandinformation is not available. We hope that these handbooks will help prac- titioners see that religious backgrounds andbeliefs play a part in the way patients deal withpain, illness, and the decisions that arise in thecourse of treatment. Greater understanding ofreligious traditions on the part of care providers,we believe, will increase the quality of carereceived by the patient. Introduction to the series The Park Ridge Center explores and enhances the interaction of health, faith, and ethics through research, education, and consultation to improve the lives of individuals and communities.
