We focus on areas where conventional medicine lacks - treating the root cause of disease and seeing the patient as a whole person - as the sum of all symptoms, all systems, all organs, and body parts. Not sick? No problem! Prevention is the best medicine. It starts with listening. We take the time to get a thorough assessment of your chief complaints. We order any diagnostics tests or appropriate referrals as needed to get to the root of the problem. We then proceed with treatment, for which you will be an active participant. Choose us because you are ready to be an active participant in your health. You're tired of being on the hamster wheel of medication management and algorithms in mainstream medicine. You want personalized medicine that prioritizes nutrition, mind-body medicine, and lower force interventions, which might actually help you recover.
