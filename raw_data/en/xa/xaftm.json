How does Beta Glucan work? It improves your immune response by activating receptors in intestinal lymph nodes, which in turn heightens immune surveillance, allowing white blood cells and other key disease-fighting immune cells to travel around the body quickly to deal with any trouble. Beta glucan is a soluble fiber. This means that your body does not digest it, but it slows down the time it takes food to travel in the intestines. Therefore, food digestion takes longer. Slower digestion means that your body doesn't absorb sugar or carbohydrates as fast, which therefore reduces the chance of your blood sugar spiking and [controls your blood glucose levels](https://www.bensnaturalhealth.com/blog/diabetes-health/how-to-control-blood-sugar/). Beta glucan also works to prevent your body from absorbing cholesterol from food in your stomach and intestines, thus [lowering your cholesterol levels](https://www.bensnaturalhealth.com/blog/diabetes-health/cholesterol-reducing-foods/).
