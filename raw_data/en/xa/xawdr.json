As the immune system declines with age, older adults do not respond to standard dose flu vaccines as well as younger adults.1,2 FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose Influenza Vaccine has been shown to generate an enhanced vaccine-induced immune response in those 65 years of age and older compared to a standard dose vaccine.,2,3 Importantly, a large, randomized, clinical trial also demonstrated that FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose Influenza Vaccine provided superior efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza illness compared to a standard dose vaccine in adults 65 years of age and older.2,3,4 In its immunization advisory statement for the upcoming 2016/2017 influenza season, Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has stated: 'Considering the burden of disease associated with influenza A (H3N2) and the evidence of superior efficacy of high dose TIV compared to standard dose TIV, it appears that high dose TIV would provide the greatest benefit to the 65 years age group'.3 For many people, recovering from influenza infections may take seven to ten days.3 However, it may take longer for adults 65 years of age and older to recover as they are at risk of developing more severe complications or worsening underlying medical conditions.3,5,6 Further, influenza may trigger medical events like strokes and heart attacks because of the possible destabilizing effects that the inflammatory response can have on the cardiovascular system.6, Where to get high-dose vaccine At this time, the high-dose influenza vaccine is not publicly funded but is available for purchase at some pharmacies or vaccination clinics.
