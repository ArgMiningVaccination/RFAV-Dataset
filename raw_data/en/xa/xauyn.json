However, there is a need to conceptualise these early-life factors, how they relate to each other, and provide conceptual framing for future research on aetiology and modelling prevention scenarios of multimorbidity. We develop a conceptual framework to characterise the population-level domains of early-life determinants of future multimorbidity.

Worsening delirium severity is associated with poorer clinical outcomes, yet its assessment remains under-reported with most severity assessment tools not validated for critical care. The DRS-R98 is a widely applied and validated tool. The aim of this project is to report the validation and utility of the DRS-R98 in critical illness.

Evidence suggests these two environments influence adolescents' food choices independently, but there is limited knowledge of how the interplay between these environments influence adolescents' diets. An enhanced understanding of this interplay surrounding adolescent food choice could aid the development of more nuanced interventions and policies. This qualitative study involved 13 online focus groups with adolescents (n = 45) aged 11-18 years, attending secondary school or college in England, UK. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Social experiences which accompanied eating were perceived as more important than the food itself, and fast-food outlets were described as uniquely suited to facilitating these interactions. Young people wanted to spend their money on foods they considered worthwhile, but this did not always relate to the most affordable foods. Adolescents wanted to put little effort into making food decisions and appreciated factors that helped them make quick decisions such as prominent placement and eye-catching promotions on foods they wanted to buy. Chain food outlets were valued as they offered familiar and frequently advertised foods, which minimized the effort needed for food decisions. Adolescents' sense of autonomy underpinned all themes. Participants described having limited opportunities to make their own food choices and they did not want to waste these buying unappealing 'healthy' foods. Interventions and government policies should align with adolescents' experiences and values relating to food choice to ensure that they are effective with this important age group.

A range of validated tests, which integrate both strength and aerobic function, are available and increasingly being used. Together, these tests offer the ability for comprehensive exercise evaluation. Extensive research and expert consensus over recent years has enabled the adaptation and standardisation of a range of exercise tests to aid the understanding of the pathophysiology related to exercise limitation in PwCF and has led to the development of novel exercise tests which may be applied to PwCF. This article provides expert, opinion-based clinical practice guidance, along with test instructions, for a selection of commonly used valid tests which have documented clinimetric properties for PwCF. Importantly, this document also highlights previously used tests that are no longer suggested for PwCF and areas where research is mandated. This collaboration, on behalf of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Exercise Working Group, represents expert consensus by a multidisciplinary panel of physiotherapists, exercise scientists and clinicians and aims to improve global standardisation of functional exercise testing of PwCF. In short, the standardised use of a small selection of tests performed to a high standard is advocated.

We know that those who are already socially disadvantaged in society are more exposed to COVID-19, experience the worst health outcomes and are more likely to suffer economically. We also know that these groups are more likely to experience stigma and have negative healthcare experiences even before the pandemic. However, little is known about disadvantaged groups' experiences of Long Covid, and preliminary evidence suggests they may be under-represented in those who access formal care. We will conduct a pilot study in a defined geographical area in London, United Kingdom to test the feasibility of a community-based approach of identifying Long Covid cases that have not been clinically diagnosed and have not been referred to Long Covid specialist services. We will explore the barriers to accessing recognition, care, and support, as well as experiences of stigma and perceived discrimination.

Health and social care professionals need to have personalised tools to evaluate the process of living with Parkinson's disease and consequently, plan individualised and targeted interventions. Recently, the English version of the Living with Long term conditions (LwLTCs) scale has been developed filling an important gap related to person-centred tools to evaluate the process of living with long term conditions among English-speaking population. However, no validation studies for testing its psychometric properties have been conducted. Aim: To analyse the psychometric properties of the LwLTCs scale in a wide English-speaking population living with Parkinson's disease.

There are strong moral and ethical arguments for good quality PPI. Despite the development of guidance aimed at addressing the inconsistent reporting of PPI activities within research, little progress has been made in documenting the steps taken to undertake PPI and how it influences the direction of a study. Without this information, there are minimal opportunities to share learnings across projects and strengthen future PPI practices.

Recent reports have suggested that early life exposure to microbiome altering medications, such as antibiotics and laxatives, could impact the risk of atopic eczema in infancy and childhood. For example, Lin et al., 2022, reported an increased risk of allergic disease in offspring whose mother used laxatives in pregnancy independent of laxative exposure in the offspring but no associations were found for maternal antibiotic use. As the evidence on this topic is sparse, we aimed to examine whether maternal gestational exposure to antibiotics or laxatives were associated with the risk of atopic eczema in infancy as well as the link between offspring antibiotic exposure in the first 12 months of life and risk of infantile atopic eczema.

Understanding the complexity of delirium in critical illness and its deleterious outcome has expanded since early reports. Delirium is a culmination of predisposing and precipitating risk factors that result in a transition to delirium. Known risks range from advanced age, frailty, medication exposure or withdrawal, sedation depth, and sepsis. Because of its multifactorial nature, different clinical phenotypes, and potential neurobiological causes, a precise approach to reducing delirium in critical illness requires a broad understanding of its complexity. Refinement in the categorization of delirium subtypes or phenotypes (i.e., psychomotor classifications) requires attention. Recent advances in the association of clinical phenotypes with clinical outcomes expand our understanding and highlight potentially modifiable targets. Several delirium biomarkers in critical care have been examined, with disrupted functional connectivity being precise in detecting delirium. Recent advances reinforce delirium as an acute, and partially modifiable, brain dysfunction, and place emphasis on the importance of mechanistic pathways including cholinergic activity and glucose metabolism. Pharmacologic agents have been assessed in randomized controlled prevention and treatment trials, with a disappointing lack of efficacy. Antipsychotics remain widely used after \"negative\" trials, yet may have a role in specific subtypes. However, antipsychotics do not appear to improve clinical outcomes. Alpha-2 agonists perhaps hold greater potential for current use and future investigation. The role of thiamine appears promising, yet requires evidence. Looking forward, clinical pharmacists should prioritize the mitigation of predisposing and precipitating risk factors as able. Future research is needed within individual delirium psychomotor subtypes and clinical phenotypes to identify modifiable targets that hold the potential to improve not only delirium duration and severity, but long-term outcomes including cognitive impairment.

This review aims to synthesize the evidence for the influence of community nutrition environments, spatial access to food outlets, and consumer nutrition environments, environments inside food outlets, on adolescent food purchasing and dietary behaviors in high-income countries. Six databases were searched for articles published before January 2023. Results were synthesized using a vote-counting technique and effect direction plots that record the direction of the effect in relation to the anticipated relationship with health. Thirty-four observational and two intervention studies met the inclusion criteria. In the 13 studies assessing adolescent exposure to healthy community nutrition environments, results did not show clear associations with dietary and purchasing outcomes. Thirty studies assessed adolescents' exposure to unhealthy community nutrition environments with the majority (n = 17/30, 57%) reporting results showing that greater exposure to food outlets classified as unhealthy was associated with less healthy food purchases and dietary intakes. Inconsistent results were observed across the seven studies investigating associations with the consumer environment. Further research in these areas, including more high-quality intervention studies, may help to develop policy strategies to improve adolescents' dietary behaviors. Theme: Workforce & Health Systems Micronutrient use in critical care Cameron LK, Lumlertgul N, Bear DE, Cooney E, McKenzie C, Ostermann M Micronutrients, principally vitamins and minerals, play an important role both in health and in disease.

[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282183](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282183) It is widely acknowledged that social network support plays an important role in the quality of life and illness management of breast cancer survivors. However, the factors and processes that enable and sustain such support are less well understood. This paper reports baseline findings from a prospective UK national cohort of 1,202 women with breast cancer (aged <50 years at diagnosis), recruited before starting treatment, conducted in 2016-2019. Descriptive, univariate and multivariate regression analyses explored associations between the individual, and network member characteristics, and the type of support provided. Social network members provided a substantial level of illness-related, practical and emotional support. Highest contribution was provided by friends, followed by close family members. The social network members of women who did not have a partner provided a higher level of support than those in networks with a partner. Women without higher education were more reliant on close family members than those with higher education, and this was more so for women without a partner. Women with higher education without a partner were more reliant on friends and were overall best supported. Women without higher education who did not have a partner were overall least well supported. They had much smaller networks, were highly reliant on close family members, and on high level contributions from all network members. There is a need to develop network-based interventions to support people with a cancer diagnosis, prioritising support for the groups identified as most at risk. Interventions that support engagement with existing network members during treatment, and those that help extend such networks after treatment, are likely to be of benefit. A network perspective can help to develop tailored support and interventions by recognising the interactions between network and individual level processes Theme: Workforce & Health Systems The association between multi-disciplinary staffing levels and mortality in acute hospitals: a systematic review Dall'Ora, C., Rubbo, B., Saville, C. et al.

Only two studies included other health professionals, providing scant evidence about their effect. Conclusions Pathways for allied health professionals such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists, dietitians, pharmacists, to impact safety and other patient outcomes are plausible and should be explored in future studies.

(March 2023). Aims Studies of health services reveal a focus on provision of scheduled care at the expense of patient need, placing the health service in a position of power and the patient as passive recipient. This secondary qualitative analysis of a focused ethnography draws on the Foucauldian concept of power as pervasive and relational, to examine how an imbalance of power is manifested in situations where people with both cancer and dementia are being treated for cancer. Design Secondary qualitative analysis of a focused ethnographic study. Data Sources In the original study, qualitative data were gathered from observation and interviews with people with cancer and dementia (n = 2), caregivers (n = 7) and staff (n = 20). The study was conducted in the outpatient departments of two teaching hospitals in England between January 2019 and July 2021. Data from all sources were analysed for this secondary analysis using constant comparison. Results The principal theme was balance, encapsulating the competing priorities involved in delivering cancer treatment. There was tension between maintaining safety and ensuring an individual's right to treatment, and difficulty reconciling the needs of the system with the needs of individuals. Conclusion The pervasive nature of power can be harnessed to enhance the agency of people with cancer and dementia by incorporating principles of shared decision making. Theme: Long Term Conditions, Ageing & Dementia The Causes and Impact of Crisis for People with Parkinson's Disease: A Patient and Carer Perspective Agarwal Kipps C. 21 June 2021 Background: The reasons for acute hospital admissions among people with Parkinson's disease are well documented. However, understanding of crises that are managed in the community is comparatively lacking. Most existing literature on the causes of crisis for people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) uses hospital data and excludes the individual's own perspective on the crisis trigger and the impact of the crisis on their care needs. Objective: To identify the causes and impact of crises in both community and hospital settings, from a patient and carer perspective. Methods: A total of 550 UK-based PwP and carers completed a survey on (a) their own personal experiences of crisis, and (b) their general awareness of potential crisis triggers for PwP. Results: In addition to well-recognised causes of crisis such as falls, events less widely associated with crisis were identified, including difficulties with activities of daily living and carer absence. The less-recognised crisis triggers tended to be managed more frequently in the community. Many of these community-based crises had a greater impact on care needs than the better-known causes of crisis that more frequently required hospital care. PwP and carer responses indicated a good general knowledge of potential crisis triggers. PwP were more aware of mental health issues and carers were more aware of cognitive impairment and issues with medications. Conclusion: These findings could improve care of Parkinson's by increasing understanding of crisis events from the patient and carer perspective, identifying under-recognised crisis triggers, and informing strategies for best recording symptoms from PwP and carers. Theme: Long Term Conditions What are the modifiable factors of treatment burden and capacity among people with Parkinson's disease and their caregivers: A qualitative study Qian Yue Tan , Helen C. Roberts, Simon D. S. Fraser, Khaled Amar, Kinda Ibrahim March 30, 2023 Background People with long-term conditions must complete many healthcare tasks such as take medications, attend appointments, and change their lifestyle. This treatment burden and ability to manage it (capacity) is not well-researched in Parkinson's disease. Objective To explore and identify potentially modifiable factors contributing to treatment burden and capacity in people with Parkinson's disease and caregivers. Methods Semi-structured interviews with nine people with Parkinson's disease and eight caregivers recruited from Parkinson's disease clinics in England (ages 59-84 years, duration of Parkinson's disease diagnosis 1-17 years, Hoehn and Yahr (severity of Parkinson's disease) stages 1-4) were conducted. Interviews were recorded and analyzed thematically. Results Four themes of treatment burden with modifiable factors were identified: 1) Challenges with appointments and healthcare access: organizing appointments, seeking help and advice, interactions with healthcare professionals, and caregiver role during appointments; 2) Issues obtaining satisfactory information: sourcing and understanding information, and satisfaction with information provision; 3) Managing medications: getting prescriptions right, organizing polypharmacy, and autonomy to adjust treatments; and 4) Lifestyle changes: exercise, dietary changes, and financial expenses. Aspects of capacity included access to car and technology, health literacy, financial capacity, physical and mental ability, personal attributes and life circumstances, and support from social networks. Conclusions There are potentially modifiable factors of treatment burden including addressing the frequency of appointments, improving healthcare interactions and continuity of care, improving health literacy and information provision, and reducing polypharmacy. Some changes could be implemented at individual and system levels to reduce treatment burden for people with Parkinson's and their caregivers. Recognition of these by healthcare professionals and adopting a patient-centered approach may improve health outcomes in Parkinson's disease. Theme: Healthy Communities Childhood overweight and obesity at the start of primary school: External validation of pregnancy and early-life prediction models Nida Ziauddeen,, Paul J. Roderick, Gillian Santorelli, John Wright, Nisreen A. Alwan June 2022 Abstract Tackling the childhood obesity epidemic can potentially be facilitated by risk-stratifying families at an early-stage to receive prevention interventions and extra support. Using data from the Born in Bradford (BiB) cohort, this analysis aimed to externally validate prediction models for childhood overweight and obesity developed as part of the Studying Lifecourse Obesity PrEdictors (SLOPE) study in Hampshire. BiB is a longitudinal multi-ethnic birth cohort study which recruited women at around 28 weeks gestation between 2007 and 2010 in Bradford. The outcome was body mass index (BMI) 91st centile for overweight/obesity at 4-5 years. Discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Calibration was assessed for each tenth of predicted risk by calculating the ratio of predicted to observed risk and plotting observed proportions versus predicted probabilities. Data were available for 8003 children. The AUC on external validation was comparable to that on development at all stages (early pregnancy, birth, ~1 year and ~2 years). The AUC on external validation ranged between 0.64 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.66) at early and 0.82 (95% CI to 0.84) at ~2 years 0.67) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.84) on model development in SLOPE. Calibration was better in the later model stages (early life ~1 year and ~2 years). The SLOPE models developed for predicting childhood overweight and obesity risk performed well on external validation in a UK birth cohort with a different geographical location and ethnic composition.

Context: Children born to parents who are overweight or obese have a high risk of adult obesity, but it is unclear if transgenerational associations relating to unfavorable body composition differ by parent. Objective: To examine differential mother-offspring and father-offspring associations in body composition in early childhood. Methods: A total of 240 mother-father-offspring trios from a prospective UK population-based pre-birth cohort (Southampton Women's Survey) were included for anthropometry and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry assessment of whole-body-less-head body composition in the offspring at 3 different ages (4, 6-7, and 8-9 years) and in the mother and father at the 8- to 9-year offspring visit. Associations were assessed using linear regression adjusting for the other parent. Results: Positive associations between mother-daughter body mass index (BMI) and fat mass were observed at ages 6 to 7 (BMI: = .29 SD/SD, 95% CI = .10, .48; fat mass = .27 SD/SD, 95% CI = .05, .48) and 8 to 9 years (BMI: = .33 SD/SD, 95% CI = .13, .54; fat mass = .31 SD/SD, 95% CI = .12, .49), with similar associations at age 4 years but bounding the 95% CI. The mother-son, father-son, and father-daughter associations for BMI and fat mass were weaker at each of the ages studied. Conclusion: A strong association between the fat mass of mothers and their daughters but not their sons was observed. In contrast, father-offspring body composition associations were not evident. The dimorphic parent-offspring effects suggest particular attention should be given to early prevention of unfavorable body composition in girls born to mothers with excess adiposity. Theme: Healthy Communities, COVID-19, Mental Health Psychological distress experienced by parents caring for an immunosuppressed child during the COVID-19 pandemic Corine Driessens, Lynne Mills, Patel, Chappell, Saul N. Faust, Hans de Graaf, Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has proved unique in both its unpredictability and the extent to which it has continued to impact on daily life since March 2020. Among the immunosuppressed population the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic are cumulative to the ever-present challenges of living with a long-term condition. This prospective longitudinal study explored patterns of concern experienced by 467 British parents caring for an immunosuppressed child during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic and related this to parental mental wellbeing. Most parents slowly adapted or were resilient to the ever-changing stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, 12% experienced high levels of concern throughout the first 2 years of the pandemic. This group was also more likely to report emotional mental health problems towards the end of this period. The experience of emotional mental health problems among parents caring for an immunosuppressed child was related to low household income, single parenting, difficult access to greenspace, and higher level of exposure to COVID positive cases and COVID restrictions (North of England). Parents reported that optimism, reduction of isolation, and support promoted coping and management of the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. More reliable COVID information and periodic medical-condition-specific guidance would have been appreciated. These findings can increase clinical awareness of high-risk parental groups and make an important contribution to the planning of appropriate targeted psychological family interventions.

Many studies have not considered prospective data from early childhood, thus potentially neglecting the importance of the early childhood period in explaining this intergenerational transmission. Given that serial partnering has become increasingly commonplace it is important research considers those who experience multiple partnership dissolution. This paper examines, using data from the 1970 British Birth Cohort Study, the early life mediators underpinning the association between parental separation and the number of offspring partnership dissolutions. Among both men and women there is a significant unadjusted relationship between parental separation and the experience of multiple partnership dissolutions in adulthood. These associations were reduced once parental confounders and childhood mediators are included. Formal mediation analyses demonstrated that early life mediators accounted for more of the association in men than women. Mediators included childhood living standards, and for men child cognition and child behaviour, and for women maternal mental wellbeing. Parental separation and many early life mediators were related to the likelihood of multiple partnership dissolutions through age at first partnership.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040260822000089?via%3Dihub#sec0045) [External web link - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040260822000089?via%3Dihub#sec0045](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040260822000089?via%3Dihub#sec0045) Theme: Healthy Communities Inequalities in energy drink consumption among UK adolescents: a mixed-methods study [Authors: Vogel C, Shaw S, Str\u00f6mmer S, Crozier S, Jenner S, Cooper C, Baird J, Inskip H, Barker M.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36472075/#affiliation-1) [Objective: To examine energy drink consumption among adolescents in the United Kingdom (UK) and associations with deprivation and dietary inequalities.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36472075/#affiliation-1) [Design: Quantitative dietary and demographic data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) repeated cross-sectional survey were analysed using logistic regression models.

These recommendations are based on the existing literature and the expertise of the authors who are specialists in geriatric medicine. The recommendations are addressed to LTCF management, their operators, physicians working in LTCFs and also politicians, to provide the necessary framework conditions. We are confident that our recommendations will offer important help and guidance for LTCFs as well as their physicians. Adherence to these recommendations is likely to improve the outcomes and care of residents in long-term facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00391-021-01847-1) [External web link - https://doi.org/10.1007/s00391-021-01847-1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00391-021-01847-1) Theme: Ageing & Dementia Clinical Nurse Specialist Role in Young Onset Dementia Care.

Qualitative and mixed-method studies with a qualitative component that relate to usual care in Parkinson's disease were included. Quantitative studies and grey literature were excluded. Data synthesis was conducted using framework synthesis.Results1757 articles were screened, and 39 articles included. Understanding treatment burden in PwP and caregivers was not the primary aim in any of the included studies. The main issues of treatment burden in Parkinson's disease are: 1) work and challenges of taking medication; 2) healthcare provider obstacles including lack of patient-centered care, poor patient-provider relationships, lack of care coordination, inflexible organizational structures, lack of access to services and issues in care home or hospital settings; and 3) learning about health and challenges with information provision. The treatment burden led to physical and mental exhaustion of self-care and limitations on the role and social activities of PwP and caregivers.Conclusion:There are potential strategies to improve the treatment burden in Parkinson's disease at an individual level such as patient-centered approach to care, and at system level by improving access and care coordination between services.
