In these cases, you shouldn't be charged more than your plan's Copayments, Coinsurance, and/or Deductible. WHAT IS \"BALANCE BILLING\" (SOMETIMES CALLED \"SURPRISE BILLING\" )? When you see a doctor or other health care Provid er, you may owe certain Out-of-Pocket costs , like a Copayment, Coinsurance, or Deductible. You may have additional costs or have to pay the entire bill if you see a Provider or visit a health care facility that isn't in your health plan's network. \"Out -of-Network\" means Providers and facilities that haven't signed a contract with your health plan to provide services . Out-of-Network providers may be allowed to bill you for the difference between what your plan pays and the full amount charge d for a service. This is called \" balance billing .\" This amount is likely more than In-Network costs for the same service and might not count toward your plan's Deductible or annual Out-of-Pocket Limit. \"Surprise billing \" is an unexpected balance bill. This can happen when you can't control who is involved in your care \u2014like when you have an emergency or when you schedule a visit at an In- Network facility but are unexpectedly treated by an Out-of-Network Provider. Surprise medical bills could cost thousands of dollars depending on the procedure or service. YOU'RE PROTECTED FROM BALANCE BILL ING FOR: Emergency services If you have an Emergency Medical Condition and get emergency services from an Out-of-Network Provider or facility, the most they may bill you is your plan's In-Network cost-sharing amount (such as Copayments , Deductibles, and Coinsurance) . You can't be balance bill ed for these emergency services. This includes services you may get after you're in stable condition , unless you give written consent and give up your protections not to be balanced billed for these post -stabilization services. Certain services at an In-Network Hospital or Ambulatory Surgical Center When you get services from an In-Network Hospital or Ambulatory Surgical Center , certain Providers there may be Out-of-Network . In these cases, the most those Providers can bill you is your plan's In-Network cost-sharing amount . This applies to emergency medicine , anesthesia, pathology, radiology, laboratory, neonatology, assistant surgeon, hospitalist, or intensivist services. These Providers can't balance bill you and may not ask you to give up your protections not to be balance billed . If you get other types of services at these In-Network facilities, Out-of-Network Providers can't balance bill you, unless you give written consent and give up your protections . You're never required to give up your protections from balance billing . You also aren't required to get Out-of-Network care. You can choose a Provider or facility in your plan's network. WHEN BALANCE BILLING ISN'T ALLOWED, YOU ALSO HAVE THESE PROTECTIONS : You're only responsible for paying your share of the cost (like the Copayments, Coinsurance, and Deductibles that you would pay if the Provider or facility was In-Network ). Your health plan will pay any additional costs to Out-of-Network Providers and facilities directly. Generally, your health plan must: DocuSign Envelope ID: 79F9B025-EEB8-425C-B821-73F779C6772C 18-1064 (01 -23) Surprise Billing Notice - Fully Insured Page 2 of 2 Cover emergency services without requiring you to get approval for services in advance (also known as \"Prior Authorization \"). Cover emergency services by Out-of-Network Providers. Base what you owe the Provider or facility (cost -sharing ) on what it would pay an In-Network Provider or facility and show that amount in your explanation of benefits. Count any amount you pay for emergency services or Out-of-Network services toward your In-Network Deductible and Out-of-Pocket Limit.

There are tw o ways for an Insured to submit a claim: 1. The health care Provider (hospital, doctor, or other facility or specialist) can file the claim for the Insured. Most Providers will submit a claim on an Insured's behalf if the Insured shows them a BCI identif ication card and asks them to send BCI the claim. 2. The Insured can send BCI the claim. To File an Insured's Own Claim If a Provider prefers that an Insured file the claim, here is the procedure to follow: 1. Ask the Provider for an itemized billing. The itemized billing should show each service received and its procedure code and its diagnosis code, the date each service was furnished, and the charge for each service. BCI cannot accept billings that only say \"Balance Due,\" \"Payment Received\" or some similar statement. 2. Obtain a Member Claim Form from the BCI Website , www.bcidaho.com , from the Provider or any of BCI's offices, and follow the instructions. Use a separate billing and Member Claim Form for each patient involved. For OTC COVID -19 Diagnostic Tests, please see the attached Member Claim Form on the following page . 3. Attach the billing to the Member Claim Form and send it to: Blue Cross of Idaho Claims Control Blue Cross of Idaho P.O.

How Blue Cross of Idaho Notifies the Insured BCI will send the Insured an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) either electronically or by mail, as soon as the claim is processed. The EOB will show all the paym ents BCI made and to whom the payments were sent. It will also explain any charges BCI did not pay in full. Insureds should print the electronic copy and keep th e EOB for their records. If an Insured would like a paper copy of their EOB, they may reque st one from BCI Customer Service.

The Insured is financially responsible for Non -Medically Necessary services performed by a Provider who does not have a Provider contract with Blue Cr oss of Idaho. Prior Authorization is a request by the Insured's Contracting Provider to BCI, or delegated entity, for authorization of an Insured's proposed treatment. BCI may review medical records, test results and other sources of information to ensu re that it is a Covered Service and make a determination as to Medical Necessity or alternative treatments.

Noncontracting Providers : Please refer to Attachment A of the Benefits Outline, check the BCI Website at www.bcidaho.com , or call Customer Service at the telephone number listed on the back of the Insured 's Identification Card to determine if the proposed services require Prior Authorization.

The Insured is responsible for notifying BCI if the proposed treatment will be provided by a Noncontracting Provider. Prior Authorization is not a guarantee of payment. It is a pre -service determination of Medical Necessity based on information pro vided to Blue Cross of Idaho at the time the Prior Authorization request is made. Blue Cross of Idaho retains the right to review the Medical Necessity of services, eligibility of services and benefit limitations and exclusions after services are received .

The list of Prescription Drugs covered by the Program may be updated periodically. Please visit the BCI Website, members.bcidaho.com, then click on the Pharmacy link, or call the PBM at 1 -877-638-4008 for Program details.

The Enrollee may include enrolled Eligible Dependents in the Enrollee's application for transfer. B. An enrolled dependent child who ceases to be an Eligible Dependent as specified in the Eligibility and Enrollment Section. C. The Enrollee's spouse (if an Insured) upon entry of a final decree of divorce or annulment. D. The Enrollee's enrolled Eligible Dependents upon the Enrollee's death. To apply for a transfer, the Insured must submit a completed application and the appropriate premium to BCI within thirty (30) days after the loss of eligibility of coverage. If approved, benefits under the new policy are subject to the rates, regulations, terms, and provisions of the new policy. If the Group or BCI terminates this Policy, and the Group provides another health care plan to its employees effective immediately after the termination of this Policy, no Insured will be entitled to this transfer privile ge. XIV. Payment of Benefits The Insured authorizes BCI to make payments directly to Providers rendering Covered Services to the Insured for benefits provided under this Policy. Notwithstanding this authorization, BCI res erves and shall have the right to make such payments directly to the Insured. Except as provided by law, BCI's right to pay an Insured directly is not assignable by an Insured nor can it be waived without BCI's concurrence, nor may the right to receive be nefits for Covered Services under this Policy be transferred or assigned, either before or after Covered Services are rendered. XV. Insured/Provider Relationship A. The choice of a Provider is solely the Insured's. B. BCI does not render Covered Services but only makes payment for Covered Services received by Insureds. BCI is not liable for any act or omission or for the level of competence of any Provider, and BCI has no responsibility for a Provider's failure or refusal to render Covered Services to an Insured. C. The use or nonuse of an adjective such as Contracting or Noncontracting is not a statement as to the ability of the Provider. DocuSign Envelope ID: 79F9B025-EEB8-425C-B821-73F779C6772C GENERAL PROVISIONS (w/o COBRA Admin) 53 XVI. Participating Pla n BCI may, in its sole discretion, make an agreement with any appropriate entity (referred to as a Participating Plan) to provide, in whole or in part, benefits for Covered Services to Insureds, but it shall have no obligatio n to do so. XVII. Coordination of This Policy's Benefits With Other Benefits This Coordination of Benefits (COB) provision applies when an Insured has health care coverage under more than one (1) Contract. Contract is defined below. The Order of Benefit Determination Rules govern the order in which each Contract will pay a claim for benefits. The Contract that pays first is called the Primary Contract. The Primary Contract must pay benefits in accordance with its policy terms without regard to the possibility that another Contract may cover some expenses. The Contract that pays after the Primary Contract is the Secondary Contract. The Secondary Contract may reduce the benefits it pays so that payments from all Contracts does not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the total Allowable Expenses. A. Definitions 1. A Contract is any of the following that provides benefits or services for medical or dental care or treatment. If s eparate Contracts are used to provide coordinated coverage for members of a group, the separate Contracts are considered parts of the same Contract and there is no COB among those separate contracts. a) Contract includes: group and non -group insurance con tracts, health maintenance organization (HMO) contracts, Closed Panel Plans or other forms of group or group type coverage (whether insured or uninsured); medical care components of long - term care contracts, such as skilled nursing care; medical benefits u nder group or individual automobile contracts; and Medicare or any other federal governmental plan, as permitted by law. b) Contract does not include: hospital indemnity coverage or other fixed indemnity coverage; accident only coverage; specified disease or specified accident coverage; limited benefit health coverage, as defined by state law; school accident type coverage; benefit for non -medical components of long -term care policies; Medicare supplement policies; Medicare or any other fe deral governmental plans, unless permitted by law. Each Contract for coverage under a) or b) is a separate Contract. If a Contract has two (2) parts and COB rules apply only to one (1) of the two (2), each of the parts is treated as a separate Contract. 2. This Contract means, in a COB provision, the part of the Contract providing the health care benefits to which the COB provision applies and which may be reduced because of the benefits of other Contracts. Any other part of the Contract providing healt h care benefits is separate from this plan. A Contract may apply one (1) COB provision to certain benefits, such as dental benefits, coordinating only with similar benefits, any may apply under COB provision to coordinate other benefits. 3. The Order of Benefit Determination Rules determine whether This Contract is a Primary Contract or Secondary Contract when the Insured has health care coverage under more than one (1) Contract. When This Contract is primary, it determines payment for its benefits first before those of any other Contract without considering any other Contract's benefits. When This Contract is secondary, it determines its benefits after those of another Contract and may reduce the benefits it pays so that all Contract benefits do not exc eed one hundred percent (100%) of the total Allowable Expense. 4. Allowable Expense is a health care expense, including Deductibles, Coinsurance and Copayments, that is covered at least in part by any Contract covering the Insured. When a Contract provid es benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service will be considered an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. An expense that is not covered by any Contract covering the Insured is not an Allowable Expense. In addition, any e xpense that a provider by law or in accordance with a contractual agreement is prohibited from charging a covered person is not an Allowable Expense. DocuSign Envelope ID: 79F9B025-EEB8-425C-B821-73F779C6772C GENERAL PROVISIONS (w/o COBRA Admin) 54 The following are examples of expenses that are not Allowable Expenses: a) The difference between the cos t of a semi -private hospital room and a private hospital room is not an Allowable Expense, unless one of the Contracts provides coverage for private hospital room expenses. b) If an Insured is covered by two (2) or more Contracts that compute their benefi t payments on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement methodology, or other similar reimbursement methodology, any amount in excess of the highest reimbursement amount for a specific benefit is not an Allowable Expens e. c) If an Insured is covered by two (2) or more Contracts that provide benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, an amount in excess of the highest of the negotiated fees it not an Allowable Expense. d) If an Insured is covered by one (1) C ontract that calculates its benefits or services on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement methodology or other similar reimbursement methodology and another Contract that provides its benefits or services on the bas is of negotiated fees, the Primary Contract's payment arrangement shall be the Allowable Expense for all Contracts. However, if the provider has contracted with the Secondary Contract to provide the benefit or service for a specific negotiated fee or paym ent amount that is different than the Primary Contract's payment arrangement and if the provider's contract permits, the negotiated fee or payment shall be the Allowable Expense used by the Secondary Contract to determine its benefits. e) The amount of an y benefit reduction by the Primary Contract because a covered person has failed to comply with the Contract provisions is not an Allowable Expense. Examples of these types of Contract provisions include second surgical opinions, pre -certificate of admissi ons, and preferred provider arrangements. 5. Closed Panel Plan is a Contract that provides health care benefits to covered persons primarily in the form of services through a panel of providers that have contracted with or are employed by the Group, and that excludes coverage for services provided by other providers, except in cases of emergency or referral by a panel member. 6. Custodial Parent is the parent awarded custody by a court decree or, in the absence of a court decree, is the parent with w hom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year excluding any temporary visitation. B. Order of Benefit Determination Rules When an Insured is covered by two (2) or more Contracts, the rules for determining the order of benefit payments are as follows: 1. The Primary Contract pays or provides its benefits according to its terms of coverage and without regard to the benefits of any other Contract. 2. a) Except as provided in Paragraph 2.b) below, a Contract that does not contain a coordination of benefits provision that is consistent with this regulation is always primary unless the provisions of both Contracts state that the complying Contract is primary. b) Coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designe d to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits and provides that this supplementary coverage shall be excess to any other parts of the Contract provided by the Contract holder. Examples of these types of situations are major medical coverages that are superimposed over base plan hospital and surgical benefits, and insurance type coverages that are written in connection with a Closed Panel Plan to provide out -of-network benefits. DocuSign Envelope ID: 79F9B025-EEB8-425C-B821-73F779C6772C GENERAL PROVISIONS (w/o COBRA Admin) 55 3. A Contract may consider the benefits paid or provided by another C ontract in calculating payment of its benefits only when it is secondary to that other Contract. 4. Each Contract determines its order of benefits using the first of the following rules that apply: a) Non-Dependent or Dependent. The Contract that cover s the Insured other than as a dependent, for example as an employee, member, policyholder, subscriber or retiree is the Primary Contract and the Contract that covers the Insured as a dependent is the Secondary Contract. However, if the Insured is a Medica re beneficiary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is secondary to the Contract covering the Insured as a dependent; and primary to the Contract covering the Insured as other than a dependent (e.g. a retired employee); then the order of benefits betw een the two Contracts is reversed so that the Contract covering the Insured as an employee, member, policyholder, subscriber or retiree is the Secondary Contract and the other Contract is the Primary Contract. b) Dependent Child Covered Under More Than One Contract. Unless there is a court decree stating otherwise, when a dependent child is covered by more than one Contract the order of benefits is determined as follows: (1) For a dependent child whose parents ar e married or are living together, whether or not they have ever been married: The Contract of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar year is the Primary Contract; or if both parents have the same birthday, the Contract that has covered the parent the longest is the Primary Contract. (2) For a dependent child whose parents are divorced or separated or not living together, whether or not they have ever been married: i. If a court decree states that one of the parents is responsible for the dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Contract of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Contract is primary. This rule applies to Contract year commencing after the Contract is given notice of the court dec ree; ii. If a court decree states both parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expenses or health care coverage, the provisions of Subparagraph (1) above shall determine the order of benefits; iii. If a court decree states that the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expenses or health care coverage of the dependent child, the provisions of Subparagraph (1) shall determine the order of benefits; or iv. If there is no court decree allocating responsibility for the dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the order of benefits for the child are as follows: 1. The Contract covering the Custodial Parent; 2. The C ontract covering the spouse of the Custodial Parent; 3. The Contract covering the non -Custodial Parent; and then 4. The Contract covering the spouse of the non -Custodial Parent. For a dependent child covered under more than one Contract of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the provisions of Subparagraph (1) or (2) above shall determine the order of benefits as if those individuals were the parents of the child. c) Active Employee or Retired or Laid -off Employee. The Contract that cove rs an Insured as an active employee, that is, an employee who is neither laid off nor retired, is the Primary Contract. The Contract covering that same Insured as a retired or laid -off employee is the Secondary Contract. The same would hold true if an In sured is a dependent of an active employee and that same Insured is a DocuSign Envelope ID: 79F9B025-EEB8-425C-B821-73F779C6772C GENERAL PROVISIONS (w/o COBRA Admin) 56 dependent of a retired or laid -off employee. If the other Contract does not have this rule, and as a result, the Contracts do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if the rule labeled 4.a) can determine the order of benefits. d) COBRA or State Continuation Coverage. If an Insured whose coverage is provided pursuant to COBRA or under a right of continuation provided by state or other federa l law is covered under another Contract, the Contract covering the Insured as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree or covering the Insured as a dependent of an employee, member, subscriber or retiree is the Primary Contract and the COBRA or state or other federal continuation coverage is the Secondary Contract. If the other Contract does not have this rule, and as a result, the Contracts do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if the rule labeled 4.a) ca n determine the order of benefits. e) Longer or Shorter Length of Coverage. The Contract that covered the Insured as an employee, member, policyholder, subscriber, or retiree longer is the Primary Contract and the Contract that covered the Insured the s horter period of time is the Secondary Contract. f) If the preceding rules do not determine the order of benefits, the Allowable Expenses shall be shared equally between the Contracts meeting the definition of Contract. In addition, This Contract will not pay more than it would have paid had it been the Pr imary Contract. C. Effect on The Benefits Of This Contract 1. When This Contract is secondary, it may reduce its benefits so that the total benefits paid or provided by all Contracts during a Contract year are not more than the total Allowable Expenses. In determining the amount to be paid for any claim, the Secondary Contract will calculate the benefits it would have paid in the absence of other health care coverage and apply that calculated amount to any Allowable Expense under its Contract that is unp aid by the Primary Contract. The Secondary Contract may then reduce its payment by the amount so that, when combined with the amount paid by the Primary Contract, the total benefits paid or provided by all Contracts for the claim do not exceed the total A llowable Expenses for that claim. In addition, the Secondary Contract shall credit to its Contract deductible any amounts it would have credited to its deductible in the absence of other health care coverage. 2. If a covered person is enrolled in two or more Closed Panel Plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of service by a non -panel provider, benefits are not payable by one Closed Panel Plan, COB shall not apply between that Contract and other Closed Panel Plans. D. Facility of Payment A payment made under another Contract may include an amount that should have been paid under This Contract. If it does, BCI may pay that amount to the organization that made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under This Contract. BCI will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes providing benefits in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means the reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services. E. Right of Recovery If the amount of the payments made by BCI is more than it should have paid under this COB provision, it may recover the excess from one or more of the Insureds it has paid or for whom it has paid; or any other Insured or organization t hat may be responsible for the benefits or services provided for the covered Insured. The \"amount of the payments made\" includes the reasonable cash value of any benefits provided in the form of services. XVIII. Benefits for Medicare Eligibles Who Are Covered Under this Policy A. If the Group has twenty (20) or more employees, any Eligible Employee or spouse of an Eligible Employee who becomes or remains an Insured of the Group co vered by this Policy after becoming DocuSign Envelope ID: 79F9B025-EEB8-425C-B821-73F779C6772C GENERAL PROVISIONS (w/o COBRA Admin) 57 eligible for Medicare (due to reaching age sixty -five (65)) is entitled to receive the benefits of this Policy as primary. B. If the Group has one hundred (100) or more employees or the Group is an organization which includes an employer with one hundred (100) or more employees, any Eligible Employee, spouse of an Eligible Employee or dependent child of an Eligible Employee who becomes or remains an Insured of the Group covered by this Policy after becoming eligible fo r Medicare due to disability is entitled to receive the benefits of this Policy as primary. C. An Insured eligible for Medicare based solely on end stage renal disease is entitled to receive the benefits of this Policy as primary for eighteen (18) months only, beginning with the month of Medicare entitlement, if Medicare entitlement is effective before March 1, 1996. If Medicare entitlement is effective on or after March 1, 1996, the Insured is entitled to receive benefits of this Policy as primary for t hirty (30) months only, beginning with the month of Medicare entitlement. Medicare is secondary during the 30 -month period, known as the coordination period. When this Policy is primary, it pays in accordance with the terms of this Policy. In certain ci rcumstances, such as when using a Noncontracting Provider, Insureds may be responsible for amounts in excess of the Maximum Allowance. Medicare does not typically permit billing for amounts in excess of the Maximum Allowance, when it is primary. Insureds should contact Medicare for more information about their options. XIX. Indemnity By The Group and Blue Cross of Idaho Anything contained in this Policy notwithstanding, including any limitation on damages, the Group and BCI agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other from and against any claim, demand, expense, loss, damage, cost, judgment, fee or liability the other receives, incurs or sustains that is caused by or arises out of any negligent act or omission of the indemnifying party related to this Policy. The indemnification obligation of the Group is subject to the limitations of the Idaho Tort Claims Act, including dollar amounts. XX. Incorporated By Reference All of the terms, limitations and exclusions of coverage contained in this Policy are incorporated by reference into all sections, endorsements, riders, and amendments and are as effective as if fully expressed in each one unless specifically noted to the contrary.

DocuSign Envelope ID: 79F9B025-EEB8-425C-B821-73F779C6772C GENERAL PROVISIONS (w/o COBRA Admin) 59 D. Insured's Rights to an Independent Ex ternal Review Please read this carefully. It describes a procedure for review of a disputed health claim by a qualified professional who has no affiliation with BCI. If an Insured or their authorized representative requests an independent external review of a claim, the decision made by the independent reviewer will be binding and final on BCI. The Insured or their authorized representative will have the right to further review the claim by a court, arbitrator, mediator or other dispute resolution entity only if your plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as more fully explained below under \"Binding Nature of the External Review Decision.\" If BCI issues a final Adverse Benefit Determination of an Insured's reques t to provide or pay for a health care service or supply, an Insured may have the right to have BCI's decision reviewed by health care professionals who have no association with BCI. An Insured has this right only if BCI's denial decision involved: The Medical Necessity, appropriateness, health care setting, level of care, or effectiveness of an Insured's health care service or supply, or BCI's determination that an Insured's health care service or supply was Investigational. An Insured must first exhau st BCI's internal grievance and appeal process. Exhaustion of that process includes completing all levels of appeal. Exhaustion of the appeals process is not required if BCI failed to respond to a standard appeal within thirty -five (35) days in writing or to an urgent appeal within three business days of the date the Insured filed the appeal, unless the Insured requested or agreed to a delay. BCI may also agree to waive the exhaustion requirement for an external review request. The Insured may file for an internal urgent appeal with BCI and for an expedited external review with the Idaho Department of Insurance at the same time if the Insured's request qualifies as an \"urgent care request\" defined below. An Insured may submit a written request for an exte rnal review to: Idaho Department of Insurance ATTN: External Review 700 W State St, 3rd Floor Boise ID 83720 -0043 For more information and for an external review request form: See the department's Website , www.doi.idaho.gov, or Call the tel ephone number, (208) -4250, or toll -free in Idaho, 1 -800-721- 3272. An Insured may act as their own representative in a request or an Insured may name another person, including an Insured's treating health care provider, to act as an authorized represen tative for a request. If an Insured wants someone else to represent them, an Insured must include a signed BCI's \"Appointment of an Authorized Representative\" form with the request before BCI determines that an individual has been authorized to act on beha lf of the Insured. The form can be found on BCI's Website at www.bcidaho.com. An Insured's written external review request to the Department of Insurance must include a completed form authorizing the release of any medical records the independent review o rganization may require to reach a decision on the external review, including any judicial review of the external review decision pursuant to ERISA, if applicable. The department will not act on an external review request without an Insured's completed aut horization form. If the request qualifies for external review, BCI's final Adverse Benefit Determination will be reviewed by an independent review organization selected by the Department of Insurance. BCI will pay the costs of the review. Standard Externa l Review Request: An Insured must file a written external review request with the Department of Insurance within four (4) months after the date BCI issues a final notice of denial. 1. Within seven (7) days after the Department of Insurance receives the request, the Department of Insurance will send a copy to BCI. 2. Within fourteen (14) days after BCI receives the request from the Department of Insurance, we will review the request for eligibility. Within five (5) business days after BCI completes DocuSign Envelope ID: 79F9B025-EEB8-425C-B821-73F779C6772C GENERAL PROVISIONS (w/o COBRA Admin) 60 that review, we will notify the Insured and the Department of Insurance in writing if the request is eligible or what additional information is needed. If BCI denies the eligibility for review, the Insured may appeal that determination to the Department. 3. If the request is eligible for review, the Department of Insurance w ill assign an independent review organization to your review within seven (7) days of receipt of BCI's notice. The Department of Insurance will also notify the Insured in writing. 4. Within seven (7) days of the date you receive the Department of Insuranc e's notice of assignment to an independent review organization, the Insured may submit any additional information in writing to the independent review organization that they want the organization to consider in its review. 5. The independent review organi zation must provide written notice of its decision to the Insured, BCI and to the Department of Insurance within forty -two (42) days after receipt of an external review request. Expedited External Review Request: An Insured may file a written \"urgent care request\" with the Department of Insurance for an expedited external review of a pre -service or concurrent service denial. The Insured may file for an internal urgent appeal with BCI and for an expedited external review with the Idaho Department of Insura nce at the same time. \"Urgent care request\" means a claim relating to an admission, availability of care, continued stay or health care service for which the covered person received Emergency Services but has not been discharged from a facility, or any Pr e-Service Claim or concurrent care claim for medical care or treatment for which application of the time periods for making a regular external review determination: 1. Could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the Insured or the ability of the Insu red to regain maximum function; 2. In the opinion of the Provider with knowledge of the covered person's medical condition, would subject the Insured to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the disputed care or treatment; or 3. The treat ment would be significantly less effective if not promptly initiated. The Department of Insurance will send your request to us. BCI will determine, no later than the second (2nd) full business day, if the request is eligible for review. BCI will notify t he Insured and the Department of Insurance no later than one (1) business day after BCI's decision if the request is eligible. If BCI denies the eligibility for review, the Insured may appeal that determination to the Department of Insurance. If the requ est is eligible for review, the Department of Insurance will assign an independent review organization to the review upon receipt of BCI's notice. The Department of Insurance will also notify the Insured. The independent review organization must provide no tice of its decision to the Insured, BCI and to the Department of Insurance within seventy -two (72) hours after the date of receipt of the external review request. The independent review organization must provide written confirmation of its decision within forty -eight (48) hours of notice of its decision. If the decision reverses BCI's denial, BCI will notify the Insured and the Department of Insurance of BCI's intent to pay for the covered benefit as soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than one ( 1) business day after receiving notice of the decision. Binding Nature of the External Review Decision: If the Group is subject to the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) laws (generally, any plan offered through an employer to its em ployees), the external review decision by the independent review organization will be final and binding on BCI. The Insured may have additional review rights provided under federal ERISA laws. If the Group is not subject to ERISA requirements, the extern al review decision by the independent review organization will be final and binding on both BCI and the Insured. This means that if the Insured elects to request external review, the Insured will be bound by the decision of the independent review organizat ion. The Insured will not have any further opportunity for review of BCI's denial after the independent review organization issues its final decision . If the Insured chooses not to use the external review process, other options for resolving a disputed cla im may include mediation, arbitration or filing an action in court. DocuSign Envelope ID: 79F9B025-EEB8-425C-B821-73F779C6772C GENERAL PROVISIONS (w/o COBRA Admin) 61 Under Idaho law, the independent review organization is immune from any claim relating to its opinion rendered or acts or omissions performed within the scope of its duties unless perform ed in bad faith or involving gross negligence. XXII. Plan Administrator \u2014COBRA BCI is not the plan administrator for compliance with the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) and any amendments to it. Except for services BCI has agreed to perform regarding COBRA, the Group is responsible for satisfaction of notice, disclosure, and other obligations if these laws are applicable to the Group. XXII I. Reimbursement of Benefits Paid By Mistake If BCI mistakenly makes payment for benefits on behalf of an Enrollee or their Eligible Dependent(s) that the Enrollee or their Eligible Dependent(s) is not entitled to under this Policy, the Enrollee must reimburse the erroneous payment to BCI. The reimbursement is due and payable as soon as BCI notifies the Enrollee and requ ests reimbursement. BCI may also recover such erroneous payment from any other person or Provider to whom the payments were made. If reimbursement is not made in a timely manner, BCI may reduce benefits or reduce an allowance for benefits as a set -off to ward reimbursement. Even though BCI may elect to continue to provide benefits after mistakenly paying benefits, BCI may still enforce this provision. This provision is in addition to, not instead of, any other remedy BCI may have at law or in equity. XXIV. Subrogation and Reimbursement Rights of Blue Cross of Idaho The benefits of this Policy will be available to an Insured when the Insured is injured, suffers harm or incurs loss due to any act, omission, or defective or unreasonably hazardous product or service of another person, firm, corporation or entity (hereinafter referred to as \"third party\"). To the extent that such benefits for Covered Services are provided or paid for by Blue Cross of Idaho under this Policy or any other Blue Cross of Idaho plan, agreement, certificate, contract or policy, Blue Cross of Idaho shall be subrogated and succeed to the rights of the Insured or, in the event of the Insured's death, to the rights of their heirs, estate, and/or personal representative. As a condition of receiving benefits for Covered Services in such an event, the Insured or their personal representative shall furnish Blue Cross of Idaho in writing with the names, addresses and contact informat ion of the third party or parties that caused or are responsible, or may have caused or may be responsible for such injury, harm or loss, and all facts and information known to the Insured or their personal representative concerning the injury, harm or los s. In addition, the Insured shall furnish the name and contact information of the liability insurer and its adjuster of the third party including the policy number of any liability insurance that covers, or may cover, such injury, harm, or loss. Blue Cr oss of Idaho may at its option elect to enforce either or both of its rights of subrogation and reimbursement. Subrogation is taking over the Insured's right to receive payments from other parties. The Insured or their legal representative will transfer to Blue Cross of Idaho any rights the Insured may have to take legal action arising from the injury, harm or loss to recover any sums paid on behalf of the Insured. Thus, Blue Cross of Idaho may initiate litigation at its sole discretion, in the name of the Insured, against any third party or parties. Furthermore, the Insured shall fully cooperate with Blue Cross of Idaho in its investigation, evaluation, litigation and/or collection efforts in connection with the injury, harm or loss and shall do nothin g whatsoever to prejudice Blue Cross of Idaho's subrogation rights and efforts. Blue Cross of Idaho will be reimbursed in full for all benefits paid even if the Insured is not made whole or fully compensated by the recovery. Moreover, Blue Cross of Idaho is not responsible for any attorney's fees or other expenses or costs incurred by the Insured without prior written consent of Blue Cross of Idaho and, therefore, the \"common fund\" doctrine does not apply to any amounts recovered by any attorney the Insur ed hires regardless of whether amounts recovered are used to repay benefits paid by Blue Cross of Idaho, or otherwise. Additionally, Blue Cross of Idaho may at its option elect to enforce its right of reimbursement from the Insured, or their legal representative, of any benefits paid from monies recovered as a result of the injury, harm or loss. The Insured shall fully coo perate with Blue Cross of Idaho in its investigation, evaluation, litigation DocuSign Envelope ID: 79F9B025-EEB8-425C-B821-73F779C6772C GENERAL PROVISIONS (w/o COBRA Admin) 62 and/or collection efforts in connection with the injury, harm or loss and shall do nothing whatsoever to prejudice Blue Cross of Idaho's reimbursement rights and efforts. The Ins ured shall pay Blue Cross of Idaho as the first priority, and Blue Cross of Idaho shall have a constructive trust and an equitable lien on, all amounts from any recovery by suit, settlement or otherwise from any third party or parties or from any third par ty's or parties' insurer(s), indemnitor(s) or underwriter(s), to the extent of benefits provided by Blue Cross of Idaho under this Policy, regardless of how the recovery is allocated ( i.e., pain and suffering) and whether the recovery makes the Insured who le. Thus, Blue Cross of Idaho will be reimbursed by the Insured, or their legal representative, from monies recovered as a result of the injury, harm or loss, for all benefits paid even if the Insured is not made whole or fully compensated by the recovery. Moreover, Blue Cross of Idaho is not responsible for any attorney's fee s or other expenses or costs incurred by the Insured without prior written consent of Blue Cross of Idaho and, therefore, the \"common fund\" doctrine does not apply to any amounts recovered by any attorney the Insured hires regardless of whether amounts rec overed are used to repay benefits paid by Blue Cross of Idaho, or otherwise. To the extent that Blue Cross of Idaho provides or pays benefits for Covered Services, Blue Cross of Idaho's rights of subrogation and reimbursement extend to any right the Insur ed has to recover from the Insured's insurer, or under the Insured's \"Medical Payments\" coverage or any \"Uninsured Motorist,\" \"Underinsured Motorist,\" or other similar coverage provisions, and workers' compensation benefits. Blue Cross of Idaho shall have the right, at its option, to seek reimbursement from, or enforce its right of subrogation against, the Insured, the Insured's personal representative, a special needs trust, or any trust, person or vehicle that holds any payment or recovery from or on beh alf of the Insured including the Insured's attorney. Blue Cross of Idaho's subrogation and reimbursement rights shall take priority over the Insured's rights both for benefits provided and payments made by Blue Cross of Idaho for Covered Services, and fo r benefits to be provided or payments to be made by Blue Cross of Idaho in the future on account of the injury, harm or loss giving rise to Blue Cross of Idaho's subrogation and reimbursement rights. Further, Blue Cross of Idaho's subrogation and reimburs ement rights for such benefits and payments provided or to be provided are primary and take precedence over the rights of the Insured, even if there are deficiencies in any recovery or insufficient financial resources available to the third party or partie s to totally satisfy all of the claims and judgments of the Insured and Blue Cross of Idaho. Collections or recoveries made by an insured for such injury, harm or loss in excess of such benefits provided and payments made shall first be allocated to such future benefits and payments that would otherwise be owed by the Plan on account of the injury, harm or loss giving rise to Blue Cross of Idaho's subrogation and reimbursement rights, and shall constitute a Special Credit applicable to such future benefit s and payments that would otherwise be owed by Blue Cross of Idaho under this or any subsequent Blue Cross of Idaho Plan or coverage. Thereafter, Blue Cross of Idaho shall have no obligation to provide any further benefits or make any further payments unt il the Insured has incurred medical expenses in treatment of such injury, harm, or loss equal to such Special Credit. XXV. Independent Blue Cross And Blue Shield Plans The Group (on behalf of itsel f and its Insured s) hereby expressly acknowledges its understanding this Policy constitutes a contract solely between the Group and BCI, which is an independent corporation operating under a license from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, an assoc iation of independent Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans (the \"Association\"), permitting BCI to use the Blue Cross Service Marks in the state of Idaho, and that BCI is not contracting as the agent of the Association.

This paragraph shall not create any additional obligations whatsoever on the part of BCI other than those obligations created under other provisions of this Policy. XXV I. Statements In the absence of fraud, all statements made by an applicant or the policyholder or by an enrolled person shall be deemed representations and not warranties, and no statement made for the purpose of acquiring insurance shall void such insurance or reduce benefits unless contained in a written instrument signed by the policyholder or the enrolled person.

XXVI II. Out -of-Area Services Overview Blue Cross of Idaho has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensees, referred to generally as \"Inter -Plan Arrangements.\" These Inter -Plan Arrangements operate under rules and procedures issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (\"Association\"). Whenever Enrollees access healthcare services outside the geographic area Blue Cross of Idaho serves, the claim for those services may be processed through one of these Inter - Plan Arrangements. The Inter -Plan Arrangements are described generally below. Typically, when accessing care outside the geographic area Blue Cross of Idaho serves, Enrollees obtain care from healthcare Providers that have a contractual agree ment (\"participating Providers\") with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that other geogra phic area (\"Host Blue\"). In some instances, Enrollees may obtain care from healthcare Providers in the Host Blue geographic area that do not have a c ontractual agreement (\"nonparticipating Providers\") with the Host Blue. Blue Cross of Idaho remains responsible for fulfilling our contractual obligations to Enrollees. Blue Cross of Idaho payment practices in both instances are described below. All claim types are eligible to be processed through Inter -Plan Arrangements, as described above, except for all Dental Care Benefits, except when paid as medical claims/benefits, and those Prescription Drug Benefits or Vision Care Benefits that may be administered by a third party contracted by Blue Cross of Idaho to provide the specific service or services. A. BlueCard\u00ae Program The BlueCard\u00ae Program is an Inter -Plan Arrangement. Under this Arrangement, when Enrollees access Covered Services within the geographic area served by a Host Blue/outside the geographic area Blue Cross of Idaho serves, the Host Blue will be responsible for contracting and handling all interactions with its participating healthcare Providers. The financial terms of the BlueCard Program are described generally below. Liability Calculation Method Per Claim Unless subject to a fixed dollar Copayment, the calculation of t he Enrollee liability on claims for Covered Services will be based on the lower of the participating Provider's billed charges for Covered Services or the negotiated price made available to Blue Cross of Idaho by the Host Blue. Host Blues determine a nego tiated price, which is reflected in the terms of each Host Blue's healthcare Provider contracts. The negotiated price made available to Blue Cross of Idaho by the Host Blue may be represented by one of the following: (i) An actual price. An actual price is a negotiated rate of payment in effect at the time a claim is processed without any other increases or decreases; or (ii) An estimated price. An estimated price is a negotiated rate of payment in effect at the time a claim is processed, reduced or increased by a percentage to take into account certain payments negotiated with the Provider and other claim - and non -claim -related transactions. Such transactions may include, but are not limited to, anti -fraud and abuse recoveries, Provider refunds not applied on a claim -specific basis, retrospective settlements and performance -related bonuses or incentives; or (iii) An average price. An average price is a percentage of billed charges for Covered Services in effect at the time a claim is processed representing the aggregate payments negotiated by the Host Blue with all of its healthcare Providers or a similar classification of its Providers and DocuSign Envelope ID: 79F9B025-EEB8-425C-B821-73F779C6772C GENERAL PROVISIONS (w/o COBRA Admin) 64 other claim - and non -claim -related transac tions. Such transactions may include the same ones as noted above for an estimated price. Host Blues determine whether or not they will use an actual, estimated or average price. Host Blues using either an estimated price or an average price may prospecti vely increase or reduce such prices to correct for over - or underestimation of past prices (i.e., prospective adjustment may mean that a current price reflects additional amounts or credits for claims already paid or anticipated to be paid to Providers or refunds received or anticipated to be received from Providers). However, the BlueCard Program requires that the amount paid by the Enrollee is a final price; no future price adjustment will result in increases or decreases to the pricing of past claims. Th e method of claims payment by Host Blues is taken into account by Blue Cross of Idaho in determining your premiums. B. Special Cases: Value -Based Programs BlueCard Program Blue Cross of Idaho has included a factor for bulk distributions from Host Blues in the Group's premium for Value -Based Programs when applicable under this Contract. Additional information is available upon request. If Blue Cross of Idaho has entered into a Negotiated Arrangement with a Host Blue to provide Value - Based Programs to the Group's Enrollees, Blue Cross of Idaho will follow the same procedures for Value -Based Programs as noted above for the BlueCard Program. C. Prepayment Review and Return of Overpayments If a Host Blue conducts prepayment review activities including , but not limited to, data mining, itemized bill reviews, secondary claim code editing, and DRG audits, the Host Blue may bill BCI up to a maximum of 16 percent of the savings identified, unless an alternative reimbursement arrangement is agreed upon by BC I and the Host Blue, and these fees may be charged to the Group. If a Host Blue engages a third party to perform these activities on its behalf, the Host Blue may bill BCI the lesser of the full amount of the third -party fees or up to 16 percent of the sa vings identified, unless an alternative reimbursement arrangement is agreed upon by BCI and the Host Blue, and these fees may be charged to the Group. Recoveries from a Host Blue or its participating and nonparticipating Providers can arise in several ways, including, but not limited to, anti -fraud and abuse recoveries, audits/healthcare provider/hospital bill audits, credit balance audits, utilization r eview refunds and unsolicited refunds. Recoveries will be applied so that corrections will be made, in general, on either a claim -by-claim or prospective basis. If recovery amounts are passed on a claim -by-claim basis from a Host Blue to Blue Cross of Idaho, they will be credited to the Group account. In some cases, the Host Blue will engage a third party to assist in identification or collection of recovery amounts. The fees of such a third party may be charged to the Group as a percentage of the recovery. D. Inter -Plan Programs: Federal/State Taxes/Surcharges/Fees In some instances federal or state laws or regulations may impose a surcharge, tax or other fee that applies to insured accounts. If applicable, Blue Cross of Idaho will include any such surcharge, tax or other fee in determining the Group's premium. E. Nonparticipating Providers Outside Blue Cross of Idaho Service Area Please refer to the Additional Amount of Payment Provisions section in this Policy. F. Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core General Information If Enrollees are outside the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (hereinafter: \"BlueCard service area\"), they may be able to take advantage of BCBS Global Core when accessing Covered Services. BCBS Global Core is unli ke the BlueCard Program available in the BlueCard service area in certain ways. For instance, although BCBS Global Core assists Enrollees with accessing a network of Inpatient, outpatient and professional Providers, the network is not served by a Host Blue . As such, when Enrollees receive care from Providers outside the BlueCard service area, the Enrollees will typically have to pay the Providers and submit the claims themselves to obtain reimbursement for these services. DocuSign Envelope ID: 79F9B025-EEB8-425C-B821-73F779C6772C GENERAL PROVISIONS (w/o COBRA Admin) 65 Inpatient Services In most cases, if Enrollees contact the BCBS Global Core e service center for assistance, hospitals will not require Enrollees to pay for covered Inpatient services, except for their Deductibles, Coinsurance, and/or Copayments, if applicable. In such cases, the hospital will submit Enrollee claims to the BCBS Global Core service center to initiate claims processing. However, if the Enrollee paid in full at the time of service, the Enrollee must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement for Covered Services. Enrollees must contact Blue Cross of Idaho to obtain precertification for non - emergency Inpatient services. Outpatient Services Physicians, urgent care centers and other outpatient Providers located outside the BlueCard service area will typically require Enrollees to pay in full at the time of service. Enrollees must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement for Covered Services. Submitting a BCBS Global Core Claim When Enrollees pay for Covered Services outside the BlueCard service area, they must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement. For institutional and professional claims, Enrollees should complete a BCBS Global Core claim form and send the claim form with the Provider's itemized bill(s) to the BCBS Global Core service center address on the form to initiate claims processing. The claim form is available from Blue Cross of Idaho, the BCBS Global Core service center or online at www. bcbsglobalcore .com . If Enrollees need assistance with their claim submissions, they should call the BCBS Global Core service center at 1 .800.810.BLUE (2583) or call collect at 1.804.673.1177, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. XXIX. Replacement Coverage If this Policy replaces prior Group coverage within sixty (60) days of the date of termination of prior coverage, BCI shall immediately cover all employees and dependents validly covered under the prior coverage at the date of termination who meet the Group's eligibility requirements an d who would otherwise be eligible for coverage under this Policy, regardless of any exclusions or limitations relating to active employment or nonconfinement. The previous paragraph is subject to all other provisions of Idaho Code Section 41 -2215, includi ng BCI's right to deduct from any benefits becoming payable under this Policy the amount of benefits under the prior Group coverage pursuant to an extension of benefits provision for Insureds who are Totally Disabled. XXX. Individual Benefits Management Individual Benefits Management allows BCI to provide alternative benefits in place of specified Covered Services when alternative benefits allow the Insured to achieve optimum health care in the most cost -effective way. The decision to allow alternative benefits will be made by BCI in its sole and absolute discretion on a case -by- case basis. BCI may allow alternative benefits in place of specified Covered Services when an Insured, or the Insured's legal guardian a nd their Physician concur in the request for and the advisability of alternative benefits. BCI reserves the right to modify, limit, or cease providing alternative benefits at any time. A determination to cover alternative benefits for an Insured shall no t be deemed to waive, alter, or affect BCI's right to reject any other requests or recommendations for alternative benefits. XXX I. Coverage And Benefits Determinations BCI is vested with authority and discretion to determine whether a claim for benefits is covered under the terms of this Policy, based on all the terms and provisions set forth in this Policy, and also to determine the amount of benefits owed on claims whi ch are covered. XXXI I. Health Care Providers Outside the United States The benefits available under this Policy are also available to Insureds traveling or living outside the United States. T he Inpatient Notification and Prior Authorization requirements will apply. If the Provider is a Contracting Provider with BlueCard, the Contracting Provider will submit claims for reimbursement on behalf of the Insured. Reimbursement for Covered Services will be made directly to the Contracting Provider. If the Health Care Provider does not participate with BlueCard, the Insured will be responsible for payment of services and submitting a claim for reimbursement to BCI. BCI will require the original cla im along with an English translation. It is the Insured's responsibility to provide this information. DocuSign Envelope ID: 79F9B025-EEB8-425C-B821-73F779C6772C GENERAL PROVISIONS (w/o COBRA Admin) 66 BCI will reimburse covered Prescription Drugs purchased outside the United States by Insureds who live outside the United States where no suitable alter native exists. Reimbursement will also be made in instances where Insureds are traveling and new drug therapy is initiated for acute conditions or where emergency replacement of drugs originally prescribed and purchased in the United States is necessary. The reimbursable supply of drugs in travel situations will be limited to an amount necessary to assure continuation of therapy during the travel period and for a reasonable period thereafter. Finally, there are no benefits for services, supplies, drugs or other charges that are provided outside the United States, which if had been provided in the United States, would not be a Covered Service under this Policy. XXX III. Summaries of Benefits and Coverage BCI shall timely prepare (and update) Summaries of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) for the Policy(s) as required by Section 2715 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). The SBC(s) will be provided by BCI in an electronic format to the Group for distribution to its employees, dependents, retirees and COBRA eligible Insureds if applicable. The Group shall provide all necessary benefit plan information in a timely manner to BCI for the preparation of the Group's SBC(s). The SBC(s) will be distributed to its emp loyees, dependents, retirees and COBRA eligible Insureds if applicable by the Group in compliance with requirements of Section 2715 of the PHSA.
