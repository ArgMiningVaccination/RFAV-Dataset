Most people have received some form of IV therapy in their lifetime, typically receiving fluids during a hospital stay. Vitamin C infusions are delivered nearly identically to all other forms of intravenous therapy. We only use Non-corn, Non-GMO Vitamin C. Vitamin C has such broad applications because it is a key factor in collagen production in the skin, blood vessels, ligaments, and bones it directly boosts the immune system, and it has a potent antioxidant function. Collagen is the structural protein found in all animal tissue. It holds our muscles to our bones, provides structural support for veins and arteries, and more. Vitamin C is required for collagen synthesis along with the amino acids proline and lysine. When you don't have enough collagen, you may have thin skin and weaker blood vessels, bones, tendons, and ligaments. This can lead to aneurysms (blood vessel wall thinning), possible stroke, and even the ruptured ligaments and tendons commonly seen in sports injuries. High doses of vitamin C when administered by IV can bolster skin and connective tissue and prevent these outcomes. Vitamin C may have a direct effect on infectious agents like bacteria, viruses, and even cancer cells. The use of Vitamin C in cancer is still controversial but is being studied and is promising. At very high doses it can generate peroxide (H2O2) which may account for this effect. Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant that helps protect cell structures like collagen, proteins, and DNA from damage by free radicals which are common in high-stress states, chronic illness, and infections. Research has shown that the antioxidant properties of vitamin C can reduce the severity of symptoms associated with the H1N1 influenza virus and is considered an important add-on therapy in surviving the flu. Vitamin C even in high doses of 1.5 grams/ kg (over 100 grams) is safe and tolerated very well with very few side effects Vitamin C (ascorbate) is a powerful antioxidant and several critical enzymes require vitamin C in the synthesis of collagen from proline and lysine. Vitamin C is, therefore, required for the maintenance of normal connective tissue as well as for wound healing since the synthesis of connective tissue is the first event in wound tissue remodeling. Vitamin C is also necessary for bone remodeling due to the presence of collagen in the organic matrix of bones. Vitamin C is required for the conversion of tyrosine to epinephrine (adrenalin), and the synthesis of the bile. It is present in high amounts in the adrenal gland cortex and these levels are depleted after the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation of the gland and synthesis of the stress hormone cortisol, which is why it's important to replete vitamin C levels during times of high stress. Vitamin C therapy has been used by some providers to treat: Some providers also utilize high-dose vitamin C therapy to help aid the body's natural recovery process. Like all forms of IV therapy, the amount of vitamin C that will be prescribed varies depending on the nature of your ailments. Vitamin C therapy is commonly considered a form of micronutrient infusion. As the name implies, vitamin C therapy is delivered intravenously. This means that a small IV drip is inserted into the arm and delivers steady amounts of vitamin C for a short time. Some vitamin C treatment plans consist of multiple sessions. Vitamin C therapy is most often performed in a medical office setting and is administered by a medical professional. The amount of time taken during a session will vary depending on the condition being treated and the amount of vitamin C being delivered. Vitamin C infusions feature few side effects and are generally a painless procedure. Before beginning any vitamin C therapy, it's important to make note of any medications or supplements you are currently taking. High dose vitamin C infusions, a form of IV therapy, may provide relief for a variety of health ailments and painful conditions.
