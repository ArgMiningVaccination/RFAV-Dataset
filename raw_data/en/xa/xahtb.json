The Curricula r Affairs Committee approved proposals for a new Undergraduate Certificate in Integrative Health Care submitted by the College of Nursing and Health Sciences (CNHS) , Department of Rehabilitation and Movement Science, and a new Continuing and Distance Education (CDE) Ce rtificate cates, Karen Westervelt will serve as the Educational Director, and C ara Feldman- Hunt as the Administrative director . The two certificates are identical in their rationales, pedagogical goals, and curricula. They differ only in the sponsoring unit, advis ing, and the students eligible for enrollment. Matriculated UVM students would enroll in the Undergraduate Certificate in Integrative Healthcare; non -UVM students would enroll in the CDE Certificate in Integrative Heathcare. If approved by the Faculty Senate and Board of Trustees , the program s will be offered beginning fall 2018 . Program Description and Rationale The proposed certificates in Integrative Health Care seek to inform undergraduate students about the methods, evidence base, and philosophical underpinnings of integrative health and medicine. Students in the minor will learn about the use of integrative health and medicine in health promotion and disease preventi on, and how it can address the important aims of enhancing the patient experience, improving population health, reducing costs, and improving health care workforce burnout and dissatisfaction. The primary goal s of the certificates are to 1) educate studen ts about this model of health care, help them become better health care professionals, 2) enable them to identify what further training they may need to become health care providers who can be responsive to patient choices and needs, balancing traditional methods of care and those that are considered complementary approaches , and 3) enable students to experience a variety of alternative and complementary health care modalities and to personally experience how this could be integrated into a health and welln ess plan. A consumer -led movement for greater access to natural medicine and complementary and alternative health care approaches (e.g., acupuncture and oriental medicine, therapeutic massage, etc.) gained 2 significant attention from mainstream medicine following the publication of David Eisenberg's research on \"Unconventional medicine in the United States. Prevalence, costs, and patterns of use\" in The New England Journal of Medicine ( Eisenberg et al., 1993 ). The NIH National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) was formed in 1998 to serve as the federal government's lead agency for scientific research on complementary and integrative health approache s recognizing the importance of understanding and investigating integrative health. The NCCIH 2016 strategic plan (https://nccih.nih.gov/about/strategic -plans/2016 ) calls for increased knowl edge to advance our understanding of integrati ve health care. The proposed certificates were developed in response to this increased interest and call for advancement of understanding . Integrative medicine and health is a vital and growing field and through the inter -professional collaboration of the University of Vermont Medical Center, the Lar ner College of Medicine, and CNHS. Over the past year and a half, representatives of CNHS , the Larner College of Medicine, and the UVM Medical Center have met to design a comprehensive program in the field of integrative medicine and health. This effort will have curricular, clinical, research and outreach components. The proposed certificates would be part of the curricular offerings that can reach students and health professionals that have interest in integrative health and/or are seeking to complement their credentials. Relationship to Existing Programs The proposers indicate that there are no other certificates offered at UVM that are similar in content or have an overlap in focus. Diet, exercise, and access to a healthy environment, including but not limited to healthy food, air and water, are essential to human health and well -being. This means that a number of departments across the university offer cou rses that will be appropriate electives for students enrolled in the Integrative Healthcare Certificates . The Behavioral Change Health Studies Minor in the Larner College of Medicine is the most similar program . While the courses in the Behavioral Change Health Studies Minor are complementary to the proposed certificates, they are not redundant. The Integrative Healthcare certificates' focus is to prepare future health care professionals for an understanding of complementary practices in health care, while the focus of the Behavior Change Health Studies Minor is the neuroscience of behavior change. Dr. Jim Hudziak, Director of the Behavior Change Minor, provided a memo of support for the proposed certificates in Integrative Healthc are, and indicates neg ligible overlap. Curriculum Completion of the proposed certificates requires 15 credit hours (9 required credits and 6 experiential learning elective credits). Students may take no more than three one -credit courses to assure that a broad gener al knowledge of Integrated Healthcare is achieved.

The Integrative Healthcare Educational Director will assist UVM undergraduates with curricular decisions specifically related to the certificate program . Individuals that meet the requirements for CDE programs will be eligible to enroll in the CDE Certif icate in Integrative Healthcare. Students will be required to submit a written statement of interest. CDE will advise and support student knowledge of the CDE certificate. CDE students will be advised by CDE advisors who will work with the Integrative Heal thcare Educational Director to assist with curricular decisions related to the certificate program. Anticipated Enrollment and Impact on Current Programs The propose rs indicate that they expect a cohort of approximately 15 students per year , and do not anticipate impact on existing programs . Assessment Plan Current CNHS program evaluation tools (see below) would be implemented to assess the new minor . Individual courses will be additionally evaluated through student evaluations, peer evaluations and In tegrative Health Education Committee discussion. Department and CNHS evaluation tools include: Course and instructor evaluations Advising surveys Student exit surveys Survey of graduates Survey of community service- learning partners Survey of employers Research papers, publications Course offerings that may relate to content in the Integrative Healthcare Certificate will be examined by the Integrative Health Education Committee to ensure that the courses developed have sufficient substance and cover relevant and best practice. The Integrative Healthcare Education Committee will ensure course content is in accordance with the Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine & Health ( http://www.imconsortium.org /). A process for routing and approval of such courses has been agreed upon and already has begun. Program evaluations will be the responsibility of the Educational Program Director and CNHS Curriculum Committee, and will use existing UVM processes and t he outcome criteria listed above. Staffing Plan, Resource Requirements , and Budget No new faculty appointments are necessary to support this program. The Libraries have already purchased supporting materials necessary for the required courses. 5 Evidence of Support Positive letters of support were provided from: - Cynthia Belliveau, Dean of Continuing and Distance Learning - Mike Cannizzaro, Chair of the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders - Rosemary Dale, Chair of the Department of Nursi ng - James Hudziak, Professor, Departments of Psychiatry, Medicine & Pediatrics and Communication Sciences (Director of the Behavior Change Minor) - Nancy Matthews, Dean of the Rubenstein School - Patricia Prelock, Dean of the College of Nursing and Health Sciences - Jeremy Sibold, Chair of the Department of Rehabilitation & Movement Science - Shelly Velleman, Chair of the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders Summary Interest in integrative healthcare is growing at UVM and nation- wide. These certific ate programs will provide a broad- based education in the theoretical and experiential underpinnings of Integrative Healthcare, including scientific and philosophical models, treatment modalities, and the policies affecting implementation. Students (UVM, professionals, and community members) will have the opportunity to learn policies and practices that promote incorporating integrative healthcare into clinical practice. Therefore, these two certificates will be valuable addi tions to "}
