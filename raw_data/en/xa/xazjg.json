The strategy covers us e of alcohol, illicit and licit (prescribed and over-the-counter) drugs withi n its remit, and em phasises that the harmful use of alcohol in Wales is far more widespread than that of illegal drugs. Its dominant focus is the reduction of harm associated with substance misuse. Four priority action areas are identified in the Strategy: preventing harm; support for substance misusers; supporting and protecting families; and tackling availability. Aims and methodology The main aims of the evaluation were to determine whether or to what extent: (1) All aspects of the Strategy have been implemented, particularly with regard to treatment; (2) The intention to prov ide \"wrap around services\" ( eg accommodation, education, training, employment) for clients during and at the end of tr eatment, has been fully implemented; (3) Good practice has been followed; (4) Resources have been allocated effectivel y with regard to what is known about the effectiveness of different types of substance misuse interventions; (5) Statistics are being used effectively to monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of treatment agencies, includi ng the progress of individual clients over time. (6) There is evidence of reductions in ha rm arising from the im plementation of the Strategy. At the time of the fieldw ork significant changes were underway in the substance misuse field in Wales, incl uding a shift from local to regional level commissioning of services, a revision of the national Key Pe rformance Indicators , the bedding in of a new data recording system, and the transfe r of control of Home Office funds (distributed via the Welsh Government) for substance misusing offenders from the Drug Intervention Programme (DIP) to the incoming elected Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs). The ev aluation focuses mainly on t he system prior to these changes, but also comments on their likely implications. The results are based on the following methods and sources of information: (1) reviews and analysis of existing internal and exter nal documents and reports; (2) a focused review of the general research literature on 'what works' in relation to substance misuse; (3) scrutiny of available statisti cal data from national databases; (4) analysis of previous eval uations of aspects of subst ance misuse interventions in Wales; 5 (5) formal recorded interviews with 52 key stakeholders in Wales, including government officers, commissioners, GPs and consultants, and managers of service providers and criminal justic e agencies, though not service users; (6) informal discussions with many others in the field. Limitations in time, resource s and available evidence meant that not all of the above aims could be fully addressed. The findings are based predominantly on the views and experiences of stakeholders rather than quantitative data. The first part of the report ex amines the history, aims an d content of the Strategy and the extent to which it is based on evidence about effective ways of tackling substance misuse. The second part investigates the im plementation of the St rategy, looking at the 'fitness for purpose' of the struct ures and governance arr angements through which it has been put into practice; the coherenc e (or fragmentation) of the system of interventions that has been produced; and ev idence of and views about this system's overall 'effectiveness'. The report concludes with recommendations for change in light of the findings. Part One. The Strategy: Content and Evidence Base Part One first looks briefly at how the S ubstance Misuse Strategy was developed, including the roles played by key individuals and groups, the extent to which they built on previous strategies, how much consul tation they undertook, and what ideas or evidence they drew upon. The evidence gat hered suggests that the design of the Strategy was guided by clear principles (including a focus on harm reduction, a balance between drugs and alcohol, and par tnership approaches) which had wide support in Wales and drew on a range of ideas, experience and evidence. Wide consultations were undertaken across gov ernment and with external stakeholders, and APoSM, a panel of experts in substance misuse representing a diverse range of organisations, played an important advisory role. Research evidence was used extensively, if not always in a systematic fashion. An analysis of the content of the Strategy document shows that it is broadly consistent with global evidence about effective ways of tackling substance misuse. Based on a 'systematic review of systematic reviews', it is clear that there is good international evidence to justify the strong focus on support to substance misusers, and particularly the use of pharmaceutical interventions to provide maintenance, as well as psychosocial interventions. There is also some support for the use of schools-based preventive interventions, and for the use of brief interventions for alcohol misusers. Most stakeholder interviewees were k nowledgeable about the Strategy, and most considered it a good document, particular mention being made of its broad scope, the inclusion of alcohol, and its readability and cl arity. A small mi nority felt there was insufficient attention to particular issues or client groups, including offenders and non- traditional service users. Some respondents thought that the 10-ye ar time frame was too long to remain fully relevant as circumstances and views changed. However, others welcomed the longer time frame, not least as a barrier against over-hasty reactions to 'fashionable' ideas or political imperatives. 6 Part Two. Implementing the Strategy: Systems, Structures, Governance, Impact Part Two begins by identifying a number of fundamental tensions and dilemmas that impact upon efforts to tackle a problem as large and complex as that of substance misuse. These include: 1. Differing views about the relative effectiveness of - and hence the relative weight to give to - different ways of re sponding to substance misuse. 2. Differing views about how and how far to a dapt the implementati on of the Strategy in response to changing expert views, new evidence, or political or media concerns, as well as the emergence of new drugs or new patterns of substance misuse. 3. Tensions between the aim of implementing reasonably consistent services across Wales, and the aim of responding e ffectively to local needs. 4. Tensions in commissioning between com petition, collaboration, and the need for continuity. These tensions emerged repeatedly in vari ous guises in the interviews with stakeholders. Allocation of resources Chapter 5 describes the main funding streams for substance misuse services in Wales, and explores the fairness and effectiveness of the various mechanisms by which the available resources were and are allocated to particular activities. These include the drawing up of broad Implementation Plans; decis ions about what specific services will be delivered or commissioned; and decisions about which providers will deliver them. It is concluded that t he Substance Misuse Branch has always had considerable influence - mainly through its ow nership of the three-year Implementation Plans, the intermediary role played by t he Substance Misuse Advisory Regional Teams (SMARTs), and its ultimate control of the 'purse stri ngs' - on the broad shape of the services to be commissioned in lo cal areas. Nevertheless, within this framework, there was ample space for local decisions about the precise nature of the interventions to be commissioned and whic h agencies would deliver them - until recently such power resided mainly in the hands of commissioners at CSP level. There were wide variations across the c ountry in the nature, quality, fairness, effectiveness and transparency of the processes followed, and ranges in practice from areas where competitive commissioning was t he norm, to those where most contracts were routinely renewed without competition. Most interviewees agreed that there were some excellent commissioners and so me whose practices left much to be desired. It was also pointed out that t here was no satisfactory way of complaining about the latter. On the question of whether the advent of Area Planning Boards (APBs), the regional commissioning bodies replacing CSP level commissioners, are likely to produce a more strategic approach, mo re consistency and a higher quality of commissioning, stakeholder views were mixed. Most interv iewees felt that they had the potential for 7 better decision-making and more strategi c approaches, although some fears were expressed that they could be pushed off tr ack by powerful individuals, for example advocating the interests of particular local ar eas within the region. It was also pointed out that definitive guidance about the ro le and powers of APBs had been slow in materialising, and that in its absence considerable diffe rences had already emerged across Wales in how the Chairs interpreted their tasks. However, following a Welsh Government review of APBs, such guidance was issued shortly after the completion of our research. The system as a whole: coverage, balance, coherence and fragmentation Chapter 6 presents a broad pi cture (based on Welsh Govern ment records) of the results of the planning and commissioning arrangements described in the previous chapter. It first attemp ts to 'map' the totality of services , projects and interventions that have been implemented in Wales through the various funding streams, and uses the results to assess how well these cover the main areas identified in the Strategy, the overall balance between them , and whether there are any significant gaps. Despite some gaps in the information it was clear that, while the services funded span the whole range of interventions proposed in t he Strategy document, by far the greatest emphasis (in terms of both num bers of projects and allocati on of funding) was placed on just one of the four action areas in the Strategy, 'suppor t for substance misusers'. This covered a range of services, the most common being treatment through prescribing or psychosocial interventions. Co mparatively little investment was made in 'Preventing harm' or 'Tackling availability'. Despite this apparent imbalance, most interviewees were reasonably happy with the distribution of funding between action areas. Perhaps the strongest area of disagreement was between interviewees with health and other backgrounds, over the level of priority that should be given to clinical treatment as against psychosocial interv entions and 'wrap around' support. In terms of the operation of the system as a whole, t here was wide agreement among stakeholders that it varied widely in quality and cohesion across Wales, services in many areas being handicapped by fragmentation and duplication, and that an individual's 'journey' through them was often not smooth or 'seamless'. Too often, it was disrupted by agency rivalries, comp lex funding arrangem ents, or lack of communication and coordination. Some held out hope that such problems would be ameliorated by the advent of APBs. At the same time, some serious concerns were voiced about the possible loss of services for offenders - and knock-on effects on the system as a whole - if the incoming PCCs decided to spend the funds previously used to run the Drug Implementat ion Programme (which will no longer be ring-fenced) elsewhere. Oversight, monitoring and change management Chapter 7 examines the structures and info rmation systems through which oversight is maintained both of the activities of individual agencies and of the implementation of the Substance Misuse Strategy as a whole. This may be for purposes of monitoring compliance with contracts, assessing e ffectiveness, ensuring accountability, or informing policy change. Few interviewees expressed confidence in the accuracy and value of the KPIs used to monitor performance at local and individual provider level, and most welcomed the imminent shift to more outcome-focused measures. Most providers and 8 commissioners also agreed that the fair est and most productive means of understanding how well an agency was carrying out its tasks was to consider formal performance indicators alongside more qua litative data, servic e user feedback, and discussions at monitoring meetings. A small number of service pr oviders pointed out that, wher eas their work was closely scrutinised, that of commissioners was not, and that there should be more formal complaints mechanisms for providers dissa tisfied with procedures or decisions. Deficiencies were also ident ified in terms of oversight of the implementation of the Strategy as a whole. The Implementati on Board was seen as potentially the key body to comment on how well implementation of the Strategy was going, and to challenge government officers if problems were apparent. However, the Board was widely described as too big and unwieldy, losing focus, and prone to becoming bogged down in detail. A need for a broader kind oversight of the Strategy - involving strategic thinking about the general 'directi on of travel' - was also identif ied, especially at a time when new patterns of substance misuse were emerging and new responses (such as the 'recovery' agenda) were being advocated. The key body mentioned in this context was APoSM which, having played a prom inent part in the development of the Strategy, appeared to have had relati vely little influence thereafter. Chapter 7 ends with a brief overview of t he kinds of data available with which to assess the effectiveness of the implementation of the Strat egy. It is argued that the national database (WNDSM), suffers with major problems of inaccuracy and missing data, and that - although TOP data are potent ially valuable in measuring a range of short-term outcomes of treat ment - it does not allow longitudinal monitoring of the progress of service users. Where resear ch and evaluation are concerned, a number of isolated studies were found, but they were not collected in one place and there appeared to be no systematic research plan. It is concluded that there is a case for such a plan to be built into the Implementation Plan. What can be concluded about the effectiveness of the implementati on of the Strategy? Chapter 8 addresses the most difficult question in the report: what do the available data and evidence tell us about the overall e ffectiveness of the im plementation of the Substance Misuse Strategy? As it was not part of the remit to conduct any original research, this can be tackled only by drawing upon previous studies and evaluations, published information from the national database, and information and opinions emerging from stakeholder interviews. It is concluded that, although the Welsh Gove rnment is clearly committed to using monitoring, evaluation and research to develop and improve its substance misuse services, there is relatively little strong ev idence about the effectiveness of individual projects, particular types of intervention, or indeed the implementat ion of the Strategy as a whole. This is largely because of weaknesses in the design of the various instruments and databases for collecting information, combined with poor compliance among practitioners in supplying requested da ta accurately and fully. Furthermore, while a number of internal and external evaluations have been undertaken, these have generally not been planned system atically and have often been dogged by problems of the availability of appropriate data. T hey have also often been short in duration and commissioned too late in the day to ensur e that appropriate dat a collection systems are developed from the outset. 9 In short, in terms of what can be said with confidence about the effectiveness of the implementation of the Strategy, the list is ra ther short. It is clear from WNDSM data that waiting times for a ssessment and treatment have r educed, and from TOP data that, among those entering treatment, there have been at least short-term improvements in alcohol and drug use, physical and psychological health, and quality of life, although large amounts of missing data call these findings into some question. The available published research also cont ains a few positive findings, especially short-term reductions in substance misuse and progress in relation to social problems, but again caveats must be entered because of weaknesses in data and methodology. The overall conclusion has to be that the w hole area of data collection, monitoring and evaluation is one that needs close and systematic attention. Indeed, it could be argued that a planned programme of research and evaluation should be built into the Strategy and its Implementation Plans. Conclusions and recommendations Chapter 9 summarises the findings of the research, and pr esents ten broad conclusions and a set of recommendations arising from them, as follows: Conclusions 1. The Strategy is essentially sound, and has widespread support. The emphasis on alcohol as well as illicit drugs is also widely praised. 2. All main elements of t he Strategy have been implem ented, although considerably more resources have been devoted to 'supporting substance misusers' (in the shape of treatment and psychosocial support) than to the other action areas of the Strategy. This distributi on of resources is supported by stakeholders, with a few exceptions. 3. There is strong international evidence for the effectiveness (in terms of reduced substance misuse) of opiate substitute pr escribing and psycho-social interventions. Of course, although this applies at a general level it does not necessarily show that the specific interventions implem ented in Wales are effective. 4. Good progress has been made in the provision of 'wrap around support', especially through the implementation of the ESF-f unded Wales Peer Mentoring project, which aims to help ex-substance misuse rs into employment. However, wrap around support services remain patchy across the country, and links between treatment units and those providing such services could be improved. 5. The commissioning processes through wh ich, until recently, resources were distributed to service providers through CSPs, were variable in fairness, effectiveness and transparency, and decisions were often difficult for providers to challenge. 6. The main body charged with oversight of the implementation of the Strategy, the Substance Misuse Strategy Implement ation Board, is widely agreed to be ineffective. 10 7. APoSM played an important role in the development of the Strategy, but has been ineffective and underused in terms of broad over sight of whether shifts in direction are needed as ideas and circumstances change. 8. While we did not interview substance mi susers ourselves, there was fairly broad agreement among stakeholders that service users' experiences could vary widely between areas, and that insufficient co llaboration and coordination between different providers could lead to duplication and fragmentation of the services they received. This finding is echoed in the recent Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (2012) review of substance misuse serv ices, which reported that although there are many examples across Wales of excell ent practice to avoid such problems, there remains much 'patchiness' and inconsistency between area s. 9. The WNDSM is not currently produc ing information that adequately assesses performance or measures outcomes. There is some statistical evidence that the implementation of the Strategy has had a positive impact, especially through reductions in waiting lists and drop-outs from treatment, but although there are a few useful measures of trends pres ented in the annual reports (such as encouraging figures showing a continuing reduction in alcohol-related deaths), there is as yet relatively little relia ble evidence about broader and longer term outcomes or trends, most obviously in rela tion to the long term impact of treatment on individuals' levels of substance misuse or their quality of life. 10. There is no clear research and evaluation strategy built into the Substance Misuse Strategy or the implementation plans. Generally speaking, research appears to have been commissioned in an ad hoc fashion, and the results are not collected together in an easily accessible form. While most centrally commissioned projects and pilots have been evaluated, this is not the case with routine interventions across the country. Recommendations Recommendation 1 We recommend that the aims, membersh ip and terms of reference of the Implementation Board are urgently reviewed, with a view to equip it to exercise more effective oversight of the implementation of the Strategy and to challenge the government's performance in this area when necessary. Recommendation 2 We recommend that the aims, operation and membership of APoSM are reviewed in order to equip it to make a more proactive and effective contribution to debates about possible shifts in approach or emphasis during the lifetime of the Strategy. (There is also a case for a formal APoSM-led 'mid-S trategy review'.) Consideration should be given to creating a paid position for t he Chair and/or for members who undertake specific investigations, and to allocating mo re resources for suppo rt to the Board (eg for literature searches, small-scale re search commissioning, or data analysis). Recommendation 3 We recommend that considerat ion is given to the creati on of a formal complaints procedure in respect of commissioning and other decisions made by APBs. 11 Recommendation 4 We recommend that a thorough review is carried out of the WNDSM in order to determine what kinds of information are most useful for the monitoring of service provision and the meaningful measurement of out comes, with a view to ceasing the collection of redundant information and focusi ng on data that has a clearly useful purpose. Priority should also be given to finding the most effective ways of tracking the progress of individuals across different providers over time. Recommendation 5 We recommend that actions are taken to ensure that compliance with data entry requirements moves closer to 100 per cent , especially in relation to pieces of information that (we suggest) are flagged as essential. Dialogue with those responsible for providing the data should include explanations of how the databases have been improved, as well as more feedback of the results of analysis, in order to convince them that their entries are used productively. Recommendation 6 We recommend that more analysis is c onducted on TOP data and the results are published in a more accessible form. Recommendation 7 We recommend that a coherent research and evaluation strategy is built into implementation plans. Evaluations should include not only centrally commissioned projects, but, for example, comparative st udies of the quality of implementation and the impact of psycho-social interventions that are routinely im plemented across the country; a small fund could also be made av ailable on a competitive basis to support evaluations of local innovative practice. In addition, while recognising the limitations imposed by current budget restraints, we believe that there is a strong case fo r developing a planned programme of broader research, for example into changing patterns of substance abuse in Wales, or into drug or alcohol problems am ong specific social groups. Such studies - in the oversight of which, we recommend, APoSM should play a major role - would provide a strong evidence base for the development of future Subst ance Misuse Strategies for Wales. Recommendation 8 We recommend that evaluations of in terventions funded by the WG are well signposted and displayed together in an appropriate place on the WG website. There is also a case for creating a numbered se ries of studies with standard covers. Consideration should also be given to collect ing together evaluations that have been commissioned or produced at local level and pl acing the best of them on the website too. Recommendation 9 We recommend that continuing careful atte ntion is paid by the Substance Misuse branch to the working practices and governance of APBs, which we regard as critical to the effective implementation of the Strategy. This should build on, and monitor the implementation of, its recent guidelines (iss ued after the completion of our research), focusing on issues such as the membership of APBs; their powers; their strategic and commissioning roles; their relations with CSPs and the Substance Misuse Branch; 12 their administrative and information support systems; and their governance, including complaints procedures. Further consideration should be given and, if thought appropriate, advice should be issued about how best to assess need across a region; how to ensure that balance is maintained between expenditure on, sa y, medical treatm ent and 'wrap-around services' as funds shrink; and the kinds of commissioning processes that should be followed (eg in terms of balance between sp ecifying services precisely and allowing flexibility; or the extent to wh ich services should be 'competed'). Recommendation 10 We recommend that contingency plans shou ld be drawn up to help fill the serious gaps in service provision that will arise if P CCs in one or more areas decide to use the existing DIP funds for other purposes. Recommendation 11 We recommend that continuing serious consi deration is given to ways of improving service users' experience of substance misu se interventions by 'joining up' services more effectively: for example through fu rther development of information sharing arrangements, common referral and assess ment instruments, coordinated 'hand- overs' at exit points from particular serv ices, and more single points of contact, 'one stop shops' and co-location of agencies. Fu rther efforts should also be made to improve links and streamline referral rout es between treatment agencies and those providing 'wrap around' services such as assistance with housing, training and employment. 13 PART ONE: THE STRATEGY, BACKGROUND, CONTENT, EVIDENCE BASE 14 CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION Background and aims of the research This report presents the findings of a shor t study aimed at making a broad assessment of the effectiveness of the implementation to date of the Substance Misuse Strategy for Wales 2008-2018.1 Within this remit, the ma in objectives were to determine whether or to what extent: (1) All aspects of the Strategy have been implemented, particularly with regard to treatment (eg outreach services, responding to new patterns of substance misuse and waiting times); (2) The intention to prov ide \"wrap around services\" (e.g. accommodation, education, training, employment) for clients during and at the end of tr eatment, has been fully implemented; (3) Good practice has been followed; (4) Resources have been allocated effectivel y with regard to what is known about the effectiveness of different types of substance misuse interventions; (5) Statistics are being used effectively to monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of treatment agencies, includi ng the progress of individual clients over time. (6) There is evidence of overall reductions in harm resulting from the implementation of the Strategy. These aims are wide-ranging and extremel y ambitious for a project with a seven- month lifespan. To make the task more complex, at the time of our fieldwork significant changes were already underway in the subst ance misuse field in Wales, including: a shift from local to regional level commissioning of services, involving the creation of seven new Area Planni ng Boards (APBs) and consequent opportunities for more stra and 'joined up' oversi ght of the previously unaligned health and community safety budgets; a revision of the national Key Performance Indicators (KPIs); the bedding in of the Treat ment Outcome Profile, aimed at more effective data capture about outcomes for individuals; the transfer of control of Home Of fice funds (distributed via the Welsh Government) for offenders with subst ance misuse problems from the Drug Intervention Programme (DIP) to the incoming elected Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs). Methodology Given the complexity and scope of the task, we had to make a pragmatic assessment of what was feasible and what methods of data collection and analysis would produce the most useful results within the limited time available. As we were unable to conduct primary evaluative research ourselves, we were reliant mainly on secondary data and existing documentary material. However, we placed greatest emphasis on conducting a series of in-depth interviews to mine t he knowledge and views of a wide variety of 1 Working Together to Reduce Harm: The Substance Misuse Strategy for Wales 2008-2018. 15 'key stakeholders' in Wales. Limits on time and resources caused us to omit from this exercise one of the most important voices, that of service users themselves, and we acknowledge that this is a weakness of the study. However, a recently published report by Health Inspectorate Wales (2012) includes the results of such interviews, and the findings support a number of our conclusions. In summary, the results are based on the following methods and sources of information: (1) reviews and analysis of existing documents and reports , including the Strategy itself, implementation plans, lists of funded projects and services, and other internal and published policy and practice documents; (2) a focused review of the general research literature on 'what works' in relation to substance misuse, against which to a ssess the Strategy and implementation plans; (3) scrutiny of available statisti cal data from national databases; (4) analysis of previous eval uations of aspects of subst ance misuse interventions in Wales; (5) formal recorded interviews with 52 key stakeholders, including government officers, local and regional commissioners, managers of third sector provider agencies, GPs and consultants, police, probation and prison ma nagers, members of advisory groups and other external experts (though not service users); (6) informal discussions with m any others in the field. Further details of the methods used will be gi ven at appropriate points in the text and a full account can be found in Appendix 1. Structure of the report The report is divided into two main parts. The first part examines the history, aims and content of the Strategy and the extent to which it reflects evidence about the most effective ways of tackling substance misuse. The second part investigates the implementation of the Strategy , looking at the 'fitness for purpose' of the structures and governance arrangements through which it has been put into practice; at the coherence (or fragmentation) of the system of interventions that has been produced; and at evidence of and views about this system's overall 'effectiveness' and impact. The report concludes with a summary and re commendations for change in light of the findings. There are also a number of Appendice s, which will be referred to in the text where relevant. The content of individual chapters can be summarised as follows. Chapter 2 briefly describes the history and de velopment of the current Strategy. It shows how it built on previous strategies and explores the processes by which it was designed, including the part played by par ticular individuals and groups, consultation and the use of evidence. Chapter 3 examines the text of the Strat egy document in some detail to determine what precisely it proposed, and the extent to which its content is in tune with global evidence on the effectiveness of particular approaches and types of interventions. It 16 also presents findings from interviews wi th key stakeholders, looking at how familiar they were with the document and their views about its quality and usefulness. Chapter 4 introduces the second part of the report and highli ghts some of the fundamental tensions that c hallenge the effective implem entation of the Strategy. Chapter 5 examines the structures and syst ems through which the allocation of resources is planned and implement ed, with particular attention to the extent to which commissioning processes were and are efficien t, fair, transparent and consistent. It also looks at ways in which changes in direction or approach are proposed and managed. Chapter 6 seeks to determine whether all the proposals contained in the Strategy have been implemented, how expenditure is divided between the different action areas, and the extent to which the overall system of interventions is 'joined up' or fragmented, especially from the viewpoint of substance misusers seeking treatment and support. Chapter 7 examines the mechanisms in pl ace for monitoring and oversight of the performance of individual providers, local areas and the system as a whole, as well as the availability and quality of data to assess effectiveness. Chapter 8 reviews statistical material drawn from the national database (WNDSM), as well as previously published research and evaluation, and asks what, if anything, can be concluded from them with any confidence about t he effectiveness of the implementation of the Strategy. Chapter 9 summarises the findings and conclusions, and presents recommendations emerging from the research. 17 CHAPTER 2: HISTORY AND DEVE LOPMENT OF THE STRATEGY This chapter sets the contex t for the report by looking briefly at how the current Substance Misuse Strategy was develo ped, including the roles played by key individuals and groups, the extent to which t hey built on previous strategies, how much consultation they undertook, and what new or different ideas or evidence they drew upon. Chapter 3 will look in more detail at the content of the Strategy document that emerged, and the extent to which it appears to reflect global evidence about the most effective ways of tackling substance misuse. Background to the 2008 Strategy Over the last 25 years, ther e have been three substance misuse strategies in Wales. The first, Forward Together: A Strategy to Com bat Drug and Alcohol Misuse in Wales , was published in 1996. In 2000, shortly after devolution, a second Strategy, Tackling Substance Misuse in Wales: A Partnership Approach , was published. This had four key strands, which closely matched those of the 1998 UK Strategy Tackling Drugs to Build a Better Britain . However, the Welsh version was somewhat broader in aims and approach. It included responses to problems created by alcohol, over-the-counter and prescription medication, and volatile substances, in addition to illegal drugs. The current Strategy, Working Together to Reduce Harm: The Substance Misuse Strategy for Wales 2008-2018 , was published in 2008, shortly after the Westminster Government launched its new Strategy, Drugs: Protecting Families and Communities . It was given a specified lifespan of ten year s. Details about the processes by which the Welsh Strategy was generated are not readi ly available in publ ished documents. Our main source of information on this topic was therefore interviews with people who were involved at the time. The respondents agreed, first of all, that the two previous strategies had been heavily dependent on the approaches adopted in England. For example: [There was] quite a lot of turmoil in the late 90s and early 2000s because constantly, there was this pressure to fall in line with England; fall in line with the Tackling Drugs to Build a Better Br itain and prior to that, take, Tackling Drugs Together. Nevertheless, it was ack nowledged that there had always been some distinctive elements about the Welsh approach, particularl y the stronger focuses it placed on alcohol, harm reduction and working in partnership. Wales was trying to hold on to this wi der sense of substance misuse and to hold on to the significance of alcohol being the major challenge rather than illegal drugs. So that's the context. So that is why the 1998 Tackling Drugs to Build a Better Britain, which was a UK drugs strategy, produc ed the partnership approach Welsh strategy in 2000... This was said to stem partly from the fact that Wales had had for some time a substance misuse committee to comment on policy issues. An early version of this was the Welsh Advisory Committee on Drug and Alcohol Misuse (WACDAM), a committee of about 35 members representing many agencies (e.g. prison service, education, health, and third sector) and chair ed by a GP. Shortly after devolution in 18 1999, the new First Minister replaced WACDAM with the Substance Misuse Advisory Panel (SMAP). This in turn was replaced in 2001 by the Advisory Panel on Substance Misuse (APoSM), with the specific remit of ad vising the Minister on the current state of knowledge and evidence about substance misuse issues. Like WACDAM, APoSM was (and still is) comprised of people with a variety of types of knowledge and expertise relating to substance misuse, incl uding representatives from police, prison, probation, health, voluntary sector agenc ies, statutory tr eatment services, pharmacists, nursing, youth services, social services, education, and public health. As we shall see, this committee played an important part in t he design of the 2008 Strategy. 2 During the period of the implementation of the second Strategy and the early work on the current Strategy, there were considerable political changes in the UK, in terms of the strengthening of devolution in both Scotland and Wales. As a result, the pressure for Wales to follow the English Strategy decreased and some of the distinctive characteristics of the Welsh appr oach began to come to the fore. [The second strategy] ... started in 2000 and it was an eight-year strategy to 2008 in order to fall in line with the ti meframe of the English strategy (1998- 2008); but by the time the English strategy came to be refreshed, there was less pressure to follow the Eng lish model. So suddenly, 2008 was an opportunity for Wales to build its Worki ng Together to Reduce Harm and to give greater significance to misuse of alcohol. The design of the new Strategy The main responsibility for managing the de sign of the new Strategy fell upon the Substance Misuse Branch within the Wels h Government (then the Welsh Assembly Government). At the time, substance mi suse policy came under the remit of the Minister for Local Government and Communi ties, so the key civil servants involved were the Head of the Community Safety Div ision, supported by t he Head of Substance Misuse Treatment Services. At an early stage, the Head of Division established a cross-governmental steering group to oversee the development of the Strat egy. In collaboration with this group, the Substance Misuse Branch established various consultation arrangements. These included commissioning research and se tting up liaison arrangements with key stakeholders and partners. There were also formal consultation arrangements required with ministers and senior Welsh Go vernment officers as well as interest groups. It was considered particularly important to liaise with the different departments to try to align the Strategy with their policies and avoid 'silo' thinking. As already demonstrated, those responsible for designing the Strategy did not start work in a vacuum. There were already in place two previous strategies, plus the continued presence of an advisory committee to generate ideas about methods for tackling substance misuse. Hence by the time the work began in earnest (interviewees generally suggest some time in 2006), there was already a sense of direction among the key players and a firm base to build on: 2 Further information about the composition and role of APoSM and of two other key bodies in the substance misuse landscape in Wales (the Welsh Government Substance Misuse Branch and the Substance Misuse Strategy Implement ation Board), can be found in Appendix 2. 19 So ... so over that period we had a good feel as a team, which included ... a social worker, included access to a ... psychiatrist here and to an advisory panel and substance misuse, what the key issues were? So we knew where the agenda was in Wales, we weren't as a team coming to it as a blank sheet of paper and don't know what's going on. You know, we did have a reasonable view of where things were, and we were doing a lot of engagement with stakeholders on what the key issues we re that they were faced anyway. In particular, there was broad agreement about the underpi nning philosophy and aims of the new Strategy: namely, that harm reduction was to be at its heart. This was largely because most of those involved be lieved this to be the most effective approach, but also partly due to a view that the Welsh Government should focus most strongly on implementing policie s in areas in which powers had been fully devolved. This view also strengthened the case for a mu ch stronger focus on alcohol, for which many individuals had been pushing for some time: [W]e came in at the start and agreed with ministers this was about reducing harm, it wasn't about saying this is a cr iminal act and you sh ouldn't do it. ... [S]o we were starting from a different place; we were not getting into the habit of what should be, in terms of drugs; what were legal and what weren't? You know, that was clearly a non-devolved issue. We did want to push the agenda on alcohol quite significantly, which was a non-devolved issue in terms of licensing and availability. From that point on, ideas were refined and the detailed design of the approach was worked out. We asked respondents who had been involved at the time where the more detailed ideas in the Strategy came from. Several sources were mentioned, including the knowledge gained from existi ng programmes in Wa les which appeared to be working well, and formal and informa l meetings with peopl e with particular expertise or experience. One intervie wee commented on the ' huge strengths' of bringing together a very disparate gr oup of people with diffe rent histories, experiences, knowledge and understanding. Use of evidence In addition to drawing upon lessons from the previous strategies, undertaking consultations with the field, and using the widely-held belief in harm reduction as a guiding principle, the design team also made efforts to collect and consider evidence from academic and other sources. This wa s initially planned as a systematic exercise but appears to have ended up as fairly piecemeal. One interviewee who had been closely involved described how a team of re searchers, external to the WG, were commissioned to collate the evidence on 'what works' and to flag up areas of good practice. The plan, it seems, was that the review of the evidence base would be used to guide the development of t he Strategy. For various reasons, however, the review ended up being completed in-house by me mbers of the WG Substance Misuse Branch. In practice, this involved them collecting whatever evidence they could find from a range of sources incl uding APoSM, partner agencies, other substance misuse strategies from across the UK, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, as well as from colleagues in Whitehal l and across the Welsh Government. For example, one interviewee reported how in some APoSM meetings, papers were presented outlining the findings of new res earch on the effectiveness of specific interventions, such as on the use of leaflets and counselling in Accident and Emergency units. 20 Overall, respondents with knowledge of the process agreed that evidence had been used, but in a pragmatic ra ther than systematic way, us ing 'what was available' and 'what was around at the time'. Nevertheless, the use of a range of sources was well documented. One respondent noted the influence of w hat was happening elsewhere in other administrations in the development of the Strategy. This respondent also described the use of consultation events in volving key stakeholders from across the field and an evaluation of the previous Stra tegy. The interview responses therefore clearly support the notion that evidence from a range of sources was used to guide the development of the Strategy. However, t he extent to which the evidence wholly reflected the contemporary stat e of knowledge on the effectiv eness of interventions is less clear. Conclusion The aim of the chapter was to provide some brief insights into the history and thinking behind the development of the 2008 Substa nce Misuse Strategy, as well as the process by which it was designed. This was in part to provide necessary background information and context for the discussion to fo llow, but also to examine the logic of the methods by which actions were proposed. Overall, the evidence we obtained supports the conclu sion that the methods and general approach to generating t he Strategy document were well suited to the task. Those involved in designing the Strategy were guided by some clear guiding principles which had wide support in Wales and drew on a range of ideas, experience and evidence. They consulted effectively both across government and with external stakeholders, took advice from an advis ory panel of independent experts and tested out ideas widely before committing them to the document. Overall, the general principles they adopted ( harm reduction, a balance betw een drugs and alcohol, and a partnership approach) appear to have been a good choice, in that they had some history and meaning to Wales, were in harm ony with previous approaches in Wales, and already had support from key players. The one aspect of the design process that appears to have created problems was the use of the broader evidence on the effectiveness of substance misuse intervent ions: while efforts were made to draw upon evidence from a range of sources, this was undertaken (not necessarily through the fault of the design team) in a piecemeal rather than syst ematic fashion. 21 CHAPTER 3: CONTENT AND EVIDEN CE BASE OF THE STRATEGY Introduction In this chapter we look more closely at t he content of the Strat egy and investigate the extent to which it reflects global ev idence about the effectiveness of various approaches to tackling substance misuse, the latter being based on our own 'systematic review of systematic reviews' of such evidence. We also present some results from our interviews with stakeholders, looking at how familiar they were with the Strategy document and their view s about its quality and usefulness. Content of the Strategy document The Strategy is set out in the published document: Working Together to Reduce Harm: The Substance Misuse Strategy for Wales 2008-2018 . The broad objectives of the Strategy are set out early on, placing st rong emphasis on the reduc tion of harm. The first paragraph states that a key priority is to reduce the harms caused by substance misuse, and goes on to specify the types of harms to individuals, families and communities. Four priority action areas are identified in the document: 1. The 'preventing harm' action area fo cuses on helping children, young people and adults to resist or delay starting substance misuse. This is to be achieved through education of young people and the pr ovision of information to older people about the harms of substance misuse. 2. 'Support for substance misusers' aims to reduce harms by improving their health and assisting their recovery. This primarily entails ensur ing that there is ready access to treatment or other support services. 3. 'Supporting and protecting families' aims to reduce harms to children and adults caused by substance misuse in the family. This is to be achieved mainly through the provision of professional support to families which have been damaged by substance misuse. 4. 'Tackling availability' aims to redu ce the harms associated with ease of access to substances at the individual and comm unity level. This action area causes some difficulties for the Welsh Government in that it has relatively little direct influence over policing and other c ontrol mechanisms. The recommended approach is to work closely with those who do. The focus running through these four priority areas is social and individual support. Even the last of the four does not st rongly emphasise criminal sanctions and exclusion. Specific interventions recommended As it is intended to provi de broad guidance over a ten-y ear period, the Strategy naturally does not contain a great deal of detail on the kinds of interventions recommended, but nevertheless it is possible to identify a number of t hese. In order to examine these more systematically, we unde rtook a content analysis of the document, using the coding rules shown in Appendix 3 Figure A3.1. In essence, interventions were defined as actions that aimed to reduce substance misuse either directly or 22 indirectly. These are presented in Appendix 3 Tables A3.1-4, listed under each of the four main priority action areas. Under the first action area (Preventing harm) the Strategy document proposes three main types of action: diversionary activiti es, education, and information. There is little said about diversionary activities, which normally include sports and out-of-school activities for young people, and only one specif ic example was found. Much greater attention is paid to information and educat ion approaches. The document refers several times to the All Wales School Liai son Core Programme (AWSLCP), which is now implemented in nearly all schools in Wale s. The aims of the AWSLCP are listed on the WG website as 'to reduce offending, anti-soci al behaviour, and substance misuse, to encourage positive citizenship an d to give young people the knowledge to avoid becoming victims of crim e.' Emphasis is also given to a range of actions aimed at engaging into gainful activity young people not in education, employment or training (NEETs). A similar level of attention is paid to methods of improving the availability of information on substance misuse, including the DAN 24/7 helpline, media campaigns, and information packs for parents, universities and colleges, and young people. Interventions specified under the second ac tion area (Support for substance misusers) are much more varied and cover a range of activities includi ng harm minimisation, treatment, aftercare, support, and prevention. Treatment services named include the prescribing of opiate substitute s, brief interventions for the treatment of harmful alcohol use, increased availability of drop-in c entres and outreach services, and psychosocial interventions including cognitive behavioural therapy. A considerable amount of attention is also paid to 'wrap around' services - including assistance with accommodation, training and employment - to provide social support and to aid recovery. The third action area (Supporting and protecting fa milies) is more focused in terms of the types of interventions proposed. F our main types of action are proposed: information, prevention, psychosocial interv entions, and various other kinds of support. 'Information' refers to acti ons to make people more aware of the types of services available for the families of substance misusers. Three major programmes are named under prevention: the 'On Track' programme to provide interventions to at-risk children and their parents, the 'Families First' programme to limit the harm to children of substance misusing parents, and the domes tic abuse strategy to tackle the links between substance misuse (particularly alcohol use) and violence in the home. Psychosocial interventions mentioned include the use of therapeutic communities to provide support for family members and ca rers who work with people who misuse substances. Finally, the other types of s upport mentioned refer again to interventions to support the families and carers of subs tance misusers, including the Evaluated Early Parental Intervention Projects (EEPI P) and the Option 2 model (which offers crisis intervention to families where there are child protection concerns related to parental substance misuse). The fourth action area (Tack ling availability) covers a range of interventions, many of them concerning policing and other enforcement activities aimed at reducing the supply of drugs, but also brief (treatment ) interventions for offenders arrested for alcohol-related crime, and interventi ons for controlling disorder including environmental design especially relating to alcohol misuse, such as late-night transport policy, management of city-centre areas, street lighting, street cleaning and CCTV. The proposals also include enhanced neighbourhood policing programmes to 23 involve the community in tackling substanc e misuse and in providing information about agencies working in the area. Is the Strategy evidence based? The extent to which strategies (of any ki nd) are evidence based is an issue that has attracted considerable political and research attention in recent years. It has become accepted that, particularly where large sums of money are involved, any proposals for implementation should be grounded in re search evidence and have proven effectiveness. We concluded in the previous chapter that the Welsh Government Substance Misuse Branch certainly made ef forts to collect and use evidence in designing the Strategy. In this section we investigate whether the contents of the resulting Strategy document can fairly be described as evidence based. We begin with some comments about the capacity of rese arch to answer the broad question of whether there is evidence to support t he choice of 'harm reduction' as the underpinning philosophy of the Welsh St rategy, in comparison with possible alternatives, such as a primarily 'criminal justice' or 'abstinence' focused approach. We then look briefly at the extent to whic h evidence is explicitly referred to in the Strategy document. Finally, we consider to what extent the latter's advocacy of particular types of intervention is in tune with the weight of research evidence about the most effective ways of ta ckling substance misuse: to achieve this we present our own systematic review of published systematic reviews of international research on specific kinds of intervention. Fundamental choice of approach As mentioned several times, the designers of the Welsh Strategy clearly nailed their colours to the mast of a 'harm reduction' approach to tackling substance misuse - a philosophy which had - and still has - wides pread support in Wales. The document does not define this approach completely cl early, and it has many ramifications. However, there is little doubt that it incor porates two core underlying beliefs that have considerable consequences for the kinds of interventions which receive priority in practice. These are (a) that, while atte mpts should be made to reduce the supply and availability of harmful subst ances, substance misuse should be treated primarily as a social and psychological problem rather th an a crime problem, and (b) that while, for some misusers, abstinence may be a realistic goal in the short term, many have such deep and interrelated social and psychologic al problems that the most effective strategy may be to reduce the harm they do to themselves and others by 'maintaining' them (for example, through pr escribing opiate substitutes) for considerable periods during which their other pr oblems can be addressed. It will be demonstrated in Chapters 5 and 6 t hat - in line with the above beliefs - psychosocial and social interventions, al ong with prescribing, feature heavily in commissioning and spending plans. The question which needs to be considered briefly here, however, is whether there is any research evidence to support this fundamental choice of a 'harm reduction' over either a primarily 'criminal justice' or 'abstinence' focused approach to underpin the St rategy. This is, of course, a question which is likely to become more pertinent i f, as seems likely, the 'recovery' agenda now advocated by the Westminster government take s stronger root in Wales: despite some confusion and disagreement about its meaning, this is generally agreed to give greater priority to the goal of abstinence and to question t he value of long-term 'maintenance'. Unfortunately, there is no simple research or evidence-based answer to questions about which fundamental approach to substance misuse problems is most effective. 24 In essence, this is primarily a normative question rather than an empirical one, and a topic for political and moral debate informed by evidence, rather than driven by evidence. The answer depends largely on w hat outcomes one wishes to achieve in the short or long term, and what value one attaches to each. Explicit references to evidence We turn now to the relevance of evidence to more concrete aspects of the Strategy, including specific action areas and individual kinds of intervention. First of all, in order to measure how often evidence is explicitly referred to in the Strategy, we conducted a systematic search of the St rategy document (specifically Chapter 4, which presents details of the four priority action areas) for any reference to the word 'evidence' or its close synonyms. The results of this analysis are presented in full in Appendix 3 but are described briefly here. In t he 33 pages of Chapter 4, the words 'evidence', 'research', 'findings' or 'statistics' were used on 26 occasions in total. The use of evidence in the Strategy wa s investigated further by examining the academic references cited in the Strategy . Overall, 58 references to research literature were found in Chapt er 4. Of note is the fact that the distribution of references was found to be somewhat uneven across the four action areas, with the majority relating to 'Support for substanc e misusers' and the minority relating to 'Tackling availability'. While these are obviously crude and indirect i ndicators of evidence-based policy, they do suggest that (confirming the comments of interviewees referred to in the last chapter) considerable attention was paid to research findings, especially in relation to treatment and support. Are the recommended actions in the Strat egy supported by the wider literature? To investigate whether the recommended actions listed in the Strategy were (or still are) in line with knowledge and evidence about the effectiveness of interventions, we conducted a review of the research literature. Our approach was to conduct a 'systematic review of systematic reviews' to determine the broad range of research findings. In total, 55 systematic revi ews covering nearly 2,000 evaluations of interventions were included in the analysis. We then extracted from this review selected evaluations to show the methods used and to provide examples of good practice. In this section we briefly summari se the results. More detailed findings and information about the method used are presented in Appendix 4. Most of the systematic reviews that we found (48 of the 55) were in respect of interventions that could be classified as falling within the 'Support for substance misusers' action area of the Strategy. T he 48 reviews, which are listed in full in Appendix 4 Table A4.1, can be broadly divided into two main groups, one involving pharmaceutical interventions (n=23) and t he other involving psychosocial approaches (n=25). As Table 3.1 shows, it emer ged that of the 23 reviews of pharmaceutical interventions, 13 (57%) had a 'positive' conclusion, m eaning that strong evidence was found in a significant number of studies for the effect iveness of the intervent ion studied in terms of impact on the level substance misuse among service users. Four (17%) found 'mixed or uncertain' results, while the remaini ng six (26%) identified ' no effect'. Of the 25 reviews of psychosocial interventions 15 (60%) had a 'positive' conclusion, five (20%) or uncertain' and fi ve (20%) found 'no effect'. In other words, in both 25 cases a strong majority of reviews found pr edominantly positive results in terms of reductions in substance misuse. Table 3.1 Type of intervention by outcome Positive Mixed or uncertain No effect Total Pharmaceutical 13 (57%) 4 (17%) 6 (26%) 23 (58%) 9 (19%) 11 (23%) 48 (100%) It can be seen in Appendix 4 Table A4.1 that about half of the reviews of pharmaceutical interventions refer to maintenance in the form of methadone or other substitute medications and that nearly a ll of these found a predominantly positive effect. An example of a methodologica lly robust evaluation of a successful methadone maintenance progr amme, and a brief descripti on of the programme, are presented in Appendix 4. By contrast , the two systematic reviews found of detoxification interventions were less positive, one finding no effect and one uncertain effects - though the amount of evidence here is insufficient to draw any firm conclusions. The psychosocial programmes reviewed were variable in nature, but a high proportion was shown to have positive results. Among particular types of intervention with the strongest evidence of effectiveness (in terms of reduced substance misuse) were those incorporating Cognitive Behavioural T herapy (for an exampl e, see Appendix 4). Interestingly, too, there was strong evidence for the effectiveness of several aimed at alcohol misuse, including a range of 'brief interventions'. As will be mentioned in Chapter 8, it is somewhat ironic that one area in Wales with a strong commitment to evidence-based policy terminated the provis ion of such an intervention (based on arrest referral) on the basis of the results of a short ev aluation it commissioned, which found no impact on re-arrest rates. This illustrates that the pursuit of 'evidence-based policy' is by no means a straightforward ma tter: findings from evaluations will differ according to variations in the robustness of the research met hodology, the precise nature of the intervention, t he quality of its implementation, and the country or area in which it is implemented. Hasty reactions to a single evaluation, therefore, are not always advisable, and are best considered al ongside qualitative information and, if possible, first-hand knowledge of the scheme in question. There were insufficient numbers of reviews found concerning interventions in the other three action areas to draw confident conclusions about their effectiveness,3 but it is worth noting that all three of the reviews that we found re lating to schools programmes (and hence classifiable under the 'Prevent ing harm' action area) had favourable outcomes for at least one of the types of school based interventions evaluated4 (see 3 It is likely that we found relatively few such re views owing to limitations we placed on the kinds of outcomes that would merit the inclusion of the review in the final list. For example, it may be that there we missed a number of reviews of enforcement-based interventions whose outcomes were assessed in terms of reconviction rates or reductions in the supply of drugs. 4 Faggiano F, Vigna-Taglianti F, Versino E, Zambon A, Borraccino P. School-based prevention for illicit drugs' use. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2005, Issue 2. Art. No.: CD003020. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003020.pub2., one of the three systematic reviews analysed, 26 Appendix 4 Table A4.2). Although it should be noted that the studies were based solely on US data, these positive results offer some encouragement for the inclusion of schools-based programmes in the implementation of the Substance Misuse Strategy for Wales. A recent evaluati on of the All Wales School Liaison Core Programme (Stead et al. 2011) was unable to determine c hanges in substance misuse behaviour as no comparison group was us ed, while an evaluation of a similar programme in England (Blueprint Evaluati on Team, 2009) was likewise inconclusive. However, there is some rigorous evidence fr om other countries of the effectiveness of schools-based prevention programmes. A good example is the Life Skills Training in Schools programme in the United States , which focused on reducing excessive alcohol use (Foxcroft and Tsertsvadze, 2011). This was found to be more effective than both teacher-led and standard progr ammes in reducing the frequency of drunkenness and consumption of alcohol per occasion (further information on this programme can be found in Appendix 4). Finally, although the amount of evidence was similarly limit ed, some strong effects were found in the systematic reviews for family-based programmes, which have also been quite prominent in the Welsh Strategy. Once again, a relevant example of such a programme and a summary of the robus t evaluation which demonstrated its effectiveness, are pres ented in Appendix 4. Conclusions In conclusion, our 'systematic review of systematic reviews' provides strong international evidence for the effectiv eness of a number of pharmaceutical and psychosocial interventions, notably maintenance and brief interventions for alcohol. We also found some good evidence fo r the effectiveness of schools-based programmes, although these reviews were re latively small in number, and focused primarily on schemes in the United States. Overall, then, our (admittedly rapid and partial) review of the broader literature gives us a fair d egree of confidence that the primary focus of the Strategy and Impl ementation Plans on harm reduction through pharmaceutical and psychosocial methods of treatment and support (which will be elaborated in more detail in Chapter 6) has a strong evidence base. This does not mean that interventions in the other action ar eas are ineffective: our searches simply did not identify sufficient reviews to make such confident claims about their effectiveness (or not). It is likely that a di fferent kind of search, allowing a wider range of outcome types, would produc e a greater number of rele vant reviews (see footnote 3 above). Finally, it is important to re iterate that while the above fi ndings probably hold good at a broad level, there is no straightforward answer to the question of whether what is being implemented is truly eviden ce based. This is because it is rarely possible to compare wholly 'like-with-like'. Intervent ions are always different at the level of implementation, including the specific practi ces used, the motivations of the staff and clients, the funds available, and so on. The results of large numbers of evaluations often end up to some extent equivocal. T he problem of large numbers of evaluations coming up with large numbers of different results is to some extent endemic in all social evaluations. It is therefore not always clear how policy decisions should be made in response to research evidence. Just one of the issues to ponder is how much evidence does there have to be in support of an intervention to warrant implementation: is one positive finding enough or is it necessa ry that the majority or found that only skills training appears to be effective in deterring early-stage drug use, while knowledge based, and affective focused programmes, were not. 27 nearly all studies provide a positive result? Our own view is that it is unrealistic and unnecessary to seek unanimous or even majo rity support in the evidence base for an intervention to be implemented. We believe t hat 'sometimes effective' is good enough to justify initial implementation. On this basis, we reiterat e, what we have outlined in this chapter provides enough evidence that much of what is being implemented under the Wales Substance Misuse Strategy (i ndeed, as we shall see, the kinds of programmes on which most money is being spent) has a reasonably strong evidence base. Stakeholders' reflections on the Strategy We end the chapter with an overview of comments about the Strategy by key stakeholders. We asked all our interviewees about their level of familiarity with the document and, where they felt able, to identify its strengths and weaknesses. Knowledge of the Strategy The first point to note is that all our inte rviewees knew something about the Strategy document. In fact, most of them had a hard, colour copy that had been gi ven to them by the Welsh Government, and some of them brought this (often well thumbed) document with them to the interview. O ne interviewee who was a member of APoSM noted that the Strategy had been 'widely circ ulated' to key stakeholders and that the first print was disseminated to such an exte nt that the WG ran out of copies. Generally speaking we f ound that there was a good level of awareness and understanding of the contents of the Strategy document. Most interviewees could name the action areas and a significant minority had extensive knowle dge of detail (for example, being able to list all of the KPIs pub lished in the annex!). For the most part, knowledge of the Strategy appeared to be greatest amongst the WG staff, members of boards and committees, and service providers working in managerial positions. It was less extensive - but in most cases adequate - among staff who were more peripheral to government and/or in organisations with less direct focus on substance misuse as their main area of business (for example po lice, probation and prisons). It should of course be acknowledged that most of our interviewees were in relatively senior positions, and these findings may not reflect the level of knowledg e among more junior staff. Indeed, one respondent suggested that knowledge abo ut the Strategy tended to diminish the closer one got to the ground level and service delivery. This interviewee indicated that not many of her staff would have seen it or read it , and identified 'a huge gap between the Strategy and pr actice on the ground'. While knowledge about the Strategy was generally good, knowledge about the Implementation Plan was much weaker. In fact, some of our respondents did not even know that it existed (which is perhaps a little odd given that a hard copy of the plan was tucked into the back of the main Stra tegy document). This point will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 5. General opinions of the Strategy We found remarkably little criticism of the St rategy across all our interviewees: most agreed strongly that it was bas ically a good Strategy. Its most commonly mentioned strength was its breadth of coverage, both in terms of t he range of interventions recommended and the fact that it paid serious attention to problems associated with a variety of substances including illegal and legal drugs, prescription and over-the- counter drugs, and above all alcohol. The point was also made to us several times 28 that the problems caused by different kinds of substances are often linked and need to be viewed and tackled together. Oh, I think it's first class in the way t hat Wales took on all substances apart from nicotine, cigarettes, because if you still look at the English stra tegy then it's very much divided and that's a nonsense, you know. Polydrug use is far more common. What's the point in separating? Absolutely nonsense! So from day one, you know, we felt that the Welsh government had the right approach to it... and to have an integrated strategy. Likewise, a health professional supported the breadth of the Strate gy, highlighting the fact that 'there are so many issues linked to substance misuse'. On a slightly different tack, a local commissioner of substance misuse services reported that the breadth of the Strategy gave the CSP great er latitude in identifying the best interventions for the local area. He explained that its wide scope enables CSPs 'to interpret it' and 'to experiment with where they f eel their priorities are'. Support was also expressed for what was per ceived as a clear distinction between the substance misuse strategies of England and Wales. As mentioned earlier, until the current Strategy, the Welsh strategy was more or less a copy of t he English strategy. It was argued that Wales now had its own distinctive strategy which provided a stronger sense of ow nership and purpose. What I would say though is when it did co me out, [I was] probably happier with it and supportive of it ... than I thought I would be. .. I think there is a definite distinction between Wales and E ngland, which I think is good. It doesn't feel like we're on the coattails of what they've been doing in England. ... I don't know, there's - for me there's always being a s ense of ownership about it, that it is something to do with us in Wales. It sounds really cheesy but that's how it feels to me anyway. Finally, there were many positive comments made about the clarit y of the report in terms of its structure, written style, and pr esentation. One res pondent felt that it had been written in a way that was 'not too academic, that people can relate to their targets'. While the great majority of respondents spok e positively about the Strategy, some felt that it gave insufficient emphasis to particular issues. Often the appeal was for greater attention to areas or client types about which the respondent had specialised knowledge. For example, one respondent m entioned the special needs of elderly clients and those with learning disabilities. ... my plea is always don't ... forget the complex end and also not to forget the emerging groups that are a bit more co mplicated, like the over 65s. ...like people with learning disabilities. There is n't a provision for these people in Wales really, you know. ... There are t hese really complicated groups that are emerging that need to be part of strategy as well. Another interviewee drew attention to the problems of offender health and was concerned that 'such a big ar ea of business' had received such limited reference in the Strategy. The interviewee was of the view t hat offender health has 'got to feature ... because if they're not managed properly ... they will be a bigger burden on health 29 somewhere else in the system or in the future'. A third argued that insufficient emphasis was given to the reduction of drug-related crime and offending. However, such concerns were not widely shared. Duration of the Strategy There was some debate about whether the 10-year lifespan of the Strategy was a good or bad thing. Some of our respondents felt that it was too long given the evolving nature of substance misuse. I think having the ten year strategy is al so quite challenging in an area such as substance misuse, because it's, it moves ve ry quickly. And even to the point of actually what drug of choice, substance of choice, do individuals take. And I think if we looked at that now that, y ou know, opiates look to be reducing, and that's quite a big focus within the stra tegy. We've got the psychoactive drugs, that are obviously much more predomi nant than they were, and steroid use is more predominant. A particular concern was that it was not onl y substance misuse that was changing, but so too were many other factors that affe cted the work of se rvices. One respondent pointed out that 'things have moved on a lot' since the Strategy was launched and that 'we are now five years down the line really, if you count the time it took to write it as well'. Several respondents were concerned that the Strategy had been written before the recovery movement had come to prom inence. One manager of a third sector treatment agency explained that she was 'particularly disappointed' by the Strategy's lack of emphasis on recovery. She noted that 'there is a real lack of that impetus in the strategy for people to be driven out of the system in terms of recovery'. Similarly, another manager of a voluntary sector agency highlighted the need to 'freshen up' the Strategy by giving it a 'lick of paint' to make it relevant to 2012. She explained that 'I don't think that it needs much. But, ... th ings like the recovery agenda ... the new and emerging [drugs], the changing in perhaps the way people us e drugs, that kind of stuff'. Another common concern reported related to the imminent changes to the structure of substance misuse services in Wales, in cluding the introduction of APBs, the possible loss of DIP funding and the election of PCCs . Some respondents felt that this new structure should be reflected in the Stra tegy and some proposed that the Strategy should be re-written to better r epresent the current system. I think it ... it needs to be rewritten in light of PCCs, area planning boards, you know, these, these have all come about since 2008 ... So it's a very new world... and an area planning board's agenda should reflect the strategy and, you know, there should be a mechanism for ensuring that what's being delivered down on the ground does reflect the Welsh Government's objectives. And with the PCCs coming in now and, you know, if DIP funding for example does go to health... those area planning boards then are going to be vital to commissioning of the services in the fu ture ... There's a ... yet another new world coming now down the line that I feel needs very strong leadership from the strategy. On the other hand, the counter-argument wa s put that the 10-y ear duration of the Strategy guarded against over-hasty reaction to new ideas, events or 'flavours of the month'. In fact, one of our respondents wa s extremely animated about the issue and 30 supportive of the timescale stating that '10 years is a godsend ...I wish it was 20 years'. This positive view was linked largel y to the belief that a longer period provides more stability to workers and ensures that any new movements (e.g. recovery) are properly investigated before being adopted on a national basis. A similar point was noted by another respondent who was concerned that in Wales 'we suffer from follow on syndrome, because ... something's hap pened in Scotland, something's happened in Northern Ireland, something's happened in England that looks good, 'oh we'll do that''. A longer timeframe would therefore help to guard against any knee-jerk responses to any new developments in the field. More broadly, the benefits of stability were mentioned by several respondents. One described how a shorter strategy could result in 'a period of flux' that might disrupt service provision. This respondent felt that the longer 10-year strategy provides everyone with a clear 'direction of travel', and that if significant adjustments had to be made, these could be achieved via the thr ee-year Implementation Plans (discussed in Chapter 5). It was recognise d, however, that there is a limit to how much change the Strategy could tolerate and that a review would be necessary if the substance misuse 'world' had moved on too much. Conclusion In examining the contents of the Strategy in some detail - a necessary step before assessing (in this chapter) the extent to wh ich it is based on evidence about effective practice and (in later chapters) how much of it has been implemented - we found that, while several specific programmes and serv ices were mentioned as desirable, the Strategy document was understandably not over ly prescriptive in recommending how its aims should be achieved. This makes it difficult to address in a robust fashion the question of how much it is evidence based, and our conclusions on this issue are inevitably broad and tentative. Clearly, evidence played a fairly prominent part in the creation of the Strategy. Analysis of the text of t he document identified many refe rences to research findings, while as outlined in Chapter 2, key stak eholders who had been involved in (or were knowledgeable about) its develop ment, stated that evidenc e from a range of sources had been collated by in-house researchers and used to guide the direction of the Strategy. However, whether reviews of the evidence base were systematic and exhaustive is less clear. The issue of whether the pr oposals outlined in the Strategy matched the conclusions of the broader knowledge-base was investigated by way of a 'systematic review of systematic reviews'. The review demonstr ated that there was strong international evidence to justify the focus on support to substance misusers, and particularly the use of pharmaceutical interventions to prov ide maintenance, as well as psychosocial interventions. There was also some suppo rt for the use of schools-based preventive interventions, and for the use of brief interv entions for alcohol misusers, despite the fact that recent evaluations in Wa les and England had been inconclusive on the effectiveness of both of thes e. It is acknowledged that our review did not cover interventions of the kinds found in the ot her three action areas in the Strategy (preventing harm, supporting families, and tack ling availability) as thoroughly as it covered support to substance misusers, so we cannot draw any firm conclusions about them beyond the above. We also emphasise that the interpretation of evidence drawn from studies of a wide variety of 'variations on a theme' (clearly, categories like 'brief interventions' or 'maintenance' cover a range of practices, delivered to a range of 31 standards) is by no means a straightforward task, so serious caution must always be exercised before making any firm judgement s that a particular type of intervention 'works' and another 'doesn' t work'. Finally, we found that all interviewees knew something about the Strategy and many were quite knowledgeable about it. Kno wledge was strongest among those in the Welsh Government and in senior management positions in provider agencies. All respondents recognised positive elements to the Strategy, with frequent mentions being made of its broad scope, the inclusion of alcohol, and its readability and clarity. The main criticisms made concerned lack of su fficient attention to particular issues or client groups, including offenders and non-traditional service users. Some respondents thought that the 10-year time frame was too long to remain fully relevant as circumstances and views changed. Howe ver, others welcomed the longer time frame, not least as a barrier against over- hasty reactions to 'fashionable' ideas or political imperatives. 32 PART TWO IMPLEMENTING THE STRATEGY : SYSTEMS, STRUCTURES, GOVERNANCE, IMPACT 33 CHAPTER 4: FUNDAMENTAL IS SUES IN IMPLEMENTATION Introduction In the second part of the repor t, we now shift attention fr om the design and content of the Strategy to its implementation. We cons ider the variety of systems, structures and institutions through which the Strategy is implemented, through which its delivery is monitored and evaluated, and through which c hanges to its focus or priorities are proposed and operationalised. Some of the mechanisms involved are historical legacies of previous political and organisa tional systems, while others have been created recently through central policy initiati ves. Their effectiveness, or 'fitness for purpose', will be examined not only individually, but collect ively as a 'whole system' - i.e. how well they dovetail together to ensur e that best use is m ade of the available resources in accord with the aims and spirit of the Strategy. To structure the discussion, we shall begin in this chapter by briefly placing it in the context of a number of fundament al tensions or dilemmas that inevitably create major challenges for any collective a ttempt to turn broad strategic principles into a coherent set of concrete interventions in a field as large, complex and controversial as that of substance misuse. In the following chapters we shall then look in turn at the following key aspects of implementation: (Chapter 5) The allocation of resource s and the structures, processes and people involved, including: the creation of overarching Implementation Plans; concrete decisions about what kinds of services to fund and how to allocate resources between them; decisions about which agencies will deliver what; the impact of APBs on the quality and consistency of decision-making. (Chapter 6) The overall 'system' of servic es and interventions produced, including: an overview of what is actually funded and implemented; the balance between the different action areas in the Strategy; perceptions of the extent to which the system is 'joined up' or fragmented; the likely impact on this of APBs and PCCs. (Chapter 7) Monitoring, accountability and the management of change, including: mechanisms for monitoring and assessing in dividual providers' performance; systems of accountability around commissioning decisions; mechanisms for assessing and improving the effectiveness of the system as a whole (for example, reducing duplicati on or fragmentation); mechanisms for implementing and managing changes in priorities or practice; the quality of the available data for informing such processes. (Chapter 8) What the availa ble data and research tell us about the effectiveness of system for tackling substance misu se in Wales, including: what can be gleaned from WNDSM; what can be gleaned from TOP; what can be concluded from pub lished research and evaluations. 34 Fundamental tensions in implementation While it is tempting to see the 'implementation' of the Strategy as a centrally-driven, linear process, this is far too simplisti c a picture. The abov e-mentioned systems and structures - and the way they operate in practice - are perhaps best understood as the cumulative (and often changing) product of the efforts of large numbers of people across Wales to resolve some fundamental tensions and dilemmas that face any country wishing to tackle a problem as la rge and complex as that of substance misuse. In a world of fini te resources, one cannot expect such tensions ever to be satisfactorily resolved - indeed, as resource s shrink in the current financial climate, arguments about priorities are likely to become more intense - but we hope to make some very broad judgements about how well the substance misuse 'community' as a whole (from central government to prov ider agencies) has m anaged them in Wales since 2008. The fundamental tensions referred to include: 1. Differing views about the relative effectiveness of - and hence the relative weight to give to - different ways of responding to substance misuse. While the Strategy document makes it clear that all four of its main strands are important components of a comprehensive and balanced approach, this does not answer practical questions about, for example, how much should be spent on medical treatment and how much on education or on psychosocial interventions or on 'wrap around' services. 2. Differing views about how and how far to a dapt the implementati on of the Strategy (or even to undertake 'mid-term' revisions of the Strategy itself) in response to changing expert views, new evidence, or po litical or media concerns. These may range from major ideological arguments around, for example, whether (and if so, how) to move from a 'harm reduction' to a 'recovery' approach to treatment, to whether and how to respond to apparent long -term shifts in patterns of substance misuse (for example, a dec line in heroin use and an increase in the use of other kinds of drugs reported by drug agencies across South Wales) or indeed to issues that suddenly receive media attention (such as the use of 'khat' and mephedr one). 3. Tensions between the aim of implementing reasonably consistent services across Wales, and the aim of responding effectively to local needs. This tension of course has a major financial dimension, in that economies of scale can be achieved, for example, by commissioning services on a regional rather than unitary authority level, but at the same time this may hav e negative repercussions at the local level, including possible neglect of specific local needs and the possible 'squeezing out' of small providers (which may have str ong local connections with communities and other agencies) in favour of larger or ganisations which can deliver across wider areas. 4. Tensions between competit ion, collaboration, and the need for continuity. Clearly, service providers are ultimately in competit ion for the available funding, yet at the same time it is strongly in the interest s of service users to experience treatment and support as far as possible as a 'seam less' rather than fragmented process, which requires providers to collaborate clos ely. Equally, while it is important to allow organisations to compete for contra cts at intervals, ov er-frequent changes of provider are not only disruptive in terms of changes in premis es, staff transfers, 35 etc, but may produce a hiatus in service delivery with serious consequences for service users. As will be demonstrated, all the above tens ions emerged repeatedly in a variety of guises throughout our intervie ws with stakeholders. 36 CHAPTER 5: THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES: PLANNING AND COMMISSIONING In this chapter we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the various mechanisms by which the available resources are allocat ed to particular activities. These include the drawing up of broad Implementation Plans; decisions about what specific services will be delivered or commissione d; and decisions about which providers will deliver them. We draw mainly on our key stakeholder interviews to explore views about how fairly and effectively the relevant structur es, processes and decision-makers perform these functions. To some extent this will be a historical exercise, given the termination of local commissioning arrangements, but we s hall also consider the likely impact of the advent of APBs. In Chapter 6, we s hall present an overall picture (based on Welsh Government records) of what the funds are spent on, and summarise stakeholder views on the extent to which th e resulting mix of interventions 'on the ground' may be described as balanced or in tegrated, and to what extent as fragmented or plagued by gaps and duplication. Implementation Plans The Substance Misuse Branch within the Welsh Government publishes formal Implementation Plans, as well as prepari ng more detailed annual Branch plans which are not published. The original thr ee-year (2008-2011) Implementation Plan contained five sections: four corresponding to the four main action areas specified in the Strategy document and a fifth entitled 'Delivering the Strategy and supporting partner agencies'. Under each of the main headings it summarised several actions to be taken, along with target implementati on dates, and a proposed lead authority. The actions were sometimes broken down into target actions or groups (such as 'encouraging engagement with services' or 'children an d young people'). The number of actions for each heading ranged from 10 (S upporting and protecting families) to 41 (Support for substance misusers). This Plan was succeeded in 2011 by an interim one-year Plan. The latest Implementation Plan, covering the period 2012-15, is still in draft form at the time of writing. At first sight, the creation of an Implement ation Plan might seem to be almost as important as the Strategy it self in shaping practical responses to substance misuse problems in Wales: it identifie s specific kinds of activity for attention and development, thereby playing an important preliminary role in defining priorities and influencing decisions about the allocation of resources. Certainly, civil servants we interviewed regarded the exercise of revisi ng the plan as a useful opportunity to think more broadly about where efforts should be targeted, or as a powerful tool to help drive desired change: But again, I think, the implementati on plan gives us a vehicle for change. I think the fact that, you know, thi ngs move on, we have new and emerging drugs, and differing challenges and things lik e the internet. They weren't about at the time [of the Stra tegy] and so there is a need to adapt to those changes. And I think, in part, the im plementation plan that sits alongside the Strategy, is where we're able to do that. So although it's still the, the implementation plan for the ongoing and remaining commitments wit hin the Strategy, it's also used for us to sort of respond to the challenges that come along from time to time. 37 Consequently, one might have expected many of our external stakeholder interviewees to have taken a keen interest in the contents of the Plan, or indeed to have made efforts to ensure that they were consulted when it was being put together. However, beyond a small number who had frequent contact with the Substance Misuse Branch and sat on national commi ttees, we found a surprising lack of knowledge about - or indeed interest in - t he Implementation Plans, even at senior levels. Indeed, two members of APoSM we interviewed had not even known of its existence. Moreover, among those who were aware of the document s, there was little sense of concern evident that priorities might be being defined by civil servants without adequate consultation with the field. C onsidering the widespread discussion and consultation that took place in 2007-8 ar ound the development of the Strategy, as well as the high level of familiarity we found with its contents, this relative lack of knowledge about and interest in t he Implementation Plans seems di fficult to explain. At a purely practical level, par t of the explanation may be that the format of the Plan - essentially a spreadsheet with a list of briefl y described actions - is not reader-friendly, and without close examination it is difficult to grasp its overall shape and significance. However, the crux of the matter may be that it consists less of a set of prescriptive statements about what kinds of services should be implemented, than a brief guide as to how to take forward the development of ce rtain broadly defined groups of activities. Thus the substance of the Plan could be described (with a few exceptions) as identifying the means for establishing interventions, rather than proposing specific interventions. This is illus trated in the extract from the 2008-11 Plan shown in Figure 5.1. Figure 5.1 Extract from th e 2008-11 Implementation Plan In short, although the national Implementat ion Plan clearly plays a major part in subsequent decisions about the allocation of funds to centrally designed and commissioned interventions, (examples being the Take Home Naloxone Project and the All Wales School Liaison Core Progra mme - see Chapter 6), its influence on how funds are allocated by planning boards and commissioners at local and regional level has generally been weaker and less direct. Most interviewees were more interested in, and concerned about, the decisions taken at these more local levels, where by far the largest proportions of funds for subst ance misuse services are distributed, and where the decisions taken determine precisely what kinds of services or interventions will be delivered, and by whom. This is illu strated by the following comments from a local commissioner and third sector provider, respectively: 38 So, yes, their implementation plan does help us but it, it's different to ours because it's much more strategic, it 's much broader, you know, what they expect you to do. I think there's a national implementation plan if I remember rightly. And then, er, we have in Dyfed a Dyfed strategy for the three counties and then we have individual implementation plans for each c ounty that reflect the strands of the strategy. ...That localises it more. It is to local planning and co mmissioning that we turn our attention in the next two sections. Planning and commissioning at local and regional level As outlined earlier, while the Welsh Government undertakes some central commissioning of substance misuse projects (see Chapter 6), the bulk of concrete decisions about what specific services will be funded and who wil l deliver them, are made at a more local level. As noted ear lier, these arrangements are currently in a state of transition, as responsibility for t he distribution of Welsh Government funds is transferred from local Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs) to regional Area Planning Boards (APBs), and co ntrol of the Home Office funds (distributed via the Welsh Government) previously earmarked fo r the Drug Intervention Programme (DIP) is transferred (without ring-fencing) to the new elected Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs). In this section, we briefly describe the various funding streams and local planning and commissioni ng arrangements that pertained during the first three years of the implementati on of the Strategy. We then present our interviewees' views about the strengths and weaknesses of these arrangements and the APB-based system that is replacing them. Funding streams and responsible bodies During the early years of the implementation of t he Strategy, the largest slice of the budget - the Substance Misuse Action Fund (SMAF) - was distributed through Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs) or, mo re specifically, the Substance Misuse Action Teams (SMATs) or Joint Commissioni ng Groups within them. In 2011-12, this amounted to \u00a322.6 million, which was divided among the 22 CSPs in accordance with a central funding formula, before being passed on to local providers through a variety of commissioning, grant-awarding and other processes. The other main block of funding, amounting to about \u00a317 million in the same year, was distributed by Local Health Boards: this is known as the '0.4 %', the percentage of t he overall health budget historically reserved for spending on substance misuse services. However, in April 2010 the planning and commissioning system embarked upon a major change aimed at greater coordinat ion between the use of the health and community safety budgets as well as across uni tary authority areas. This entailed the formation of seven regionally-based Area Planning Boards, comprising representatives from both CSPs and Local Health Boards. Two years later, further changes to the commissioning system were made following a formal review of APBs as part of the Minister's comprehensive S ubstance Misuse Review Programme. The review recommended 'a strengthened and enhanced role' for APBs and in April 2012, responsibility for distributing the SMAF revenue budget and approving the ('0.4%') Health budget was formally transferred fr om CSPs to APBs. The new system will become fully operational across Wales from April, 2013. 39 It is also important to mention the s eparate funding streams for offender-related services emanating from the Home Office and National Offender Management Service (NOMS). Again, major c hanges are under way in relation to these funds, but during the first three years of the Strategy, t he arrangements were as follows: Probation Trusts commissioned services for the tr eatment and testing of offenders serving community sentences with a Drug or Alc ohol Rehabilitation Requirement (DRR or ARR); NOMS commissioned prison-based Counsel ling, Assessment, Re ferral, Advice and Throughcare (CARAT) services; and Home Office funding (distributed via the Welsh Government) for the Drug Interventio n Programme, which offers treatment and support to substance misusing offender s on a voluntary basis, was managed and distributed by DIP boards and commissioners at r egional or sub-regional level. As is also the case across England, there has been considerable variation in the degree of consultation, collaboration and coordination (including joint commissioning) that has taken place in Wales between Health Boards, CSPs, APBs, and those responsible for offender-related services. This will be discussed in the next chapter. Annual plans Under the system in place until the arriva l of APBs, decisions about the kinds of services on which funds would be spent at lo cal level were made mainly by CSPs and Health Boards, albeit in both cases subject to ratification elsewhere. Technically, CSPs had to 'sign off' Health Board plans, al though in most cases, we were told, this was 'on the nod' - not least because ot her CSP members oft en found them opaque and lacking in detail and hence had trouble in understandi ng and interrogating them fully. CSP annual plans for spending their slic e of the funding had to be agreed by the Welsh Government Substance Misuse Branch. Achieving this agreement was helped by the intermediary role played by the Welsh Government's Substance Misuse Advisory Regional Teams (SMARTs), who vi sited CSPs on a regular basis to discuss their ideas and plans, and to ensure that they were in tune with both the Strategy and the central Implementation Plan. As a member of the Subst ance Misuse branch put it: That's part of the role of the SMART in a sense as well. So when they're attending the planning meetings, to push t he role, the Strategy. Well, not so much encouraging them to read the Strat egy, but more in terms of what our expectations of partners are within the implementation plan. Generally speaking, CSP members we inte rviewed felt that they had good relations with the SMARTs, who were willing to eng age in dialogue and entertain new ideas, and also that they had met with relatively li ttle disagreement or excessive interference from the Branch in relation to the signing o ff of their local plans. There were a few exceptions, especially where CSP members fe lt that certain areas of the Strategy were given less priority by the Subs tance Misuse Branch than others. One experienced member in particular, who had chaired a CSP, felt that the Branch was too focused on treatment, and paid only 'lip serv ice' to two of what he called the 'four pillars' of the Strategy, pr evention and enforcement. He claimed that efforts over several years to switch more of his loca l CSP funds into these fields had met with opposition and indeed vetoes from the centre. However, if anything, there was more criticism in the opposite directi on - i.e. that there was too little central influence and control over local plans, and that local and regi onal commissioners were insufficiently accountable for their actions. The latter i ssue will be discussed further in the next section and Chapter 7. 40 Interviews with Branch staff confirmed the g eneral view that they were happy to leave most decisions to local areas, so long as t he latter did not stray too far from the basic framework provided by the Stra tegy and the Implementation Pl an. On the whole, they said, they did not need to reject or alter lo cal plans submitted to them, as the SMARTs had already ensured in a more informal and collaborative way that most CSPs adhered to the broad parameters la id down. One senior civ il servant also noted that, strictly speaking, the Branch had no powers to tell CSPs how to design their plans, but in the final analysis it could refuse to si gn off those it was not happy with. A further point made by several interviewees in relation to local planning was that in many areas, relatively few members of the CSP had str ong knowledge about, or indeed interest in, substance misuse issues, and therefore were content to leave most of the decision-making to the SMATs or other small groups within the partnership. This had the disadvantage that the quality of substance misuse plans and their implementation could depend too heavily on the skills and judgement of a small number of individuals. Equally important, they were not always fully 'owned' by the partnership as a whole, thereby being adm inistered and discussed in something of a vacuum, too isolated from other aspects of CSP work. As is well known, substance misusers often have multiple needs, wh ich are best addressed holistically through close coordination with housing, education, employment, criminal justice and other local services. Without these links, some in terviewees warned, there is a tendency for substance misuse plans to drift towards an excessive focus on 'treatment' at the expense of addressing clients' psychosocia l and ('wrap around') social needs, thus unbalancing local provision and violating the spirit of the Strategy. Finally, planning was said to be made more difficult in some areas by a lack of adequate data and resources to produce reliable local needs analyses and hence to allow decisions to be m ade on the basis of sound evidence. A more general discussion of problems concerning data and ev idence can be found in Chapter 7. Commissioning Local planning includes not only decisions about what kinds of services to fund, but decisions about how and by whom they will be delivered. The term 'commissioning' is often used in the latter context, although as we shall see it conceals a wide variety of ways of making such decision s. We interviewed at least nine individuals who had some direct experience, past or present, as commissioners at national or local level. Most other interviewees had a fair am ount of knowledge about or experience of commissioning systems, often through personal contact with commissioners, and it was a topic on which robust views were expressed. With some exceptions, there was broad agreement that local commissioning in Wales under the 'old' system had a number of seriou s flaws (though, as we shall see below, less agreement on whether the introduction of APBs would repair them). Areas of criticism included concerns about inconsist ency (and sometimes unfairness) in the processes that determined choices of provider; variable levels of competence and experience among commissioners; and insuffici ent transparency of and accountability for decision-making. A few comments will be made on these topics below. The most fundamental set of criticisms, however, rela ted to the cumulative results of the complex and patchwork system of planning and commissioning that has grown up in Wales. Quite widespread concern was expr essed about the overall shape, balance and coherence of the services provided: in particular, about duplication and fragmentation arising from insufficient 'joining up' of wo rk commissioned from different 41 providers and different funding streams, and the negative impact of this on how the system is experienced by service users. This will be discussed in Chapter 6. Local commissioning processes Local commissioning processes, in the broad sense of ways of dec iding how funds will be distributed to service providers, were f ound to be highly diverse. At one extreme were CSPs in which competitive tendering had become the norm. At the other were areas where there was a general expectati on of almost automatic renewal of agreements, usually via the 'rolling over' of contracts or service level agreements with agencies that had been providing particular se rvices, in some cases for twenty or more years. The extent to which indivi dual CSPs tended in one or other of these directions appeared to be influenced by a variet y of factors, including traditional local practice, the local authority's interpretations of procurement rules, and individual preferences of commissioners.5 As was recognised by many stakeholders, both the above extremes can have major disadvantages. Regular 'competing' of large numbers of services not only involves both commissioners and potentia l providers in expensive and time-consuming bid preparation and assessment proc esses, but over-frequent changes of provider can be highly disruptive for staff and clients. On the other hand, a general assumption that contracts will be automatically renewed, risks complacency among the incumbent providers and accusations of unfairness from rivals who believe they would provide a more effective and innovative service. There was general agreem ent that the goal should be a happy medium - sometimes refe rred to as 'intelligent commissioning' - with a flexible mix of competitive tenderi ng, contract renewal, and other ways of ensuring that services are delivered by the most suitable agencies over appropriate lengths of time. Under this kind of approach, commissioner s may decide that as a general rule, agencies that are performing well should be a llowed to continue (with only occasional re-tendering exercises), while those who are not performing well s hould expect to face competition. This, however, raises the furt her question of how, in order to make such decisions, commissioners can know how we ll or badly particular agencies have been performing. Some providers argued that formal monitoring data are often misleading, and that commissioners who did not visit projects or take into account more qualitative evidence, could receive a false impression of the quality of services 'on the ground', and hence make poor and uninformed decisions (for further discussion of issues around monitoring and evidence, see Chapters 7 and 8). Once a decision has been taken to re-commission a service (or indeed commission a new one), the approach adopted may range from a process in which innovative thinking is welcomed and potentia l providers are asked to put forward their own ideas about what to provide and how, to one in whic h they respond to a tender specification setting out a list of closely prescribed and defi ned activities which they are required to deliver at a competitive price. The latter kind of approach is more often (though by no means always) associated with 'procurement' than with 'commissioning' processes, and may be governed by rules laid down by local authorities, such as allowing no account to be taken of the incumbent agency' s previous performance in delivering the service, and obliging the commissioners to ma ke decisions on the basis of transparent 5 Although the Welsh Government issues a guidance document for commissioners, this leaves a great deal of discretion to the local areas and seemed to have relatively limited influence on how they approached the tasks. 42 scoring systems. As some interviewees po inted out, while superficially fair, such systems can be over-rigid and prevent commissioners from using their judgement, thereby sometimes leading to results not in t he best interests of service users or of the coherence of local networks of provision. They also tend to favour larger organisations with the capacity to employ spec ialists skilled in bid preparation, which may help them score the highest points without necessarily being the most suitable provider in reality. One interviewee whos e agency had recently lost its contract to deliver a particular service commented as follows: Basically [we lost it] on a 1% or 0. 9%, I think it was on one of them, because they don't take in past history, even t hough our commissioner loved our service. However, there we go, procurement is procurement... They score them and they go like, oh that was a better answer, I'll give them three extra points on that and obviously when it's all added up, oh my god, they've won, they've beaten us, because they've given a slightly better answer. [The prov ider that won it] write tenders all the time... However, when you look at the impact... services sort of go awry for six months, they then need a building, which is 300 grand, which we wouldn't have needed that money. So the added cost fo r changing provider, when your service is doing well, is insane.. Finally, some sense of the variety of co mmissioning practice can be gleaned from the following extract from an interview with a manager from a third sector provider: Q So are there any of your projects, services that just get rolled over automatically? A Yes. Q Why is it that so me do and some don't? A You'd have to ask the commissioners that. Q Is it different commissioners? A Yeah. Q So some commissioners will just roll them on and others...? A Pretty much. Q Okay. So it's certain services in certain areas then... is there no competition? Or is there nobody who would bid for them? A Yeah, there's loads of people wh o would bid for it. God yeah. Q Okay. But the commissioners are obviously happy with the service? A Yes, and they seem to get round procurement rules. Q Yeah, so it's extensions or something. 43 A You know, different local authorit ies have different procurement, but there's a difference between commissioning and procuring services. Q Yes. A And even all the tendering processes ar e totally different, where you go. You know you'll have one who'll ask you for three books like this, another will... a couple of responses. Some will ask for a PQQ, so they'll filter down. Then a full invitation to tender. Some will do it at the same time. Q Okay. A It's all different. While recognising the confusion and frustr ation that could be created by such a complex and inconsistent set of practice s across Wales, members of the Substance Misuse Branch were clear that it was not thei r role to interfere, influence or scrutinise commissioning processes: I think the difficulty we've got in substanc e misuse is that a lot of our services are delivered by the voluntary sector and there are rules around, you know, putting things out to open competition. So it is a fine line, really, as to what we should... what is planning and what is co mmissioning?... That is one area that we would leave to local decisions to be made... the SMARTs are there in an advisory role and they shouldn't be making decisions on that. So it would be down to individual, in the main, loca l authority and procurement processes, and they'd have to adhere to that. DIP and Health Boards: Cultural differences around commissioning While most of the above discussion relate s predominantly to the commissioning of services by CSPs from third sector provider s, it is important to remember that (a) services specifically for offenders we re funded through DIP commissioners and Probation Trusts, and (b) a significant amount of funding wa s distributed through Health Boards. Issues around the integration (or not) of se rvices funded in these ways with those commissioned through CSPs will be discussed in the next chapter. However, it is first important to highlight some of the 'cultural' differences in attitudes to the commissioning of services that were apparent in comments made by interviewees from different professional backgrounds. Not ably, while most of those with a criminal justice background (including probation, prisons and police managers, as well as DIP commissioners) were supporters of the co mpetitive commissioning processes which governed the distribution of DIP funds, it was clear that mo st of those with a health background (including addicti ons consultants, nurses and members of Health Boards) found the concept of competitive commi ssioning somewhat unpalatable. Such processes were rarely employed by Health Boards. Indeed, rather than commissioning specific projects from a range of providers, t he bulk of their '0.4%' was used to sustain NHS units which provide a range of clinical services to substance misusers - in particular, NHS addiction treat ment units, which were seen as part of mainstream health provision and no different to any other specialist unit such as cardiology. These arrangements and the th inking behind them were not always understood or agreed with by interviewees without a health background and we found quite a lot of cynicism about them, with seve ral - including members of CSPs who had 44 had to sign off Health Boards' annual subs tance misuse spending plans - expressing concerns about a lack of transparency. While 'high end' treatment services (which often prioritised clients with complex medical needs) were funded through the Health Boards, some other clinical services - principally, detoxification and the prescribing of opiate substitutes - were commissioned partly out of CSP funds as par t of 'packages' of services delivered under the auspices of third sect or agencies. There were c onflicting views on this. On the one hand, although concerne d about expensive clinical interventions eating into the funds available for other kinds of support, most interviewees with a third sector or criminal justice background cons idered it helpful for individua l clients if, for example, their appointments to see s upport workers included a prescribing service on the same premises. On the other hand, most of those with a health background expressed some concerns about too much control over such services being placed in the hands of people with little or no medical knowledge. Some negative comments were made about the 'h iring' by other agencies of medically qualified practitioners (chiefly GPs) to suppl y detoxification or prescribing services, which had led in some areas to bad feeli ng between practitioners. For example, cases were cited of organisations winning CSP co ntracts to deliver a range of services including prescribing, and only then approac hing medically qualified individuals or groups (some of whom had been part of rival bi ds) to ask if they would prescribe for them. More importantly, major ethical an d clinical governance issues (central, of course, to any doctor's or nurse's work) were raised in a situation where a DIP contract specified that funding for prescribing was limited to 24 weeks for any client. This created a dilemma for GPs appointed to supply the prescribing service, as they were unwilling to 'abandon' their clients before they had comple ted treatment, but made a clinical judgement in some cases that it would be not in the client's best interests to reduce their opiate substitu te dose so quickly. The problem was ameliorated after more flexibility was agr eed, but this exam ple provides a good illustration of the very diffe rent approaches to dealing with substance misuse found in different professions, and how much impac t these can have, through the control and operation of commissioning processes, on practice on the ground. Finally and by contrast, there seemed to be agreement on a ll sides that the commissioning of Tier 4 residential treatment services, traditionally undertaken by various CSPs using ring-fenced funds, was i nappropriately located at local level, and should be managed centrally. For example, the following comments were from a government officer and a third sector provider, respectively: There are services like residential rehabi litation for drug and alcohol misuse that should be centrally driven. I mean you can't hav e 22 residential units, you can't have 22 in-patient detox ification units. So there are services which need to be centrally determined. Well I don't know if there is a Tier Four strategy but they should have a Tier Four strategy. It's not good enough for some areas to say, well we don't really do residential. What do you mean, you don't do residential? If the Welsh government are saying you need treatment , we need treatment. And if it's residential, you need residential, and don't pu t them in a psychiatric unit unless they are mentally ill, you know. That ' something I feel really passionate about, 45 and really as a treatment provider, agai n the lack of integrity, they've had research programmes on it, but t hey don't want to listen. Quality of commissioners While some individual commissioners were prai sed for their skills, knowledge, fairness and/or approachability, the overall picture of local commissioning presented by our interviewees was one of significant variability in quality. Typical comments included: I know some very good commissioners. I also know some not very good commissioners who would tend to be swayed more by personality than by what is best for the service users in that population. Commissioners have a lot of power and sometimes I find myself really struggling with what I have to do to k eep the commissioners happy. Because if I don't keep them happy, what are they goi ng to do to my funding? I find that one of the most distressing parts of my job, because you know our values here are around honesty, transparency and about working towards plans, working towards strategies, evidencing that. Yet sometimes it co mes down to the personality of that person and whether they like you or not. I don't know how you can put into place some thing to stop that happening. Several pointed out that the job was not of high status a nd only moderately well paid, and therefore did not always attract sufficient candidates with the desirable level of expertise and experience. Indeed, one senior manager of a third sector agency said that he had toyed with applying for the ro le, which he considered vital to the successful implementation of t he Strategy, but could not afford to take the drop in salary! A small number of provider s complained of bias on the part of commissioners towards or against particular local providers (in one case, indeed, the phrase 'bordering on corruption' was mentioned - though in a general sense, without concrete allegations). Some were also said to be 'pushing their own agenda', not necessar ily in tune with the Strategy. For example, one experienced service provider commented: There are commissioners who I think are great, who I think are very knowledgeable, who are very fair, who are transparent, and understanding of what it is to deliver services, and yet you know there are some commissioners who come from a very different ba ckground and have their own agendas to push. They can only push them with service providers. You find the commissioners that seem to have t he heavy management of them, because they've got no power, they then have power over the providers. Your Strategy doesn't mean anything if someone's coming along and telling you to do something [that doesn't fit with it]. This raises the issue of the accountabi lity of commissioners for their actions and decisions - a topic that will be addressed in Chapter 7. Commissioning through APBs Most of our interviewees felt that the current transfer of responsibility for commissioning from CSPs to APBs will lead eventually to an amelioration of the problems described, although many rema ined unconvinced that matters would improve as much as they would wish. 46 The general view was that the quality, consistency and transparency of decision- making were likely to improve. At the same time, however, a number of concerns were expressed. Some of those who had been involved in commissioning at CSP level were worried that service users in their areas would 'lose out' relative to others when decisions were made at a regional level. Likewise, some felt that valuable local knowledge about the substance misuse needs of the area, and about small providers and their links with other local services, would not be available at regional level, which could lead to poor decision-making. For example: I mean, I'm sceptical of the APB because it's supposed to be there to save money supposedly and to commission mo re effectively on a regional basis. I've yet to see that workin g out. All it's done to date is create another bureaucratic monster which none of us can afford to feed really. If we're commissioning one main provider in North Wales on a local basis, we can commission that as one, but what you don't want to lose is the local flavour of what that service means. Some interviewees also felt that the ex pected increase in consistency across Wales might not materialise, as different APBs were already interpreting their role in very different ways - for example, seeing themselves either as primarily strategic bodies or as primarily commissioners: I still think across South Wales wit h the three APBs there is a real confusion about what they do. I m ean each one is completely different. There's no consistency... The *** area seems to be more of a commissioning group. The *** group seems to be more of a strategic lead group and then the ***, well I think it's still coalescing... Another worry was that the membership and size of APBs was not necessarily conducive to effective decision-making: The APB has well over 30 people. It can't make decisions - it's too big. And because it's too big it gets dominated by personalities and there are two particular personalities really that will just lead the decisions wherever they want them to go. So I don't see it functioning particularly well. Finally, some concerns were expressed about the lack of a clear statutory basis for APBs. For example, an APB chair commented: I think the whole concept of an Ar ea Planning Board which doesn't have any statutory responsibi lity is really puzzling people. They're really struggling with it from a governance point of view. So one of my understandings is that, within the concept of the Strategy, if you like, the brief for substance misuse has now moved from the local government minister to the health minister. And yet, the statutory re quirements for the implementation of the Strategy, if you like, remains at the local authority level. The Area Planning Board is required to pull that together, and I think everybody's struggling with gov ernance, you know, how do you do good governance via a non-statutory partnership? I think that, that's troubling people. 47 Further comment on APBs, specifically ab out their potential for adopting a more strategic approach and creating a more 'joi ned up' system of service provision in Wales, will be made in the next chapter. Conclusion It can be concluded from the evidence present ed in this chapter that the Substance Misuse Branch had a fair degree of influence - mainly through its ownership of the three-year Implementation Plans, the interme diary role played by the SMARTs, and its ultimate control of the 'purse strings' - on the broad shape of the services to be commissioned in local areas. Nevertheless, within this framewor k, there was still considerable space for local decisions about the precise nature of the interventions to be commissioned and, above all, for decisions about which agencies would deliver them. Until recently, indeed, mo st of the power in this respect lay in the hands of local commissioners - principally, Substance Misuse Lead Officers based within CSPs. This power was increased in some areas by the relative disinterest of other CSP members in substance misuse, so that the SMLOs were given virtually a free hand. Partly as a result of this (together with differences in attitudes and rules adopted by local authorities in relation to commissioni ng), there were wide variations across the country in the nature, qual ity, fairness, effectiveness and transparency of the processes followed, and ranges in prac tice from areas where competitive commissioning (often following strict procurement rules) was the norm, to those where most contracts were routinely renewed without competition. Most interviewees also agreed that there were some excellent co mmissioners and some whose practices left much to be desired. It was also pointed out that there was no satisfactory way of complaining about the la tter. It was further noted that both DIPs and Heal th Boards had different practices and cultures guiding the way allo cated money - the former genera lly favouring competitive tendering and the latter often funding substanc e misuse treatment in a similar way to the funding of many other health services, i.e. via the allocation of annual budgets to NHS units. On the question of whether the advent of APBs was likely to produce more consistency and a generally high er quality of commissioning, views were mixed. Most interviewees felt that they had the pot ential for higher quality decision-making and more strategic approaches, although some f ears were expressed that they could be pushed off track by powerful individuals, for example advocati ng the interests of particular local areas within the region. It was also pointed out that definitive guidance about the role and powers of APBs was ye t to be produced, and that there were already considerable differences across Wales in how the Chairs had interpreted their tasks. Some of these issues, it s hould be noted, were flagged in the Welsh Government's recent APB review, and at the time of our interviews, stakeholders were awaiting further guidance. 48 CHAPTER 6: THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE: COVERAGE, BALANCE, COHERENCE, FRAGMENTATION Introduction In this chapter we look at the overall results of the planning and commissioning arrangements described in the previous chapter. We begin by attempting to 'map' as best we can the totality of services, projects and interventions that have been implemented in Wales through the various funding streams referred to, and to use the results to make a broad assessment of the extent to which what has been implemented covers the main areas identifi ed in the Strategy, of the overall balance between them, and whether there are any signi ficant gaps. This turned out to be an extremely difficult task, and t he available data are inadequate to allow it to be carried out fully and accurately: as far as we know , nobody has attempted to do it before. We then present stakeholder perceptions of the overall 'balance' of the system in terms of the amount of at tention and resources devoted to different kinds of interventions. We also explore their perceptions of the extent to which different parts of the system work together harmonious ly or, conversely, to what extent it is blighted by 'silo' mentality, fragmentation or duplication. Finally, we summarise their views on the possible impact of APBs and PCCs. Mapping the system: what is actually funded and implemented? Programmes funded through CSPs The main part of our mapping exercise wa s based on Welsh Government data, listing projects and activities funded by CSPs during one twelve-mont h period (2011-2012). More details about the database used and our methods of analysis can be found in Appendix 5. Among a total of 378 entries, we were abl e to identify 244 separ ate projects or activities that could be categorised with a reasonable degree of c onfidence into one or other of the four action areas in the Strategy document. Most of the other entries referred to a variety of staffing and manage ment costs (includi ng training, waste management etc) which we were unable readily to assign to specific interventions. A summary of the 244 identifiable projects and activities is presented in Table 6.1. Table 6.1: Identifiable projects and activities recorded in the 2011-2012 CSP funding allocations, by action area Action area Intervention type Projects and activities n Projects and activities % 1. Preventing harm Education & prevention 35 14 2. Support for substance misusers Harm reduction 15 6 Treatment 85 35 Other support 77 32 3. Supporting families Support 19 8 49 4. Tackling availability Enforcement 13 5 Total 244 100 Overall, the greatest number of projects and activities (177 out of 244, or 73 per cent) were adjudged to fall under the 'Support for s ubstance misusers' action area. By contrast only 14 per cent fell under 'Preventing harm', eight per cent under 'Supporting and protecting families' and five per cent under 'Tackling availability'. The projects and activities in the 'Support fo r substance misusers' action area can also be broadly divided into three s ub-groups, as shown in the sec ond column of the table. The subcategory of 'treatment' (85 case s) emerged as the most frequently listed activity of all. This in turn consisted of fairly equal numbers of activities identified as prescribing and psychosocial approaches. Pr escribing included brief interventions, when they involved detoxification, GP shared care schemes, or the generic category of prescribing. Psychosocial interventions included alcohol services as well as brief interventions and general treatment. The second largest sub-category (77 cases) concerned other support services to substance misusers. In many of these cases it was unclear precisely what services were of fered, but the remainde r refer to specific activities such as counselling, drop-in serv ices, outreach, and supporting service user groups. The third largest group of projects and activiti es (35 cases) related to the action area of 'Preventing harm'. These focused predominantly on schools-based education and on methods of educating the public. They also included 'diversionary activities', which usually related to schemes for young people (more detailed breakdowns are shown in Appendix 5 Table A5.1 and A5.2). No projects or activities had targeted substance misuse in further or higher education, or unemployed young people. However, an action research intervention, aimed at r educing excessive alcohol consumption in Welsh Universities (A pilot study of alcohol policy and social norms in Welsh Universities) is listed in Table 8.2 on page 81, where the intervention is listed as \"local\"). Of course, to look at the numbers of interventions alone could be misleading, as it is possible that some are much larger and more expensive than others. It is therefore also important to look at a breakdown by expenditure. Table 6.2 shows such a breakdown, using the same four categories as in the abov e analysis. It also shows 'other' costs shown in the lists, but not attri butable to particular kinds of intervention. Table 6.2: Total cost activities recorded in the 2011-2012 CSP funding allocations Allocation use n Mean Sum % all Projects and activities Preventing harm 35 21,626 756,911 4 Support for substance misusers177 65,967 11,544,219 64 Supporting families 19 87,286 1,658,425 9 Tackling availability 13 25,271 328,522 2 50 Total 244 50,038 14,288,077 79 Other Staff Costs 73 35,355 2,580,965 14 Running Costs 52 25,407 1,321,172 7 Total 125 60,762 3,902,137 21 Notes: Running costs include costs relating to offi ce supplies such as computer software, computer hardware and photocopiers. It can be seen that, as in the breakdown by numbers of projects, by far the largest proportion of the total CSP bud get - at least 73 per cent - was spent on interventions aimed at supporting substance misusers and their families. In comparison, relatively little was spent on preventing harm and tackling availability. It is worth noting that, although comprising only 19 projects, activities aimed at supporting families received nearly ten per cent of the budget; by cont rast 35 'preventing harm' interventions received only four per cent. Even so, a bro adly similar picture of the distribution of resources emerges, looked at through either lens (i.e. numbers of activities, or expenditure). Of course, CSP-distributed f unds - although the largest - fo rm only part of the total spend on substance misuse related activities in Wales, and we should not jump to conclusions from an examinat ion of this funding stream alone. We now briefly examine (to the extent that data are available) what kinds of activities were implemented through the other main funding rout es that were in operation for the first three years after the Strategy was publish ed: those channelled via the Health Boards, DIP, Probation Trust, and direct from central government. Health Board funded services Most other clinical services were funded from health budgets controlled by the Local Health Boards. In most cases, these funds were allocated, without competitive tendering, to NHS units, although in some ar eas limited funding was also distributed to third sector providers. During the course of our interviews it becam e clear that, while a ballpark figure of \u00a317 million was quoted as the total dispersed in th is way, little concrete information was available about what exactly it was spent on. In fact one mem ber of the Substance Misuse Branch described the situation as a 'm ystery' and indicated that 'nobody's ever known what the 0.4% is'. The Branch was unable to provide us with any breakdown of the services funded, it being stated that, 'W e don't really manage that, it's a Health Board issue'. Respondents working in the Health field were al so unable to help, beyond noting that most of the funds were s pent on clinical services which formed part of the NHS. For our purpose here of attempting to 'map' the totality of substance misuse services, this lack of information is not helpful. Howeve r, we can at least conclude that the great majority of Health Board funded services can be classified under the action area heading of 'Support for substance misusers', and more specifica lly, 'treatment'. 51 Centrally funded interventions In addition to interventions funded by the SMAF and health budgets, a number of national services and experimental proj ects were commissioned centrally by the Substance Misuse Branch. Precisely how many such projects have been funded from this central budget was difficult to determi ne. We know, however, that at least 12 projects have been funded either wholly or in part from the cent ral pot since 2008. These include, in no particular order: 1. the Take Home Naloxone project 2. the Transitional Support Scheme 3. the CRAFT project 4. Early Parental Intervention Pilot projects 5. the All Wales School Liaison Core programme (co-funded between the Welsh Government and the 4 police forces in Wales) 6. the 'Include' Tu rnaround programme 7. the Option 2 project 8. the Pilot study of alcohol policy and social norms 9. Alcohol Brief Interventions 10. the Strengthening Families programme 11. the Recovery project 12. Operation Tarian (co-funded with South Wales Police) The projects are varied in nature and target a range of different kinds of actual or potential substance misuser. The Take Home Naloxone progr amme, for example, targets people at risk of opiate overdose while the Transitional Support Scheme targets short-term prisoners on release from prison. We are unable to give an accurate figure for the total cost of centrally funded projects and interventions. It should be noted that almost all have been subject to formal evaluation (see Appendix 6 for summaries of the known evaluations), and the additional costs of commissioning independent evaluations s hould also be factored in. Overall, it is likely that the annual amount spent on delivering and evaluating these projects amounts to severa l million pounds. In terms of the balance of spending between Strategy action area s, these centrally funded activities may even up the picture a li ttle, as a number of the projects listed have primarily preventive aims, and one of the most expensive (Tarian, which has received \u00a3642,000 in Welsh Government fu nds annually since 2008/9) is concerned with tackling availability. DIP funded interventions Another important source of funding for substance misuse services in Wales has been the annual grant from the Home Office (distr ibuted via the Welsh Government) to run the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) for offenders. DIP funding is being discontinued as such, and wi ll now form part of the (non -ring-fenced) budget of the newly elected Police and Crime Commissioner s, with no guarantee that it will be spent on similar activities to those it currently funds (see below). The DIP is described on the WG website as 'a crime reduction initiative which provides a much needed support structure to encour age offenders out of crime and into treatment'. In practice, it involves ident ifying Class A drug-misusing offenders at every stage of the criminal justice system from arrest onwards, and encouraging them to 52 engage in treatment, support or aftercare. To support regiona l delivery of the programme in Wales, four Regional Manage ment Boards (RMBs) were created, one for each police force area. The RMBs eac h produced their own local implementation plan to guide the commissioning of servic es delivered by the Criminal Justice Integrated Teams (CJITs). In 2012, five treatment agencies were involved in the delivery of DIP: South Wales - G4S and CRI North Wales - Arch Initiatives Dyfed Powys - Prism and Kaleidoscope Gwent - CRI The Dyfed Powys DIP website provides a us eful summary of how clients can access the DIP and what interventions are available to them: Contact with DIP will be made through the c ourts, probation, police, prisons, a 24 hour Helpline, self-referral or through referral from other key agencies. Clients will have contact with a drug wo rker who will conduct an initial assessment and develop with the client a Care Plan that matches available services to the client's needs. This may include harm reduction advice and information, one to one motivational interviewing, relapse prevention and referral to volunteer and mentoring schem es, specialist substitute prescribing schemes and wrap around support such as housing, education and training and family support. (http://www.dyfe d-powysdip.org.uk/about.html) DIP funding has decreased in recent year s. The annual report for 2010/11 shows that just under \u00a36m was spent on DIP services ac ross Wales. The figures are broken down by police force area and show that most of the money was spent in South Wales (\u00a32.9m) followed by North Wales (\u00a31.2m), Gwent, (\u00a31.1m) and Dyfed Powys (\u00a3800k). The bulk of the money was allocated to f und the CJITs (\u00a35.3m) and the remainder was allocated to RMBs. The report indicates t hat no DIP money was allocated towards the national telephone helpline (DAN 24/7) or to the Transiti onal Support Scheme for ex- prisoners. Similarly, no DIP money appear s to have been allocated to cover any central costs. The picture that emerges from this brief overview of DIP funded activities is, once again, of a primary focus on 'Support for s ubstance misusers'. Even though controlled largely by commissioners working in the crimi nal justice field, very little of the DIP budget appears to be spent on eit her 'preventing harm' or 'tackling availability'. DRRs and ARRs Services ordered by the courts for substance misusing offenders - mainly Drug or Alcohol Rehabilitation Requir ements (DRRs and ARRs) are paid for by the National Offender Management Services, and commissioned fr om local providers by Probation Trusts (Wales Probation in the case of Wales). However, following the Probation Review (2012), these arrangements, too, are likely to change. Projects funded from other sources In addition to the sources of funding descr ibed above, we were aware from our own knowledge of the field that other sources had also been used to fund substance misuse services in Wales. These include d large grants (in the millions of Euros) obtained from the European Social Fund to fund key wrap around services such as 53 the all-Wales Peer Mentoring project (s ponsored by the Welsh Government) and the Coastal project (sponsored by six South West Wales local authorities), both of which were designed to help economically inactive (former and stable current) substance misusers gain qualifications and employment. They also included grants without any links to central or local government, which meant that no formal list of relevant projects was available to us. Such information is li kely to be stored at the local level within individual agencies, and APBs are also now tasked with monitoring all services in their area regardless of funding stream, but we we re unable to conduct a survey to explore the matter in detail. We did ask our interv iewees (where relevant) if they had received funding from other non-gov ernment sources, and one re spondent reported that his third sector organisation had obt ained \u00a3250,000 from the Big Lottery to help fund the purchase and development of a new building. It is likely that others have been successful from this or other charitable sour ces, which suggests that the overall figure for externally obtained funds r uns into several millions. Again, we cannot be sure of the distribution of external ly acquired funds across the four action areas in the Strategy, but what we know suggests that, as with all the other funding streams, the main ar ea of investment has been in 'Support for substance misusers'. Conclusion The services funded from the various sources above span the whole range of interventions proposed in the Strategy doc ument. However, analysis of the kinds of projects and activities implemented with f unds distributed through CSPs, suggests that by far the greatest emphasis (in terms of both numbers of projects and allocation of funding) was placed on support for substance misusers. This covered a range of services, the most common being treatment through prescribing or psychosocial interventions. While centrally distributed funds may even up the picture a little, in that they include considerable investment in projects aimed at prevention and tackling availability, those distri buted through Health Boards and the DIP are once again directed mainly at treating and supporting substance misusers. In other words, although we do not have full information at our disposal, it can be concluded with some confidenc e that the majority of the available resources are directed at just one of the f our action groups in the Strat egy - 'Support for substance misusers'. It is unknown to what extent this distribution of resources reflects conscious prioritisation from the centre, and to what exte nt it is an unplanned outcome of numerous individual decis ions at local level. Stakeholder views about the s ubstance misuse 'system' We now look at the views of stakeholder in terviewees both about the overall coverage and balance of the system fo r responding to substance misuse in Wales, and about the extent to which it is coherent and 'joined up'. Coverage and balance We found a range of stakeholder views about the overall balance of the system. As mentioned in the last chapter, a small number of interviewees felt that one or other of the action areas of the Stra tegy not concerned with support - i.e. Preventing harm and Tackling availability - were under-funded and unde r-prioritised. However, these were firmly in the minority, and there was a str ong consensus that tr eatment and support of substance misusers and their families should be the central priority. Even so, there was a fair degree of disagreement about w hether the appropriate balance had been 54 achieved between different kinds of treat ment and support. Unsu rprisingly, views on this tended to vary according to professional background. Many of the interviewees who did not work in the health system felt that too much of the budget went towards clinical treatment and that, in a period of financial retrenchment, it was the more 'social' kinds of interventions - particularly those delivered by the third sector - that were more likely to suffer cuts. On the other hand, several of those with a clinical background felt strongly that the balance was tilted too much towards psychos ocial interventions, when (in their view) no strategy could be successful without effect ive medical treatment at its heart. This did not mean that they denied the value of c ounselling or social support, but they felt that this should be a secondary service, building on the foundations of clinical treatment. For example, one de scribed prescribing as the 'glu e' of the system. It not only kept substance misusers on course fo r ultimate freedom from addiction, but gave them a strong incentive to keep appointment s on a regular basis: the latter created a useful base from which partner agencies co uld offer 'wrap around' services such as housing and employment advice. As ment ioned in the previous chapter, several interviewees with a health background were cr itical of commissioners who did not fully understand clinical treatment and saw pr escribing almost as an adjunct to psychosocial interventions, rather than vice-ver sa. This was seen by some as a result of too little guidance from the Welsh Government. Duplication and fragmentation One of the most common topics that emerged in our interv iews with stakeholders was the problem of fragment ation of service delivery. A high proportion conceded that, for the service user, the experienc e of substance misuse interventions was often far from the ideal of a coherent and 'seamless' pr ocess with a sense of a planned journey towards a clear goal. Rather, although many individuals working in the system made efforts to link up with other agencies, ther e were frequent problems of gaps, delays in handovers, duplicated assessments, and so on (similar conclusions were reached in the Healthcare Inspectorate Wales report published in 2012, Substance Misuse Services in Wales: Are They Meeting the Needs of Service Users and Their Families? - see Chapter 8 below). The problems identified included both gaps within 'treatment' it self and between treatment and 'wrap around' or follow-up servic es. Examples of the first of these include failed links or delays between criminal justice related treatment (in prison, or under the DIP) and ordinary community tr eatment services. We have already mentioned in the previous chapter the 24-week limit on funding for prescribing imposed by a DIP: this would not have caused problems had there been a way of ensuring that after 24 weeks service users were transferred to the care of another agency to continue their treatment, but this was not the case. More generally, treatment providers would oft en not allow people such as ex-prisoners to 'jump the queue' to continue work they had begun in custody, though criminal justice staff argued that they should be a priority group (it should, however, be noted that such services appeared to be more 'joined up' in North Wales). Examples of the second include completing treatment with a c linical provider (such as an addictions unit) but then finding it difficult to access social support services. The advent of the all-Wales ESF-f unded Peer Mentoring project was said by some to have ameliorated this problem somewhat by offering opportunities for employment to service users who had completed clinical treat ment. However, it was also clear that 55 some agencies were not referring as many cases as they could to this service, partly because of inter-agency rivalries and partly - parti cularly in the case of medical staff - because of sceptical views about its val ue (it was argued both that a focus on employment did not meet the needs of many service users at this point in their lives and even that peer mentoring was not a 'profe ssional' enough follow-up to treatment). Will APBs improve the system? As noted in the previous c hapter, we found qualified support for the new APB structure in terms of its potential for better qualit y and more consistent decision-making. Perhaps more important, however, is the question of whether APBs will adopt a more strategic and 'joined up' approach to planni ng and decision-making and thereby bring about significant reductions in the fragment ation, duplication and inconsistencies in practices across local authority areas. Most interviewees expressed at least cautious optimism on this score. For example: I mean I'm not actually on the APB but I've always been an advocate of the APB. I think the problem we've had in North Wales is that we've had six SMATs. The money is not insignifi cant but compared to the global pot for local authorities and other agencies it 's quite small. So we've had some quite junior people managi ng pots of money and managing commissioning and managing what we do. My hope is that the APB with it being a North Wales body will have peopl e of sufficient seniority on that who can actually make strategic decisi ons into the next five or ten years. You know, the APB hopefully will coalesce into a sort of regionally commissioned service and there'll be equalit y of access for individuals... There is huge disparity. You know, if you're ten miles down the road in Neath or if you're ten miles up t he road in Swansea or vice versa in Bridgend, there doesn't seem to be any consistency on who's eligible for what and what the timeframes are, so hopefully that will change with the APB. As to a strategic development and, y ou know, overall ... there's got to be a pan Gwent vision. It just doesn't make sense that if you live in one area you can access in-patient detox; if y ou live in the other area you can't. Whether or not the widely shared goal of a more coherent and user-friendly service would be achieved was genera lly thought to depend on whet her the key people on the APBs, including of course the Chairs, were of sufficient strategic vision and strength of purpose to overcome the many obstacles that could throw them off course, not least pressure from local areas and interest gr oups (some of which will be represented on the APBs) to meet their particular demands . For example: I've got concerns around the APB, as I've probably voiced throughout this interview... I think some of it's about hav ing the right level of participation. I think if you're doing st rategy, you've got to have, you know, senior representatives from each organisation that firstly treats substance misuse as a priority, see it as an importan t, you know, part of the business, and then are committed to look ing outwith their own box, so when you're trying to spend money on, you know, often regional services, you can have local services, but you don't deliver everythi ng on the doorstep. You've got to have people willing to just let go, you know, and not be defensive. And I'm 56 not sure that we've achieved that anywhere near yet, and it feels to me very defensive from a local perspective of people trying to hang on to what they've got, not wanting to give up th ings in relation to the greater good. But I do think really if they want to see something which really, truly looks like cohesive regional planning and co mmissioning they need to give the APB a statutory power to do that. And at the same time take that away from the local authorities. The impact of PCCs Finally, it is important to consider briefly the possible impact on the 'system' that will be produced by the transfer of DIP funds to the elected PCCs. Numerous stakeholders from a range of professional backgrounds expressed concerns that, unless the PCCs have a good understanding of the importance of DIP services to the provision of substance misuse services as a whole, the consequences could be serious. The following comments from interviews give some flavour of t he strength of these concerns: But of course with the PCCs coming now that money may disappear. We may get it back through the PCC for subst ance misuse, on the other hand the new commissioner may decide otherwise, so we could lose that amount, which I think in our case is about 52 grand. Really dried up, I mean we 've had huge funding cuts over the last three years. And it will be at least the same going into next year, that's before the PCC even decides what they want to do with the money. And unfortunately it's always the wrap around stuff that goes first because it's the hardest to evidence and it's generally the stuff that's not written down as being r equired. So you always end up pulling back to kind of core service delivery when you know that there's an equal value to both but there isn' t always an evidence base for more alternative engagement really. I'm really worried, and not on a personal basis, but on a basis of, you know, what's going to happen? This ... you know, worked years and years really hard to get these systems up and working and e ffective for people and then all of a sudden it's ... it might all come crashing down overnight. It's really worrying. Obviously I remember the days before DIP, and I wouldn't like to go back to those sorts of days so, you know, we are quite concerned about that. I understand that the APB is doing a paper at the mome nt ready for the PCC coming in to explain the backgrou nd to DIP and the integrated offender management and how we use some of t he SMAF and the health funding to work with offenders and that if you take one bit away you're going to destabilise the rest and that it's working quite we ll. So I think they are trying to be proactive to say, you know, it's working, please leave it along at the minute. So that is a concern. Conclusion This chapter has presented a brief overvi ew of the substance misuse projects, services and activities actually funded and implemented in Wales. We found it impossible to identify all such activities, which include services provided by the NHS which are difficult to separate out from the rest of the health budget, and various one- 57 off projects funded through, for example, the Big Lottery an d other external grants. Nevertheless, we were able to gain a fairly full picture of what was commissioned through the CSPs. A certain amount of imbalance was appar ent in terms of investment in the different action areas of the Strategy docum ent. The bulk of the funds allocated were concentrated in activi ties and projects categorisable as 'Support for substance misusers': principally, treat ment, psychosocial interventions and other support services. Less investment (in term s of numbers of activities and amounts of funding) was made in 'Preventing harm' or 'Ta ckling availability'. Similar patterns were found in the other funding st reams, although the centrally funded projects included several with a prevention aim, and one large one (Operation Tarian) with an enforcement aim. Despite this apparent imbalance, most interv iewees were reasonably happy with the distribution of funding between action areas, although (unsurpr isingly) some of those working in specific fields fe lt that too little of the budget was spent on their own kind of work. Perhaps the strongest area of disagreement was between interviewees with health and other backgrounds, over the level of priority that should be given to clinical treatment as against psychosocial interv entions and 'wrap around' support. In terms of the operation of the system as a whole, ther e was wide agreement that it suffered from both fragmentat ion and duplication, and that an individual's 'journey' through it was often not smooth or 'seamless'. Too often, it was disrupted by agency rivalries, complex funding arrangements, or lack of comm unication and coordination. Some held out hope that such problems w ould be ameliorated by the advent of APBs, but concerns were expressed that the latter's effectiveness might be undermined by continuing pushing of local needs at the expense of a more strategic regional approach, or by inappropriate choices of Board members. Finally, serious concerns were voiced about the possible loss of vital services for offenders - and knock-on effects on the system as a whole - if the incoming PCCs decided to spend the current DIP funds (which will no longer be ring-fenced) elsewhere. 58 CHAPTER 7: OVERSIGHT, MONI TORING, ACCOUN TABILITY AND CHANGE MANAGEMENT: EFFECT IVENESS OF THE STRUCTURES IN PLACE AND QUALITY OF AVAILABLE DATA In this chapter, we examine the struct ures and information systems through which oversight is maintained both of the acti vities of individual agencies and of the implementation of the Substance Misuse St rategy as a whole. This may be for purposes of monitoring compliance with cont racts, assessing effectiveness, ensuring accountability, or informing policy change. We begin with an overview of the mechanisms in place for these purposes, together with stakeholders' views about their fitness for purpose. This is followed by an examination of the main sources of data on which judgements about performance or im pact may be based - again presenting stakeholder views. In the fo llowing chapter, we shall use such data ourselves to make the best judgements we can about the effe ctiveness of the impl ementation of the Strategy. Monitoring and accountability at individual and local level Monitoring of the performance of individual providers has until recently been left mainly to local commissioners and their team s, under the auspices of the CSPs. This is undertaken through a combination of standard performance indicators and more qualitative methods (including visits, discu ssions, reports, case studies, and so on) which vary widely between areas in thei r depth and rigour. If a particular agency appears to be seriously underperforming, this may be made known to the Branch - often via the SMART - who may intervene with a visit or advice. The Branch will also scrutinise the performance of agencies that receive SMAF funding through a review of the quarterly reports via the online funding tool. However, generally speaking the Branch is interested in performance at CSP le vel (which it then grosses up to national level), rather than at the le vel of individual providers. Like many aspects of the system, appr oaches to monitoring performance are undergoing a process of change - not least a shift towards out come rather than output focused indicators. What follows refers main ly to practice during the first three years of the implementation of the Strategy. KPIs Central monitoring of CSP performance is la rgely undertaken through measures of the overall performance of agencies in eac h CSP area against nationally set Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Each month, all relevant agencies have to complete formal returns providing information about new referrals and updating records on existing clients. These are translated into entries on to the Welsh National Database for Substance Misuse (WNDSM) and the resulting data are analysed by NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS, formerly Health Solutions Wales) to produce current performance indicators for each CSP area. The Substance Misuse Branch uses a 'traffic lights' system to ident ify which areas seem to be performing satisfactorily and which not. The original KPIs, which predated the 2008 Stra tegy by two years, are listed in Table 7.1. 59 Table 7.1 Key Perf ormance Indicators No. Indicator 1 Increase local service capacity for people who misuse drugs, alcohol and other substances in line with stated pr iorities in local/regional commissioning plans in respect of: open access services structured community based services residential and inpatient care 2 Reduce the number of incidences of unplanned ending of contact with services. 3 Achieve a waiting time of not more than 10 working days bet ween referral and assessment. 4 Achieve a waiting time of not more than 10 working days between assessment and the beginning of treatment. 5 All young people referred from a YOT to receive an appropriate assessment within 5 working days of referral. 6 All young people referred from a YOT to have commenced an agreed care plan no later than 10 working days fr om completion of the assessment. 7 Reduce the number of incidences of reported acquisitive crime (defined as those listed as 'trigger offences' for DToC areas) 8 All clients who are IDUs to be offered information, counselling, screening and where appropriate, immunisation against hepatitis B. While some data are collected on each KPI, in practice the main focus has been on the second, third and fourth in the above list, which are the only ones that can be produced routinely by NWIS fr om the national database (ot hers are produced at longer intervals by the Youth Offending Service, the police, and so on). If a CSP is perceived by the Branch to be underperforming in relation to any of these three measures, the local Substance Misuse Lead Officer (SMLO) may be asked to investigate further and the area may receive visits from the SMART or other Branch staff in order to discuss ways of improving the results. In some cases, too, providers whose individual performance figures have played a part in the poor CSP figures may be visited for similar discussions. As will be discussed further below, many stakeholders had severe doubts about the value of these KPIs as representations of re ality, and complaints about errors in the data were common. More fundamentally, it can be seen that the focus of performance management has for several years been pr imarily on processes around treatment provision, and in particular waiting times for assessment and treatm ent. This reflects the fact that, in the mid-2000s, waiting time s were a topic of considerable concern. However, more recently it has been widel y argued that these KPIs were excessively focussed on process-related targets, wh ich could be misleading in terms of representing the true value and effectiveness of providers' work. These concerns led to a WG review resulting in a decision to introduce a new set of KPIs which, their designers claim, place a much stronger emphasis on outcomes. These can be summarised broadly as follows: 60 Table 7.2 Summary of Revised Key Performance Indicators No. Indicator 1 Engagement of services 2 Achieve a waiting time of less than 20 working days between referral and treatment 3 Reduction in substance misuse 4 Injecting risk 5 Quality of life 6 Successful closures Stakeholder views KPIs were generally viewed by our interv iewees as a necessary consequence of receiving funding for service provision. Most respondents from third sector agencies seemed to accept them and worked hard to m eet them. As hinted above, the main criticisms concerned the appropriateness and relevance of the existing suite of KPIs, and especially their narrow focus and absence of indication of outcomes. Also mentioned were a lack of clear connecti on between the KPIs and the Strategy, and a tendency of some SMLOs to make decisions on the basis of crude indicators rather than qualitative information. While some of these criticisms may bec ome largely redundant when the new KPIs are implemented, it is worth looking at a few illustrative comments: We can't tell actually at the end of the day whether someone goes out into the community and is drug-free. We haven't got that ability to do that. Can we have some more clinically focused, meaningful, intelligent targets rather than, you know, this huge ma chine that is producing huge amounts of information for different people in Welsh government?... I don't think we're being as smart as we could be around that. Again, expressing concern at an ove r-reliance by commissioners on KPIs, an interviewee working in publ ic health remarked: And what a waste of resources, they are brilliant at engaging with people. And it's such a shame, it's such an imbalance. You know, for me, whatever works but on the negative si de of the KPIs, I came across an incidence literally last week w here one needle exchange had been better resourced recently, than the statutory, the more recognised service. So it led to an increase in service users using one service and a decrease in another. So instead of addressing what was wrong with this one, they took away the equipment of this one so that this organisation could meet their KPI. Oh my God. Since w hen were KPIs more important that actually what's happening in the field? On a more positive note, by no means a ll local commissioners used KPIs as their main way of judging performance. Thr ee of those we interviewed expressed 61 considerable doubts about their accuracy, but said that they could be of some value if used intelligently alongside more qualitative data, including conversations with providers, to get a realistic picture of local performance: But what we also have is monitoring fr om service providers into the SMAT as well, each quarter... which is a lot more on the softer outcomes as well, which I think are very beneficial for us to see how effectively the service is being delivered. Which says, this is what's going great, this is what's been a real positive, you know, in the la st quarter. These things haven't gone so great. And there is a lot more kind of meat on the bones I guess, in terms of being able to say, this is what is being delivered. We will set targets and... aside from t he key performance indicators that are given by the Welsh Assembly - and they've changed this year so they're a little bit more outcome fo cused, although we are still measuring waiting times we're not measuring t en days from referral to assessment and ten days from assessment to treat ment, we're now measuring twenty days from referral to treatment commenc e which is a much more realistic way of doing it and it's still the same time. So apart from all of those which are given and they have to r eport on, we also set them some targets locally for the kind of work we want them to do. Maybe with the young people's service we may want X amount of awareness raising sessions to work with the prevention and to pick up the schools and all the other partners. So we have quarterl y updates from each service provider, which are based on the SLA and the tar gets we've set in there, so they will report to us quarterly on those which we have to report quarterly anyway to the Welsh government. We look at any checks and problems, we look at forecast spend, all of t hose kind of things. We're measuring their KPIs, we use traffic light system for that. So if we've got a problem then it's quite easy to do really because of the good working relationship. I can ring them up and say, \"What's the problem? Can we call a meeting, we'll go through it?\" So that kind of thing... This kind of approach was clearly valued by service providers. For example: We actually follow people through to the services. So I'll present a case study this quarter, the next quarter I'll provide an update on that case study and we can then follow people up to the point of discharge. [The local commissioner] is much, much more keen to actually look at what are people getting from the services, it's not always about the numbers. And I think in other areas now, they're mo ving more towards outcome focused measures, as that's the We lsh Government Directive. In fact, several providers undertook fairly sophisticated self-monito ring, using a variety of instruments to measure pr ogress on a variety of fronts as well as service users' ratings and experiences of the support or treatment received. For example: A We've like... service user outcomes. So again you know... not drinking over safe levels, no longer using. So those sort of things. Then, how did you find accessing the service? So again, was the place you were seen in welcoming? How helpful did you find [t he agency] staff? Did we help you achieve your goals? Did the support you receive make a difference? So 62 ultimately, you know, are we getting that front end right?... Did it make a difference? Anything that we could improve? What did we do well? So you've got some very simple... Q What do you do with that then, with all that data? A So we input it into a database and then we have performance management meetings on a quarterly basis where we will analyse... xxx will provide a report on this, and measure what we're doing. Q But would you give that to your commi ssioners? Those kinds of reports? A Yeah we could do. Some of them know that we're doing it; some of them don't, because this is something that we've done ourselves and we started it from 1st April this year. Yes, we will use that as a way in which to think about anything that we could improve... You know you can't be perfect at everything. I think being honest about the areas that we could improve and then evidencing that we've improved, is a much healthier way, you know. Accountability of commissioners While providers are held accountable for their activities and performance through monitoring against KPIs, commissioners are held accountable for their performance through the quarterly reports uploaded via t he online funding tool. However, the extent to which the commissioning process was being monitored was unclear. This point was made forcefully by a small numbe r of our interviewees, especially service providers who felt that t hey had been victims of poor commissioning decisions that had been made in a non-transparent or even biaised way. One respondent called for a 'whistleblowing syst em' to bring cases of poor or biaised decision-making to light. While fairly isolated, such comments raise the general question of whether there should be a formal mechanism for oversight and accountability of commissioners, including a formal complaints system. As we have seen, the Welsh Government Substance Mi suse Branch felt that it was not its responsibility to monitor the processes of commissioning at local level. However, with the introduction of APBs, it may be an opportune time to reconsider this issue. It is not unlikely that concerns about commissioning dec isions and processes will continue, or even increase: APBs will control much la rger amounts of fundi ng, and some local areas may feel that 'their' resources have been diverted elsewhere. The following two comments from managers of vol untary sector agencies indicate that the accountability of APBs is an important issue for that sector: Yeah well maybe... and I think managing the APBs, accounting them to what they do and how they deliver it, and are they looking to the Strategy and if they're not following the St rategy and the Implementati on Plan, why aren't they? Managing their ability to respond, to communica te, to be the thing that they are. I'm a member... now if I'm prepared to take on th at responsibility, then everybody else should be. You know, I w ould take that responsibility seriously. Reminding Area Planning Boards that this is the Strategy and the Implementation Plan that we work to and that they are accountable to that, because there's lots of factors on that area planning board or individuals who 63 have different agendas. I know that they're irrelevant but ultimately we do work to that Strategy. Reminding area planni ng boards would be a really good... you know, bringing back... getting back to basics. Oversight of the sy stem as a whole So far we have discussed mechanisms - such as regular meetings with commissioners and the completion of KPI relat ed statistical returns - for monitoring of the activities and performance of individual pr oviders, as well as of local CSPs. However, it is also important to examine ways in which oversight is (or should be) maintained of the overa ll operation and effectiveness of the system for tackling substance misuse. This of course is a vita l step towards finding ways to improve it. The people with the best vantage point in this respect are the members of the WG Substance Misuse Branch, who not only prepare the Implementation Plans, but maintain regular contact with key stakeholde rs across Wales, receive 'intelligence' from the SMARTs, and control and analyse all t he relevant monitoring data. However, most interviewees agreed that it was import ant for a wider range of stakeholders not only to share this kind of knowledge, but where appropriate to use it to question, challenge and hold to account WG officials in relation to their strategic plans and decisions about implementation, as well as to have some m eaningful input into future policy decisions. While many said that members of the Substance Misuse Branch were exceptionally accessible and recept ive to suggestions made through individual approaches, there was also wid espread criticism of the forma l structures for providing such inputs - in particular, what is ostensib ly the main vehicle for this, the Substance Misuse Strategy Implementation Board. The Implementation Board According to the Welsh Government webs ite (accessed 21/6/12), the aims of the Implementation Board are (1) to oversee, at a national level, the delivery of the Strategy, (2) to ensure that the Strategy is reviewed and refreshed in light of emerging developments or changes in patterns of su bstance misuse, and (3) to ensure that links are established and maintained with relev ant groups. Membership of the Board comprises senior government officials, t he Chair of APoSM, nominated members of CSPs, and other external st akeholders drawn from a range of organisations. We asked all interviewees what they thought was the role of t he Implementation Board and whether it was achieving its objective s. The responses can be divided into comments about: (1) the original aims of the Implementation Board, (2) the work of the Implementation Board in practice and probl ems associated with it, and (3) proposals for reform. The original aim of the Implementation B oard was, as described by one respondent, to defend vigorously the principles of the Strategy; especially the emphasis on partnership approaches, and to make sure that the government was working towards achieving these principles. [T]he Implementation Board was a genuine attempt to say we see this, the delivery of this strategy as a partnersh ip thing, led by Welsh Government, and, actually, we want to, publicly with part ners, make check t hat we're keeping the delivery of it on track. So we had, you know, all areas and key partner organisations, etc., repres ented on there. And it was their opportunity to 64 challenge, actually, not only Welsh Go vernment, but other partner agencies about what was happening. In theory at least, the Im plementation Board had subst antial influence and could overrule decisions at high level; not so mu ch as a result of formal powers, but as a result of its abilities to persuade and encourage senior officials and politicians. [A]t the end of the day, policy decisions need to be taken by ministers. So, but we would have been unlikely to do it without at least seeking their views, or doing something. You know, we're not likely to do something that the Implementation Board were completely ant i, you know? So it was another way of engaging... In practice, it appears that the Implementation B oard did not act like this. The major omission is aptly summarised in the last sentence of the following comment by a Board member: the absence of an effect ive challenge on government action. [W]e'd also present data and information on what we were doing to deliver the strategy, what the indicators were telling us, where we were on, you know, delivering certain things at each meet ing? What didn't come back was the challenge. There were several problems noted by the re spondents in relation to the structure and operation of the Implem entation Board. The first was its size. They're huge meetings. It' s probably the biggest out of all the meetings I go to,,, 25, 30 perhaps round the table. There were also criticisms of the remi t it has created for itself and the agenda followed. The following respondent refers to the Implementation Bo ard as a 'receiving information' board and blames this on the inabi lity of the group to prioritise its agenda. It's not what I would call a working boar d. It's a receiving information board I think... There's a huge agenda, so how do you pick what you're going to discuss? You can't have feedback from it all. And is the purpose of that board to monitor the implementation plan which I guess it is, so how's the best way to do that with such a big plan? Again, I think they should cut it in half and prioritise and deal with the wicked issues first and then work your way through. Another respondent thought that the Implementation Board had 'lost its way'; meaning perhaps that it had moved away too much from its original remit. This reflected a frequently expressed view that it had become little more than a 'talking shop'. For example: Q How do you find it is operating? A Er, it's a talking shop. Q Talking shop. So its remit is to do what? A Well, theoretically to hold the deliver ers of the action plan to account, but it didn't have much teeth or it doesn't have much teeth. 65 There were several proposals for reform. One was to scale back the Implementation Board in terms of size and agend a; with the view of achievin g more explicit outcomes. [H]ow could it be improved? It's just su ch a big group, I guess it needs to be broken down into smaller ... and there are ... a bit ad hoc really, smaller working groups that get set up to look at something. Another was to revert back to the original aims of the Implem entation Board as an effective monitor on the Welsh Government to ensure that it was implementing the Strategy. Q So what would happen in an ideal board meeting then of the Implementation Board? A Well, I think ... we'd have to look at sort of compliance with the plan. I don't know how. This view was reflected in the comments from a senior government officer who felt that the main duty of the board was to challenge the Welsh Government. It was my responsibility to oversee the implementation, and as part of discharging that respons ibility, the Implementat ion Board was there to challenge me, actually. Overall, the common view held by our re spondents on the Implementation Board was that it was ineffective and had moved away from its original purpose. However, coupled with this, was the view that the B oard could potentially play an important role in the management process, and hence that t he way forward lay in the direction of reforming rather than abolishing it. Change management Clearly, while the adoption of a ten-year St rategy has the major advantage of stability, giving all stakeholders a clear and consistent 's teer' as to the main direction of travel over a long period of time, it is also the case that ideas and knowledge change, and that particular kinds of substance misu se problems decline in scale while others increase and new ones appear. For this r eason, there needs to be scope for changing priorities and approaches to implementatio n within the overall framework of the Strategy, in some cases to a significant degr ee. In this section we comment briefly and present stakeholder views on the mechanisms for achieving this, including issues such as the use of new knowledge and the degree of consultation involved. We have already in Chapter 3 referred to the production by the Substance Misuse Branch of (usually three-yearly) Implementation Plans as well as internal annual Branch Plans, noting the surprisingly lim ited amount of know ledge about, let alone involvement in the preparat ion of these among most inte rviewees outside the Welsh Government. These plans can shift the balance of resources considerably, as well as opening up new areas of policy and practice. An obvious forum for the discussion of such changes is the Implementation Board, but as we have seen, most felt that this was an ineffective mechanism for influencing policy. This suggests that too much control over change may be vested in the Br anch alone. However, two other boards merit brief attention in this context: APo SM and the relatively recently created Substance Misuse Review Board. 66 APoSM As discussed earlier, the primary role of APoSM is to advise the Minister on the current state of knowledge and evidence a bout substance misuse issues, and its contribution was particularly important w hen the 2008 Strategy was being written. However, its formal duties also include over seeing the implementati on of the Strategy and advising on its development. It is therefore potentially ve ry influential, throughout the lifetime of a ten-year St rategy, in driving changes in emphasis or decisions to incorporate new elements into the Implementation Plans. For example: It's a bit of a two-way thing, APOSM, you know, you'd put issues to them. But also they should be just generally saying is this strategy still relevant for the challenges for today? Are t here emerging trends and iss ues that it doesn't pick up on, you know, new drugs, for example, and that sort of thing? Um, so it's, you know, it's there as, as an advisory body to be used and for them to, you know, and for them to advise as they th ink appropriate. You know, they have, to some extent, define their own role. The example below raises the issue of the links between APoSM and the Implementation Board. While - in theory, at least - both have responsibilities for overseeing the implementati on of the Strategy, the mechanisms by which information is fed from one body to another was unclear. I have always questioned the role of APoSM...alongside the Strategy Implementation Board... Because the one doesn't feed into the other, you know, neither feeds... into the other, t hey sit parallel and I've always said, \"Well, why, you've got a group of people over here, a very high level strategic group in APoSM who are looking at differ ent areas of work around alcohol, around, you know, psychoactive drugs, which are ... all areas of work that are part of the strategy and yet the Strategy Implementation Board ... didn't task them. These were there to support... the Minister. But surely the strategy is the Minister's strategy... The Substance Misuse Review Board In 2011, the Minister decided to ask for a fairly fundamental review of several aspects of the implementation of Substance Misuse St rategy in Wales. In order to manage the review and see through any changes decided upon, the Welsh Government set up a Substance Misuse Review Board with a brief to undertake: A funding formula review; A review of APBs; An evaluation of the implem entation of the Strategy; A cost benefit analysis; An organisational development work stream The membership consisted of senior WG officials, together with some experienced external stakeholders. The review wa s not widely publicised, and many of our interviewees had only vague ideas of the pr ocess or the Board's remit, although most were aware that the KPIs would be changing. The remit was described to us by a WG officer as follows: 67 Well, there was a terms of reference set up for it, but it was, in a way, a bit of a stock-take on where they are and, and looking forward at what's... I think the minister wanted to know that the money t hat had been invested, is it delivering something? Is it having a positive impact? What's the evidence to show that? So it's not so much about have we delivered what we said we'd delivered? It's more about we may have delivered it, but is there an impact? Information and evidence No matter which individuals or Boards make decisions about perform ance or potential policy change, the quality of their decisions will depend heavily on the amount and quality of information they have to inform them . We now consider the main sources of data and evidence available for assessing the implementation and overall impact of substance misuse policies in Wales. At lo cal level, these include a wide variety of information and recording systems, as well as small-scale evaluations, all of which may be extremely valuable in guiding and assessing local practice, but are rarely used as part of broader assessments of the implem entation of the Strategy across Wales. At national level (on which we shall focu s here), the most im portant sources of information are the Welsh National Database for Substance Misuse (WNDSM), which includes the Treatment Ou tcome Profile (TOP), and a variety of research and evaluation reports. In additi on, as noted earlier, SMARTs produce a fair degree of qualitative 'intelligence' for the Branch through thei r visits to CSPs and local providers. The Welsh National Database for Substance Misuse (WNDSM) As already mentioned, the WNDSM is t he main source of information for the measurement of providers' and local areas' progress agains t the national Key Performance Indicators. It is also a sour ce of data for other st atistics about substance misuse related activities in Wales, so me of which are published by the Welsh Government in annual reports. We shall consider what can be learned from such data in Chapter 8. Here we simply describe how it is compiled and some of the problems associated with it, with a view to making a broad assessment of its value and fitness for purpose. All substance misuse treatment service pr oviders in Wales in receipt of Welsh Government funding via the CSPs, are mandated to comply with the reporting requirements of the WNDSM. These requi rements are descri bed in the annually revised report: 'The Welsh National Database for Substance Misuse: Guidance for Community Safety Partnerships and Service Provider Agencies'. The guidance states that it is a mandator y requirement that a record mu st be opened and entered onto the Welsh National Database for Substance Misuse for all individuals referred for treatment in Wales. This includes struct ured treatment (such as: detoxification, residential rehabilitation, substitute prescr ibing and related psychosocial interventions) and less structured treatment (such as: prac tical and social support, complementary and alternative therapies, brief interventions, and harm reduction). The operation of WNDSM is overseen by the WG Management Information Board while the database itself is managed by NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS, formerly Health Solutions Wales). Agencie s are required to submit data monthly to NWIS and compliance with the reporting pr ocedures is mandatory for ensuring the continued receipt of Welsh Government fundi ng. The data submitted to the national database include all new referrals receiv ed during the relevant month, plus amendments to records relati ng to previous submissions. Figure 7.1 summarises all 68 data collected on the database at July 2011. T he first part of the database includes information on contact details and referral information and the type of treatment received. The 'personal details' sect ion goes further by covering anonymised individual and demographic data while the 'current problems' section provides information on current and past substance mi suse. The remainder of the database contains information collected using the TOP (see next section). The content of the WNDSM might therefore be defined as comp rising three parts: the first covers personal and demographic information, the second covers outputs, and the third summarises outcomes. Since July 2011, the database has included a NHS number as a unique client identifier. According to the guidance doc ument, this allows better local record management and for clients potentially to be tracked across agencies and over time. Treatment Outcome Profile (TOP) The Treatment Outcomes Profile (TOP) is part of the WNDSM, but is sufficiently different to warrant its consi deration as a separate topic. It s primary aim is to measure treatment outcomes by comparing clients' responses to questions about progress over the period of treatment. This focus on outcomes means that the TOP will play an important part in the production of figures for the new suite of KPIs, discussed earlier in the chapter. The TOP was developed by the National Treatment Agency (NTA) in collaboration with National Addiction Centre. In April 2009, the Welsh Government adopted TOP and mandated its use for all clients aged 16 and ov er who were in receipt of structured treatment. The data are provi ded by the agencies delivering the structured treatment. The initial implementation of TOP was overseen by a National Working Group with members from the Welsh Government, C SPs, treatment services and NWIS. Monitoring of the TOP has since been transferred to the National Management Information Board. The TOP data are entered initia lly into a questionnaire which covers recent substance misuse, methods of administration, cr iminal behaviour, employment, education, housing, health and quality of life; the last three being coded on a 20 point scale from poor to good. An individual is first asse ssed at the beginning of treatment. The data entered at this point includes the client's status in terms of four main risk factors. The assessment is then repeated every three mo nths and at completion of treatment. 69 Figure 7.1 List of all data collection on the WNDSM (2011) 70 Figure 7.2 Treatment Outcome Profile Stakeholder comments Interviewees gave numerous examples of problems with the data collection and monitoring systems. Several referred to its complexity and the frequent risk of errors, either on the part of those enter ing the data, or by those processing it centrally. It was also said that some providers failed to ent er all cases, which compromised the overall accuracy of the figures. The following is a se lection of fairly ty pical comments, from providers and a commissioner: ... we have this over-complicated system that's not providing the correct data. So every time we go to the APB we look at the KPIs and ... the informatics guy for the commissioner s goes, \"I'm still working with [Agency] because their data's still not right,\" and fair play the APB go, \"Okay, you know, but we need them to be right next time .\" And we go back next time; they're still not right. It's been a headache for us [in Health], so I can imagine what it's been like, you know, for other agencies who hav en't got that infrastructure to start with. So people are again entering different things because they don't quite understand what it is they 're supposed to be entering. I think that's ironed 71 itself out a little bit, but you still get this issue with the new KPIs coming in, to be absolutely clear on what their defin itions are. You know, this, this ten day, it'll be ten days now from re ferral to treatment - what does treatment mean? ... you've got to be abs olutely clear. So ... if people are going to put what it, what it is they th ink it is in and then you're going to get, again this meaningless, meaningless data. But I think the TOPs is a disappointment because, you know, we were really encouraged that this was going to be a validated outcome t ool. ... This was going to show people progressing or not progressing in treatment and yet we don't get those, we don't get that back. ... So why are they collecting it? Most of the community now is doing what they should be doing. One of the agencies wasn't and they had a bit of a shock because I read the riot act essentially to them and said, \"Look, I don't want you spoiling it for the rest of us by not, you know, inputting the data. You' re going to paint a very bad picture of what you do and I know that you do an exce llent job, so why not prove it. We mentioned earlier in the r eport that providers tend to use their own software for data entry and maintain separat e local data files covering many more items than are submitted to the WNDSM. Data extracts are taken from these local systems and are submitted to NWIS for inclusion on the database. If errors are foun d, then reports are returned to the providers by NWIS. As noted earlier, some providers described how they had received reports from NWIS that di d not reflect the data extracts that had been submitted. This may in part be relat ed to the format in which the data were submitted. The person responsible for WNDSM is required to monitor all data submissions. This often means having to understand all the vari ous software systems that are used for entering and submitting it. Local data managemen t systems are often fundamentally different in design from the national system. Despite the problems this presents for the national database, provider s tend to rely on their local systems for day-to-day management purposes. In part, this is a product of t he fact that local systems are client based (as mentioned earlier), which is an essential feature for case management. At the moment, data management in relation to substance misuse in Wales is essentially a two-tier system. At one level there are the comprehensive local level data systems used for case management, from which extracts are submitted to NWIS. At the other level there is the national level system where extr acts submitted by treatment providers across Wales are combined. It should be noted that there has been a concern by the WG that the accuracy of lo cal level data is unknown. One solution that has been attempted in Swansea is to upgrade local level systems to enable simple data extraction for the referral-based nati onal system, while at the same time maintaining the more complex client-based features for the local system. However, the usefulness of this system is still under consideration. In summary, there are concerns over the quality of data in the WNDSM (including the TOP). Potential biases, inaccuracies and missing data are key problems that reportedly hinder its ability to monitor performance accurately. Research and evaluation Finally, an important way of assessing performance and effectiveness is through research and evaluation. We were surprised to find that no central, authoritative list of commissioned research is held by the WG. It was therefore necessary for us to 72 develop our own list based largely on searches of the WG website (for published research reports and information about commi ssioned projects) and by contacting key stakeholders (including staff at the WG and Public Health Wales). Our investigations revealed that the WG have co mmissioned at least 18 research projects (see Appendix 6 Table A6.1). The projects are varied in nature and include evaluations of particular programmes as well as investigations into pa rticular issues relevant to the Substance Misuse Strategy. In this section we make some brief preliminary comments about the coverage and quality of this research and its usefulness (both actual and potential) as an aid to general oversight of the system. W hat, if anything, it can tell us about the effectiveness of the system will be discussed in the next chapter. While the list of projects may not be exhaustive, it is evident that the WG has commissioned a great deal of research on issues relevant to the Stra tegy. What is not so evident is the extent to which re search and evaluation is undertaken and commissioned in a planned, systematic and coordinated manner, nor that research findings are carefully considered and acted upon. One interviewee made this point in relation to the monitoring of the Implementation Plan: So going back to the Implementation Pl an, if you have a ten-year strategy, brilliant, you have a clear way to move forward for ten years. But if you have an Implementation Plan that is not got monitoring and evaluation built into it, you're already set up to fail because there's no accountability, you end up funding stupid projects that ar e very costly for actually what? What is the health gain? Describe the health gain. Describe how you're going to measure it. And describe w hat you're going to do if it isn't working. And I think that is where the implementation, in parts, has failed to deliver. The same point can be applied more widely. The system by which substance misuse research is commissioned and managed at Branch le vel in the WG seems to be fairly ad hoc , and knowledge and oversight of the w hole portfolio of substance misuse research appears to be missing at the curr ent time. It can be argued that APoSM should play a more active role in overs eeing research, and should develop closer links with Welsh Government researchers. Conclusion Few interviewees expressed confidence in the accuracy and value of the KPIs used to monitor performance at local and individual provider level, and most welcomed the imminent shift to more outcome-focused measures. Most providers and commissioners also agreed that the fairest and most productive means of monitoring and understanding how well an agency was carry ing out its tasks was to consider formal performance indicators alongside more qualitative data, such as case studies, service user feedback, and discussions at monitoring meetings. A small number of service pr oviders pointed out that, wher eas their work was closely scrutinised, that of commissioners was not, and that there should be at minimum some kind of complaints mechanism or 'whistle-bl owing' procedure for providers who felt that poor procedures or decision-making was occurring. Deficiencies were also ident ified in terms of oversight of the implementation of the Strategy as a whole. It was felt that the Implementation Board was potentially the key body to perform the role of reflecting peri odically on how well im plementation of the 73 Strategy was going, and to challenge gover nment officers when problems were apparent. However, the Board was widely described as too big and unwieldy, losing focus, prone to becoming bogged down in detail, and in essence little more than a 'talking shop'. The need for a broader - but equally important - oversight role was also identified by several interviewees. Especially at a time when new responses to substance misuse were being advocated in some quarters - such as the 'recovery' agenda being pursued by the UK government - it was seen as important for some serious strategic thinking to be undertaken about the general 'direction of travel' to advise and guide the Welsh Government about any changes that might be considered. The key body mentioned in this context was APoSM which, it was pointed out, having played a prominent part in the development of the Strategy, appeared to have had relatively little influence thereafter. The last part of the chapter briefly descri bed and examined the kinds of data available at the time of writing, with which to assess the effect iveness of the implementation of the Strategy. It was fo und that the two main databases, WNDSM and TOP, suffered with major problems of inaccuracy and mi ssing data, and that - although TOP was potentially valuable in measur ing a range of short- term outcomes of tr eatment - neither allowed longitudinal monitoring of the progre ss of service users. Where research and evaluation are concerned, a number of relevant studies were found, but they were not collected all in one place and there appeared to be no systematic research plan (apart from to evaluate all centrally funded projects). In terms of knowing how effective, for example, particular kinds of psychosocial interventions have been across the country, it may be some small local evaluations have been carried out, but these are neither easily accessible nor likely to be conclusive or of high quality. There is a case for a more systematic research plan to be built into the Implementation Plan, which might include evaluations of this kind carried out across a number of selected areas. 74 CHAPTER 8: WHAT CAN BE CONCLUDED ABOUT EFFECTIVENESS? In this chapter we tackle what is probably t he most difficult question in the report: what do the available data and evidence tell us about the overall effectiveness of the implementation of the Substance Misuse Stra tegy? This question of course can apply both to process (or 'output') effectiveness and to the achievement of outcomes, and in each case can be answered through considerati on of a variety of more specific sub- questions. For example on the one hand, has t he implementation of the Strategy led to a reduction in waiting times, or to more members of 'hard to reach' groups coming forward for treatment? And on the other, has it led to si gnificant numbers of people who had substance misuse problems leading mo re productive lives, or to a reduction in drug or alcohol related crime? It was not part of our remit to conduct any or iginal research aimed at answering such questions, and we can therefore draw only upon previous studies and evaluations, published information from the national database, and information and opinions emerging from our interviews with stakeholde rs. Moreover, as already discussed in Chapter 7, the available s ources of data have serious weaknesses and gaps. We are thus unable to do any more here than to draw very tentative and limited conclusions and to emphasise the need for a serious re think about the overall arrangements for the collection and analysis of data about, as well as the broader assessment and evaluation of, responses to subst ance misuse in Wales. What does the WNDSM tell us? We begin with a consideration of the kinds of answers that can be gleaned through analysis of the national dat abase (WNDSM). We did not undertake any such analysis ourselves, so are restricted to data and findi ngs published in annual reports and other government documents. We al so consider the potential of the database - especially TOP - for producing more informative and re liable measures of effectiveness. WNDSM findings The main outlet for data from WNDSM is the annual report, Substance Misuse in Wales , published by the Welsh Government6. The most recent report (at the time of writing) was published in October 2011. It presents findings from the WNDSM as well as from a range of other sources includi ng TOP, Patient Episode Statistics and the Drug Intervention Programme (DIP). The first part of the report focuses on the WNDSM and presents findings for the twelve month period ending 7th July 2011. It comprises a short introductory section that includes a brief executive summary and an overview of data quality issues, followed by nearly 50 pages of tables and charts. The second part of the report focuses on evidence from other sources and comprises roughly 30 pages of tables, which, unlike part one, includes some useful descriptive, explanatory text. The report ends with a seri es of annexes including a more detailed section on data quality that highlights various problems with the data (e.g. inaccuracies, missing information and double count ing). In light of these problems the report advises readers to exercise some caution when reviewing the data. 6 Each year, 'Substance Misuse in Wales' is published at the same time as the Minister's Substance Misuse Annual Report. While the former presents data from the WNDSM, the latter provides a narrative account of progress made towards implementing the strategy. The two documents are not clearly linked on the website or within the reports themselves. 75 The first set of tables show numbers of referrals into trea tment, including variations by referral source; substance type; location; and sex, age and ethnic group of clients. The figures indicate that 28,720 referrals , in respect of 19,610 individuals, were received in 2010-11. Just over half (53% ) of these involved clients whose main problem was with alcohol and 40% were in re spect of clients whose main problem was with drugs. Among the latter group, heroin a ccounted for nearly half of all referrals (47%) followed by cannabis (21%) and amphetami nes (7%). The majority of referrals were in respect of males (68%) and most re ferrals were classifi ed as self-referrals (34% for alcohol and 26% for drugs). Patt erns varied somewhat across the country: for example, the proportion of referrals for alcohol problems was highest in North Wales. The report also presents figures showing va riations in referrals over time. The statistics show that the number of referrals received in 2010-11 (28,720) had increased over the previous year (by nearly 2%) but had actually decreased by five per cent since 2007-08. Similarly, t he number of assessments made in 2010-11 (21,627) had increased in the last year (b y nearly 2%) but had decreased by six per cent since 2007-08. By contrast, the number of treatments commenced and the number of cases closed appear to have decreas ed steadily since 2007-08. In terms of changes in the profile of clients starting tr eatment, the figures s how that the median age of new entrants rose over the four year period for both alcohol (from 37 to 40) and for heroin (from 29 to 32), but remained fairly constant for cannabis (20), amphetamines (32), cocaine (26), and crack (29). No comment is made in the report about possible reasons for any of these changes. Data from the WNDSM also indicate that waiting times between referral and assessment for both alcohol and drugs both decreased over the four-year period. The latest figures indicate that 63% of referrals made in 2010-11 for alcohol and 73% of referrals for drugs were assessed within le ss than 10 working days. These compare with 54% and 56%, respectively, in 2007-8. Waiting times between assessment and treatment also decreased over time for both alcohol and drugs. In 2010-11 the majority of clients (90%) re ferred for either alcohol or drug problems were treated within less than 10 working days of being assessed compared with 82% in 2007-08. Nevertheless, a significant minority of client s were still waiting for quite lengthy periods to be assessed or to receive treatment. 7 In addition to information about waiting ti mes, the annual reports provide some information relating to another issue about which concern was expressed in the Strategy, that of drop-out rates from treatment. The 2010-11 report showed that the number of those who 'did not attend or re spond to follow up contact during treatment' had fallen substantially since 2007-8, from 7,116 to 3,422. Other unplanned closures (covering cases where treatment had been withdrawn, clients had moved, been sent to prison, or had died) had also decreased. 7 The report also provides figures on the length of time which all open cases (including those opened in previous years) had been waiting for assessment or treatment at 31 March 2011, and at comparable dates in the previous three years. These show that the total number of referred clients still waiting for assessment had increased by 56% fr om 3,369 in 2008 to 5,239 in 2011, and the number of assessed clients still waiting for trea tment had increased by 60% over the sa me period (from 1,768 to 2,294). However, these figures in themselves do not necessarily signal any deterioration in services: as the report explains, the increases 'may be a reflection of the failure of some agencies to record the details of case closures' (p. 5). 76 The annual report states (p.3) t hat the WNDSM \"is the official source of validated data for treatment service providers and Communi ty Safety Partnerships to monitor and report performance against the nat ional Key Performance Indica tors (KPIs 2-6)\". In theory, then, the annual reports provide a useful opportunity to publicise what progress has been made towards achieving the KPIs. However, t he published figures address only three of them (see Table 8.1 ) and even these figures are presented without any direct reference to KPIs. T he omission of any link between the data and the KPIs makes it difficult fo r the reader to judge performanc e to date. This might be seen as a missed opportunity. In short, relatively little can be gl eaned from the published WNDSM data about the effectiveness of substance misuse rela ted interventions. The one clear (and encouraging) message it gives is that wa iting times for assessment and treatment have reduced since 2008.

No measure n/a Note: Based on data published in Substance Misuse in Wales 2010-11. TOP Findings Findings from the TOP were published for the first time in 2011 in the annual report 'Substance Misuse in Wales 2010-11 '. The report states clearly from the outset that caution must be exercised in interpreting the results from this 'new dataset'. Of note is the reference to 'likely biases' within it. T he results presented in the report relate to data collected since April 2009 when the tool wa s first adopted in Wales. Hence, the figures cover a two-year period (April 2009 to July 2011). The section of the report devoted to the TOP is fairly brief and limited to seven tables and one chart. The issues covered include changes, from start of treatment to exit fr om treatment, in the use of substances, client well-being, psychological health, physical health, and quality of life. As with the other WNDSM data, the only descripti ve text presented is in bullet point form in the Executive Summary 8. The figures show that more than 17,000 start-TOPs were collected over the two-year period. Of these, 6,387 (38% ) completed first reviews, 3,117 (18%) completed second reviews, 1,700 (10%) completed third review s and 1,007 (6%) completed four reviews. Over the study period, 12,228 cases were cl osed and in just over half of these cases (53%, n=6424) exit-TOPs were completed. It should be noted that figures relating to closures are not presented clearly in the r eport. The reader is required to study a chart with extremely small font to calc ulate the total number of cases closed and hence the proportion of all closures wher e exit TOPs were completed or not completed. The fact that ex it-TOPs are missing in 47% of cases is not discussed in the report. However, other potential biases are recognised including the fact that cases remain open when in reality they should be closed and that some cases are closed without an exit-TOP being completed when clients have been transferred to another agency. The potential biases that these prob lems create are of concern and bring into question the value of the data in measuring the progress of clients. Changes in the frequency of substance us e are measured using only those cases where start and exit-TOPs were completed. Given that exit-TOPs were completed in 6,424 cases it is unclear why the total number of TOPs used in this analysis is 5,165 (assuming that the 417 main substance 'heroin' users are included in the main substance 'drugs' group and should not be double counted). The figures show that between start and exit-TOP, the average frequency of use in the last 28 days decreased for both alcohol and drugs. Am ong clients whose main problem was alcohol, use of alcohol decreased by 41% . Among clients whose main problem was drugs, use of opiates decreased by 45% and use of cannabis and amphetamines decreased by 34%. The biggest changes in frequency of use were found to occur during the first three months of treatment . Clients whose main substanc e was alcohol reported a 34% 8 Each year, 'Substance Misuse in Wales' is published at the same time as the Minister's Substance Misuse Annual Report. While the former presents data from the WNDSM, the latter provides a narrative account of progress made towards implementing the strategy. The two documents are not clearly linked on the website nor within the reports themselves. 78 decrease in alcohol use in the first thr ee months and a further 17% decrease in the second three months. Similarly, clients whose main substance was drugs reported a 47% decrease in the frequency of opiate use in the first three months, followed by a decrease of 29% in the second three months and a further 19% decrease in the third period. Client well-being wa s found to improve from star t to exit-TOP with physical health improving by 17%, psychological health by 30% and quality of life by 24%. The figures are usefully broken down to enabl e the reader to see variations by drug type, key demographics as well as type of treatm ent. The biggest changes in physical health were among alcohol users, women, clients aged 50+ and those in residential rehabilitation. The same pattern of findings was also true for psychological health and quality of life. Overall, the TOP data indicate that clients generally experience improvements following treatment. However, the problems with the data make it difficult to draw any firm conclusions. It may be that the 47% of clients for whom exit-TOPs were not included had very different outcomes to those who comple ted exit-TOPs. In other words, the findings reported ma y not accurately reflect the outcomes for all clients. Treatment service provider s who are tasked with completing these forms would appear to need some encouragement (or perhaps a ssistance) to ensure that they are completed fully in all appropriate cases. The plan to launch new KPIs that are more outcome focused and can be monitored by the TOP may be a useful means of achieving higher completion rates. Other substance misuse-related data In Substance Misuse in Wales 2011-12: Profile of Substance Misuse Related Education, Health and Crim inal Justice Statistics ( formerly Part II of Substance Misuse in Wales 2010-11) other 'routinely collected' data ar e presented. This includes data from the Patient Episode Database Wales ( PEDW), the Office fo r National Statistics (ONS), Education, DIP and the Home Office . Data from the new Harm Reduction Database (HRD), a national web-based data collection system for recording all needle and syringe activity, are also included in th e 2011-12 report. It should be noted that the HRD 'went live' in Sept ember 2010 and as a result no trend data have yet been reported. In this section we summarise briefly the key outcomes emerging from these various sources. Generally speaking, the picture is mixed. On some indicators, general improvements were recorded. For example, the number of exclusions from schools 'resulting from substance misuse' decreased from 454 in 08/ 09 to 387 in 10/11 (a decrease of 15%) - although this masks a more recent 2 per c ent increase between 09/10 and 10/11. The number of alcohol-related deaths also decreased over time. In fa ct, the figures for 2011 represent the lowest number of annual deaths since 2006. However, the alcohol related death rate in Wales remained higher than in England, with the rate for females in Wales significantly higher than for females in England9. On other measures, improvem ents are relatively recent and follow a period of some deterioration. For example, drug-relat ed deaths increased stead ily between 2008 and 2010 but decreased (by 10%) in 2011 to 137. Sim ilarly, hospital admissions for mental and behavioural disorders due to opioids increased from 2007 to 2010 but decreased by 10 per cent in 2011 (to 1215 cases). Howe ver, the picture varies by drug type as 9(http://www.ons.gov.uk/ ons/rel/subnational-health4/alcohol-relate d-deaths-in-the-united- kingdom/2011/alcohol-related-de aths-in-the-uk--2011.html) 79 admissions for disorders due to cocaine increased by 12 per cent between 2010 and 2011 while admissions due to multiple dr ug use increased by nearly one-fifth. Criminal justice data provide an equally mixed picture. In 2011-12, a total of 13,655 drug offences were reported by police forces across Wales (an increase of just over 1%). By contrast, seizures of contro lled drugs in Wales were reported to have decreased by 1 per cent between 08/09 and 09/10. The meaning of these increases and decreases is not easy to interpret. An increase in drug offences may reflect improved policing or it may reflect an increase in offending. Similarly, a decrease in seizures may refl ect a drop in availability or perhaps less effective policing. The same could also be said for hospital admissions. Does an increase in the number of admissions indicate that there are more problems or that the problems are being dealt with more effectively? It was noted above that few data from the Harm Reduction Database have been presented in the substance misuse annual re ports. What has been reported is that the proportion of new HIV infe ctions linked to injecting drug use increased between 2010 and 2011 from 0.6 per cent to 1.9 per cent. Figures from the HRD relating to other blood borne viruses are not presented in the reports. Howe ver, data from the Unlinked Anonymous Monitoring Survey of people who inject drugs in the UK show that the total number of repor ts of Hepatitis C infections in Wales decreased between 2008 and 2010 (from 473 to 312) but t hen increased to 474 in 2011. Finally, mention should be made of the recent Healthcare Inspec torate Wales report (2012), Substance Misuse Services in Wales: Are They Meeting the Needs of Service Users and their Families? This provides a rare insight into the perspective of service users, based on a survey of their views and ex periences. One of the aspirations of the Strategy was to reduce the level of stig ma attached to people with substance misuse problems, but the report suggests that it s implementation has not yet led to any discernible improvement in this regard. The report also pr ovides some support to the conclusion from our stakeholder intervie ws (chapter 6 above), that - despite improvements in terms of, for example, growth in 'single point of contact' arrangements and the development of common referral and assessment instruments - from the service user's point of view t he system often does not appear 'joined up' or 'holistic', and there is a considerable degree of duplication and fragmentation of services. The report also speaks (p.22) of a 'postcode lottery' in terms of the availability and quality of se rvices, with much on dependi ng 'where and when you turn up' and interventions often being too short-term, while aftercare services, in particular, are described as 'patchy'. Overall, the Inspectorate's conclusions echo those of many of the stakeholders we interviewed: namely, that, while there is much in the implementation of the Strategy to be pleased about, responses to substance misuse in Wales cannot yet be described as a 'w hole system', and need further strategic development. Research and evaluation Another way in which perform ance is monitored by the WG is through research and evaluation. As noted in the last chapter, our investigations revealed that the WG have commissioned at least 18 research projec ts (for a full list and summaries see Appendix 6). In this secti on we look at what can be c oncluded from these studies about the effectiveness of what has been implemented. 80 Our review of the research identified 13 evaluations of specific programmes or interventions. At the time of writing, f our of the evaluations were on-going and only limited information was available about them. Nine evaluations, however, had been completed and final reports were in the public domain (see Appendix 6 Table A6.2 for methodological details). We were therefore able to review these reports to identify any findings concerning the effectiveness of the different interventions (see Table 8.2 below). Table 8.2 Summary of resu lts of known evaluations, 2008-2011 No. Title Type of evaluation* Summary of results 1. Evaluation of the Take Home Naloxone Demonstration Project National THN was found to improve knowledge, willingness and confidence to save lives among trainees. However, no difference between experimental and comparison areas in terms of numbers of lives saved. 2. Evaluation of the All Wales School Liaison Core Programme (AWSLCP) National Qualitative data indicate that the lessons had a positive impact on pupils. 3. Evaluation of the Transitional Support Scheme (TSS) National Qualitative data on 'distance travelled' indicate that many TSS participants had made progress. However, no difference was found between experimental and comparison groups in terms of reconviction rates. 4. Evaluation of Early Parental Intervention Pilot Projects National Qualitative data indicate that four of the five projects helped alleviate the problems caused by substance misuse within the families they worked with. No 'robust' quantitative data were collected. 5. Evaluation of the include Programme Regional A positive increase in behaviour scores were reported across all measured behaviours. 6. Evaluation of the Prescribed Medication Support Service in Conwy Local The reduction in benzodiazepine prescribing was found to be three-times greater in the experimental practices than among control practices. Clients also reduced their medication and some stopped using altogether. 7. Evaluation of Option 2 Regional The programme did not reduce the number of children entering care but it did reduce the length of time that children spent in care. Money was also saved. 8. Evaluation of the CRAFT pilot project Regional A range of positive effects on the psychological health and well-being of the concerned significant other were identified. Also, the majority of 'loved ones' were reported to have a reduction in their substance misuse. 9. Evaluation of the PARIS system Local Substantial improvements in service provision (e.g. an increase in the number of interactions with agencies) were reported post the introduction of PARIS. 10. Evaluation of the Strengthening Families programme Local On-going 11. Evaluation of the ESF Peer Mentoring National On-going 81 No. Title Type of Summary of results evaluation* Project 12. A pilot study of alcohol policy and social norms in Welsh Universities Local On-going 13. Evaluation of alcohol brief interventions Regional On-going Notes: National evaluations cover the whole of Wales. Regional evaluations cover two or more cities. Local evaluations cover just one city in Wales. While the programmes varied considerably in terms of their aims and target populations, they were all found to have some kind of positive effect on the target group. For example, the Take Home Naloxone programme helped opiate users to improve their knowledge of overdose sit uations and gave them the confidence to administer naloxone and perform ot her life-saving actions. Sim ilarly, the Early Parental Intervention Pilot programme helped to alle viate the problems caused by substance misuse within the families t hat it worked with. It must be emphasised that, as pointed out in Chapter 7, most of the studies have quite serious methodological weaknesses or are based on limited or unreliable data. Nevertheless, the research provides sufficient evidence to conclude that some of the interventions impl emented as part of the Substance Misuse Strategy have had beneficial effects. Stakeholder comments Most interviewees recognised the importance of monitoring, research and evaluation, and some examples were given of locally commissioned evaluations. For example, two interviewees described how DIP commiss ioners had terminated an alcohol arrest referral scheme on the basis of a relati vely 'quick and dirty' evaluation: The alcohol arrest referral evaluation that we did basically said, \"It's not working.\" So we've dumped it and we don't have alcohol workers in custody anymore, which I think is a ma ssive shame. And I think for me, personally, I don't think they did it fo r long enough, it was only a six month trial and I think certainly from an oper ational perspective, alcohol is the stuff that causes t he problems, not drugs. The study proved inconclusive really, it was recognised that there was some benefit in that service, but that from a cost analysis point of view it was difficult to directly attribute intervention to the change in behaviour. And it wasn't a longitudinal study, so it was over a quite short period of time. So it pretty much told us what I expected it to tell us anyway and on that basis funding then didn't continue into this financial year. The same area was also planning an evaluation of the impact of other DIP interventions on long-term drug abuse and r eoffending rates. Another example referred to was: Well, we did an evaluation exercise in, it might be 2009, where we brought in some people from UWIC and did some evaluation about all the treatment provision within the city, and all the sens e of what are they providing, whether it's fit for purpose and meets the needs. Bu t that was something that we'd done specifically ourselves. I don't k now if that's been done elsewhere. 82 As noted in the previous chapter, some pr oviders collect and analyse their own data to evaluate their own performance and impact, in some cases using the results to supplement KPIs when presenting data to local commissioners. One provider told us of the following results from an exercise aim ed at measuring impact over a longer term than usual: Each individual will have a unique per sonal identifier within the system so if they re-present they'll be flagge d up as somebody who's been in before obviously, so .... And what we expect ed when we started it all off was it would be the same people endlessly coming round and round in a carousel, but that hasn't been true. I mean what's been surprising is that probably 10% of the caseload of t hose who keep coming back through the door, you know, are the problematic chaotic individuals. The other 90 to 80% of people who've come through the door over the last seven or eight years have presented once or twice ... t wice at the most, but mostly once. This kind of information is clearly very val uable, and if the main findings were repeated over a variety of areas and interventions, w ould provide precisely the kind of evidence that is needed to demonstrate the long-term e ffectiveness of the im plementation of the Welsh Substance Misuse Strategy. The need for longitudinal research was also agreed by a senior WG official, although he c autioned that the issue of resources is a major barrier: Q We've asked this question to lots of people, and there's lots of shrugs... But one thing quite a few people have said is it would be very nice to have some sort of handle on... not necessa rily everybody goes through any kind of treatment ever, but sampling people who've been in a certain type of treatment and then following them thr ough... to find out what's happened to people, some idea of the results of treatment or interventions. I can't find anything on that really. A You need some kind of - and this ma y be something for the, the longer- term outcome evaluation... - you need so mething like the NTORS study to get a real feel for that, you know? Q Are there any plans for doing anything like that? A I think we haven't made any firm decisi ons about the outcome evaluation. I mean, I don't think we're going to have the funding, or time where we could do something like NTORS. But if we could get a flavour for it, and that's the only real way you're going to get it, is to stay with people, you know, two, three years down the line to see what they're doing now, you know, are they still in substance misu se or have they moved on? Finally, another interviewee with consi derable experience of both practice and research, added the additional ca ution that even if such res earch is funded, it will have to wrestle with some tricky problems in interpreting the results, as 'improved outcomes' do not always mean what they suggest at first sight: Yes, the difficulty, this is one of the difficulties in measur ing, I mean because if services are poor and they seem to be inaccessible people will not come forward for services. You improve se rvices and make them more accessible 83 and people come forward. If you m easure the people that come forward suddenly you think, god the number of people who are substance misusers has increased. Well it's not, it's just that they are thinking that presenting themselves for treatment is now worthwhile... It's similar with children of substance misu sers. If you offer services to families where there's substance misuse in parent s you might actually see that more children end up in the care system because there is a higher level of engagement with those families and a great er awareness of the risks to the children. Conclusion The disappointing conclusion to this chapter is that, although the Welsh Government is clearly committed to using monitoring, evaluation and research to develop and improve its substance misuse services, there is relatively little strong evidence about the effectiveness or not of individual projects , particular types of intervention, or of the implementation of the Strategy as a whole. This is largely because of weaknesses in the design of the various instruments and databases for collecting information, combined with poor compliance among practi tioners in supplying requested data accurately and fully. Furthermore, while a nu mber of internal and external evaluations have been undertaken, these have generally not been planned systematically and have often been dogged by problem s of the availabi lity of appropriate data. They have also often been short in duration and commissioned too late in the day to ensure that appropriate data collecti on systems are develo ped from the start of the projects' operations. Few, too, have been able to construct appropriate comparison groups against which to measure any progress of intervention groups. As a consequence, few studies have been able to determine wit h any certainty whether or not the interventions they have exami ned have been effective. In terms of what can be said with any confidence about the effectiveness of the implementation of the Strategy, the list is ra ther short. It is clear from WNDSM data that waiting times for a ssessment and treatment have r educed. It appears from TOP data that, among those enter ing treatment, there have been at least short-term improvements in alcohol and drug use, physical and psychological health, and quality of life, although large amounts of missing data call these findings into some question. The available published research also contains a few positive findings, especially short-term reductions in substance misuse and progress in relation to social problems, but again caveats must be entered because of weaknesses in data and methodology. The overall conclusion has to be that the whole area of data collection, monitoring and evaluation is one that needs close and systematic attention. Indeed, it could be argued that a planned programme of research and evaluation should be built into the Strategy and its Implementation Plans. 84 CHAPTER 9: SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Summary Part One of the report prov ided a brief historical backg round to the 2008 Substance Misuse Strategy, exploring how it was dev eloped and designed. It was found that it followed clear guiding principles and drew on a wide range of ideas, experience and evidence. The distinctive focuses on harm reduction, a balance between drugs and alcohol, and partnership approaches were in harmony with prev ious approaches in Wales, and had strong support across the country. Analysis of the text of the Strategy, and interviews with people who had been involved in its design, showed that it had been informed by research findings on effective approaches, though in a piecemeal rather than systematic fashion. We also undertook a 'systematic review of systematic reviews', which demonstrated that there was strong international evidence to ju stify the focus on support to substance misusers, and particularly the use of phar maceutical interventions to provide maintenance, as well as psychosocial interventions. There was also some support for the use of schools-based pr eventive interventions, and for the use of brief interventions for alcohol misusers, despite t he fact that recent evaluations in Wales and England had been inconclusive on the effectiveness of both of these. All interviewees knew something about the Strategy and many were quite knowledgeable about it. Most comments about it were positive, with frequent mentions of its broad scope, t he inclusion of alcohol, and its readability and clarity. The main criticisms made concerned lack of su fficient attention to particular issues or client groups, including offenders and non-traditional service users. Some respondents thought that the 10-year time frame was too long to remain fully relevant as circumstances and views changed. Howe ver, others welcomed the longer time frame, not least as a barrier against over- hasty reactions to 'fashionable' ideas or political imperatives. Part Two of the report explored various aspect s of the implementati on of the Strategy. It began by noting the existence of some fundamental tensions that challenge its effective implementation: for example, those between agencies and practitioners that take different views of the appropriate balance of priorities between clinical treatment and psychosocial support; between the ai ms of, on the one hand, implementing reasonably consistent services across Wale s and, on the other, responding effectively to local needs; between the competitive commissioning of services and the need for inter-agency collaboration and continuity of services; and between the desire to 'stick to the Strategy' and pressure to adapt it s implementation to changing expert views, new evidence, new patterns of drug use, or po litical or media concerns. It is noted that such tensions underlie many of the issues discussed in the later chapters. Chapter 5 explored the strengths and weak nesses of the various mechanisms by which available resources are allocated to particular activities. This included the drawing up of broad implementation plans; decis ions about what specific services will be delivered or commissioned; and decisions about which providers will deliver them. Stakeholder views were presented on how fairly and effectively these functions were performed through the various structures, proc esses and decision-makers in place for the first three years of the Strategy, as well as their opinions on the likely impact of the advent of Area Planning Boards. It was c oncluded that, while the Substance Misuse 85 Branch had a fair degree of influence ov er the broad shape of the services commissioned in local areas, there was still considerable space for local decisions about the precise nature of the interventions to be commissioned and which agencies would deliver them. Until rec ently, indeed, most of the power in this respect lay in the hands of local commissioners, who in some areas were given virtually a free hand. There were wide variations across the c ountry in the nature, quality, fairness, effectiveness and transparency of the proc esses followed, and there were some excellent commissioners and some whose practices left much to be desired. Views were mixed on whether the advent of APBs would lead to more consistency and higher quality commissioning, view s were mixed. Most interv iewees felt that they had the potential for higher quality decision -making and more strategic approaches, although there were risks that needed to be wa tched and, at the time of interview, definitive guidance about the role and powers of APBs was yet to be produced. Chapter 6 presented a brief overview of the substance misuse projects, services and activities actually funded and implemented in Wales. We found it impossible to identify all such activities, but were able to gain a fairly full picture of what was commissioned through the CSPs. A certain amount of imbalance was apparent in terms of investment in the different action areas of the Strategy document. The bulk of the funds allocated were concentrated in activities and projects categorisable as 'Support for substance misusers': principa lly, treatment, psychosocial interventions and other support services. Similar patterns we re found in the other funding streams, although the centrally funded projects incl uded several with a prevention aim, and one large project with an enforcement aim. No t many significant gaps were identified, although it was noted that little attention had been paid to substance misuse in further and higher education (with only one project aimed, at exce ssive alcohol consumption), and nothing targeted at unemployed young peopl e. Despite the apparent imbalance, most interviewees were reasonably happy with the distribution of funding between action areas. The strongest area of dis agreement was between interviewees with health and other backgrounds, over the level of pr iority that should be given to clinical treatment as against psychosocial interv entions and 'wrap-around' support. There was wide agreement that the system overall suffer ed from both fragmentation and duplication, and that an individual's 'journey' through it was often not smooth or 'seamless'. Too often, it was disrupted by agency rivalries, complex funding arrangements, or lack of communication and c oordination. Some interviewees held out hope that such problems would be am eliorated by the advent of APBs, but concerns were expressed that their e ffectiveness might be undermined by continuing pushing of local needs at the expense of a more strategi c regional approach, or by inappropriate choices of Board members. Serious concerns were also voiced about the possible loss of vital services for offenders - and knock-on effects on the system as a whole - if the incoming PCCs decided to s pend the current DIP funds elsewhere. In Chapter 7 we examined the structures and information systems through which oversight was maintained both of the activities of individual agencies and of the implementation of the Substance Misuse Strategy as a whole. Interviewees expressed little confidence in the accu racy and value of the KPIs used to monitor performance at local and individual provi der level, and most welcomed the imminent shift to more outcome-focused measur es. However, both providers and commissioners agreed that the fair est and most effective form of monitoring included a combination of formal KPIs, more qualitative information (i ncluding client feedback), and discussions with providers. 86 A small number of service pr oviders pointed out that, wher eas their work was closely scrutinised, that of commissioners was not, and that there should be at minimum some kind of complaints mechanism or 'whistle-bl owing' procedure for providers who felt that poor procedures or decision-making was occurring. Deficiencies were also ident ified in terms of oversight of the implementation of the Strategy as a whole. It was felt that the Implementation Boar d had been ineffective in this role and did not challenge government o fficers sufficiently when problems were apparent. The need for a broader oversight role over the 'direction of travel' was also identified, especially at a time when new responses to substance misuse, such as the 'recovery' agenda being purs ued by the UK government, were being advocated, and it was argued that this woul d best be undertaken by APoSM - an expert body which had played a prominent part in the developm ent of the Strategy, but appeared to have had relatively little influence thereafter. The last part of the chapter briefly descri bed and examined the kinds of data available with which to assess the effectiveness of the implementation of the Strategy. It was found that the national database, WNDSM, suffered from major problems of inaccuracy and missing data, and that - although TOP was potentially valuable in measuring a range of s hort-term outcomes of treatment - it did not allow longitudinal monitoring of the progress of service users. A number of relev ant evaluations were found, but they were not colle cted together for ready acce ss. There also appeared to be no systematic research plan, and there were few studies of the effectiveness of interventions that are routi nely commissioned at local level across the country. There is a case for a more systemat ic research plan to be built into the Implementation Plan, which might include evaluations of the abov e kind carried out across a number of selected areas. Finally, Chapter 8 considered what can be concluded from the available data (including our interviews) about the effe ctiveness of the implementation of the Strategy. The disappointing conclusion wa s that, although the Welsh Government is clearly committed to using monitoring, evaluation and research to develop and improve its substance misuse services, there is relatively little strong evidence about the effectiveness or not of individual projects , particular types of intervention, or indeed of the implementation of the Strategy as a whole. This is largely because of weaknesses in the design of the various instruments and databases for collecting information, combined with poor compliance among practitioners in supplying requested data. Moreover, while a number of evaluations have been undertaken, these have generally not been planned systematically. Most have been short in duration and dogged by a lack of useful data - a problem often exacerbated by research being commissioned too late to ens ure that appropriate data collection systems are in place. Few, too, have been able to construct appropriate comparison groups, so conclusions ar e often unreliable. As a result of the above pr oblems, disappointingly little can be said with confidence about the effectiveness of the im plementation of the Strategy. It is clear from WNDSM data that waiting times for assessment and treatment have reduced. It appears from TOP data that, among those ent ering treatment, there have been at least short-term improvements in alcohol and drug use, physical and psychological health, and quality of life. The available published research also contains a few positive findings, especially short-term reductions in substance misuse and progress in relation to social 87 problems. However, in all cases, cav eats must be entered because of weaknesses in data and methodology. The overall conclusion has to be that the whole area of data collection, monitoring and evaluation is one that needs close and systematic attention. Indeed, it could be argued t hat a planned programme of research and evaluation should be built into the Strategy and its Implementation Plans. Conclusions and recommendations Before drawing together the conclusions and recommendations emerging from this report, it is important to em phasise that this has been anyt hing but a straightforward piece of research. We have tried to cover a range of very broad and complex questions in a relatively short period of time , using a combination of (often unreliable) secondary data and a set of semi-structu red interviews. The task was also complicated by the fact that substance misuse services in Wales were undergoing major changes during the period of our fiel dwork, so some of the structures and processes described and commented on in this report have already been replaced or will shortly disappear. In t hese circumstances, we cannot realistically hope to come up with a set of robust and conclusive findings backed up by clear evidence. The main value (and uniqueness) of our study lie s in the fact that we have gleaned the views of 52 of the people in Wales wit h the most knowledge and experience of substance misuse problems and the policies and practices devised to tackle them - albeit, as acknowledged earlie r, weakened somewhat by t he important omission of the direct voice of service users. What we have tried to do is to reflect as best we can their views about the strengths and w eaknesses of the Strategy and its implementation. Our (tentat ive) recommendations are also based primarily on points about which we found fairly widespread agreem ent among them. Where possible, we have used evidence from other sources, but generally speaking we found very little reliable data or previous research evidence that assisted our task. On the above basis, we list below ten broad conclusions and a set of recommendations arising from them. Conclusions 1. The Strategy is essentially sound, and has widespread support. The emphasis on alcohol as well as illicit drugs is also widely praised. 2. All main elements of t he Strategy have been implem ented, although considerably more resources have been devoted to 'supporting substance misusers' (in the shape of treatment and psychosocial support) than to the other action areas of the Strategy. This distributi on of resources is supported by stakeholders, with a few exceptions. 3. There is strong international evidence for the effectiveness (in terms of reduced substance misuse) of opiate substitute pr escribing and psychosocial interventions. Of course, although this applies at a general level it does not necessarily show that the specific interventions implem ented in Wales are effective. 4. Good progress has been made in the provision of 'wrap around support', especially through the implementation of the ESF-f unded Wales Peer Mentoring project, which aims to help ex-substance misuse rs into employment. However, wrap around support services remain patchy across the country, and links between treatment units and those providing such services could be improved. 88 5. The commissioning processes through wh ich, until recently, resources were distributed to service providers through CSPs, were variable in fairness, effectiveness and transparency, and decisions were often difficult for providers to challenge. 6. The main body charged with oversight of the implementation of the Strategy, the Substance Misuse Strategy Implement ation Board, is widely agreed to be ineffective. 7. APoSM played an important role in the development of the Strategy, but has been ineffective and underused in terms of broad over sight of whether shifts in direction are needed as ideas and circumstances change. 8. While we did not interview substance mi susers ourselves, there was fairly broad agreement among stakeholders that service users' experiences could vary widely between areas, and that insufficient co llaboration and coordination between different providers could lead to duplication and fragmentation of the services they received. This finding is echoed in the recent Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (2012) review of substance misuse serv ices, which reported that although there are many examples across Wales of excell ent practice to avoid such problems, there remains much 'patchiness' and inconsistency between area s. 9. The WNDSM and TOP are not currently producing information that adequately assesses performance or measures outcomes. There is some statistical evidence that the implementation of the Strategy has had a positive impact, especially through reductions in waiting lists and drop-outs from treatmen t, but although there are a few useful measures of trends presented in the annual reports (such as encouraging figures showing a continuing reduction in alchohol-related deaths), there is as yet relatively little re liable evidence about br oader and longer term outcomes or trends, most obviously in rela tion to the long term impact of treatment on individuals' levels of substance misuse or their quality of life. 10. There is no clear research and evaluation strategy built into the Substance Misuse Strategy or the implementation plans. Generally speaking, research appears to have been commissioned in an ad hoc fashion, and the results are not collected together in an easily accessible form. While most centrally commissioned projects and pilots have been evaluated, this is not the case with routine interventions across the country. Recommendations Recommendation 1 We recommend that the aims, membersh ip and terms of reference of the Implementation Board are urgently reviewed, with a view to eq uip it to exercise more effective oversight of the implementation of the Strategy and to challenge the government's performance in this area when necessary. Recommendation 2 We recommend that the aims, operation and membership of APoSM are reviewed in order to equip it to make a more proactive and effective contribution to debates about possible shifts in approach or emphasis during the lifetime of the Strategy. (There is 89 also a case for a formal APoSM-led 'mid-S trategy review'.) Consideration should be given to creating a paid position for t he Chair and/or for members who undertake specific investigations, and to allocating mo re resources for suppo rt to the Board (eg for literature searches, small-scale res earch commissioning, or data analysis). Recommendation 3 We recommend that considerat ion is given to the creati on of a formal complaints procedure in respect of commissioning and other decisions made by APBs. Recommendation 4 We recommend that thorough reviews are ca rried out of the WNDSM in order to determine what kinds of information are most useful for the monitoring of service provision and the meaningful measurement of out comes, with a view to ceasing the collection of redundant information and focusi ng on data that has a clearly useful purpose. Priority should also be given findi ng the most effective ways of tracking the progress of individuals across different providers over time. Recommendation 5 We recommend that actions are taken to ensure that compliance with data entry requirements moves closer to 100 per cent , especially in relation to pieces of information that (we suggest) are flagged as essential. Dialogue with those responsible for providing the data should include explanations of how the databases have been improved, as well as more feedback of the results of analysis, in order to convince them that their entries are used productively. Recommendation 6 We recommend that more analysis is c onducted on TOP data and the results are published in a more accessible form. Recommendation 7 We recommend that a coherent research and evaluation strategy is built into implementation plans. Evaluations shoul d include not only centrally commissioned projects, but, for example, comparative st udies of the quality of implementation and the impact of psychosocial interventions that are routinely implemented across the country; a small fund could also be made ava ilable on a competitiv e basis to support evaluations of local innovative practice. In addition, while recognising the limitations imposed by current budget restraints, we believe that there is a strong case fo r developing a planned programme of broader research, for example into changing patterns of substance abuse in Wales, or into drug or alcohol problems am ong specific social groups. Such studies - in the oversight of which, we recommend, APoSM should play a major role - would provide a strong evidence base for the development of future Subst ance Misuse Strategies for Wales. Recommendation 8 We recommend that evaluations of in terventions funded by the WG are well signposted and displayed together in an appropriate place on the WG website. There is also a case for creating a numbered se ries of studies with standard covers. Consideration should also be given to collect ing together evaluations that have been commissioned or produced at local level and pl acing the best of them on the website too. 90 Recommendation 9 We recommend that continuing careful atte ntion is paid by the Substance Misuse branch to the working practices and governance of APBs, which we regard as critical to the effective implementation of the Strategy. This should build on, and monitor the implementation of, its recent guidelines (iss ued after the completion of our research), focusing on issues such as the membership of APBs; their powers; their strategic and commissioning roles; their relations with CSPs and the Substance Misuse Branch; their administrative and information support systems; and their governance, including complaints procedures. Further consideration should be given and, if thought appropriate, advice should be issued about how best to assess need across a region; how to ensure that balance is maintained between expenditure on, sa y, medical treatm ent and 'wrap-around services' as funds shrink; and the kinds of commissioning processes that should be followed (eg in terms of balance between sp ecifying services precisely and allowing flexibility; or the extent to wh ich services should be 'competed'). Recommendation 10 We recommend that contingency plans shou ld be drawn up to help fill the serious gaps in service provision that will arise if P CCs in one or more areas decide to use the existing DIP funds for other purposes. Recommendation 11 We recommend that continuing serious consi deration is given to ways of improving service users' experience of substance misu se interventions by 'joining up' services more effectively: for example through furt her development of information sharing arrangements, common referral and assess ment instruments, coordinated 'hand- overs' at exit points from particular serv ices, and more single points of contact, 'one stop shops' and co-location of agencies. Fu rther efforts should also be made to improve links and streamline referral routes between treatment agencies and those providing 'wrap around' services such as assistance with housing, training and employment. 91 Evaluation of the Substance Misuse Strategy for Wales Appendices 92 APPENDIX 1: Methods Interviews with key informants The aim was to interview people covering a ll stages of the impl ementation process. These included those involved in the desi gn of the Strategy, the creation of the Strategy document; as well as key people in the Directorate, their advisers, and those tasked within the Welsh Government for or ganising its implementation. We also wanted to include representat ives of the agencies and services that helped design and deliver the interventions, including the hi gher-level management and those working more closely with the end users. Respondent s were selected by creating our own provisional list to cover the above categor ies, and then by a 'snowball' process of asking interviewees and other key stakehol ders if they could recommend further suitable people to interview. We used our own judgement about whom to interview. The total number of interviews conducted was 52; a full list of t he posts or roles of interviewees can be found in Table A1.1 (no names are given, as all interviews were conducted with the promise of anonymity). The main interviewing method was face-to- face, semi-structured interviews. The interviews were conducted by members of the evaluation team using an interview guide. The issues included in the guide co vered nine broad themes: (1) knowledge of the Strategy and plan, (2) actions taken in relation to the Strategy and Implementation Plan, (3) views on the Strategy and plan, (4) support given in relation to the Strategy and plan, (5) commissioning, (6) data, (7) ef fectiveness of interventions, (8) central management and leadership, and (9) strengths and weaknesses of the Strategy and proposals for change. Naturally, certain themes were more relevant to some interviewees than others, which meant that the focus and content of the interviews varied from person to person. The length of the interviews also varied ranging from approximately one hour to nearly three. The interviews were analysed by transcrib ing them and entering them into NVivo. Keywords relating to each element of the analysis (e.g. 'co mmissioning', 'data management', 'Implementation Board' and so on) were searched and the relevant sections of the transcripts read and t he key issues identified were coded. 93 Table A1.1: Interviews completed No. Organisation Group Transcribed 1 National Programme Manager DIP, WG WG Yes 2 Regional Advisor, WG WG Yes 3 Regional Advisor, WG WG Yes 4 Consultant Psychiatrist Health Yes 5 Director Department of Health, WG WG Yes 6 Chief Superintendent, Police Police/APB chair Yes 7 Commissioner Local Authority Yes 8 CARAT manager, HMP Prison Yes 9 Consultant Psychiatrist Health Yes 10 Voluntary Service Provider VSO Yes 11 Substance misuse officer, Police Police Yes 12 Manager, Voluntary Service Provider VSO Yes 13 Operational Manager, NOMS Cymru NOMS Cymru Yes 14 Drug Strategy Manager, HMP Prison Yes (notes) 15 Manager, Voluntary Service Provider VSO Yes 16 Youth Justice Boar d Youth Justice Yes 17 APoSM alcohol lead Health Yes 18 Substance Misuse Division, WG WG Yes 19 Substance Misuse Division, WG WG Yes 20 Manager, Drug Interventions Programme DIP Yes 21 CEO, Voluntary Service Provider VSO Yes 22 Regional Advisor, WG WG Yes 23 Prescribing GP Health Yes 24 Research Scientist Public Health Yes 25 CEO, Voluntary Service Provider VSO Yes 26 Royal College of Psychiatrists Health Yes 27 Manager, Statutory Service Provider Health Yes 28 Regional Advisor, WG WG Yes 29 Implementation Board Chair WG Yes (notes) 30 Liaison officer, Police Police Yes 31 Manager, Voluntary Service Provider VSO Yes 32 Manager, Substance Misuse Programme Health Yes 33 CEO, Voluntary Service Provider VSO Yes 34 Director, Voluntary Service Provider VSO Yes 35 Ex Voluntary Service worker VSO Yes 36 Commissioner Local authority Yes 37 APB Chair Local authority Yes 38 ARCH initiatives VSO Yes 39 DIP Commissioner DIP Yes 40 Manager, Probation Probation Yes 41 Senior Community Safety Officer Police Yes 42 SMAT Co-ordinator Local authority Yes 43 Probation Probation Yes 44 Nurse, Consultant Substance Misuse Health Yes 45 Commissioner Health Yes 46 Director, Voluntary Service Organisation VSO Yes 47 Manager, Statutory Service Health Yes 48 Head of Citizen Focus Policing Police Yes 49 APB Chair Health No* 50 Director, Voluntary Service Organisation VSO No* 51 Chief Inspector in charge of substance misuse Police No* 52 DIP Chair DIP No* Notes: * Four interviews were not included in the formal NVivo analysis because they had not been transcribed in time. Key i ssues from these interviews were flagged up by the interviewer for inclusion in the report. 94 Analysis of the Substance Misu se Strategy for Wales report One of the essential tasks of the evaluation was to find out what precisely the Substance Misuse Strategy was in terms of its aims and the interventions proposed. We did this by conducting a content analysis of the Strategy document. This involved extracting comments relating to the aims and interventions and pasting them into an Excel file. Each entry was then coded and the coded entries were copied into SPSS and analysed. The main purpose of this analysi s was to map out what the Strategy was proposing should be done. Analysis of projects and services implemented To determine if what had been implemented in practice matched the proposals listed in the Strategy, our approach was to identif y all interventions implemented from the main funding sources. These included: CSP (Community Safety Partnership) funding allocations, the WG (Welsh Government) central budget funding, Health Budget funding, as well as ESF (European Social Fund), Lottery fundi ng, and funding from other charities. As a result of various difficu lties in obtaining the data, (e.g. there is no clear list of projects funded out of the Health Budget) we limited our analysis to CSP funded projects and activities published in the substance misuse annual reports produced by the Welsh Government. The CSP funded project analysis was conducted by coding the interventions into Excel and analysing the results in SPSS. The results enabled us to see if the Strategy plans had been put into practice. Focused review of the research literature One of the aims of the evaluation was to determine whether resources have been used effectively in light of what is known about the effectiveness of different types of substance misuse intervention. Our appr oach to addressing this problem was to conduct a review of the research literat ure covering the four main action areas identified in the Strategy document: preventing harm, suppor t for misusers, supporting families, and tackling availability. The focus ed review had three main parts. The first comprised a systematic review of systematic reviews to determine the broad range of research findings relating to substance misuse interventions. The second part described key evaluations, eit her included in the systemat ic reviews or otherwise known to us, to give greater insight into kinds of results obtained. The third part involved selecting a small number of case studies to provide further detail on the characteristics of the more successful interventions. The three reviews provided us with information with which to gauge whether or not the Strategy's proposals were in line with the evidence base. 95 APPENDIX 2: Key bodies in the design and implementation of the Strategy At the national level there are three main vehicles that support the implementation of the Substance Misuse Strategy. These ar e the Welsh Government Substance Misuse Branch, the Strategy Implementation Board and the Advisory Panel on Substance Misuse. The structure and remit of thes e three groups are described below. The Welsh Government Substance Misuse Branch At the centre of the whole implementation process is the Substance Misuse Branch. This is currently located in the Department of Health, Social Services and Children, and answerable to the Minister of Health and Social Services, who in early 2012 took over responsibility for substance misuse from the Minister for Social Justice and Local Government. Indeed, responsibility for the area has switched backwards and forwards between Ministers several times since devolution, perhaps reflecting some fundamental uncertainty about its most appropriate 'home'. In addition to its policy development roles (discussed earlier), the Branch publishes formal three-year (or one-year) Implementat ion Plans, as well as more detailed annual Branch plans. It distributes Welsh Go vernment funds to Community Safety Partnerships (and latterly Area Planning Boards) and oversees performance monitoring processes. It also commissi ons a number of cent rally managed projects, as well as bidding for project funds from elsewhere (notably the European Social Fund). Finally, one of the critical elements of the implementation syst em is the work of the Substance Misuse Advisory Regional Teams (SMARTs), which act as intermediaries between the Substanc e Misuse Branch and local planners and commissioners (CSPs, SMATs and APBs). The Strategy Implementation board According to the Welsh Government webs ite (accessed 21/6/12), the aims of the Strategy Implementation Board are (1) to oversee, at a na tional level, the delivery of the Strategy, (2) to ensure that the Strategy is revi ewed and refreshed in light of emerging developments or changes in pa tterns of substance misuse, and (3) to ensure that links are establishe d and maintained with relevant groups. Membership of the Board comprises WG senior officials as well as external stakeholders drawn from a wide variety of organisations. APoSM The Advisory Panel on Substance Misuse (APoSM) is primarily tasked with advising the Minister on the current state of knowledge and evid ence about substance misuse issues. The Panel is comprised of people wi th a close interest in substance misuse and includes representatives from a diverse range of organisations including: police, prison, probation, health, vo luntary sector agencies, stat utory treatment services, pharmacists, nursing, youth services, soci al services, education, and public health. APoSM has developed four sub-groups each of which focus on a specific issue. At the current time there are sub- groups examining alc ohol, opiate replac ement treatments, psychoactive substances and the recovery agenda. Minutes from APoSM meetings (usually held four times each year) ar e published on the WG w ebsite along with any APoSM reports. At the time of writing, just three r eports are available on the WG website, the last of which was publish ed in March 2011. We understand that APoSM 96 97 has been without a Chair for some time and is in the process of recruiting a replacement. 98 Organisational structure of the Welsh Go vernment Substance Misuse Branch (2012) Figure A2.1 APPENDIX 3: Analysis of the Substance Misuse Strategy for Wales The first method of determining use of evidence was to search the strategy document (specifically Chapter 4) for the word 'evidence'. In the 33 pages presenting the four priority actions, the word 'evidence' was used 19 times. The word 'research' was used twice, 'findings' three times, and 's tatistics' once. Henc e, the main section of the document covering proposed interventi ons clearly considered the findings of research. However, the word counts do not show whether evidence was consulted to inform the choice of effective interventions or for some other purpose. To examine this, the sections of text in which the word 'evidence' was found was read to determine if research was being used to ident ify the nature of the problem (e.g. facts about drug misuse) or the natur e of the solution (e.g. the most effective intervention to be implemented). We also looked at whether evidence was mentioned as something that had been addressed or something that might be addressed in the future. The review showed that 12 of the 19 refe rences referred to finding out something about the solution rather than collecting information about the natur e of the problem. It also showed that 16 of the 19 references to evidence referred to research that had been consulted rather than might be consulted. Hence, on this basis alone, it could be argued that the strategy document drew upon research evidence. It should be acknowledged, however, that it provides only an indirect method of determining whether the strategy was evidence based. To investigate this further, we also exami ned the references cited to determine the extent to which they included evaluations of intervention effectiveness. Overall, there were 64 citations to 58 references to t he research literature in the 33 pages of Chapter Four. The distribution of references across the four priority action areas was somewhat uneven. The research was most frequently incorporated in the discussion on 'Support for substance misusers' and leas t frequently in the section on 'tackling availability'; with the first action area ('Preventing harm') and 'Tackling availability' had four. We also looked at whether the reference used concerned the nat ure of the problem (substance misuse) or the nature of the so lution (interventions). The concept of evidence-based policy concerns mainly the use of evidence to determine solutions to problems. The analysis showed that almost three-quarters (72%) of the references concerned the nature of t he solution (the effectiveness of interventions). Accepting that the analysis was fairly brief in the time available, even these fairly indirect indicators of evidence-based poli cy suggest that research played some role in determining the strategy, and in the choice of particular interventions proposed. The role of evidence in relation to other aspects of the strategy and the extent to which programmes implemented matched th e conclusions of broader-based literature reviews on effectiveness, is considered in Chapter 3. 99 Figure A3.1 Interventions included: * named programmes * types of programmes (e.g. harm-redu ction, educational programmes. etc.) * general, but tangible, interventions (e.g. 'support', 'guidance', 'information', etc.) * programmes that might indirectly reduce substance misuse (e.g. health, relationships, employment, etc.) * interventions that are current, but were implemented in a previous strategy. Interventions excluded: * statements of aims to tackle a problem without saying how * general statements about improving services * unspecified interventions * general statements about improving access * general statements about improving staff training * proposed changes to organisational or administrative arrangements * actions proposed at the UK level Table A3.1: Priority Action Area 1: Preventing Harm Strategy document page number Action summary level 1 Action summary level 2 Action summary level 3 28 Diversion Diversionary activities Led by CYPPs, CSPs and YOTs should work together to ensure that appropriate diversionary activities and support systems are in place via joint commissioning or budget pooling arrangements where appropriate. 22 Education Educational material We need to ensure that information and education material are available in Welsh and ethnic minority languages to meet the needs of the local community. 22 Educational material A core substance misuse education programme in 97 per cent of primary and secondary schools, backed by local initiatives. 25 Schools programmes We have directly funded (jointly with the four police forces in Wales) the establishment of the 'All Wales School Liaison Core Programme' (AWSLCP) which is now delivered at key stages in 97 per cent of primary and secondary schools across Wales. 28 Non-schools programmes Our NEET policies, which CSPs have been consulted on, include a range of actions aimed at re-engaging young people into education, employment or training opportunities. The Learning Pathways Programme for all 14-19 year olds and, in particular, its focus on tailored personal support will be crucial here. 22 Information DAN 24/7 The Welsh Substance Misuse Helpline (DAN 24/7) providing easy access 24 hours a day to information and advice (including about where to access further support or treatment). 100 23 Media campaigns [R]aise awareness through media campaigns at a national and local level. 23 Information [Raise awareness] ... through sensible drinking information at the point of sale. 27 Information For that reason, we will provide advice to parents about appropriate age-related alcohol consumption in young people. 27 Information We want colleges and universities to develop policies to make sure that students are not drinking excessively because of misperceived social norms for drinking, an approach that has had success in universities in other countries. 28 Information The new Welsh youth service strategy, launched in 2007, identifies improved health, fitness and well being as a strategic outcome. To support this, guidance 'Introducing Health to Youth Workers', which contains information on substance misuse, will be revised and re-issued to key partners and agencies in 2008. 101 Table A3.2: Priority Action Area 2: Supporting Substance Misusers Strategy docume nt page number Action summary level 1 Action summary level 2 Action summary level 3 33 Brief interventions Brief interventions We will therefore be scoping the potential to pilot a brief intervention service to which GPs and others can refer those drinking alcohol at harmful levels but not requiring specialist treatment for addiction. 34 Detoxification Detoxification services Tackling the problem of access to inpatient detoxification and residential rehabilitation services in Wales. (Studies show that clients entering residential and inpatient programmes make substantial improvements in terms of abstinence from or reduction in illegal drug misuse, criminal activity, levels of injecting and psychological health. They are especially beneficial for substance misusers with severe problems, and evidence suggests that residential treatment may be more effective for tho 34 Drop-in services Drop in and day services Encouraging the development of drop-in and day services... 31 Drop-in services Expanding outreach, drop in and other services aimed at identifying those in need of treatment and support and engaging them with services. 31 Harm reduction Needle exchange The services provided must include needle exchange, harm minimisation ... 31 Testing for BBVs The services provided must include ...blood-borne virus testing and vaccination for hepatitis B 33 Information Advice and information to users Primary care settings are particularly important in offering advice and information to alcohol misusers and ensuring greater numbers are referred to and engage with services. 34 DAN 24/7 Promoting the Welsh Drug and Alcohol Helpline (DAN 24/7) as a route to access information and advice about substance misuse information and services in Wales and developing it to provide a source of easily accessible support for substance misusers. 40 Multi-agency services Multi-agency care for pregnant substance- Pregnant women with substance misuse problems should not be managed by GPs and midwives alone but with support from specialist services, to ensure co-ordinated multidisciplinary and multi-agency care. Close multidisciplinary and multi-agency care should be continued not only through pregnancy but also in to the postnatal period even if the infant is removed into the care of the local authority. 31 Outreach services Outreach services The services provided must include ... better provision via outreach services. 33 Outreach services This will require more investment in youth and other outreach services ... 102 34 Prescribing Heroin prescribing In line with the latest evidence on effectiveness continuing to develop the capacity of substitute opiate prescribing across Wales (including supervised consumption), and the greater involvement of community pharmacists but ensuring that the effectiveness of such treatment is enhanced by the provision of Tier 2 support services. 34 Heroin treatment programmes Considering the cost effectiveness of the introduction of the heroin treatment programmes for a very small number of individuals for whom alternative treatment has failed. This will include reviewing evaluations of the pilots running in England as soon as they are available. APoSM will be asked to provide expert advice on this matter once the evaluation material is available. 38 Monitoring prescribing We will also take action aimed at ... encouraging more responsible prescribing. 38 Reducing use of abused drugs in primary care Reducing inappropriately prescribed medicines such as benzodiazepines in primary care 33 Primary health care General medical care Individuals with substance misuse problems are often in poor general physical health and many are not registered with GPs. It is important that health service planners ensure that appropriate general medical health services (including sexual health and family planning) are available to this population. 34 Psychosocial interventions Psychosocial interventions Expanding psychosocial interventions and psychological therapies to motivate engage and retain substance misusers in treatment and support relapse prevention. This will also assist the expansion of treatment for those with alcohol or drug dependency (such as stimulants) where substitute medication is not an option. 36 Cognitive behaviour therapy Service users who are trying to change their substance misusing behaviour need support to cope with situations that may lead to relapse. Cognitive behaviour therapy programmes which help individuals identify, anticipate and cope with pressures and problems should therefore be a key part of structured treatment programmes. 34 Self-help groups Alcoholics Anonymous Encouraging the development of ... self-help or mutual aid groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous 34 Narcotics Anonymous Encouraging the development of ... self-help or mutual aid groups such as ...Narcotics Anonymous by ensuring service planners recognise their importance in supporting formal treatment 37 Skills training Skills training and The skills and employment strategy for Wales47, 'Skills that Work for Wales' 103 educational programmes acknowledges the importance that training and skills programmes have in addressing deprivation and social exclusion, and preventing and reducing tthe harms caused to young people and families by substance misuse. We will work with partners to raise their awareness of the needs of substance misusers to improve their access to skills programmes and learning opportunities. 36 Support services Support services It is also essential to ensure that support services are in place to protect and support individuals from relapse after they leave structured treatment. Service planners should ensure that these important elements of the care pathway are available and seen as integral to service design and care planning. 31 Wrap around services Wrap around services including support and care plans Focusing on helping substance misusers to re-establish themselves in the community, both by providing wrap around services, and by providing support for the avoidance of relapse through the embedding of planning of these services in local substance misuse plans and individual care plans. 36 Wrap around services including support and care plans For many substance misusers, it is the provision of wrap around services, alongside the appropriate treatment and aftercare services, that will be pivotal to reducing the harm caused by their substance misuse and to their ability to maintain or re-establish themselves in the community. If we are to help individuals sustain the benefits gained from treatment, then we must do more to provide effective wrap around services. 36 Wrap around services including support and care plans In order to ensure these important elements of care are properly addressed, CSPs and their partners should consider wrap around services as a core component of treatment for all substance misusers. 104 Table A3.3: Priority Action Area 3: Supporting Families Strategy document page number Action summary level 1 Action summary level 2 Action summary level 3 46 Information The Carers and Families module We will be requiring the CSPs to implement the Carers and Families module of the SMTF. This will include ensuring there is well publicised advice available about local services and sources of information, including national agencies such as Families Anonymous and Adfam. 44 Prevention On Track programme The 'On Track' programme works with children and their families between the ages of four to twelve and provides a proactive, multi- disciplinary early prevention agenda for work with families, children and communities, combining area/community initiatives with targeted interventions. 44 Families First programme 'Families First' is a multi-agency collaboration to provide a child and family focused service in order to prevent and limit the potential for harm to children and young people of substance misusing parents. It works with both parents and children including direct work with children and young people to develop coping strategies and self esteem. 46-47 The domestic abuse strategyWe will work with the All Wales Domestic Abuse Working Group which is responsible for overseeing the Welsh Assembly Government's domestic abuse strategy and the network of Welsh domestic abuse co-ordinators to take forward, identify and co-ordinate actions which support jointly the delivery of the domestic abuse strategy and tackle substance misuse. 46 Psychosocial Therapeutic communities In addition, we will be piloting a therapeutic community family support service and issuing models of good practice to encourage the expansion of services that work with the families/carers of people who misuse substances offering them advice, guidance and counselling. 44 Support Evaluated Early Parental Intervention Projects (EEPIP) Evaluated Early Parental Intervention Projects (EEPIP) support parents where there are concerns about the impact of substance misuse on their parenting skills but which have not yet reached the threshold of activating child protection procedures. By working with the parents the intention is to achieve better welfare outcomes for their children. We are currently supporting five pilots and the evaluation and lessons learnt will be widely disseminated in October 2009. 44 Option 2 model The 'Option 2' model offers a crisis intervention service for families where there are child protection concerns related to parental 105 substance misuse. It is a time limited, intensive intervention. An evaluation of 'Option 2' commissioned by the Welsh Assembly Government has revealed promising results. 45 Caring about Carers strategy Parental substance misuse can place a burden of responsibility for the care of siblings and parents onto children. In the case of illegal drugs, children can also be affected by stigma and the illegality of the activity. 106 Table A3.4: Priority Action Ar ea 4: Tackling Availability Page no. Action summary level 1 Action summary level 2 Action summary level 3 53 Brief interventions Brief interventions In some areas, a similar approach is already being taken by police forces to offenders arrested for alcohol related crime. Under this strategy and, in line with the objectives in the Reducing Re-offending Plan for Wales, partnerships should work together to ensure that arrangements are in place to offer brief interventions, support or referral to alcohol treatment services to those arrested for alcohol related crimes. 53 Criminal Justice Generic arrest referral workers Partners should seek to develop generic substance misuse arrest referral workers, who are able to deal with both drug and alcohol misusing offenders in order to make the best use of workers in custody suites and better meet the needs of those who misuse both drugs and alcohol. 53 Better use of assess recovering procedures When the police arrest individuals for drug supply it is imperative that they use asset recovery powers to remove the profits of the illegal drug trade. Funding from recovered assets should be used to fund further enforcement activity or community initiatives to divert young people from illegal drug use. 53 Better use of harm reduction in custody suites Interventions in custody suites can be an effective means of offering support and harm minimisation advice to problematic drug users and directing them into other treatment services. Arrest referral workers, forming part of DIP teams, and the use of Drug Testing on Charge (DToC) in some areas is proving very successful in identifying and encouraging more people to engage in treatment. 53 Drug testing on arrest A move to drug testing on arrest in some DIP areas in England has demonstrated further success in identifying and encouraging hard-to-reach individuals to engage in treatment79. Testing at the point of arrest also identifies individuals who misuse stimulants and other drugs that only stay in the system for a short time. We will support those areas in Wales operating DToC moving to testing on arrest as part of plans to encourage more individuals to enter treatment. 50 Enforcement Better use of Licensing Act and Violent Crime Reduction Act We are concerned that partners are not yet making best use of the Licensing Act and Violent Crime Reduction Act to reduce the harms to individuals and communities from excessive drinking. CSPs and Health bodies must do more to share data and information and work together on the preparation of the 107 local substance misuse action plans to tackle alcohol related harm. 50 Target traders who sell alcohol to children Work with local trading standards departments to tackle traders who persistently sell or supply alcohol to children, and make it easier for responsible traders to identify those who may be underage. 50 Enforce public drinking laws Make the best use of current powers and legislation at a partnership level, and ensure that the full range of sanctions are brought to bear against the individuals who drink irresponsibly and become involved in crime and anti-social behaviour, and the licensees who continue to serve them regardless of their state of intoxication. 50 Licensing Licensing 50 Test purchasing Test purchasing 50 Under-age drinking Under-age drinking 51 Impose licensing authority standards Initiatives should be undertaken on a local and regional level to encourage the licensing industry to meet standards which will impact positively upon their business and the wider community. 50 Environmental Environmental design and management Look beyond licensees to take a holistic approach to the management of our towns and cities during the evening and night time so that everyone is able to visit them without the fear of alcohol related crime and disorder. 51 Transport Transport 51 Environmental factors Environmental factors such as toilet facilities 51 Lighting Lighting 51 Street cleaning Street cleaning 51 CCTV CCTV 51 Night time economy We will work with local partners to implement an evening and night-time economy framework across Wales through provision of a web-based tool providing up to date guidance and best practice for local areas to develop plans for managing the evening and night-time economy. 52 Policing Neighbourhood policing Neighbourhood Policing Teams are now established in each area of Wales under the current National Policing Plan. These teams should work to empower individuals and communities to engage with local policing in our communities. 53 Neighbourhood policing Neighbourhood policing units should distribute leaflets informing the community of the action taking place and the agencies in place to support drug users requiring access to treatment. 52-53 Tarian Tarian engages with the local policing teams and partnerships to ensure a co-ordinated approach is taken when the arrest phase of an 108 operation is implemented. We will continue to support this initiative and encourage all partners to develop stronger links between drug enforcement activity at a local and regional level, both in terms of intelligence gathering and assistance with local initiatives. 53 Street level policing project We will be supporting an initiative aimed at tackling street level dealing and the impact upon the visible anti-social effects of drug dealing in our communities. 50 Prevention Proof of age cards We also believe that the availability of alcohol and other age restricted products could be reduced by the wider use of approved Proof of Age cards. We will consider a national Proof of Age card scheme in Wales which is secure and has a Proof of Age Standards Scheme (PASS) hologram making it easier to identify a legitimate card. 50 Working with the licensed trade Working with the licensed trade 109 110 APPENDIX 4: Focused review of the literatur e: methods and additional tables The search method used for the Cochrane database was to select initially all reviews published in the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Gr oup. This is a separate collection of reviews relating to interventions concerning substance misuse. A similar procedure was adopted in relation to the Campbell librar y of criminal justice systematic reviews. As this collection was relatively small, it was possible to select them all initially with the view of finding relevant publications at the second stage of the review. The ASSIA database was more extensive and r equired using a traditional search expression to reduce the number of initially relevant publications. The search terms used are shown below. Figure A4.1 The first search resulted in 361 studies that fitted our search criteria (see Figure A3.1). The title and abstracts were obtained for all 361 studies. These were then checked against our eligibility criteria to determine if they were suitable for analysis. The initial eligibilit y criteria were that the docum ent must comprise a systematic review (e.g. not an evaluation or a systematic review of systematic reviews), it must be based on determining the effect of an in tervention using an experimental design (e.g. randomised controlled trials, double bl ind experiments, quasi-experiments), it must be easy to obtain (bearing in mind t he time and resource constraints of the review), and it must not duplicate a system atic review already identified. This resulted in 104 eligible item s with 257 items reject ed. We then attempted to obtain copies of all eligible publications. Seven were unobtainable, which left a total of 97 reviews. Each review was then read and checked against a final round of eligibility criteria. The main criteria were that t he systematic review must contain a summary outcome measure relating to substance mi suse. We excluded studies that focused solely on completion rates, outcomes relating to knowledge gained or skills developed, and outcomes relating to criminal behaviour. Forty-two studies were excluded, which left a total of 55 systemat ic reviews suitable for analysis covering 1,874 evaluations.

Drugs Positive 115 116 Specific types of intervention for wh ich there is good quality evidence of effectiveness Schools-based prevention A good example of a well evaluated schools-based prevention programme is the Life Skills Training in Schools programme in the United States which is focused on reducing excessive alcohol use (Foxcroft and Tsertsvadze, 2011). The intervention Foxcroft DR, Tsertsvadze A. Universal sc hool-based prevention programs for alcohol misuse in young people. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2011, Issue 5. Art. No.: CD009113. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009113. The results In school settings, universal prevention typi cally takes the form of alcohol awareness education, social and peer resistance skills , normative feedback, or development of behavioural norms and positive peer affiliations. Prevention programs can be either specific curricula delivered as school lessons, or classroom behaviour management programs, and can be educational, psychosocial, or a combination. Psychosocial interventions aim to develop psychological and social skills (e.g. peer resistance) through modelling, understanding, norm-setting and social skill practice, so that young people are less likely to misuse alcohol. Educational interventions aim to raise awareness of the potential dangers of alcohol misuse (e.g. in creased knowledge) so that young people are less likely to misuse alcohol. In two trials, the single intervention progra m - Life Skills Training (LST) was delivered through formal teacher, older students, or vi deo training. In the first trial, the peer-led program significantly reduced frequency of drunkenness and the amount of consumption per occasion compared to the teacher-led progr am or standard curriculum at four months of follow-up. In the second trial, the LST program delivered either through teacher or video training was significantly more effective in reducing the mean number of drunkenness episodes in the last month compar ed to standard curriculum at 6 months of follow-up. In the same trial, post-intervent ion alcohol use (monthly or weekly) and the frequency of three or more drinks per occasion did not significantly differ between the intervention programs and the control group. In another trial that evaluated the LST program, the program was significantly more effective in reducing binge drinking (> 5 drinks per occasion) at one year and two years of follow-up. Family-based prevention A common psychosocial intervention used to prevent substance misuse are family- based programmes. These cover a wide range of activities including developing parenting skills, providing par ental support, social and peer-resistance skills training, and positive peer affiliations. Several evaluations of these programmes were included in the systematic review. One of t hese reviews, by the same authors of the previous review, summarised the results of 12 evaluations of universal family-based prevention programmes. The following is a description of this kind of programme and the evaluation results obtained. 117 The intervention Universal prevention strategies address the entire population within a particular setting (schools, colleges, families, co mmunity). The aim of universal prevention is to deter or to delay the onset of a disorder or problem by providing all individuals the information and skills necessary to prevent the problem. Univ ersal prevention programs are delivered to large groups without any prior screening for risk factors, so all members of the population share the same general risk, although the ri sk may vary greatly among individuals and sub-groups. In family settings, universal prevent ion typically takes the form of supporting the development of parenting skills includi ng parental support, nurturing behaviours, establishing clear boundaries or rules, and parental monitoring. Social and peer resistance skills, the devel opment of behavioural norms a nd positive peer affiliations can also be addressed with a universal family-based preventive program. Foxcroft DR, Tsertsvadze A. Un iversal multi-component prevention programs for alcohol misuse in young people. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2011, Issue 9. Art. No.: CD009307. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009307 The results Nine of the 12 evaluations examined in t he review showed significantly greater reductions in alcohol use among family-based intervention groups than in the control groups. Examples of two of the nine family-based interventions are shown below. In one long-term trial (Spoth 1999a), t he effectiveness of two family-based intervention programs (Iowa Strengthening Families Program and Preparing for the Drug-Free Years Program) were compared to the control intervention (4 mailed leaflets) through a 10-year follow-up for di fferent alcohol use measures (e.g., lifetime use, past year use, past mont h use, lifetime drunkenness, past month frequency of drinking, alcohol use composite index, or alcohol use initiation growth curve parameters). The long-term results of this trial indicated that both family- based interventions significantly reduced t he proportion of new alcohol users, past month mean frequency of drinking, and alcohol use composite index. In general, the positive effect of the Iowa Strengthening Families Program (ISFP) relative to the control intervention was more pronounced than that of the Preparing for the Drug- Free Years Program (PDFY) for reducing several alcohol use outcome measures (e.g., lifetime use, past year use, past month use, lifetime drunkenness, ever drinking alcohol, and growth curves for lif etime alcohol use, lifetime drunkenness, and initiation of drunkenness). Pharmaceutical approaches The main pharmaceutical methods used in the treatment of substance misuse are broadly 'agonist treatment', wh ich mimic the effect of the substance being misused, (the most common is substitute prescrib ing), and 'antagonist treatment', which blocks the effect of the misused substance (the most common of which is Naltrexone treatment). A third method is various forms of adjunct drug treatme nt to modify the effects of withdrawal or to control relat ed disorders (e.g. use of anti-depressants and anti-psychotics). The most common and widely known pharmaceutical intervention is methadone treatment. This is a form of substitute pre scribing which aims to replace the drug of addiction (usually heroin) wit h another drug (oral or in jectable methadone). It can be 118 administered on a reducing or maintenance basis. There have been many evaluations of the effectiveness of met hadone maintenance. One of the earliest and most frequently cited are the various studies by Gluber et al. in the United State based on random allocation designs. The intervention The therapy comprised 6 months of methadone maintenance with standard counselling. Participants were transferred from 21-day methadone detoxification to the 6-month methadone maintenance prog ram, and were guaranteed methadone maintenance for 6 months (60-90 mg) followed by a 6-week taper. Participants in this treatment condition received their therapy in directly observed doses at their daily methadone clinic visits. Gruber VA, Delucchi KL, Kielstein A, Ba tki SL. (2008) A randomised trial of 6- month methadone maintenance with standard or minimal counselling versus 21- day methadone detoxification.. Drug an d Alcohol Dependence 94:199-206. The results Compared to 21-day methadone detoxification, 6-month methadone maintenance with minimal counselling resulted in a greater decrease from baseline in opiate positive urine tests (65-85%) and self-reported heroin use (mean = 5.8-8.1 days per month) during months 1-6. Psychosocial approaches Psychosocial approaches are used in treatment to provide information (e.g. educational programmes such as skills tr aining and family-based interventions) and to aid motivation (such as motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy). The example chosen describes an intervention that is used widely in the United States. The intervention Reinforcement-based intensive outpatient treatment (RBT) is a relatively newly developed therapy based on the communi ty reinforcement approach (CRA). Reinforcement-based outpatient treatment (RBT) has been based on CRA with monetary-based incentives. It has been ta ilored to inner-city heroin abusers who may not be eligible or do not want methadone maintenance. This is implemented as aftercare from a rapid (3-day) inpatient detoxification. Abstinence-contingent financial support for practical needs such as housing, travel, lunch and recreational activities is also included. A brief version of RBT includes a three-month treatment schedule was implemented with intensive daily attendance in the first two-week p hase, followed by a less intensive three weekly sessions offered for six weeks, then twice-weekly sessions offered for the last four weeks. During attendance, individual sessions could incorporate cognitive behavioural methods, addressing individual needs of the patient. Mayet S, Farrell M, Ferri M, Amato L, Da voli M. (2004) Psychosocial treatment for opiate abuse and dependence. Cochrane Data base of Systematic Reviews. Issue 4. Art. No.: CD004330. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004330.pub2. 119 120 The results Reinforcement-Based Intensive Outpati ent Treatment (RBT) versus Standard Community Treatment Resources. Relapse to heroin use by urinalysis suggested that the RBT group had a significantly better prevention at one-month follow up. However at three months follow up, this e ffect was not significant. Self-report of heroin and cocaine use was less likely with the RBT group as compared to the standard group at discharge, at one week follow up and at one month follow up. Being in employment was significantly more likely by the RBT groups at one month, but not at three months. 121 APPENDIX 5: Analysis of projects and services implemented To determine if what had been implemented in practice matched the proposals listed in the Strategy, our approach was to identif y all interventions implemented from the main funding sources. These included: CSP (Community Safety Partnership) funding allocations, the WG (Welsh Government) central budget funding, Health Budget funding, as well as ESF (European Social Fund), Lottery funding, and funding from other charities. As a result of various diffi culties in obtaining the data, (e.g. there is no clear list of projects f unded out of the Health Budget) we limited our analysis to CSP funded projects and ac tivities published in t he annual reports of the Implementation Board. The CSP funded pr oject analysis was conducted by coding the interventions into Excel and analysing the results in SPSS. The results enabled us to see if the Strategy pl ans had been put into practice.

National overdose study University of Glamorgan Cross-sectional survey Non-fatal overdoses Summaries of evaluations commi ssioned by the WG since 2008 Evaluation of the Take-Home Naloxone demonstration project The Take-Home Naloxone demonstration proj ect grew out of t he WG's substance misuse strategy which stat ed a commitment to take actions to reduce the number of drug-related deaths and near-fatal drug pois onings. The project was launched in September 2009 in selected areas across Wale s. It involved training drug users and their family and friends in the administrat ion of naloxone (an opioid antagonist which 127 blocks the actions of opioid medicines such as heroin) and other life-saving actions following the discovery of an overdose event. THN kits were then issued to opiate users who completed the training. The ev aluation comprised a process evaluation and an outcome evaluation of the project during its first year of operation. The findings indicate that the THN training sessions were effective in improving knowledge and skills across a range of meas ures. However, the absence of a long- term follow-up means that it is not cl ear whether these improvements were maintained over time. In terms of lives sa ved, no difference was found in the survival rates of overdose events in the THN sites and a non-matched comparison site in which THN was not distributed. Evaluation of the All Wales School Liaison Core Programme The All Wales School Liaison Core Pr ogramme (AWSLCP) was developed \"in recognition of the role that schools and education can play in tackling anti-social behaviour, substance misuse and in improving personal safety\" (p.15). The programme became fully operational in September 2004 and by 2008/09 98% of schools in Wales had signed up to it. In practice the AWSLCP involves school community police officers delivering formal lessons to children in Key Stages 1-4 on substance misuse, social behaviour, comm unity and personal safety. The evaluation comprised both a process and outcome eval uation. The use of a questionnaire survey showed that after participating in t he AWSLCP 83% of primary pupils, 57% of Year 8 pupils and 37% of Year 11 pupils 'now' thought about what would happen if they used illegal drugs. A similar pattern of results was found for alcohol. Results from focus groups also indicated that there were changes in attitude towards substance misuse though the authors recognise that the picture is a 'complex one' (p. 65). The evaluation also examined ch anges in behaviour regarding substance misuse. The authors explain that although fewer in number than other examples given, \"they nonetheless suggest the lessons we re having an impact in this area.\" (p. 9) Overall, the evaluation provides some fairly weak evidence to support the effectiveness of the programme. The absence of pre-test measures means that changes following the programme hav e not been properly assessed and the absence of a control group means that any effects cannot be attributed to the programme with any certainty. Evaluation of the Tran sitional Support Scheme The Transitional Support Scheme (TSS) is one of the largest and longest established mentoring schemes for ex-prisoners in the UK. Its main aim is to reduce re- offending. The scheme was developed to help with the resettlement of short-term prisoners who, unlike their long-term count erparts, are not subj ect to statutory supervision on release. The evaluation examined both the effectiveness of the scheme's organisational processes and it s impact on the client group using a combination of quantitativ e and qualitative methods. Us ing data from the Police National Computer, the two-year reconviction rates of all male TSS participants over 21 were compared with those of a sample of similar prisoners who did not participate in TSS. No significant difference in reconviction rates was found between TSS participants as a whole and the comparison gr oup. However, reconviction rates were found to be considerably lower among participants who had maintained contact with their mentors post-release (71%) than among both the comparison group (77%) and those who had not maintained contact (83% ). Other statistical data collected to measure the 'distance travelled' by TSS participants in terms of addressing 128 criminogenic needs such as employment, housing and substance abuse, indicated that substantial proportions of participants made progress in these areas. The results provide relatively strong evidence of the effectiveness of TSS in reducing crime. However, the use of a post-test only design without random allocation into experimental and comparison conditions, weakens the strength of this evidence. Evaluation of the Early Parent al Intervention Pilot Programme The Early Parental Intervention Pilot progr amme (EPIP) was developed as part of the WG's policy objective of reducing harm caused to children by parental substance misuse. In April 2007, five pilot projec ts were commissioned in different locations across Wales. Each project aimed to reduc e the effect of substance misuse on parenting capacity and to enable substance misusing adults to develop positive and effective parenting skills. The evaluation included both a process and impact evaluation. The effectiveness of the EPIP was assessed on a largely qualitative basis due to the lack of quantitative data av ailable to the evaluation team. The researchers explain that the evaluat ion was commissioned 10 months into a 24- month pilot after data collect ions systems, focusing on outputs rather than outcomes, had already been implemented. Despite developing a bespoke database to enhance the recording of outcomes, the data were either not entered or not complete enough to support any robust outcome analyses. Neve rtheless, the qualitative data collected showed that despite a short implementation period, four of the fi ve projects 'helped to alleviate the problems caused by subst ance misuse within the families that they worked with' (p. 33). Given the absenc e of any robust quantitative data, the evaluation provides only limited evidenc e of the effectiveness of the EPIP. Evaluation of the 'include' Programme The 'include' programme was established in 2003 in three areas of South Wales. It aims to provide intensive support to young people who have been involved in significant substance use and offending beh aviour. The programme runs on a rolling basis over an 11-week period and involves young people (in groups of no more than eight) participating in 25 hours of activities per week. The evaluation was conducted over a six-month period from January to July 2008 and investigated the delivery, impact and effectiveness of the programme . Effectiveness, on a range of outcomes including, substance use and offending, was measured using data from the 'include' database and through qualitative interviews with participants. Project involvement was found to be associated with a significant positive increase in behaviour scores across all aspects of measured behaviour on exit from treatment. Interviews with participants on completion of treatment (and again three months post-exit) provided further evidence to support the positive impact of the proj ect on participants. However, the absence of a comparison group and the short- term measure of changes makes it difficult to know pr ecisely what impact the project has on participants and if any impact is maintained post-completion. Evaluation of the Pres cribed Medication Support Service in Conwy The development of a Prescribed Medicati on Support Service in Conwy was initiated and funded by Conwy Local Health Board to tackle high levels of benzodiazepine prescribing. The main aim of the project was to address inequalities in health care provision across Conwy and to increas e the quality of life of long-term benzodiazepine users. The project ran from the end of May 2006 for a 12-month period. It involved a Support Worker (R GN and Psychotherapist) and a team of 129 volunteer counsellors, working closely with t he five GP Practices that had the highest levels of benzodiazepine prescribing. It should be noted that the evaluation report presents findings relating to a period prior to the implementation of the 2008 strategy. Nevertheless, its inclusion on t he WG website and its coverage of an issue highlighted in the 2008 st rategy means that it is relev ant to include in this review. The evaluation is brief and focuses on effectiveness by measuring the level of GP prescribing and the numbers and percentages of people redu cing or stopping their use of benzodiazepines. Over the duration of the projec t the average reduction in prescribing was nearly three times greater among the five practices taking part than among those practices not taking part. Fu rthermore, 33% of clients reduced their medication and 12% stopped taking their medi cation altogether. When interviewed about their experiences of the service, cli ents rated their experiences very highly. Overall, the evaluation provides fairly strong evidence to support the service. However, the small sample sizes, the short-term follow-up and the inability to control for information reaching the comparison gr oup means that caution must be taken when interpreting the findings. Evaluation of Option 2 Option 2 provides brief and intensive interventions for families where social workers have identified a risk that a child may eit her enter care or be placed on the Child Protection Register. The programme is based on the Homebuilders model (from the US) and is designed for families in which there is known parental substance misuse. The intervention is short (4-6 weeks) and in tensive. Workers are available 24 hours a day and use a combination of techniques including motivation al interviewing, solution-focused counselling and other ther apeutic and practical interventions. The evaluation focused on impacts rather than pr ocesses and benefited from the use of a 'broadly valid' comparison group and a long follow-up period (3.5 years). To assess impact, children accepted by the Option 2 service between 2000 and 2006 (including 16% who did not receive the service) were compared with children who were referred but not accepted as the servic e was full (the comparison group). While Option 2 did not reduce the proportion of ch ildren who entered care, it was found to significantly reduce the time children spent in care. Furthermore, cost analyses demonstrated that Option 2, on average, sa ved the local authority in one area more than \u00a31,000 per child. While the evaluation is relatively strong in its design, it is weakened by several factors including the unmatched nature of the comparison group, the lack of knowledge about what services the comparison group received, and the failure to measure impact on a wider array of measures (e.g. substance misuse, offending, education, health). Evaluation of the ESF Peer Mentoring Programme The Peer Mentoring Programme is a national scheme funded by the European Structural Fund (ESF) covering all ESF co nvergence and competitiveness areas in Wales. It is implemented by six providers ac ross nine sites. The project aims to give substance misusers a pathway out of a s ubstance misuse lifestyle, by providing mentoring support to enter em ployment, gain qualificati ons, enter further learning and achieve other positive outcomes. The evaluation of the programme is ongoing and includes both a process and an impact evaluation. The unusually lengthy evaluation was commissioned in August 2010 fo r a three and a half-year period. To date, no reports have been pub lished from which information about research design and results can be extracted. However, fr om our own knowledge of the evaluation 130 we know that it will examine the impact of the programme on a range of outcome measures using both quantitative and qua litative methods. To ensure that effectiveness is measured robustly, it would be useful for the evaluation to include a comparison group so that any programme effects can be clearly identified. Informing and modernising care in a s ubstance misuse treatment community (Evaluation of the PARIS system) In June 2010, the WG commissioned an evaluation of the impact of a new client record capture system (PARIS) in Swansea. The research examined the implications of the PARIS system for the deliv ery, management, commissioning and effectiveness of substance use treatment services. The PARIS system was launched in the Swansea SMAT commissioning area in September 2010. The aim was to establish a single comprehensive a ssessment and case management system, enhance information sharing between agenc ies, and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery to improve the quality and volume of treatment provision. Statistical a nalyses comparing pre and post- PARIS data for the client sample showed that the number of organisations and individuals that clients engaged with increased post-PARIS. It also showed that the number of interactions with agencies was higher among the post-PAR IS group than the pre-PARIS group. The results of this evaluati on point to substantial improvements in service provision post-PARIS. However, the s hort follow-up period and the lack of information about the selection of the detailed case studies (which formed t he basis of the evaluation) means that the longer-term impact of the system across the full range of clients is not known. Guidance to reduce unplanned drop out fr om, and promote re-engagement with, substance misuse treatment services As part of the 2008 strategy the WG co mmissioned the National Public Health Service for Wales to investigate the range of factors that influence unplanned drop- out from, and re-engagement with, substance misuse treatment services in Wales. The project is therefore unlik e most of the other studies reviewed in this section in that it did not evaluate a particular interv ention or system. Rat her, it investigated a particular problem common to all substance mi suse services. To identify the relevant factors that influence retention in treatm ent, a cross-sectional survey design was used and postal questionnaires were distributed to 78 substance misuse services in Wales that routinely submi tted data to the WNDSM. In addition, a structured mixed- method questionnaire was completed by 559 current and ex-service users from across Wales who had experienced unplanned dr op-out from services in the last two years. A myriad of factors were found to be related to early departures from treatment including issues relating to operational practice, resources, service design, and the culture of substance misuse serv ices and their commissioning bodies. While the sample sizes used in this study are fairly large, the opportunistic sampling strategy employed to recruit current and ex -service users may mean that the sample is not entirely representative of the whole population of tr eatment drop-outs. Nevertheless, it is useful that the researchers desi gned a sampling framework which would ensure that both pr imary drug and primary alcohol users were equally represented in the sample. 131 The Nature and Scope of Benzodiazepine and 'z' Drug Prescribing in Wales In December 2009 the WG commissioned t he Welsh Medicines Partnership (WMP) to investigate the prescribing of benzodiaz epine and 'z' drugs in Wales. The need for this study emerged out of growing concerns regarding the high volume of anxiolytic and hypnotic prescribing in Wales and the subsequent call for a reduction of such prescribing in the 2008 substance misuse st rategy. The study was conducted in four phases. In Phase 1 raw prescribing data was analysed to identify changes in prescribing practices between 04/05 and 08/09. In Phase 2 comparisons were made with data from England. In Phase 3 areas of good practice were identified through interviews with Heads of Pharmacy and Medicines Management in each of the 22 Local Health Boards. In Phase 4 anal yses of demographic data were undertaken. The results showed that over the study period rates of benzodiazepine prescribing did not increase in any of the LHBs and ac tually decreased in many areas (ranging from a decrease of 3% to 46% ). However, rates of 'z' drug prescribing increased in eight of the LHBs (ranging from an increas e of 1% to 20%). The study also found that hypnotics and anxiolytics are prescr ibed more frequently in Wales than in England, even when compared with a demographi cally equivalent ar ea in the North East of England. The study is comp rehensive and detailed and appears to be a useful source of data on prescr ibing practices in Wales. A Scoping Exercise to Identify the Requi rements for, and Current Provision of, Counselling across Substance Misuse Services in Wales Over the last twenty years support has grown for the use of evidence-based structured counselling in the substance mi suse field. This scoping exercise was commissioned by the WG to help inform the expansion of counselling services in Wales that was called for in the 2008 strat egy. The research aimed to investigate a range of issues including what counselling se rvices are currently being delivered in Wales, who delivers them, where they ar e delivered, as well as the need for and effectiveness of them. Qua litative, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 16 commissioners (80% respons e rate) and 65 providers of services (100% response rate). The results show ed that there is a lack of structured counselling provision in substance misuse services across Wales, leading to long waiting lists and clients not receiving referrals to appropriate interventions. Furthermore, problems with evaluating the effectiveness of these services were identified as no single outco me measure was found to be used consistently across them. Overall, on the basis of fairly comprehensive qualitative data, the study demonstrated a clear need for structured couns elling in substance misuse services in Wales. Annual Report of the Systematic Review of Drug Related Deaths in Wales 2010 In 2005 the WG published guidance on developi ng local confidential reviews into drug-related deaths. Since then, four panel s, comprising addiction specialists, clinicians and treatment providers, have been developed and they now meet regularly to analyse drug-related deaths. This report examines drug-related deaths from 2010 and compares them with deaths from 2008 and 2009 (inclusive). The data were collected from a random sample of post-inquest files and from questionnaires distributed to treatment pr oviders thought to have had contact with the deceased. The report provides information on key demographic themes, geographical distribution, substance of harm, treatm ent issues, co-occurring substance misuse and mental health, first aid, prison rel ease and near fatal poisonings attending 132 emergency care settings. While it is l audable that the annual report of the drug- related death panel has been put in the public domain, it is disappointing that the report presents only limited information. Firs t, it is unclear why data from 2010 (a one-year period) have been compared with dat a from 2008-2009 (a two-year period). Second, while it is stated that 114 cases were reviewed in relation to 2008 to 2009, it is unclear how many were from 2008 and how many from 2009. Any changes may therefore be related more to one year than the other. Thir d, only limited information on sampling is provided. For example, it is not known whether the sample was selected randomly by year or randomly from across all years. Last, the report is weak in its presentation of resu lts. The lack of charts and tables makes it difficult for the reader to note any changes over time. Given that the need to reduce drug- related deaths is a priority listed in the st rategy, it is important that high quality information about such deaths is used to monitor the nature of the problem and guide future developments to tackle the problem. Evaluation of the CRAFT Pilot Project Community Reinforcement and Family Tr aining (CRAFT) is a programme designed for families and carers (Concerned Significant Others, CSOs) of substance misusers (loved ones). The programme has three main aims: (1) to help the CSO to improve the quality of their own lives, (2) to mi nimise the loved ones' consumption of substances, and (3) to encourage the loved ones into treatment. A CRAFT service has been operating in Cardiff since 2007 wh en it was funded as part of the Drug Interventions Programme. In July 2008 the programme moved under the management of the Cardiff Alcohol and Dr ug Team (CADT) and became funded by the WG. Subsequently, in 2010 the WG commissioned a process and outcome evaluation of the CRAFT programme to be completed over a short three-month period (January to March 2010). The evaluation team note that 'the data collection necessary to support a robust outcome evaluation had not been planned for at the start of the CRAFT project' (p. 17). The impact of the CRAFT programme was therefore measured in a lar gely qualitative way using feedback forms completed by CSOs and interviews with therapists and a small number of CSOs (n=7). The research found that CRAFT has a range of positive effects on the psychological health and well-being of the CSO. In terms of impact on loved ones' substance misuse, just under two-thirds of partici pating CSOs reported a reduction in their loved one's substance misuse. However, the role of CRAFT in achieving this reduction is difficult to measure given that three-quarters of those who experienced a reduction were already in treatment when contact with CRAFT wa s made. Overall, this study provides only weak evidence of the effectiveness of CRAFT in achieving its aims. A Pilot Study of Alcohol Policy and Social Norms in Welsh Universities In recent years, particularly in the US, t here has been increasing interest in the social norm approach to reduce drinking among students. The approach is based on the assumption that students are influenced by t heir perception of what their peers are doing (e.g. drinking large quantities of al cohol). In reality, however, these perceptions are often wrong. The social norms approach therefore aims to correct inaccurate perceptions and thereby influence behaviour. The pilot study used a cluster randomised control trial whereby first year students living in halls of residence in four Welsh Universities were randomly selected to receive the social norms materials (e.g. drinking mats, posters and mi rror stickers). Students were asked to 133 complete an anonymous web-based or paper questionnaire describing their alcohol consumption and related cons equences and were offered entry into a \u00a3100 prize draw as an incentive for participation. T he results of this study have not yet been published and it is therefore not possible to comment on them here. However, if the study is to measure impact re liably, it will need to be careful to ensure that materials given to the experimental group are not l eaked to the comparison group thereby confounding any programme effect s. Of note is the fact that there is some doubt about who funded this study. Do cumentation on the internet suggests that the study is funded by Alcohol Research UK. Co mmunication with the Substance Misuse division at the WG suggests that the study is funded by the WG. Perhaps it is a combination of the two. Evaluation of the Strengt hening Families Programme The Strengthening Families Programme aims to prevent young people from using drugs or alcohol by strengt hening the protective factor s and reducing the risk factors associated with substance misuse. The SFP has been operating in Cardiff since 2005 and is managed by Cardiff Alcohol and Drugs Team. The programme includes seven weekly sessions covering a range of issues including family functioning, strengthening parental skills and helping young people to learn how to resist peer pressure. The SFP was evaluated in 2008 and is now in the process of being evaluated again. Full details of the evaluat ion are not in the public domain, but the WG website does state that t he SFP is currently participat ing in a randomised control trial funded by the National Prevention Resear ch Initiative. The trial will examine the long term public health benefits of the St rengthening Families Programme in relation to preventing alcohol, tobacco and drug use and anti-social behaviour in young people. To what extent the WG are invo lved in funding the study is unclear. Evaluation of Alcohol Brief Interventions Alcohol Brief Intervention (ABI) is a short (around five minutes) structured conversation about alcohol consumption with pat ients. The aim of the intervention is to motivate and support the individual to think about reducing their alcohol consumption. Evidence suggests that ABI is most effective when used in primary care settings and in trauma settings when de livered by nurses. However, if ABI is only delivered in such settings then a large proportion of those who are drinking at harmful levels will not be reached. As a re sult, Public Health Wales has developed a training model for all 'Allied Health and Social Care professionals' to provide ABI more widely. We understand from colleagues in Public Health Wale s that the current roll-out of the ABI is in t he process of being evaluated. No further details are known about the evaluation at this time. National Overdose Study As part of the WG's commitment to reduc e drug-related death (as stated in the 2008 strategy), the WG have recently funded rese archers to conduct a national survey to find out the proportion of injecting opiate us ers who overdose in any year. The aim is is to generate a national estimate of the sc ale of the problem, with the view of taking action if necessary to reduce harm and save lives. The survey will run during the month of September 2012 and will invo lve drug workers in all agency needle exchange programmes collecting information on client overdose. The information will be collected using a single-page questi onnaire containing eight questions that will take no more than one minute to complete. It is hoped that this method will 134 ensure a high response rate and therefore generate reliable results. The survey will also include a qualitative component, whereby clients who completed the questionnaire will be asked if they are willing to speak to a member of the research team in more detail about ov erdose events. On the face of it, this study appears to have been designed in such a way to enable a national estimate to be generated. However, the usefulness of this study hi nges on it achieving a high enough response rate. 135 "}
