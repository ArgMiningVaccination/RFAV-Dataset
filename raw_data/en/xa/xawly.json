Here's a list of 20+ gifts made with sustainable and natural materials.", "sitename": "Grazed & Enthused", "date": "2019-11-24", "cleaned_text": "Looking for eco-friendly, non-toxic gift for babies and children? Here's a list of 35+ gifts I've vetted as an occupational therapist and mom of two! I don't have much self control around the holidays when it comes to gifting my children. If I see a toy I know would inspire wonder, creativity and fun, I want to buy it for them! I have to reel myself in though because there's such a thing as too many toys. Instead I put on my occupational therapist goggles and really give the toy a good objective look. I created a list of 20+ toys that use non-toxic, sustainable materials while providing creative play, gross and fine motor advancement and a whole lot of fun! My Eco-Friendly Baby & Kids Toy Guide had to meet three standards: ONE: Are the toys made with responsible, ethically-sourced or natural materials? TWO: Are the toys open-ended? Can they be explored in multiple ways by a child? THREE: Will the toys stand the test of time? Both from a child's interest in them and from a quality standpoint. Materials to look for in baby/kids toys: Wood (solid wood is best), Non-Toxic Water-Based Paints, Recycled Materials, Silicone, Phthalate-Free, Low VOC Types of toys I avoid: Screens (they get enough of those elsewhere!), Light-Up/Talking Toys (sensory overload, very close-ended, don't allow for imaginative play), Plastic (unless made with recycled materials), toys painted without water-based non-toxic paint (these can be alarmingly high in lead) Enjoy this mix of high-quality but affordable eco-friendly, non-toxic baby and kids gifts anywhere from newborn to 6 months to 3 years and up! [Lily & River Little Climber](https://rstyle.me/+IOMeBi10T0N_snHQHFTjwQ) 6 months to 3 years + 15% OFF THROUGH 11/24! This gross motor climbing structure is made of beautiful solid wood, fits any decor and can be used by babies 6 months+ to over 3 years of age. The first day we had it in our living room, my 6-month-old (at the time) pulled to stand and started cruising! Now she's practicing climbing up the rungs while my 3-year-old uses it more for imaginative play. Throw a blanket over it and you get an instant fort. The paint in non-toxic and it was simple to build and arrived quickly from the Etsy shop owner. [Lily & River Little Creator Smart Activity Table](https://rstyle.me/+d0c1AwYDStgbZMlG39Na_Q) 15 months+ Birch hardwood, zero VOC non-toxic paint and a wickedly smart design. You receive the activity table (with a Lego mat for building on the tabletop - genius!), two child-size chairs to promote independent play, and it can be drawn on (and erased) with dry erase markers for endless fun. Children need their own safe space to create - this is it - and perfect if you're short on room at home! [Montessori Wooden Sensory Bin Toolkit](https://rstyle.me/+1nWSXC5Esdc01E0JrupkzA) 15 months + Montessori-style learning promotes the use of tools made from natural materials like these wooden bowls, scoops, tongs and cups. Fill up a large bin with beans, rice or even sand and let kids explore! We use sensory bins for nearly every child in occupational therapy as it provides a creative atmosphere for kids to explore imaginative play, sensorial introductions, measuring, fine motor and grasp. [All Seasons Kids Wooden Dollhouse](https://amzn.to/2OrQB3H) - $80 off now - 3 years+ (small parts) This is the dollhouse I purchased for my 3-year-old this year as her \"big gift\". We've been using and loving Hape toys since she was a newborn, and I can't wait for her to play with this 3-story, unique and detailed dollhouse. Each little piece and the house are made with solid wood and painted with non-toxic water-based paint. Seriously, the details are incredible and this is an awesome price for a nearly fully furnished dollhouse! Dollhouses aren't just for little girls - boys love to play \"make believe\" with them too and imaginative play is a healthy way for children to work out real life conflicts. [The Play Gym by Lovevery Baby](https://amzn.to/2XoF74Z) Newborn to 12 months My sister just got this for her soon-to-be born baby boy, and from a therapy standpoint I am very impressed.

[Cuddle & Kind Handcrafted Dolls](https://cuddleandkind.com/) Newborn+ My friend gifted us this adorable matching dolls when I had my second daughter earlier this year. Every doll purchased provides 10 meals to a hungry and malnourished child globally (most of their work is done in Africa). Fair trade and handcrafted, these are one of the loveliest and kindest gifts you could give to a child who has it all and a great way to teach them about helping others. [Personalized Cotton Kids Apron & Oven Mitts](https://rstyle.me/+93U28TkqLOdO-OkKR2-6Ew) 4 years+ These little cotton matching apron and oven mitts for tiny kitchen helpers are cute, functional and encourage kids to get in the kitchen!

Each egg makes a unique sound when you shake it and has so many uses for 3 months to 3 years+. My youngest practices grasping, shaking and sound exploration while my oldest uses them as a musical instrument while we dance around listening to Pandora in our living room. What a cute stocking stuffer for a family with multiple kids too! [Wooden Sound Discovery Musical Blocks ](https://amzn.to/33YuVmh)6 months+ to 3 years+ We also love these, if you're looking for more sound-making manipulatives.

These Honeystick Crayons have a nice chunky body for easy grasp for toddlers 12 months and up! [AromaDough Gluten & Soy-Free Playdough Christmas Scents](https://amzn.to/2QNzhIW) One of the biggest hits under our tree last year - gluten and soy free playdough with some interesting scents for sensory exploration! My only complaint is they dried out after 9 months, but I've found that to be the case with all playdoughs outside of the actual Playdough brand (which we avoid because of the wheat flour, preservatives and colorings in it).

[Peter Rabbit Touch & Feel Board Book](https://amzn.to/35ibKDV) This is one of our favorite books that both my kids enjoy reading at the same time. The baby likes the sensory aspect while my oldest enjoys the colorful large illustrations. I wouldn't really call it eco-friendly since it's a board book but I had to put it on the list! It doesn't tell the whole tale of Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit but perfect for young readers/explorers.

[Leather & Suede Handmade Moccasins](https://rstyle.me/+MCZm9TMvX2Qlr11zMxwUQw) Newborn to 4 years When my eldest was learning how to walk, we didn't want to stick her in heavy rubber-soled shoes. She wouldn't be able to feel the ground beneath her and that sensory input is important for balance. Natural material handmade moccasins are the perfect first shoe for new walkers. [Big City Architecture Block Set](https://rstyle.me/+t6eacduyeDEB31Xn6lrQrw) 3 years+ How much fun is to be had with this architecture-inspired building block set? Answer: infinite amounts.
