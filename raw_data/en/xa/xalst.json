Cell Host Microbe ; 30(3): 388-399.e3, of 2 pools of experimentally defined [SARS-CoV-2]T [cell] [epitopes]that, in combination with spike, were used to discriminate 4 groups of subjects with different SARS-CoV-2 infection and [COVID-19 vaccine]status. The overall T [cell]-based [classification]accuracy was 89.2% and 88.5% in the experimental and validation cohorts. This scheme was applicable to different [mRNA vaccines]and different lengths of [time]post [infection]/post [vaccination]and yielded increased compared to serological readouts. T [cell]responses from [breakthrough infections]were also studied and effectively segregated from [vaccine]responses, with a combined performance of 86.6% across all 239 subjects from the 5 groups. We anticipate that a T [cell]-based immunodiagnostic scheme to classify subjects based on their [vaccination]and natural [infection] [history] [will]be an important tool for [vaccinations]and for establishing [SARS-CoV-2]correlates of [protection].
