Background 1. The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) last considered maternal diet and nutrition in relation to offspring health in its reports on 'The influence of maternal, fetal and child nutrition on the development of chronic disease in later life' (SACN, 2011a) and on 'Feeding in the first year of life' (SACN, 2018). In the latter report, the impact of breastfeeding on maternal health was also considered. In 2019, SACN agreed to conduct a risk assessment on nutrition and maternal health focusing on maternal outcomes during pregnancy, childbirth and up to 24 months after delivery. 2. SACN agreed that, where appropriate, other expert Committees would be consulted and asked to complete relevant risk assessments e.g. in the area of food safety advice. A provisional list of chemicals was proposed by SACN Members; however, this was subject to change following discussion by COT. A scoping paper was presented to the Committee (TOX/2020/45) to define the scope of the work from the toxicological safety perspective and also requesting their input on the selection of candidate chemicals or chemical classes that could be added or removed. 3. As part of this work, the Committee thought it would be useful to consider the use of dietary supplements during pregnancy. A discussion paper (TOX/2020/ 51) was presented reviewing the commonly used dietary supplements used during pregnancy. These were supplements that are not officially recommended by relevant authorities, but which are promoted by anecdotal evidence and unofficial sources as having various purported benefits. 4. The review was confined to herbal dietary supplements which would be regulated under food law and which would not be considered to be traditional herbal medicines which are the responsibility of the Medicines and Hea lthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Following this review , the COT suggested ginger required further investigation, noting that both human and animal in vitro and in vivo data were available. Main areas of concern were general toxicity to the mother, effects on the development of the fetus or embryo, and possible interactions with drugs. Introduction 5. Ginger ( Zingiber officinale) is a flowering tropical plant originating in Southeast Asia and grown in warm climates including China, India, Africa and the Caribbean. This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 2 The rhizome (underground stem) of the ginger plant is commonly used as a spice and flavouring in many countries around the world and is increasingly growing in popularity as a natural remedy due to its purported immune system -boosting properties and also for motion sickness and post -operative nausea and vomiting. 6. Ginger supplements are regarded as a \"safe\" by people looking for a natural alternative to natural alternative for the relief of morning sickness. Some adverse effects have been reported however, few specific safety studies specifically have been carried out in this area. Despite its extensive use among pregnant women, there is limited information on the safety of its use. 7. In the current paper, a literature search was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed and Science Direct databases to identify studies detailing the use of ginger during pregnancy, using searc h terms including 'ginger supplement', 'ginger and pregnancy', and 'ginger and safety'. The search was centred on papers published between 2010 and 2020. Information was taken from the EMA's review of ginger and recently published reviews of ginger use dur ing pregnancy. 8. Many of the studies found were centred on the efficacy of ginger as a remedy for post -operative, chemotherapy and pregnancy associated nausea and vomiting and few discussed safety aspects of ginger use during pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes. 9. There are currently no health- based guidance values (HBGV) with respect to ginger or its main components. Exposure to ginger was considered based on information found on supplement and tincture composition and background diet, but the variability of available supplements means exposure will also vary. Uses 10. Ginger is commonly consumed in fresh root form, dried root powder, capsule (encapsulated dried powder) form, liquid extract, preserved in syrup or sugar and as a tea. Ginger is a common traditional treatment for prophylaxis of motion sickness, Digestive disorders, upset stomach and nausea 1. In pregnancy it is most used in the treatment of pregnancy -related nausea (NHS). It has also been used as a dietary supplement and a traditional remedy in many cultures2. Ginger is included in the official pharmacopoeias of several western countries. Constituents 11. The ginger rhizome contains two main classes of constituents: the essential oils responsible for the aroma, and the main pungent principles , gingerols is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 3 shogaols. Organic acids are also present in smaller amounts. Depending on area of cultivation , gingerols make up 4- 7.5% of the pungent principles, the main one being 6-gingerol. Gingerols of other chain lengths are also present in smaller amounts. 12. Over 100 compounds have been identified, most of them being terpenoids mainly amounts of the main principles and r elative concentrations of gingerol to shogaol differ according to preparation and processing. 6, 8 and 10- Gingerol 6- Gingerol 8- Gingerol 10-Gingerol 6-Shogaol 6- Shogaol Essential oils 13. The major components of essential oils found in ginger include camphene, sabinene, -curcumene, zingiberene, -farnesene, -sesquiphellandrene and geranial. The ginger include included citric, malic, oxalic, succinic, and tartaric acids . Animal mo dels suggest one of the major components of ginger - 6-gingerol - is eliminated partially i n the liver (Naora et al. , 1992). Toxicit y 14. Ginger is classified as 'Generally R ecognised as Safe' (GRAS) by the FDA however few specific studies have been carried out to evaluate the safety of ginger use during pregnancy and lactation. Recently, the Finnish Food Authority has issued a recommendation against the use of products containing ginger concentrate or extract, ginger tea and food supplements containing ginger by pregnant and breastfeeding women, infants and toddlers, schoolchildren, elderly and individuals with weakened immunity 3. It was noted that the concentrates contained harmful 3 https://www.ruokavirasto.fi/globalassets/henkiloasiakkaat/tietoa-elintarvikkeista/turvallisen -kayton - ohjeet/18.10.ruokavirasto- taulukko1eng_saavutettava.pdf This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 4 substanc es and safe consumption levels we re unknown. In 2008, the Danish company Ferrosan A/S withdrew their product GraviFrisk - a product containing 6 g of dried ground ginger - from market, due to concerns surrounding the lack of safety data with respect to the use of supplements containing highly concentrated ginger extracts by pregnant women (Dietz et al., 2016) . 15. Ginger has been reported to cause heartburn (Vutyavanich et al ., 2001, Chittumma et al., 2007 abstract only), exacerbate lower gastrointestinal tract conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and duodenal ulcer, hypotension and there is a theoretical possibility of cardiac arrhythmias associated with ginger use (Tiran 2012). Very large doses of 6 g are reported to possibly lead to gastric irritation and loss of protective gastric mucosa (Supu et al ., 2018). Health based guidance values 16. There are currently no health- based guidance values (HBGV) with respect to ginger use during pregnancy and no consensus on the safe dosage of ginger. The UK Teratology Information Service (UKTIS) have concluded that while exposure to ginger would not usually be regarded as grounds for termination or additional monitoring during pregnancy, other factors could affect the overall risk outcome and this is something that would take place on an individual basis 4. Toxicity studies Cytotoxicity 17. The c ytotoxicity of ginger has been investigated with varied results. Plengsuriyakarn et al. examined cytotoxicity in Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cell line 6 (CL-6), hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) and normal human renal epithelium (HRE) AM release and Hoechst 33342 assays . Median inhibitory concentration, (IC 50) and value for cytotoxici ty of the crude ethanolic extract of ginger were 10.95 and 53.15, g/ml respectively . 18. Zaeoung et al. (2005) reported that the IC 50 of ginger was higher than 39.2 \u00b5g/ml against breast (MCF7) and colon (LS174T) cell lines. Abudayyak et al. found the aqueou s and methanol extracts of ginger exhibited no cytotoxic activity when assessed using an MTT test in rat kidney , NRK- 52E cell line. The chloroform extract resulted in value of 9.08 mg/mL (2015). 4 https://www.medicinesinpregnancy.org/bumps/monographs/USE -OF-GINGER -IN-PREGNANCY/ This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 5 Mutagenicity 19. Nakamura & Yamamoto ( 1982) found that the juice of ginger rhizome possessed both mutagenic and anti -mutagenic properties, and that 6- gingerol in particular was a powerful mutagen. The group also demonstrated that 6- shogaol was much less mutagenic (strain H s30 of Escherichia coli) than 6- gingerol (Nakamura & Yamamoto 1983) . In a Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation (Ames) assay, t he urine of rats fed diets containing 0.5, 1 and 5% powdered ginger for 1 month and exposed to benzo(a)pyrene was found to display a significant reduction in the mutagenicity as indicated by a reduced number of TA98 and TA100 revertants at all ginger concentrations ( Nirmala et al. 2007) when tested in an Ames assay. 20. In another Ames assay , an ethanol extract of ginger ( Soudamini et al. 1995) and an essential oil from ginger ( Sivaswami et al. 1991) demonstrated mutagenic activity in S. typhimurium strains TA 100 and TA 1535 at concentrations of 25- 50 mg/plate and 5- 10 mg/plate, respectively. Similarly, an ethanolic ginger extract at concentrations between 10 and 200 g/plate, and gingerol and shogaol were mutagenic in strains TA 100 and TA 1838 with metabolic activation by rat liver S9 fraction, while zingerone did not display mutagenic effects ( Nagabhushan et al. 1987) . 21. Abudayyak et al. found the aqueous ginger extract exhibited mutagenic activity when assessed using the Ames assay on S. typhimurium TA98 ( -S9) strains. no activity was observed in the chloroform and methanol extracts (2015) . Animal studies Acute toxicity 22. An acute toxicity study carried out by Malik and Sharma on male Wistar rats showed no signs of toxicity or mortality (2011) . The animals were administered doses of 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg by gastric gavage. The authors stated that t he three dose levels used i n the study corresponded to 5, 10 and 20% of the NOAEL of the lyophilised ginger powder (5000 mg/kg) . 23. Plengsuriyakarn et al. also examined acute and subacute toxicity in hamsters. Sixty hamsters (nine groups of 5 male and 5 female) were fed either 1000, 3000 or 5000 mg/kg bw ethanolic ginger extract, resuspended in a distilled water -Tween- 80, mixture 4:1, v:v, by oral gavage and observed for 14 days (acute toxicity) or 30 days (subacute toxicity) . The group concluded an absence of any toxicity at maximum dose of 5 g/kg bw during the investigation period. Short term repeat dose studies This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 6 24. Rong et al. (2009) evaluated the safety of powdered Japanese ginger (mainly containing 6- gingerol galanolactone and 6- shogaol) by conducting a 35- day toxicity study in rats. Both male and female rats were treated with 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg bw/day by gavage. The results demonstrated that oral administration of up to 2000 mg/kg to male and female rats did not result in any increase in mortality, or changes to behaviour, growth, the general condition of the animal s (including: changes in skin, fur, eyes, and mucous membranes, occurrence of secreti ons, excretions and autonomic activity), food and water consumption. It was only at the highest dose tested (2000 mg/kg), that ginger led to slightly reduced absolute and relative weights of testes (by 14.4% and 11.5%, respectively). No effects were apparent in the females. 25. The effect of oral and intraperitoneal administration of aqueous extracts of ginger root over 28 days in female rats at two dose levels (50 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg) was examined for haematological, serum and systemic toxicity (Alnaqeeb et al. 2003). Neither oral nor intraperitoneal administration resulted in mortality. Orally administered aqueous ginger extract resulted in increased levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and decreased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). 26. Jeena et al., conducted a sub chronic toxicity study of the essential oil of ginger in Wistar rats following oral administration at concentrations of 100, 250, and 500 mg/kg per day once daily for 13 consecutive weeks to assess the oral safety of ginger oil (2011). No mortality was observed. No unusual changes in behaviour or locomotor activity was observed during the period of the study , nor were any abnormal changes observed in the relative organ weights of liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, brain, and stomach with respect to body weight in ginger oil -treated animals when compared to vehicle control animals. 27. An increase in serum sodium levels was observed in male rats treated with 500 mg/kg per day but in the absence of changes in sodium levels in f emales, this change was not considered significant. A slight increase in total bilirubin was observed in female rats treated with ginger oil along with a decrease in AST and ALT levels however, ther e was no significant changes in hepatic function parameter s such as alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, and globulin content. Reproductive and developmental toxicity 28. Reproductive and developmental toxicity has also been investigated in rat studies. In a study by Wilkinson (2000) , three groups of pregnant Sprague- Dawley rats were administered either a control (unspecified), or 20 g/L or 50 g/L ginger tea - prepared by the infusion of grated ginger in water via their drinking water - during days 6 to 15. No further details were provided regarding specific compounds of interest. While no maternal toxicity was observed, embryonic loss in the treated groups was found to be double that of the controls. Exposed foetuses were found to be significantly heavier than controls and showed no gross structural malformations. This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 7 The results of this study suggest that in utero exposure to ginger tea results in early embryonic loss and increased growth in surviving foetuses. 29. Hosseini et al. investigated the effect of ethanolic ginger extract on serum testosterone, LH and FSH as well effect on spermatogenic cell lines in male mature offspring rats (2015, abstract only). In this study, 72 female rats, sorted into 9 groups were orally administered of alcoholic extract of ginger at doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg bw, during their neonatal and perinatal periods versus saline as a control. Following puberty, LH, FSH, cell numbers of Sertoli, spermatogonia, spermatocyte and spermatids were counted in 8 male rat offspring from each group. Ginger was found to significantly increase testosterone levels and the number of spermatogenic cells and at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg bw, alcoholic extract of Ginger significantly reduced the FSH and LH compared to control groups. The authors concluded that \"the oral consumption of Ginger during pregnancy and lactation dose- dependently increase the level of testosterone and of spermatogenic cells.\" 30. The teratogenicity of EV.EXT 33, patented officinale extract (comprising 6- gingerol, 8- gingerol, 10- gingerol, 6- shogaol, and 8- shogaol, which made up 1.9 w/w of the extract ) was investigated i n Wistar rats, (Weidner & Sigwart , 2001) . The extracts were administered orally by gastric intubation at concentrations of 100, 333 and 1000 mg/kg, to three groups of pregnant rats from days 6 to 15 of gestation. Their bodyweight, food and water monitored during the treatment period. The study concluded that treatment with EV.EXT 33 during the period of organogenesis res ulted in neither maternal nor developmental toxicity at daily doses of up to 1000 mg/kg bw. 31. Dissabandara & Chandrasekara (2007) also examined the effect of powdered ginger extract administered prenatally on the postnatal development of rats. A period of administration of the dry powdered extract orally at doses of 500 mg/kg/day or 1000 mg/kg/day (control not specified) during days 5 to 15 of gestation resulted in a lower intake of food and water and lower weight gain in the ginger treated group, suggesting that maternal administration of ginger during mid pregnancy result ed in reduced maternal weight gain and increased embryonic loss without affecting the postnatal growth and physical maturation of the surviving offspring. 32. ElMazoudy and Attia (2018) investigated the effect of powdered dried ginger root on the oestrus cycle and implantation in female mice. ICR mice, orally dosed at 250, 500, 1000, or 2000 mg/kg bw/d aqueous ginger extract. These were investigated in four different experiments: the main study of outcomes ( treatment for 90 days and throughout mating and gestation), a 35- day treatment study evaluating effects on the oestrous cycle. The third and fourth intended antifertility and abortifacient loss (20 days treatment) . In the main study, the dams were sacrificed on gestation day 20. One mortality was recorded in the 100mg/kg bw/d group on gestation day 18 and two mortalities in the 2000 mg/kg bw /d group at day 16. There was also a significant reduction in body weight change in these two dose groups compared to the control group; however, food consumption was comparable. This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 8 33. In the study investigating the oestrus cycle, a significant reduction in the numbers of oestrus cycles was observed at the highest dose group, with the length of the oestrus cycle in this group being significantly prolonged (10.05 \u00b10.8) days compared with (4.99 \u00b1 0.5) days recurrent and successive oestrous cycles in control mice. At the highest dose level, the length oestrous cycle was prolonged with a significant decrease in the duration of diestrous -metestrus (luteal) phase and prolonged proestrus -estrus (ovulatory) phase. In the study investigating pre- implantation loss, a significant decrease in the number of corpora lutea was observed at the highest dose group. Implantation failure was also increased by 36% compared to the control group and pre- implantation loss at this dose group was also 16.59 % higher than the control group. The authors considered that this may reflect a dose- depend antifertility (anti-implantation) effect . 34. Regarding fertility and developmental outcomes, the female copulation index was significantly r educed at 2000 and 1000 mg/kg bw/d groups, whereas the female pregnancy index was significantly decreased only at the highest dose. The number of implantation sites and live fetuses in the 2000 mg/kg bw/d group were lower than the other treated and control groups. An increase in fetal resorption and post implantation loss was also seen at the highest dose group. There was no evidence of fetal malformations however growth retardation, reduced pup weight and delay in the crown -rump length was observed at this dose group as well. Finally, changes in ovarian histopathology were observed at 2000 mg/kg bw/d, following 90 days of treatment . Ovarian follicle atresia was observed. The atretic follicles contained cell debris and there was haemorrhage in the antral cavity. 35. Additionally, degenerated primordial follicles with pyknotic nuclei forming polycystic ovaries were noted. Deteriorated follicles were observed as a detaching of layers of granulosa cells from the basal membrane by dilation of zona pellucida and with evidence of apoptosis in damaged ova follicular nuclei were non- visible. The authors considered the above observations as evidence that ginger possesses anti- ovulation properties. Overall, the authors concluded that ginger impairs the normal growth of corpus luteum because of progesterone insufficiency during early pregnanc y and that the results suggested that ginger can disrupt the oestrous cycle and blastocyst implantation without teratogenesis. They considered the highest NOAEL to be 500 mg/ kg bw. Human studies - exposures in pregnancy 36. In their 2003 review of interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy, Jewell and Young concluded that ginger shows no evidence of teratogenicity in infants (Jewell and Young, 2003) . More recently, Stanisiere et al. (2018) c onducted a review of the safety and efficacy of ginger rhizome for decreasing nausea and vomiting in women during early pregnancy. This review was based on systematic literature searches until the end of December 2017. Most of the studies included in this review have already been included in the current paper. This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 9 Some recent studies have been conducted evaluating the effectiveness and safety of ginger in pregnancy, and these will be discussed in detail. Overall, most studies reported gastrointestinal effects such as abdominal discomfort, vomiting and diarrhoea. Other effects included dizziness, headaches and drowsiness with some more ser ious effects such as spontaneous abortion al so being reported in 5 out of the 14 randomized clinical studies. The review focuses on the reported effects rather than statistical significance, therefore more details on studies reporting more serious effects are given below. 37. In a double -blind randomised crossover trial, 27 women were administered capsules containing either 250 mg ginger in powdered root form or 250 mg lactose as a placebo, four times per day, for four days followed by a wash out period of 2 days prior to a further 4 days administration of ginger or placebo ( Fischer - Rasmussen et al., 1990 ). Two subjects did not carry to term: One subject from the ginger group had a spontaneous abortion, one elected. Of the remaining 25 subjects, no adverse effects were observed. 38. Of the available human studies, few explicitly addressed the safety of ginger consumption during pregnancy, most being incidental to other studies. In a double-blind study by Vutyavanich et al . (2001), 32 women were given 1 g of dried ginger in capsule for m for 4 days. Of those in the ginger group, one spontaneous abortion was reported compared to 3 in the placebo group. Equally, for delivery by caesarean section, there was no difference between both groups. No congenital abnormalities were observed in all babies carried to term. The group concluded that there were no significant adverse effect s of ginger on pregnancy outcome. 39. An observational study in humans examined pregnant women who took ginger in their first trimester and compared them to women expose d to nonteratogenic drugs that were not antiemetic drugs. The results suggested that the ginger group did not have an increased rate of major malformations above the baseline rate of 1% -3% (Portnoi et al., 2003). Three major malformations were reported in the ginger group, ventricular septal defect (VSD), right lung abnormality, and kidney abnormality (pelviectasis) and one child was diagnosed with idiopathic central precocious puberty at age 2 years. The mother was reported to have taken 250 mg of ginger i n capsules four times a day from 11 to 20 weeks of gestation in addition to dimenhydrinate and doxylamine/vitamin B6 (Diclectin) during the first trimester of pregnancy. No significant difference between the two groups in terms of live births, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, therapeutic abortions, birth weight, or gestational age were reported, however the comparison group had more infants weighing less than 2500 g and the ginger group had 8 sets of twins. 40. Willet ts et al. examined the effect of ginger on pregnancy induced nausea (2003) . 120 women less than 20 weeks pregnant, were given 125 mg ginger extract (EV.EXT35; equivalent to 1.5 g of dried ginger) or a placebo four times per day for 4 days. Three spontaneous abortions were observed in the group r eceiving ginger compared to those in the placebo group. Whilst also examining the use of ginger in This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 10 the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, Smith et al . noted 3 spontaneous abortions in the group taking 1.05 g ginger compared to 9 abortions in the group taking 75 mg B6 daily for 3 weeks (2004) . 41. Ensiyeh et al, investigated the effectiveness of ginger versus B6 for treatment of NVP (2009) in women before 17 weeks' gestation. 70 women were randomised to receive either ginger at a dose of 1 g per day or B6 and 40 mg per day for 4 days. The ginger group reported 2 spontaneous abortions , compared to one in the B6 group. Of the babies brought to term, no congenital anomalies were observed, and all babies were discharged in good condition. Lactation 42. With respect to lactation, the focus of available studies has been on the effect of ginger on milk production and volume rather than safety and therefore , the effect of exposure during lactation has not been fully investigated. Ginger has reportedly been used as a galactagogue in Turkey and parts of Asia (Laxmay et al. , 2011, Kaygusuz et al. , 2021) , and has been demonstrated to possibly enhance milk production in women who had vaginal births ( Dilokthornsakul et al., 2021) , though the mechanism for this effect is unclear . Overall , ginger has not previously been considered a galactagogue for pregnant wo men. Effect on Cytochrome P450 Enzymes and Herb -Drug Interactions 43. Qiu et al. (2015) investigated the molecular interactions between 12 main active components (6- gingerol, 8- gingerol, 10- predict the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) of the 12 ginger components using computational methods and literature searches. This study suggests that ginger components may regulate the activity and expression of various human CYPs, resulting in alterations in drug clearance and response. 44. These results could potentially be significant in pregnant women on medication, who are using ginger as a remedy for nausea in the early stages of pregnancy. In vitro studies 45. Ginger extracts and the major components thereof - 6-gingerol (6G), 8- gingerol (8G), 10- gingerol (10G) and 6- shogaol (6S) - were investigated and shown to have an inhibitory effect on CYP isoenzymes in in vitro models by various groups (Kimura et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2012; Mukkavill et al., 2014). This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 11 Animal studies 46. A study into the effect of ginger on the pharmacokinetic s of metronidazole was studied by Okonta et al ., using rabbits (2008) . In a two-phase study , five healthy local strain rabbits (3 females, two males) were eac h given 3 mg/kg oral metronidazole. Following a 2 -week washout period, the rabbits were given 1 ml/kg of ginger extract orally daily for 3 days and immediately given 3 mg/kg metronidazole per oral on the third day. Ginger significantly increased the absorption and plasma half-life, and significantly decreased the elimination rate constant and clearance of metronidazole. 47. Egashira et al. , reported the interaction between ginger juice and tacrolimus in rats (2012). Tacrolimus (0.6 mg/kg) was administered intraduodenally in male Sprague- Dawley rats 1 hr following oral administration of 10 mL/kg 50% ginger juice or water. Pre -treatment with ginger juice was found to significantly increase tacrolimus blood concentrations compared to those pre- treated with water or orange juice. 48. The possible herb- drug interaction of ginger crude extract on glibenclamide and insulin was investigated by Al -Omari et al. , along with its hypoglycaemic and antihyperglycemic effects in normoglycemic - and streptozotocin- induced (STZ) diabetic rats (2012). Ginger crude extract was administered to normoglycemic male rats as a single dose (1 day) and as a daily dose for 1 week. STZ diabetic rats were treated with the same GCE concentrations (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg bw) together with glibenclamide (5 mg/kg bw) or insulin (1.2 IU/kg bw). 49. Single administration of ginger crude extract showed a significant decrease in blood glucose level (BGL) in normoglycemic rats after 1 and 2 hours (50 mg/kg bw). In STZ- diabetic rats ginger crude extract (25 and 50 mg/kg bw) decreased non - fasting BGL (N -FBGL) significantly at 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 hours. Glibenclamide (5 mg/kg bw) in combination with ginger crude extract at doses 25 or 50 mg/kg bw exhibited a significantly reduction in the N -FBGL 26.3% and 25.1% respectively after 4.5 hours, compared to glibenclamide alone which exhibited a 7.9% reduction. 50. Ginger was found to have a signific ant inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and P glycoprotein activities in vitro (Kimura et al., 2010; Zhang and Lim, 2008). It was this effect that was thought t o be responsible for reported hepatic cytolysis in a 48-year-old woman being treated with crizotinib. The patient, who was being treated with 250 mg crizotinib twice a day , had been taking ginger as a tea (amounts unknown) concomitantly during treatment . A subsequent diagnostic evaluation showed an increased crizotinib concentrati on, 1.8-fold higher than that measured two months prior. Anti-platelet aggregation activity This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 12 51. Several reports have been published on the pharmacological properties of ginger , with varying results. The potential effect of ginger extract and components thereof on the reduction of platelet aggregation and their potential antithrombotic activity has been noted as a concern in both literature and by health professionals. 52. With regards to the relevance of such effects in pregnancy, literature reports that pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of thrombotic events ; mainly related to a pro- thrombotic state, physiologically useful to reduce bleeding at delivery . These changes are more pronounced in the third trimester (Patti et al., 2014). It has also been hypothesised that antiplatelet agents might prevent or delay the development of pre- eclampsia (Duley et al., 2019). 53. The implications and clinical significance of the anti -platelet activity of ginger exposure during different stages of pregnancy remain undetermined. In vitro studies 54. Srivastava report ed an effect of ginger extracts on in vitro platelet aggregation (1986) . Ginger extracts in water, n- hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate were shown to arachidonic (AA), epinephrine, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen as agonists. 55. The effect of an aqueous ginger extract on platelet thromboxane- B2 (TBX 2) and prostaglandin- E2 (PGE 2) production was studied by Thomson et al . (2002) . Adult female Sprague- Dawley rats were administered an aqueous extract of raw ginger at either 50 mg/kg or 500 mg/kg daily, by either oral gavage or intraperitoneally (IP) for a period of 4 weeks . A dose of 50 mg/kg ginger administered orally , or IP did not result in any significant reduction in serum thromboxane -B2 levels when compared to saline -treated control groups but doses at 500 mg/kg significantly reduced TBX 2 levels in serum . 56. A non- significant reduction in the level of TXB 2 was observed when ginger was injected IP. However, levels were not significantly different from the TXB2 levels in control rats that had received saline. 50 mg/kg of ginger administered orally resulted in serum PGE 2 levels being significantly reduced however, 500 mg/kg was found to be more effective in reducing PGE 2 synthesis. PGE 2 levels were reported to be significantly lower than the saline control in rats given 500 mg/kg ginger extract both orally and IP. Human studies 57. Srivastava (1989) investigated the effect of fresh ginger on blood platelet thromboxane synthesis in humans . In a study on 7 women aged between 25- 65 years , where volunteers consumed ~5g of fresh ginger for 7 days . Ginger was found to inhibit eicosanoid biosynthesis in vivo.

Kr\u00fcth et al. reported the possible over -anticoagulation resulting from a possible ginger -phenprocoumoun interaction (2003). A 76- year-old woman on long- term phenprocoumon therapy presented with epistaxis and an international normalized ratio ( INR) of >10. Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was also found to be prolonged (84.4 sec onds ; normal <35). For several weeks prior to the event, the woman had a regular ginger intake of dried ginger prices and tea from ginger powder. Following treatment with vi tamin K, the patient's INR and PTT returned to within therapeutic range. 59. Young et al. investigated the synergistic effect of ginger and nifedipine on anti-platelet aggregation in healthy volunteers aged 25- 60 years old and hypertensive individuals aged 35- 60 years old (2006) . In a five -part study , the two groups comprising of 10 males and 10 females were administered 75 mg of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), 1 g of ginger , 10 mg nifedipine, 1 g ginger and 10 mg nifedipine in combination and 1 g ginger and 75 mg ASA in combination daily for one week each following a washout period ( 7 days following ASA administration, 10 days thereafter). 60. Platelet aggregation in the presence of collagen ADP and epinephrine was 44.1%, 44.5% and 42.1% 62.9% in hypertensive patients, respectively. Platelet aggregation induced by collagen, ADP or epinephrine was found to be higher in hypertensive patients than normal patients. Following administration of ginger alone, platelet aggregation was m easured as 35.2%, 37.8%, 35.9% with ADP and epinephrine respectively. When administered ginger and nifedipine in combination, the percentage inhibition of platelet aggregation collagen, ADP and epinephrine were 79.8%, 75.2%, 69.3% respectively. 61. Rubin et al. (2019) reported the possible effect of ginger supplementation on the (INR) in a woman taking warfarin. The 70- year-old female, who had been taking clonazepam 1 mg, metoprolol succinate 25 mg, paroxetine 10 mg, phenytoin 30 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg, warfarin 7.5 mg daily, and warfarin 10 mg once day per week, presented with an INR of 8, an increase from 2.7 one month prior after taking a 48 mg ginger supplement daily. A week following cessation of the ginger supplement, the INR declined to 2.6. 62. Al Askar et al. (2020) investigated the effect of ginger on platelet aggregation using agonists adenosine diphosphonate, arachidonic acid, collagen, ristocetin Forty healthy male and female participants were randomized (1:1) to consume ginger tea at an amount of 4 g in 150 ml of boiling water once daily vs. 4 g twice daily for five consecutive days. 4 g of ginger powder administered daily resulted in reduced platelet aggregation in subjects using epinephrine only. Platelet aggregation inhibition was also found to be higher in women using arachidonic acid. Effects on blood pressure This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 14 63. Ghayur and Gilani (2005) reported that a crude extract of ginger induced a dose- dependent (0.3- 3 mg/kg) fall in arterial blood pressure of anesthetized Sprague- Dawley rats (2005) . In Guinea pig paired atria, the crude extract exhibited cardio- depressant activity on the rate and force of spontaneous contractions. In rabbit thoracic aorta preparation, the crude extract relaxed the phenylephrine induced vascular contraction at a dose 10 times higher than that required against K+- induced contraction (80 mM) . 64. Ca2+ channel -blockin g (CCB) activity was confirmed when the crude extract shifted the Ca2+ dose- response curves to the right similar to the effect of verapamil. It also inhibited the phenylephrine (1 mM) control peaks in normal -Ca2+ and Ca2+- free solution, indicating that it acts at both the membrane- bound and the intracellular Ca2+ channels . When tested in endothelium -intact rat aorta, it again relaxed the K+ - induced contraction at a dose 14 times less than that required for relaxing the PE - induced contraction. The vasodilator effect of the crude extract was endothelium - independent because it was not blocked by N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) (0.1 mM) or atropine (1 mM) and also was reproduced in the endothelium -denuded preparations at the same dose range. These data indicate that the blood pressure- lowering effect of ginger is mediated through blockade of voltage- dependent calcium channels. Exposure 65. The relative proportions of the active components of ginger - gingerols , shogaols and curcumin occur in varying proportions , depending on the variety of rhizome and the area of cultivation. 66. Many ginger supplements are recommended to support di gestive and joint health, alleviate nausea, upset stomach, and travel sickness . Currently, two commercially available pregnancy supplements - 'Seven Seas Pregnancy' and 'Seven Seas Pregnancy Plus Follow On' - contain 10 mg ginger extract (Table 1) . Table 1.

In addition to supplements, pregnant women m ay also consume ginger as part of their general diet to various degrees. There are anecdotal reports of women using ginger products such as ginger biscuits and ginger ale, to alleviate morning sickness and nausea. Some may use these in combination with juice shots or tinctures .

Table 5 provides c onsumption estimates was 49 for women of childbearing age - (16 - 49 years) 1 from years 1 - 8 of the NDNS survey (Bates et al ., 2014; 2016; Roberts et al., 2018). The NDNS (Bates et al ., 2014; 2016; Roberts et al., 2018) does not provide data for pregnant or lactating women so while data is based on women of childbearing age, this data may not necessarily be representative of the maternal diet. The food group used for the consumption assessment consisted of all foods within the NDNS database which contained ginger (raw, powdered etc) except for alcoholic beverages . Mean chronic ginger consumption from the diet of women aged 16- 49 years old was 0.0083 g/kg bw/day g/kg bw/day . Table 5: Estimated chronic consumption for ginger in women aged 16 - 49 years old (Bates et al., 2014; 2016; Roberts et al., 2018) Consumers (n) Respondents in population group (n) Chronic consumption * s.f. 69. Table 5 indicates the contribution of ginger to the diet of women aged 16- 49 years is low, therefore, the main contributor to exposure for some could be from supplement use. This may vary however according to country of origin . For example, ginger is used more and in larger quantities in foods in Asian, African and Caribbean communities . 70. The NDNS does not provide data for pregnant women, therefore there would be uncertainty as to whether this give an accurate reflection of exposure during pregnancy, especially in women who will use ginger drinks and teas or foods such as ginger biscuits to alleviate symptoms of pregnancy associated sickness. Risk characterisation 71. There is a high uncertainty regarding the risk of consuming ginger drinks and particularly, concentrated ginger 'shots', which can contain as much as 27 g of raw, pressed ginger root per serving. Some marketed supplements provide limited This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 19 composition information, which adds further uncertainty of the exact exposure to the various components of ginger. It is considered likely that in addition to exposure from food and the use of supplements, people may consume ginger in tea or juice form to alleviate nausea and vomiting or symptoms of illnesses such as colds , potentially increasing risk. 72. Based on the available data, ginger showed some mutagenicity in TA 100, TA 1535, and T 98 strains , but this is l ow compared with established mutagens. Ginger is not shown to be mutagenic in vivo. Ginger showed no signs of acute or sub- acute toxicity in vivo at maximum levels of 5000 mg/kg bw , but studies show it may affect serum ALT and AST levels at does above 200 mg/kg . From the available studies it appears that ginger exposure could affect hormonal levels in animals thus interfering with reproduction, fertility and resulting in early embryonic loss. Furthermore, there is indication in utero exposure or exposure to ginger during breastfeeding indirectly affected hormonal levels and spermatogenesis in male animals. 73. It is not possible to fully characterise the risks associated with ginger use in pregnancy , due to the lack of safety data available and the varied study results to date. It has been considered that these varied results are attributed to the volatility of the principle compounds of ginger commonly reviewed - gingerols and shogaols . There is currently limited toxicological information available for the use of ginger during pregnancy. Among the variety of ginger supplements commercially available, there is a large variability in their composition, which also adds uncertainty regarding their use during pregnancy. Conclusions 74. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is the rhizome of the ginger plant, originating from in Southeast Asia. Ginger is commonly used as a spice and flavouring in many countries around the world and is increasingly growing in popularity as a natural remedy due to its purported immune system -boosting properties and also for motion sickness and post-operative nausea and vomiting. 75. Ginger supplements are regarded as a \"safe\" by people looking for a natural alternative for the relief of morning sickness . Some adverse effects have been reported however, few specific safety studies have been carried out in this area. 76. Several ginger supplements are commercially available , ranging from dried root in capsule form to tincture form, all with varying amounts of ginger . In addition to this, concentrated ginger shots , containing large amounts of pressed ginger, are increasingly becoming popular. The variability in the composition of these supplements adds uncertainty on the amount of ginger actually being consumed. 77. The lack of safety and toxicological information available on ginger use in pregnancy make it difficult to fully characterise the risks. From the available studies it This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 20 appear s that ginger exposure could affect hormonal levels in female animals thus interfering with reproduction, fertility and resulting in early embryonic loss . Furthermore, there is indication that in utero exposure or exposure to ginger during breastfeeding indirectly affected hormonal levels and spermatogenesis in male animals. These are indications based on limited studies and although some authors have speculated on the mode of action of ginger , it has not been fully elucidated. Human epidemiological studies have not reported comparable effects and the effects of in utero exposure to ginger in humans are unknown. Questions for the committee Members are asked to comment on a) The effects of ginger in animal studies b) The effects of ginger in humans? c) Based on the available information, is the Committee able to identify a point of departure to be used in the risk assessment of ginger? d) Any other comments on this paper.
