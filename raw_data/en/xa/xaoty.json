Ma Abstract: Beginning, notably, with Jean -Jacques Rousseau's \"Emile,\" that the child could exercise reason and autonomy developed in the late -eighteenth century. In the literature of the nineteenth, we see authors experiment such an idea. As a realist concerned with the limitations of language and subjectivity, Henry James used children to expose the society in which they l ived. By placing them at the heart of his plots, the writer exploited the linguistic gap and the inherent inaccessibility between children and adults. Studying the children in Henry James' novels provides a critical analysis into their r\u00f4le as the moral ce nter of it all. Looking at \"The Lady,\" \"What Maisie Knew,\" and \"The Pupil,\" I will argue that children are far from passive plot devices; that they define, through their interactions with the world around them, in fact the novel's standards f or moral behavior. In doing so, this paper seeks not only to explore the historical representation of childhood, but also present the basis for our thinking today. Research Mentor : Derek Pacheco, English, Liberal Arts ; Start Time : 1:00pm :: Room: Stewart 214 -B :: Social Sciences/Humanities College of Science ; Honors College Data Use and Privacy in the Public Sector Author: Sarah Rodenbeck Abstract: While having access to many of the same technological capabilities as the private sector, the public and nonprofit sectors raise very different questions in terms of data use practices and privacy. The goal of the public and nonprofit sectors are to provide benefits to society at a larger level, not to make a profit. Such services have the potential to save lives, for example by using cell phone location data to find survivors after a disaster. However, this data is often comprised of highly personal and identifiable information, which if revealed could be used to a person's detriment. Many of the current regulations concerning the use of data by federal agencies such as FEMA were created almost forty years ago, have many loopholes, or are not transparent. Technology and the field of data have fundamentally changed, and current regula tions may fail to allow for the positive potential of emerging technologies to benefit individuals. However, they also are not equipped to handle some of the emerging privacy concerns, especially as they relate to historically underserved populations. Cu rrent regulations must be re -evaluated to allow for greater data collection and use, but with an increased focus on data access protocols and transparency to prevent data from being used against people. Additionally, checks and balances must be put into p lace recognizing the potential for biased data and algorithmic discrimination. Research Mentor : Dr. Lindsay Weinberg, Honors College ; Start Time : 1:00pm :: Room: Stewart 214 -C :: Innovative Technology/Entrepreneurship/Design Polytechnic Institute Fatigue in Collegiate A viation Author: Erik Levin Abstract: The threat of fatigue to aviation safety is not fully understood. Contrary to mechanical defects, evidence for pilot fatigue is difficult to identify. Therefore, fatigue is rarely considered as a contributing factor in accidents or incidents. Although approximately seven percent of aircraft accidents have been associated with fatigue, this number is likely underestimated. According to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), from January 2000 through December 2018, a total of eighty -five general aviation (GA) aircraft accidents in which fatigue was cited as a causal factor occurred in the United States. Of those accidents, eighty -two resulted in fatalities and twenty -six in destroyed aircraft. Participants were recruited from a Midwestern university's accredited Part 141 flight school and a partner fixed base operator (FBO). The researcher of this study used a survey questionnaire to gather quantitative and qualitative responses. Many respondents reported fatigued stemming from sleep quantity or quality deficits. The primary contributing factors included an insufficient resting time and an inadequate work -free time balance. Daily free time activities conducive to health y sleep patterns were frequently neglected. Furthermore, several other factors that affected participants' lifestyles resulted from demands imposed by the college environment. Findings from this study can assist the GA community in gaining a greater unders tanding of how collegiate aviation students perceive, process, and manage the risk of fatigue in aviation.

Though the Apollo program is the one that landed the U.S. on the moon, the Gemini program ensured we had the necessary training and technology to make it to the moon and back. The Gemini 8 mission represented many firsts in NASA's long journey to the moon. It was the first attempt at docking, an essential and technologically challenging step that is often overlooked in the grand scale of the moon landing. It was also Neil Armstrong's first mission in space and in the command pilot seat of a sp acecraft, marking the beginning of his path to become the first person on the moon. However, the mission also could have led to a lot of lasts, for both NASA and Armstrong. Once docked with the Agena, Armstrong and Scott found themselves in the first crit ical-in-space emergency in NASA history, as the craft began it spin out of control. If it wasn't for Armstrong's quick actions and level - headed thinking, both him and David Scott would have perished, most likely taking NASA and the Apollo missions with the m. In the aftermath of the near disaster, NASA was quick to understate the severity of the failure, but the months leading up to the launch were marred with engineering mistakes and administration oversight. By looking through archival sources from Armstro ng himself, it's shockingly clear to see how close NASA's race to the moon almost took two astronauts to the grave.

The research was conducted primarily online and resulted in a larger understanding of the way that the physical design of Walt Disney World affects its guests. The paper starts with an introduction to the design principles studied the shaped the foundation of the conclusio ns, then explores examples from areas of Magic Kingdom, like Main Street U.S.A. and Liberty Square. Then, a closer look at a ride queue that is extensively themed to manipulate guest experience. Research Mentor : Dr. Michael Salvo, Pro fessional Writing, College of Liberal Arts ; Start Time : 1:20pm :: Room: Stewart 214 -B :: Social Sciences/Humanities College of Health and Human Sciences Perceptions of Ally Confrontations Author: Celine Jusuf Abstract: Research related to interpersonal confrontations, where one person points out a way in which another person had engaged in stereotypical or prejudicial bias, has provided a wealth of knowledge about factors that influence the extent to which confrontations reduce bias (e.g., Czopp, Montei th, & Mark, 2006; Wagner, 2011; Parker, Monteith, Moss -Racusin, & Van Camp, 2018). However, how do minority -group members perceive confrontations on behalf of their social/ethnic group, and does group membership of the conf ronter matter? The present experiment investigates how Asian women perceive confrontations of prejudice against their group when performed by an Asian woman, White woman, or Black woman. We are especially interested in testing whether confrontations provid e contextual cues to safety (Wout, Murphy, & Sabrica, 2014) signaling that Asian women are valued and belong in a given setting. We examine whether the greater the amount of social identity overlap between the Asian women participants and the confronter, t he greater safety and belonging participants will feel in the setting in which the confrontation took place. Results indicate that biased remarks without confrontation significantly lower participants' sense of belonging within a group along with other dep endent variables compared to a condition in which no biased remark is made. Confrontations do not significantly heighten these results and serve as a safety cue, but White confronters show a tendency to be marginally effective at increasing these dependent variables. Research Mentor : Dr. Margo Monteith, Psychological Sciences, Health and Human Sciences ; Start Time : 1:20pm :: Room: Stewart 214 -C :: Life Sciences College of Health and Human Sciences A Comparison of Bioavailability between Two Different -Sized Magnesium S Abstract: Magnesium is an essential nutrient for the human body. However, half of the United States (US) population fails to consume an adequate amount of magnesium from foods. Current magnesium su pplements can increase the magnesium intake, but they may cause side effects like diarrhea if given in a high dose. There is no known study in humans that compares the bioavailability of two different -sized magnesium salts. Also, few studies assessed the b lood concentration of ionized magnesium (iMg), but iMg was thought to be the active form of magnesium. Our hypothesis is that decreasing the particle size of magnesium supplement may increase the bioavailability and reduce the side effect. The objectives o f this study was to address the gap in the literature by comparing the magnesium bioavailability magnesium citrate) using the blood iMg. We conducted a preliminary analysis of 9 participants by performing 3 Matched pairs t -tests. The results showed that over 24 hours following administration of supplements, no significant differences of bioavailability were found between ReMa g and Natural Vitality Calm. Also, blood iMg seems to be a more reliable indicator of magnesium status compared to serum Mg concentration and urine total Mg. Our findings did not support our hypothesis that ReMag would be more bioavailable because of the smaller particle size .

Hundreds of companies along with hundreds of thousands of people worked tirelessly towards one goal: the Moon, by way of the Saturn V rocket. The team of software engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) wrote thousands of lines of code that guided the Command and Service Module (CSM) and Lunar Expeditionary Module (LEM), propelling their cargo thr ough open space towards the Moon in order to orbit and land, and then safely return to Earth. The code gave life to the crucial functions of the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) that steered Saturn's upper stages to the moon. We tend to diminish its historic al role given its rather weak calculating power, at least relative to contemporary computing. Yet the code and AGC were, for their day, cutting edge. The challenge of the astronauts was to learn about the fledgling field of computer science in order to u nderstand this code and the basics of the AGC. This was especially true for Neil Armstrong, who both depended on its automatic guidance and control, and was forced to override the very system that was guiding him to the moon. The advancements made by the A GC also created the practical means of augmenting human performance and, thanks to its size, power, and ease of use, create new possibilities like fly -by-wire technology and the personal computer. Research Mentor : Michael G. Smith, History, College of Liberal Arts ; Start Time : 1:40pm :: Room: Stewart 214 -A :: Social Sciences/Humanities College of Liberal Arts Amelia Earhart: Feminist or Not? Author: Rachel Small Abstract: Amelia Earhart is presently acknowledged for her work as an activist towards women's rights within the aviation industry and is regarded highly by feminists abroad as a role model for girls and women alike. The first purpose of this research was to analyze primary sources within the George Palmer Putnam Collecti on of Amelia Earhart papers at Purdue University's Archives and Special Collections as support towards A.E.'s feminist activism. The second purpose of this research was to highlight the implications modern ideas have on our understanding of the past. Both purposes required using the critical archival approach, which establishes the archive as a place of power and bias. This resulted in asking questions like, \"Was Amelia Earhart a feminist during her lifetime?\" and \"What did the term 'feminist' mean in the 1 930s?\" This study acknowledged the archive's primary sources as fractional and adopted secondary sources as alternate perspectives for a more holistic analysis. A major finding of this study was that one primary source contradicted the modern perception of Amelia Earhart as a feminist activist. It was concluded that due to the nature of an archive, there will always be a bias in deciding if Amelia Earhart was a feminist or not. Research Mentor : Sammie Morris, Purdue Libraries, Head Arc hivist ; Kendall Roark, Anthropology, Liberal Arts Start Time : 1:40pm :: Room: Stewart 214 -B :: Life Sciences College of Pharmacy Optimize the Detection of N -Terminally Methylated Protein methylation is a form of post -translational modification done on proteins specifically by N -terminal methyltransferase (NRMT1/2). Mutations in these enzymes are linked to the causes of cancer; whereby, they hinder the DNA repair mechanism. To fu rther understand N -terminal methylation on protein substrate, this research focuses on identifying the presence of N -terminal methylation on a wild type protein substrate (WT), and the absence of N -terminal methylation on a Tae -1 deleted protein substrate (Tae1). Both protein substrates are extracted from a yeast cell. Protein Substrate extracted from yeast cells were suited for this experiment due to yeast cells eukaryotic similarities with human, and they divide a lot faster. To observe these genotypic c hanges, optimizing our western blotting technique was very essential for an accurate result. Thus, this research utilized different blocking agents and conditions to observe the genotypic change. Optimizing the western blotting procedure with the use of ce ntrifugated 5% milk, DNase, prolong experimental duration, varied amount of PBST, and varied dilution folds of the antibody and antibody with the blocking agents enabled us to obtain a clearer result that allowed us to distinguish between methylation prese nce or absence in the targeted yeast strains. Interestingly, we observed an extra MW bound on the WT strain lane; this is a clear indication of the methylation activity present in this strain - the status of this extra is a potential focus for our future experiment.

This study utilized the user experience desig n approaches, including semi -structured interviews, workshop, and prototyping, to understand the roots of the problem and to propose a potential solution. It is suggested that communication barriers are only applicable to students who have specific communi cation needs. Long -term interests, altruism, and empowerment play huge roles in aiding international students to alleviate their communication barriers. In this paper, we brought insights from the primary research to effective action, proposing a mobile Ap p design that introduces local resources to international students. Educators might consider paying extra attention to the communication problems Mandarin -speaking students currently face and employing technical interventions to allay the communication bar riers. Research Mentor : Austin L Toombs, Department of Computer Graphics Technology, Polytechnic Institute ; Start Time : 1:40pm :: Room: Stewart 214 -D :: Social Sciences/Humanities College of Liberal Arts Female Strength in Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings Author: Zoe Franznick Abstract: Despite its continued popularity in fantasy fiction, many have condemned Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings (LOTR) as a misogynist work due to both the prevalence of male characters and the apparent misrepresentation of the few women who are in the novel as passive, citing the shield -maiden Eowyn as the exception which proves the rule. This paper asserts that this view is a misinterpretation of Tolkien's work, arguing that not only is it a reading which fails to accurately understand the main female characters' motivations and roles, it also implies that Tolkien's female characters must act out a singular representation of what a \"strong female character\" must be \u2014 a shield -maiden in battle. Rather, this p aper demonstrates that each of the female characters in LOTR portrays a different representation of an empowered, strong woman in Middle -earth; in fact, Eowyn must face her own personal struggle as one of the least empowered female characters in Tolkien's novel before she finds her internal strength alongside the other women in Middle -earth. This paper illustrates that Tolkien argues that women need not only wield swords or play a dramatic role in a narrative, as Eowyn does, in order to be well -represented female characters, but may also hold empowered roles as counselor, exemplified by Arwen and Galadriel. Each of these women is depicted in a positive and even regal light, illustrating Tolkien's favorable representation of women in The Lord of the Rings. Research Mentor : Shaun Hughes, Department of English Language and Linguistics, College of Liberal Arts ; Start Time : 2:00pm :: Room: Stewart 214 -A :: Life Sciences College of Pharmacy; Honors College Effect of Hypoxia on Breast Cancer Cells Author: Hyesoo Chae Abstract: Breast cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the United States. Although survival rate of breast cancer patients is high when the cancer is localized, survival rate is drastically decreased when cancer cells escape the local environment of the breast and invade distant secondary organs, a process known as metastasis. Evidence shows that presence of hypoxia, or low oxygen tension, is positively associated with metastasis in cancer patients. Hypoxia is capable of drastically altering gene expression, including genes that regulate cell metabolism. However, the extent to which hypoxia differentially modifies gene and protein expression in non - metastatic compared to metastatic breast cancer cells is still not fully understood. My research in particular focuses on determining the effects of hypoxia on survival and migration in non -metastatic compared to metastatic breast cancer cells. MTT and wound healing assays were used to st udy these processes in breast cancer cells in either environmental (~20%) or hypoxic (1% oxygen) conditions. Our results show that hypoxia significantly increases viability of non -metastatic breast cancer cells, but not metastatic breast cancer cells. When determining the effects of hypoxia on cell migration, no significant differences were found in migration rates in non -metastatic or metastatic cells after 20 h in hypoxia. Our future work will determine whether altering the time that cells are exposed to hypoxia can significantly change migration rates. The overarching goal of my research is to determine the metabolic effects of hypoxia in metastatic and non -metastatic breast cancer cells.

In spite of attractive characteris tic, there is no a simple, rapid, and straightforward method to quantify the on - and off -target activities of pAgos. Here, we developed a cell -free system with fluorescent outputs to quantify on/off -target activity within 24 hours. Unlike in vivo methods, the cell -free system allows a quantitative way to measure without worrying about transcription/translation variance in a living system. Our system is designed to use four plasmids harboring a T7 RNA polymerase (T7RNAP), a pAgo driven by a T7 promoter, Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP), and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), individually. T7RNAP is expressed first to induce pAgo expression. With programmable guides, pAgo can target either RFP or GFP, resulting in lower output. By measuring the outputs of RFP and G FP, we can assess the on -target and off -target activity of pAgo. We have already engineered both fluorescent proteins to have the same backbone so they will be expressed equally. Collectively, we developed an easy, fast, and straightforward system to asses s on-target and off -target activity of candidate pAgo, facilitating the development of the next -generation gene -editing tool.

While it is unknown how Fe plays in the etiologies of these diseases, welders inhale large quantities of metal particulates in welding fume, including iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn). Mn is a neurotoxin that has been shown to accumulate in the brains of welding fume exposed workers by increasing the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) R1 contrast. R1 and R2* are M RI parameters that are proportionate to Mn and Fe accumulation, respectively. Measurements of Mn in the brain could be confounded by accumulated Fe, mostly altering R2* contrast, but also R1 contrast to some degree. Therefore, monitoring the amount of Fe a ccumulating in welders is of consequential interest. While some groups, including our own, have reported increased R2* levels in region -of-interest (ROI) based analyses, such findings were inconsistent and targeted few brain regions. To enable an unbiased whole -brain analysis of Fe accumulation in the brain using MRI, 47 welders and 38 controls were recruited from a local manufacturer. Whole -brain R2* maps were co -registered with T1 - weighted structural images using SPM12 and then segmented into 192 differen t brain regions using Freesurfer. R2* in these segmented ROIs within the brain (e.g. white matter tracts and basal ganglia nuclei) were separately averaged and compared between welders and controls. Student's t -tests showed no statistically significant dif ferences between controls and welders. Therefore, a more comprehensive analysis using machine learning was used to determine if any patterns using all 192 regions could discriminate between controls and welders. Principle component analysis (PCA) was perfo rmed on five different statistics of R2* distributions in each ROI: mean, median, skew, 90thpercentile, and maximum value. For example, PCA performed on R2* mean showed that only 32 principle components (PCs) were required to explain 90% of all variation i n mean between all 192 ROIs. A support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel was employed using these 32 PCs but could not distinguish between welders or controls better than chance. Similar results were found for the other four statistics. These null results suggest that R2*, and thus brain Fe accumulation, cannot distinguish welders from controls. This provides some evidence that measures of Mn accumulation shown in previous work in the same cohort is only caused by elevated Mn brain levels and not co nfounded by elevated iron levels.

History records that Yuri Gagarin consumed the first food in space on April 12, 1961, squeezing beef and liver paste from metal tubes, followed by liquefied chocolate for dessert. More recently, space food received its two seconds of fame in the movie , First Man (2018), when Neil Armstrong opened a package of an unknown mush during his Gemini 8 mission. None of this sounds very appetizing. Yet these were beginnings. Today, astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) have better and mor e choices for space food, with over 250 different meal options, all prepared in a kitchen at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Some sixty years after Gagarin, the single most challenging obstacle remains weight. It costs around $1 0,000 for each pound of space food. This problem is mostly solved by freeze drying, a process which removes 97% of the water. Yet as the time humans spend in space increases, food will become more important to long -term space travel, as for example when we will need a whole new way of growing our own food in a colony on Mars. This article explores the unique contributions to the development of space food by the students, professors, and alumni of Purdue University through the lens of its archives and interviews. They are continually trying to make food better to ensure that the astronauts have a link to their home culture and tastes, as they explore longer and farther away from earth.

As more students are taking advantage of this opportunity, it begs the question of how these programs affect participants' personal and professional lives. For ten years, the College of Education has sponsored a Maymester program that allows students to spend 4 weeks in Tanzania. This program has been popular amon g students ever since its first year, and to date over 150 students have participated. The research question we seek to answer in this study is how/in what ways has this study abroad program fit into your life journey? There are 4 subset questions to fully answer that question; (1) What experiences led you to participate in this study? (2) In what ways was the program influenced by your participation? (3) In what ways did the program impact your subsequent experiences? and (4) How did your experience impact others? Narrative inquiry is increasingly used in educational studies because this notion of studying human experiences translates into the view that education is the construction and reconstruction of personal and social stories; teachers and learners ar e storytellers and characters in their own and other's stories (Connelly and Clandinin, 1990, p. 2). Through the use of a survey, data collection is currently being analyzed through narrative inquiry before moving onto more in -depth accounts from participa nts. The survey was sent to a sample of 136 participants who participated in this program to understand what experiences each student brought into the program, how they affected the program, and how the program has impacted their lives since their particip ation. Research Mentor : Jill Newton, Curriculum & Instruction, College of Education ; Start Time : 2:20pm :: Room: Stewart 214 -C :: Life Sciences College of Science; Honors College A thrombin -activated PAR -1 adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal cancer characterized by a wide range of mutations and a dense stromal environment that makes the disease resistant to chemotherapy. This chemoresistance, coupled with late stage diagnoses, often leads to fatal prognoses for patients diagnosed with PDAC. The purpose of this study is to define the role of a key G -protein coupl ed receptor, PAR -1, in PDAC malignancy, with the overall goal to identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Previous studies have shown that the PAR - 1 pathway is thrombin -activated which provides a mechanism of experimental control over its a ctivation. In vitro transwell migration and adhesion assays were used to measure metastatic abilities of a representative PDAC cell line, KPC2, in the presence or absence of thrombin. Additionally, tail vein injection assays were utilized to measure the in vivo metastatic ability of the KPC2 cell line. Initial results have provided evidence that the PAR -1 pathway is critical for pancreatic tumor development and metastasis. As this research project progresses, further work will be done to characterize specif ic downstream factors under the control of PAR -1, which will contribute to the understanding of how this pathway is inducing tumor progression.

As Neil Armstrong had it in his famous first words on the surface, \"That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\" The media celebrated Neil Armstrong and his crew members as conquerors. The y praised Armstrong, the captain of the mission, as the ultimate hero, a symbol of mankind's glory in the \"giant leap.\" Yet we also ought to remember Armstrong's many \"small steps\" that prepared him to explore space, to pilot a spacecraft, and to fulfill a mission. The two primary instruments of the entire Apollo 11 mission, Armstrong as astronaut and the Lunar Expeditionary Module (LEM) he piloted, formed a strong human - machine complex and interacted with each other through their journey. Armstrong represe nted the ultimate human element of the Apollo project, the aspect we all try to acknowledge yet still somehow diminish.

Ewing contributed to the early development of the well -known \"Special Relationship\" between the United States and Israel. Ewing is a relatively unknown name in the history of the Truman administratio n and Israel, but his influence is significant. In this abridged version of the larger paper, I explain the process by which Oscar Ewing gains close proximity to President Harry S. Truman and utilizes his social welfare position to impact his larger goals for US foreign policy. Informed by archival material from several national libraries, this paper provides deeper understanding of the key actors involved in building the unique relationship with Israel that the United States maintains to this day.

The impact of shared -use residential kitchens on food safety has not been adequately explored. This study uses a young adult population to pilot study. Purpose: To examine the effect of living with or without roomates on their perception of kitchen cleanliness, food safety knowledge and practice. Methods: An online survey (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) was developed containing questions on demograph ic, perception of kitchen cleanliness, food safety knowledge and practice. Upon approval of Purdue University IRB, the survey link was was sent to a listserv of all registered Undergraduate and Graduate students at Purdue University, West Lafayette. Resul ts: A total of 2214 students (60% reported to be female, 79% between 18 to 24 years of age) completed the survey. 66% of respondents confidently answered that they keep the kitchen clean. 25% of respondents believed that their roommates did not keep the ki tchen clean. 53% of students that live alone report that they believe that their kitchen would be the same if they lived with a roommate and 35% believe that it would be worse. Over half (56%) of those with roommates believed that the state of the kitchen would be better if they did not have roommates compared to the condition. From this, it is determined that students themselves believe that they keep the kitchen more clean than their roommates and that most students believe that living with roommates will mean that the kitchen will likely be less clean. Over 90% students responded that they are willing to improve their safe food handling practices if materials were available. Young adults seem to be more willing to change their habits so a part II will be administered to see if given reading or video educational material on food safety and roommate communication skills will improve the condition of the kitchen as well as the relationship of those who share the kitchen. Significance: Risks of foodborne illne sses in young adults can be reduced with proper food safety educational interventions and peer communication strategies. This study can also aid in other shared -use kitchen situations such as public or subsidized housing, and commercial shared -use kitchens .

Further, complicated steps often require the user to have had scientific training. Creating a novel methodology for the storage of loop -mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reagents would allow for increased portabili ty and usability for any pathogen -detecting point -of-care device that utilizes LAMP. A method was designed to deposit, dry, and store LAMP reagents at room temperature, eliminating the need for cold -chain storage. Reagents are separated into primer and enz yme groups to prevent premature amplification. A layered design is used to minimize the time taken for reagents to diffuse and mix upon rehydration. The primer layer is deposited on polyethylene terephthalate film and allowed to dry completely before the e nzyme layer is deposited directly on top of the primer. Upon usage, the reagents are rehydrated with buffer and pathogen sample and heated at 65 C. Heating time depends on the specific pathogen being tested. Dried reagents can be rehydrated and successfull y amplify sample after three weeks of storage. The method presented has been shown to be viable for the amplification of both bacterial and viral pathogens.

Yet with every great project comes great cost, and recently several works have come out delineating the massive drawbacks of the Apollo program. These works, building off the criticisms made in the 1960s with the hindsight of today, have declared the Apollo missions as political folly. Analyzing the wide variety of primary sources left from this era reveals that, regardless of the possible validity of the criticisms, they have been outshone by the many admirations at the time and since. This paper delves into select archival sources to sample the American public's reaction to the Apollo program during its missions. After the true goal of the program had been realized in the summer of 1969, many commentators were left with a deep but vague wonder. What was the meaning of these landings \u2014what was their purpose, and how would they influence the future? The reactions were polarized. While the criticisms of Apollo revolve around the inordinate amount of time, money, and effort required to bring a man to the moon and back, this is also the precise reason for celebrating the project. Apollo 11 represented a demonstration of American and human capability \u2014a capstone project in which its greatest boon was simply its accomplishment. The romanticism of such a unilateral, historical, and seemingly impossible goal as landing on the moon sparked the imagination of millions and continues to even today.

Unfortunately, it is not thoroughly studied. As such, we have attempted to fur ther understand how campus social climate can potentially impact minority students. Through this project, we have worked to see if there are disparities in perception of campus social climate correlated to race. More specifically, we have sought to discove r correlations between more socially conservative or liberal campus social climates, defined by previous voting patterns of the state and student reported political affiliations on the SERU, and minority student experiences and disparity in perceptions of campus social climate and social belonging. Using statistical methods such as T -tests and data from the Student Experience at a Research University (SERU), we aim to see if perceptions of campus social climate and social belonging change based on different geopolitical areas across different institutions. We have established there are statistically significant differing perceptions of campus social climate and campus social belonging correlated to different racial groups across political areas. Research Mentor : Dr. Jason Ware, Honors College ; Start Time : 3:00pm :: Room: Stewart 214 -B :: Life Sciences College of Health and Human Sciences Size Distribution of Nicotine Aerosol Particles Produced Using a Vibrating Mesh Nebulizer Author: Alec Graff Abstract: With the rising popularity of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) such as electronic (e -) cigarettes with young people, continued research needs to the conducted with health effects and alternatives in mind. Even though E -cigarettes are known to be safer than traditional cigarettes, toxic metal contents generated or leached from the metallic heating coil have been found in e -cigarette fumes. One possible alternative to conventional ENDS could be a vibrating m esh nebulizer (VMN), which would eliminate contaminants given off by these metallic coils. The VMN containing 5% and 10% nicotine solutions was tested to generate the nicotine aerosols. The size distributions of produced nicotine aerosols were measured by a NanoScan scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) for nano -sized particles and an optical particle sizer (OPS) for micro -sized particles. Each measurement was conducted for 90 minutes. Modes were found for the NanoScan SMPS and OPS at 81.6 nm and 1337.0 n m, respectively. Total number concentrations from the NanoScan SMPS and the OPS were 9.7e4 particles/cm3 and 1.2e3 particles/cm3, respectively. From these results, it was determined that the vibrating mesh nebulizer could be a suitable ENDS alternative on this basis. Further work needs to be done with various operational conditions.

The U.S. government has enacted legal safeguards against such encroachments, the primary legislation of which is Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA). The extensive and complex policies \u2014 comprised of GINA Title II, related statutes, bureaucratic regulations, and judicial opinions \u2014impose significant liability exposure on businesses that e mploy 15 or more employees. For such a firm, an incomplete or inaccurate understanding of the law threatens to cause severe losses, related either to excessively cautious practices that hinder productivity or to noncompliant practices for which the governm ent inflicts punishment. Conversely, for individuals, ignorance threatens to render the protections impotent by generating obstacles to rightful attainment of relief. These may include an inability to identify a violation, unawareness of the available mean s of seeking legal remedy, or filing of a technically flawed complaint. With the objective of informing firms and individuals of the law, so that the law may better concurrently protect individuals and avoid unnecessary damage to businesses, this examinati on first lays a sound foundation of legal analysis. It then separately addresses firms and individuals, outlining in plain language the details crucial to a company's implementation of minimally restrictive compliant policies, as well as those vital to the preservation of one's rights.

However, there is relatively little research on the factors that may contribute to the presence of superfund sites. Therefore, the goal of this project is to determine whether county -level demographics can predict the occurrence of superfund sites in a co unty. The 92 counties within Indiana were included in the analysis. Data on the superfund sites was obtained from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Priority List (NPL) website and demographic data was obtained from the Unit ed States Census. Multivariable linear regression models were created to identify which characteristics were associated with the number of superfund sites in a county. Models covariates included county -level data for household income, age, race, sex, obesi ty, and smoking. The results show that there is a significant negative correlation between the percent non -Hispanic whites living in the county and the number of superfund sites in the county. The Beta coefficient was -0.833 (p< 0.001) ( - 1.043, -0.723). The analysis shows that higher proportion of minorities is independently associated with a higher number of superfund sites per county within Indiana, whereas there was not a significant association of income, age, sex, obesity , or smoking with the number of superfund sites. Future work will evaluate relationships of superfund site location with county -level health outcomes.

While many genres of novels and games include puzzles, only a few include puzzles as a form of the narrative genre itself. This distinction demonstrates that the use of the puzzle narrative creates more immersive, interesting and engaging works in any medium, namely because the puzzle narrative ensures that the intri gue of the story and the puzzle are inseparable. The paper argues that unlike a typical puzzle, a puzzle narrative creates a deeper interaction between creator and player through three elements: a proper amount of interaction at an appropriate level for the medium, rules of fair play for creator and player, and finally, an inseparability between the puzzle and story itself. The paper further examines how the constraints of each medium \u2014novels, video games, and RPGs respectively \u2014 vary the level of interacti on the content creator has with the audience, and how that affects the puzzle narrative's presentation within its other constraints. This paper concludes that the adventure of the mystery is found not only in solving the puzzle, but in the cohesiveness of finding the solution by players interacting with the story as a whole; a successful puzzle narrative demands interaction from the reader, establishes rules of fair play, and ensures that the puzzle is ultimately inseparable from the tale itself \u2014 its soluti on brings the story to its natural and satisfying end.

Shale gas is a form of natural gas that is trapped within shale formations and has become an increasingly vital source of natural gas for the United States through the development of the hydraulic fracturing extracti on process. Heterogeneous, non -acidic catalysts can be used to convert the light alkanes in shale gas to more usable and transportable products. Catalytic shale gas conversion is a two -step process that includes the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olef ins and then the oligomerization of olefins to longer chain products. These two processes are traditionally performed under different reaction temperatures and pressures. However, the two reactions are proposed to be related due to common metal -hydride and metal -alkyl intermediates. Single -site cobalt catalysts where the olefin selectivity was >95% at 6% conversion. This suggests that Co2+ forms the necessary reaction intermediates for oligomerization. This project demonstrates that Co2+ can also catalyze olefin oligomerization at high temperatures through dimerization tests. Dimerization tests of pure ethylene resulted in low conversions (~3%) to C4 products, along with the presence of other higher molecula r weight hydrocarbons. Tests at higher pressures are expected to form liquid fuel products. This transformation to liquid fuel products will allow shale gas to be compatible with the current United States transportation infrastructure, further making it a viable alternative fuel.

Parents watching their children grow up is one of life's greatest adventures and treasures. What if the government said that after your child was born, you don't get pai d leave from work? How would you react to that situation? The United States declared that mothers don't get paid leave after the birth of a child or an adoption. Mothers need time after child birth to recuperate and gain energy back. The stress of worrying about their job is not something that parents need after the birth of a newborn. One of the biggest issues that employers face in employment law is parental leave for their employees. If you compare the United States to countries in the European Union suc h as France, Ireland, and Germany, their regulations are more favorable towards paternal leave and pay. Why the difference between these European Union countries and the United States? This paper is going to explore the governmental legal regulations to de termine why these countries, United States, France, Ireland, and Germany, all differ so drastically and make recommendations regarding the best form of governmental regulations for parental leave. The United States government has a conservative stance wh en it comes to parental leave. This gives companies the opportunity to set their own parental leave standards as they see fit. A lot of issues stem from mothers not being treated equally because they are pregnant, and that they may not have their job when they come back after their pregnancy. The United States passed the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) that stated companies must give maternity leave up to at least twelve weeks for the mother of a newborn or an adopted child, and their job must be kept or be given a similar job at that level. This eliminates some stress for new parents about their employment, but all companies differ in the amount of leave time they allow. Some companies give paid maternity leave and some don't, it all depends on the company and their policies. The United States has very different policies than that of the European Union. The three European Union countries this paper will explore are Germany, Ireland, and France. The governmental regulations vary among these three countries, but they emphasize the importance of the work/life balance and family life. The governments have different laws that emphasize different aspects of parenthood such as breastfeeding, up to a year of paid leave, and opportunities for fathers to take paid le ave as well. For example, Germany offers up to three years of paid maternity leave until the child reaches the age of eight. France offers allowances for new families to support them financially throughout the first year of being parents. These countries v ary in their style of liberal parental leave regulations, but have the same goal of promoting family life. Companies can offer additional benefits beyond what the government has requires, and most do. Their employment retention rates are much higher than i n the United States. This paper attempts to compare these three European Nations and show the positives and negatives associated with each countries policies. The differences between the conservative and liberal governmental stances between these four na tions show how parental leave is still in the early stages of expansion around the world. Parental leave is an aspect of employment law that is expanding globally and could hurt employees and companies in the long run. This paper will try to determine whic h legal aspects are best for the company, parent, and government. The legal aspects of these countries have changed drastically over time and will continue to change as people demand more. Companies need to think about long -term gains of employee satisfact ion and retention rates when they create their personal parental leave policies, and governments should consider the economic demands of their country. Is there a balance of what the parents, companies, and governments want? Should governments offer more p aid leave times for new parents? This paper will attempt to answer these questions by exploring governmental regulations and the government's stance from these four different countries.

The topic of this research addresses which facet(s) of the university experience are the most effective in preparing a preservice teacher for the first year in the classroom: academic coursework, extracurricular activities, or related work experience. In this research, I collected p ersonal narratives associated with a novice teacher's first year to reveal key themes linked to their college/university experience in the form of a case study. The interview was based on questions related to the perceived value of various facets of this e ducator's college/university preparation and experiences and how they helped prepare the educator for the first year of teaching. Data analysis for this study indicated that key themes were 1) the effectivity of coursework relative to boosting content area knowledge and confidence, 2) extracurricular experiences built essential \"people skills\" that transferred in daily interactions with students, and 3) related work experiences give valuable, specific hands -on experience that cannot be simulated in the abse nce of actually physically working with students. This study is necessary to understand what experiences provide the skills and knowledge that most effectively prepare educators for their first year in the classroom. This research helps inform the areas up on which emphasis is placed in university teacher preparation programs while providing an avenue for practicing first -year educators' voices to come into the realm of research on this issue.

Using data hand - collected from all presidential speeches conducted during these periods, including accounting for adlibbing by Donald Trump, I argue that Trump was distinctive in his dehuma nization of immigrants and refugees, far surpassing all other candidates. His language surrounding these groups focused heavily on 1) using non - human language to describe their actions and migrations; 2) assigning criminality and viciousness to immigrants; 3) repeating stories of the deaths of American citizens by immigrants; 4) saying that immigrants and refugees have values incongruent with Americans; and 5) emphasizing the idea that immigrants and refugees are a threat to the American way of life. Dehuma nization is often used as justification for aggressive policies and behaviors, which has been demonstrated through the Trump administration's family separation policies. This paper adds to the conversation about dehumanization by providing evidence that Tr ump presents a major increase in dehumanizing rhetoric compared to previous candidates, which is important to note as new policies unfold. Additionally, it provides a foundation of collected data for future studies.

Enterococcal infections have been on the rise since the early 2000's and are t he second most common hospital -acquired infection in the United States. Two strains: E. faecium and E. faecalis are found naturally with low virulence in mammalian gastrointestinal tracts and human female genitalia. Upon long term exposure to antibiotics t hat disrupts the normal gut microbiota, enterococcal species begin to thrive unchecked. These strains, E. faecium in particular, are adept at acquiring resistance to common antibiotics. When resistance is acquired to the last line of defense, these strain s become even more problematic. The current standard of treatment is antimicrobial agents such as linezolid or a combination of quinuprisin/dalfopristin. However, resistance against them has been documented in the clinic and these antibiotics kill off esse ntial microflora that are necessary for proper immune and digestive function. With this knowledge, it is imperative that a new treatment option is developed to cure these vancomycin - resistant enterococcus (VRE) infections. A fast and reliable method of gen erating new therapeutics is by repurposing FDA approved drugs. A high -throughput screen was run against a chemical library of FDA approved drugs to find hits that inhibit the growth of VRE and vancomycin sensitive enterococcus (VSE). A carbonic anhydrase i nhibitor known as acetazolamide was selective in targeting VRE and exhibited no toxicity against normal gut microbiota. The World Health Organization (WHO) regards acetazolamide as a safe and effective drug as it is used in long -term treatments for glaucom a world -wide with limited toxicity in high doses. A structure activity relationship (SAR) study of acetazolamide derivatives was explored. Approximately 30 novel analogs were synthesized, with improved minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 0.06 -1 ug/m L, compared to acetazolamide which yielded values of 2 -64 ug/mL. Our most potent analogs have been brought forward into mouse gut decolonization models where they displayed selectivity for VRE and have shown to be nontoxic in high doses. Resistant mutants of VRE against acetazolamide have been isolated in culture and the data suggests a drug target that has previously never been characterized and is unique to enterococcal strains. Validating the binding of our analogs to this unique target both in vitro and in vivo is currently in progress. Research Mentor : Daniel P.

WHO estimates that over 600 million people worldwide infected annually. However, not all health professionals are aware of patients' vulnerability to foodborne illness. Previously, we identified barriers to food safety education among health professionals in the US. In this study, we went further to examine the global perspective of this issue. The objective is to evaluate health professionals' practice and attitudes toward food safety education i n China and Peru. Method A face -to-face semi -structured interview was conducted to collect data among health professionals in China and Peru, using local languages (Chinese, Spanish). In China, participants were recruited from local hospitals in Guangzhou, the capital city of Guan gdong province. In Peru, participants were recruited from local hospitals in Lima, the capital city of Peru. Results 42 health professionals participated in this interview (China, n=30; Peru, n=12). The biggest food safety concern mentioned in China is f ood adulteration while in Peru is the use of contaminated water. All of the health professionals saw the necessity to deliver food safety education, but few of them actually delivered. The majority of health professionals in China and Peru felt confident a bout microbial food safety knowledge. However, only 8 participants had food safety training before. Lack of materials has been ranked as one top barrier in both countries. Significance The findings provided evidence to guide the decision making of govern ment, educators and health professionals, supporting the development of next -generation food safety education strategies for the public.

Its main components are: cement, water, and aggregates. Use of concrete has grown exponentially over the last decades. Production of cement has a huge negative impact on the environment. Biomass ash, a waste from th e paper industry, could be used as a partial replacement of cement due to its composition. However, due to the lack of studies about its effects, its use is not allowed. Knowing its positive and negative effects will contribute towards more sustainable regulations and to avoid potential problems. There are no studies about how biomass ashes affect the performance of concrete under extreme conditions. This research studies the effect of partial replacement of cement by biomass ashes on heat resistance of cem ent paste, in function of curing temperature. Cement paste with 0%, 10%, 20% and 40% of replacement of cement by biomass ash were studied. Curing temperatures were 10 \u00b0C, 20 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C. Tests will be performed before and after exposure to high temperatur es (100 \u00b0C and 500 \u00b0C), including: compressive strength test, and tests to quantify hydration products (Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Thermogravimetric analysis). It is an ongoing investigation, test and analysis of the data are not completed yet. Preliminary results focused on the effect of 10% of biomass ashes on heat resistance, by comparing 7 -day compressive strength before and after exposure at 500 \u00b0C for 2 hours, were completed. Results suggest that the biomass ash has a negative effect on hea t resistance at 7 days. However, since biomass ash slows the hydration rate, it is possible that this negative effect will change if the exposure occurs at the long term. Test at 28 and 90 days will be performed. The ongoing tests will help us to have bett er understanding of mechanisms that drive this effect, to mitigate it or to avoid it.

However, there have been times historically and in recent years that farmers have switched to a continuous corn system. Although rotational corn dominates the Eastern Corn Belt, there is a significant number of farmers th roughout the Midwest that find continuous corn to be more profitable. There are many variables that affect the decision to execute a continuous corn system, including corn -soybean yield ratios, corn -soybean price ratios, geographic location, soil fertility , tillage practices, pest pressure, and fertilizer requirements. The objective of this research project is to examine how these variables impact the point where continuous corn becomes more profitable than a corn -soybean rotation. When all else is held con stant, each variable can be analyzed individually to see how impactful it is to the overall profitability of the system. This is conducted through a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that itemizes the revenue and expenses for both corn and soybeans, and then solving for net income under each crop budget. This takes into account not only the profit from growing continuous corn, but also the opportunity cost of growing corn instead of soybeans. Once the difference is calculated, the sign of the number will indicate the economic viability, and the size of the number will indicate the strength of certainty for the economic viability. By entering in customized values into the spreadsheet, a farmer can view the different scenarios for growing continuous corn, which will assist them in making economically sound decisions on their farm in terms of choosing their cropping system.

Objective: Assess food safety knowledge and behavior of flour handling among consumers and evaluate food safety implications from popular recipe sources. Methods: Phase I: An online survey (Qualtrics) was developed for data collection, consisting of three topics: source of recipe and food safety information, knowledge and practice of flour storage and handling, knowledge and practic e of flour recalls. The participant selection criteria included (1) handling flour at least twice a year and (2) primary grocery shopper and food preparer in the household. Phase II: Recipe from traditional source (cookbooks) and online source (blogs and YouTube videos) were selected and coded to assess the food safety implications according to FDA's flour handling recommendations. Results: Phase I: The online survey was distributed to one thousand consumers. Most of the participants showed lack of knowl edge and practice of flour recalls. Phase II: Qualitative and quantitative information was taken from videos, blogs, and cookbooks. The traditional source and the online sources presented flour handling errors and lacked precaution information addressing the food safety risk of flour handling. Significance: Findings provide insights on elevated foodborne illness risk among consumers from poor flour handling and limited food safety knowledge. Strategies of enhancing safe flour handling in popular recipes should be developed by a consolidation of health educators, researchers, and policymakers.

This enrichment technique improves rat welfare by decreasing handling stres s and increasing positive emotions. Despite these known benefits, its current application and barriers to application are unknown. This study's purpose was to characterize the current use of and beliefs about rat tickling in the status quo. This study recruited laboratory personnel (N=611) from the United States and Canada who completed a brief 20 -minute online survey. The survey consisted of sections that assessed attitudes toward, frequencies of, and familiarity with rat tickling. Additionally, it asked q ualitative open -ended response questions pertaining to the possible barriers, advantages, and improvements to rat tickling application. We used the Theory of Planned Behavior and thematic analysis to determine barriers, advantages, and improvements to rat tickling. We found that rat tickling was implemented infrequently and often incorrectly. Personnel reported that Handling (61% of participants) and Rat Welfare (55%) were two key advantages to rat tickling. Personnel also reported that Time (59%), Personne l (22%), and Research (22%) were three key barriers to rat tickling. Current implementation of rat tickling is low and often incorrectly implemented. Targeting specific rat tickling barriers of time, personnel, and research has the potential to increase ra t tickling implementation across laboratories. Research Mentor : Megan R.

Circadian clocks generate key biological rhy thms, including the timing of cell proliferation and activity. We hypothesize that circadian clocks in mammary glands regulate cell proliferation. The objective of our experiments was to determine how disruption of the mammary clock, through knockout of BM AL1 core clock gene, would affect cell growth and metabolism. Western blot analysis was used to confirm CRISPR -CAS9 knockout of BMAL1 (BMAL KO) gene in mammary epithelial cell line HC11. To determine the effect of BMAL1 knockout on cell proliferation, numb er of cells over an eight -day growth period and percent of cycling cells were compared between BMAL KO and wild -type HC11 (HC11) cell lines. MTT assay was used to measure NADH levels as an indicator of cellular activity. General liner analysis in SPSS foun d that day and line had a significant effect on cell growth. Doubling time between days two and four was not different between HC11 (21.9 \u00b1 3.8 hours) and BMAL KO (26.9 \u00b1 3.8 hours); however, BMAL KO cells reached stationary phase at a significantly lower density than HC11 cells. Cell cycle analysis did not yield any significant differences between average percent of proliferative cells between the two lines on any day. MTT results showed BMAL having lower absorbance values, indicating lower metabolic activ ity, on days two and four compared to HC11. Overall, significant differences between BMAL KO and HC11 cells indicate that knockout of the BMAL1 clock gene and disruption of the circadian clock in mammary epithelial cells have a negative impact on cell grow th and metabolic activity.

This is mainly due to poor food choices that lead to excess energy intake. Despite positive energy balance, these diets may actually be deficient in selected essenti al nutrients; many of which could be corrected by increased vegetable intake. Interventions at a young age that increase knowledge of and appreciation for healthy foods through experiential learning can aid in addressing the obesity problems in children. E xposing children to other food options, teaching them about vegetables and getting them excited about eating healthy might be one way to influence their food choices and possibly change the habits of the families and the whole community. The Centers for D isease Control and Prevention notes that Leafy greens are vegetables that have low energy density but are rich in 17 nutrients of public health importance. The proposed project uses an indoor leafy green production system (ILGPS) setup at two research site s, Franciscan Health, Lafayette, IN and Tri -County Intermediate School, Wolcott; IN. Franciscan Health donates food to children living in food insecure areas while Tri -County Intermediate is one of the 60 schools with a certified STEM program. Young childr en at these two facilities will regularly visit and work with plants in the ILGPS. In addition, we plan to provide educational programs that will increase knowledge about growing leafy greens and the nutritive value and health benefits of eating such plant s. We expect that this will shift their preferences from more unfavorable to more favorable views of leafy greens and establish a greater appreciation for healthy food generally. Another expected outcome is that children get interested in learning more abo ut not only Biology and Agriculture, but Science in general. To measure the impact, we will evaluate whether there is a change in knowledge level, preferences and behavior related to healthy eating among children participating in the project. We plan also on maintaining contact with the school and possibly expanding the project in case the results show positive impact in the community.

Therefore, it is commonly targeted for antibiotics and herbicide strategies, and genetic engineering. It is known to be localized in plastids (such as chlor oplasts), but there is biochemical evidence of a cytosolic shikimate pathway. This experiment's goals are two -fold: 1) determine the presence of a cytosolic shikimate pathway and 2) characterize the genes encoding the pathway's enzymes. First, we aim to te st for a cytosolic shikimate pathway by overexpressing exists, we expect overexpression of this DAHP synthase to increase the production rate of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), derived from phenylalanine. To date, we have grown 21 transgenic petunias, selecting using antibiotic resistance. We will soon verify overexpression of the feedback -insensitive, cytosolic DAHP synthase using Western Blot. Secondly, two enzymes have of these demonstrated that DHQS plays a role in VOC production, consistent with a role in the shikimate pathway. By visualizing fluorescently -tagged variants, we determined DHD is localized as expected; however, DHQS is local ized in plastids and is therefore unlikely to directly contribute to cytosolic shikimate pathway flux. Further analysis is required to determine these enzymes' precise roles with respect to the putative cytosolic shikimate pathway.

The study consisted of making sweetener of them 1:1 w/w with starch (potato starch, dent corn, waxy corn, 70% high amylose corn starch, and 55% high amylose corn starch). The sweetener concentrations ranged from 1 -4M for monosaccharides and 0.5 -2M for disaccharides. The sweetener -starch slurries were h eld for 24 hours and then measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The DSC protocol increased the temperature from 30C -130C at 10C/min. The resulting thermograms were used to identify the onset and peak gelatinization temperatures (Tgel ) and the enthalpy of gelatinization. Both sweetener type and concentration had significant effects on starch gelatinization, and different types of starch gelatinized at different temperatures. All starch Tgels increased with increasing sweetener concent rations. The largest changes in Tgel were found in the presence of high concentrations of sorbitol, likely because sorbitol is a sugar alcohol with an open ring structure and has an extra hydroxyl group that can help stabilize the amorphous region of the starch. In reformulation strategies intended to reduce sucrose in foods, it is ideal to match the effects of sucrose on starch thermal properties. The data set generated provides a quantitative comparison of the effects of different sweeteners on starch ge latinization which could be beneficial for product reformulation and development.

Four levels of body weight estimation error (BWEE) with SD's of 0, 4, and 8% of BW were simulated. Initially, pigs were marketed in 3 marketing cuts (MCUT), 25% at 169, 25% at 179 and remaining 50% at 193 d of age.The timing of marketing was shifted in 7 d intervals with mean marketing ages of 155.5 to211.5 d with mean CW's of 75.7 to 108.7kg. Sort loss was calculated using a market system for a U.S. pork processor(T yson Foods). Sort loss ($/pig) values were fitted to a polynomial function of mean CW for each combination of BWEE and PNVE. The increase in mean sort loss for each unit increase in CW above 93 kg increased as BWEE and PNVE increased.Pork production costs were estimated using an industry spreadsheet. A base price of $1.433/kg of CW was used to produce a small profit per pig.Market prices of $1.653 and $1.322/KG CW were used to reflect times of large profit or losses per pig. Lean premium (LPREM, $/100 kg CW ) for gilts was estimated as: to maximize profit/pig and daily returns above daily costs were estimated for each combination of BWEE and market price. For a single mean pig and base price, the optimal CW for profit/hd and profit/hd/d were the day before sort loss discount was to occur(Age= 188, CW= 98.8, profit/hd/d=$4.67, profit/hd/d= ($0.028/d). With accurate sorting, (BWEE= 0) the optim al mean age for the 3 MCUT strategy was 183.5 d (169,179 and 193 d MCUTs) at a mean CW of 96.4kg and profit of $3.49/pig. With less accurate sorting (BWEE = 8%), the optimal mean age decreased to 181.5 d with mean CW of 95.2 kg, and profit of $2.89/pig. Wi th this marketing system, the optimal market ages decreased only 1 to 2 d and CW's decreased 0.6 to 1.3 kg decreased as the accuracy of sorting pigs decreased.The lower market price reduced the optimal CW by 1.2 kg (2d) and increase 2.4 kg (4d) with the hi gher market price. The Tyson Foods marketing system is less sensitive to the accuracy of sorting than other systems.

In the time that traditional methods can detect pathogenic contamination, supermarkets are stocked, restaurants have served meals, and tainted food has been consumed. Prompt pathogen detection is a major obstacle for the world food industry. On average, 56% of foodborne outbreak deaths are multi -state incidences (CDC, 2015). This highlights the duty of food producers and distributors to embrace new detection technologies, detailed record keeping, and to promote a culture of safety. The main issue in pathogen detection in food systems is being abl e to detect the extremely low concentrations of bacteria that are sufficient to cause disease. To be able to reach detection thresholds, traditional culture methods require lengthy enrichment, E. coli being 24\u00b12 hours (Thermo Scientific, ISO 16654:2001, IS O 7251:2005). The Laboratory of Renewable Resources Engineering (LORRE) at Purdue University has developed the Continuous Cell Concentration Device (C3D), which employs hollow -fiber microfiltration to concentrate pathogens from liquid food samples, facilitating detection within a single working day (under 8 hours). Processing nutritionally complex food can incur costs in enzyme loading and filter membrane wear. Liquid - Gated Membranes (LGMs) may present a means to reduce membrane fouling, without detr imental effects to the proven and effective pathogen -concentrating procedures established by LORRE. LGMs have been characterized as non -toxic, self -cleaning, omniphobic, resistant to strong chemical treatment, while maintaining lower critical pressures and high flux rates during liquid filtrations. Their novel application in hollow -fiber microfiltration may be a conduit to reduce sample processing costs and broadened food type processing. Research Mentor : Dr. Michael R. Ladisch.

However, the secondary structure and surface properties of kafirin are not yet fully understood. To understand the effect of solvent polarity on the physico - chemical properties, kafirin was extracted from sorghum flour and dissolved in 70%, 80%, 85%, and 90% ethanol, as 70% and 80% tert -butanol, which was later plasticized and cast into films. The extracted kafirin powder, kafirin dissolved in the two different solvents, the unplasticized and plasticized kafirin films were characte rized using FTIR. The secondary structure analysis of the pristine kafrin powder contained ~40% -helices, and kafirin -80% ethanol films contained ~40% -helices. Similar result s were obtained for kafirin dissolved in tert - butanol solutions and kafirin -tert-butanol films. This suggests that there were solvent -induced transformation in the -helical structure of kafirin when dissolved in different concentrations of ethanol and ter t-butanol solutions. The addition of plasticizers and the drying of films may have also affected the -helical structure due to solvent evaporation and kafirin -plasticizer interactions. Based on the results, 80% ethanol consistently yields the highest % -helix. Circular Dichroism (CD) results for kafirin dissolved in ethanol and tert -butanol solutions showed trends similar to FTIR. With decreasing solvent polarity, the water contact angle increased, with the highest contact angle of 56\u00b0 obtained for plastic ized 3.56 GPa from plasticized kafirin - 85%ethanol films, which also has the highest tensile strength, but the lowest % elongation at break compared to other kafirin -ethanol films. For kafirin -tert-butanol films, highest plasticized kafirin -70% tert -butanol films, which also has the highest tensile strength 1.6 MPa and highest % elongation at br eak. Our findings suggest that both solvent polarity and plasticizer can effectively regulate kafirin assemblies and improve the surface hydrophobicity and mechanical properties of kafirin films for application in biodegradable food packaging materials.

To better understand how this process is regulated we carried out a genetic screen to identify mutants that either failed to, or were slow to, reorient in response to a gravity vector in the dark. Using family -wise screening of Next -Generatio n EMS Mutagenized families, 30 mutants were identified that repeatedly exhibited slow shoot turnaround out of 800 tested families. Among these, 8 exhibited short thick shoots (sts) in the dark. Remarkably, these all display attributes consistent with in Br assinosteroid (BR) deficiency. Brassinosteroids are growth promoting phytohormones controlling cell elongation and multiple developmental processes. Similar to the known BR -deficient mutants (na1, na2, lil/brd1) these mutants ls in the tassel florets (POPIT), upright leaves, and short stature similar to BR - deficient mutants. All 30 slow shoot turnaround families were grown to maturity and screened for architectural abnormalities with a focus on dwarfism and antigravitropism. N o mutants with phenotypes similar to lazy plant1 were recovered in this screen. All known BR -deficient mutants of maize were germinated in the dark and tested for gravritropic growth. Although dwarfism was apparent in na1 and na2 lines, seedlings did not d isplay the short thick shoots or slow shoot turnaround that characterized the sts mutants. Unlike these BR -deficient mutants, brd1 seedlings defective in BR -6-oxidase, did exhibit short, thick shoots and slow shoot turnaround when inverted in the dark. It is possible that the 8 sts mutants are new alleles of brd1 or are alleles in other steps of BR synthesis or signal transduction.

The St. Marys watershed drains into Western Lake Erie and has been identified as a contributor of nutrients, leading to toxic algal blooms. Nutr ient management plans (NMPs) have been promoted to reduce nutrient runoff and nutrient loadings in the Western Lake Erie Basin. This report examines the profiles of farmers who have adopted NMPs and farmers who have not. The profiles were developed from su rveys mailed to 986 farmers and landowners in the St. Marys watershed with questions pertaining to conservation practice adoption. The surveys response rate was 49.8% and the profile results include 143 valid responses. A total of 33 respondents reported adopting an NMP while 110 respondents reported they had not. Using descriptive statistics, this research describes the average NMP adopter in the St. Marys watershed and indicates that NMP adopters implement more conservation practices into their farming op eration, including cover crops, gypsum application, conservation tillage, and conservation plans. This research helps us understand the demographics of non adopters and adopters and informs outreach and education in the St. Marys watershed.

This includes agricultural production such as community gardens and backyard chicken coops, but it also includes agribusinesses and other related industries. Thi s growth has spurred urban school systems to add Agricultural Education programs in high schools and middle schools. However, there is limited research on the impact of these programs and whether they foster student interest in agriculture. This study focu ses on the relatively newly established urban agriculture program at Beech Grove High School in Beech Grove, Indiana. The program was established in 2012. The goal of this study was to see not only why students got involved in the program originally, but a lso why they stayed involved and how that could potentially relate to their future plans. All students enrolled in a high school agriculture class were given the opportunity to provide answers via a Qualtrics survey. The data were analyzed for trends that could be used to further the development of the Beech Grove agriculture program and the creation or boosting of other urban agriculture programs that have recently started or are thinking about starting. Participants provided responses in the areas of mot ivation to enroll in agriculture courses, motivation to become involved in the co -curricular student organization FFA, interest in the work -based component of the program, potential career plans, and feedback to improve the program.

These include nutrient runoff, erosion, and sediment, all of which can damage water sheds exposed to poor soil and land management. Awareness of these impairments can indicate the importance of water quality to farmers as well as influence the implementation of agricultural, conservation practices. Using survey data collected from produce rs and landowners in the St. Marys (n = 454), Big Pine Creek (n = 121), and Upper White (n = 361) watersheds, this research assesses farmers' perceptions on water quality in their respective watershed compared to the actual water quality metrics reported b y the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2010. The water impairments addressed in the survey include sediment/silt, nitrate/nitrogen, phosphorus, bacteria in the water (such as E. coli) and pesticides. We used nonparametric statistics to compare farm ers' perceptions on water pollutants across three watersheds and found that farmers generally perceived the problem of nutrient (nitrate/nitrogen & phosphorus) pollutants within their watershed correctly. However, farmers perceived the other pollutant prob lems differently to the EPA's reported impairments. Understanding how farmers perceive water quality issues within their watershed can prompt educators and outreach programs to increase awareness of the negative impacts of poor water quality. Recognizing t he implications of agricultural land use on water quality is also an important step to implementing better management or conservation plans.

Cicero, Little Cicero, and Hinkle Creek flow into the Morse Reservoir in northern Hamilton County, IN. The cr eeks are bordered by residential private property and farmland. Runoff from farmland and sediment erosion are the leading agents reducing water quality in Indiana. Conservation corridors along the creeks would provide wildlife connections to core forest habitat in southern Indiana as well as enhance recreational opportunities for nearby towns like Arcadia, Cicero, Atlanta, and Tipton. The creek corridors were analyzed to determine how planning for natural resource conservation could increase water quality, habitat viability, and local recreation. Current tree canopy and historic wetland areas were mapped to help identify areas for conservation and restoration along each creek. Geographic Information System Mapping Technology (GIS) was used to complete an ove rlay analysis of the natural resources for each creek. County land parcel layers identified current uses, residential and agricultural, along each creek and how these uses can evolve to enhance water quality, corridor habitat, and green recreation. The res ulting creek corridor plan reveals that nearby towns will benefit economically and socially from the implementation of green trails promoting recreation and education around local natural resources. Increased water quality, habitat viability, flood and run off mitigation will result from improved vegetative cover and wetland restoration along each of the three creeks.

St. John sits on the edge of an outwardly expanding urban sprawl band in Northwest Indiana. Tax benefits a nd proximity to Lake Michigan and Chicago, IL are pushing population centers South and East. Natural and agricultural environments are threatened by this urban sprawl. A need for well designed, intentional, landscape intervention is evident. Can a reductio n of impervious surface and traditional vehicular traffic within a community be ecologically, culturally, and economically beneficial? And is there an opportunity to implement these practices in Northwest Indiana? By analyzing data on the current developme nt trends, migration draws, and expected resident base we can assess the opportunity for landscape interventions in this area. Anticipated cost studies, comparing short and long term costs of traditional development vs that of proposed practice changes, wi ll expose the financial feasibility of these landscape interventions. Based on data collected, the state of development and expected future resident base, St. John would benefit from implementation of the proposed landscape interventions. Through smart des ign decision making and improved practices the long term financial benefits of this type of development make it a financially feasible development option.

During quantitative mussel biomonitoring studies from 2011 -2017, BWQ biologists sampled native Unionid mussels, recording whether mussels were found on the substrate surface or by excavation. With this data, we wished to determine whether mussel excavation was necessary to accurately represent the mussel populations. This would allow us to allocate sampling time to more accurately depict mussel density. Eight sites along the West Fork of the White River wer e sampled using Adaptive Cluster Sampling. This technique allowed biologists to record mussels on the substrate surface and through excavating up to 15 cm. Overall, 355 (36.3%) mussels were sampled on the substrate surface and 624 (63.7%) mussels were samp led through excavation. Of the 16 species found, mussel popul ation analysis without excavation. Potential factors affecting vertical distribution at the time of sampling include : hydrological factors, weather, substrate, season, and glochidia release. Results indicated that species releasing glochidia during the study timeframe include the Plain Pocketbook (75% sampled at the surface) and the Threeridge (100% sampled at the surface). My analysis suggests that excavation is necessary to obtain an accurate representation of mussel densities, and that surface numbers may be affected by vertical movement due to periods of glochidia release. Suggestions for future studies include the effect of vertical distribution due to glochidia release on the oc currence of Unionid mussels on the substrate surface, and considerations for sampling timing based on these results.

These blends may exhibit unwanted clumping or caking during storage due to the interactions between amorphous and crystalline ingredients and the enviro nment, although little quantitative information is available regarding moisture content thresholds for caking or differences between different seasoning types. The purpose of this study was to characterize the moisture sorption and caking characteristics of individual seasonings and seasoning blends exposed to varying RH and temperature conditions. Twenty -six spice and herb powders and flakes, sodium chloride, sucrose, and maltodextrin were studied individually and in binary, tertiary, and quaternary blen ds. Moisture sorption profiles were generated by exposing the samples to increasing RHs (0 -95%) using a moisture sorption instrument (SPS) and monitoring mass. A subset of samples was stored in controlled RH (44 -75%RH) and temperature (20 -50\u00b0C) desiccato rs and monitored over time for moisture sorption, appearance, and degree of caking. Due to the low deliquescence point of sodium chloride, blends containing sodium chloride were more sensitive to environmental RH conditions and sorbed the most water. As th e blends containing sodium chloride became more complex, the deliquescence points were further lowered due to deliquescence lowering. The presence of maltodextrin caused a slow increase in weight gain before the deliquescence point, unlike the other mixtur e components, due to its amorphous nature. The herb flakes sorbed more moisture than the other spices and herbs studied, followed by garlic and onion powders. The moisture sorption behaviors of spice and herb blends dictated the caking and clumping tendenc ies of the blends. Understanding these behaviors will allow predictions of physical stability of many ingredient blends.

The Indiana Dunes is a sensitive area with great ecological diversity that deserves protecting. The specific study area is in -between Chesterton and Michigan City. The area is mainly agricultural land with forests, grasslands, and wetlands mixed in. This area is prime for future suburban development which is why an overall framework plan is crucial in order to identify critical natural areas for protection and land to acquire for overall connectivity which will allow for a healthy ecosystem to thrive when development does happen. The first step in this process is to determine which areas of land may be prime for protection. By looking at the layers containing forests, grasslands, streams, and wetlands it is possible locate the key existing natural areas. L ooking at a 200 meter buffer along the streams and waterways highlights the land use along the streams, while revealing which parcels may be prime for acquiring in order to link natural areas and/or for the health of the stream. From the results it is evid ent that there are important natural areas that need protection from development in order for the Indiana Dunes to continue to thrive and maintain a high level of water quality for the whole system.

This compound is also highly reactive making it and the enzymes that use it difficult to study. As a result, in order to learn me chanistic information, more stable analogs of malonyl -CoA were made in order to mimic the size, shape and acidity of the thioester and carboxylate groups. Throughout the semester, some malonyl -CoA analogs were synthesized and bacterial inhibition growth as says were performed with Escherichia Coli, Bacillus cereus, and Micrococcus luteus. However, the inhibition predicted was not seen from any of the analogs previously synthesized. As a result, it was concluded that the information suggesting that the analog s did inhibit bacterial growth was not replicable and no minimal inhibition concentration against these microorganisms was able to be determined. To continue this research, more work will be done on synthesis of analogs that replace thioester sulfur with a carbon atom. Currently, we have synthesized several intermediate steps to completing analogs containing a ketone with different carboxylate bioisosteres. These analogs will be used to study different acyl -CoA utilizing enzymes by co -crystallizing the analogs with enzymes such as acetyl -CoA carboxylase (ACC). Finally, the Kd of the different analogs with ACC will be determined to observe how tightly they bind in the enzyme active site. We will measure this value using either isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) or microscale thermophoresis (MST). This kinetic data in combination with the structural data gained through X -ray crystallography will allow us to determine catalytic details of different enzymes, such as ACC.

Author: Megan Riley Abstract: Title: Compassion Fatigue in Laboratory Animal Personnel: Do Euthanasia, Isolation, and Other Factors Impact Professional Quality of Life? Megan Riley An important problem in th e laboratory animal industry is that the constant building and breaking of the human - animal bond may lead to workplace stress. This may impact professional quality of life by increasing compassion fatigue (comprised of burnout and secondary traumatic stres s). In this study, our objective was to explore associations between professional quality of life and potential risk or protective factors in laboratory animal personnel. We surveyed 815 laboratory animal personnel currently working with laboratory animal s in the United States or Canada. These personnel worked in a wide range of settings (e.g. industry, universities), research types (e.g. basic, applied), species (e.g. non -humans primates, mice), and roles (e.g. animal care technicians, veterinarians, labo ratory managers). The survey consisted of a Professional Quality of Life questionnaire and questions about social support, euthanasia, enrichment provisions, and general behaviors towards laboratory animals. Our results indicate that higher burnout and secondary traumatic stress were associated with lower levels of social support, enrichment provisions, and control over euthanasia (p's<0.05). Conversely, lower compassion fatigue was associated with lower level s of stress or pain in animals being cared for, desire for greater enrichment, and general positive behaviors towards laboratory animals (p's<0.05). In conclusion, compassion fatigue is associated with various social and work related factors. This suggest s that personnel could benefit from interventions that increase social support, control over euthanasia and enrichment. Future research could directly investigate these in an interventions trial to improve the professional quality of life of laboratory ani mal personnel.

Author: Morgan Ritzi Abstract: The effects of diversity and density have been well described in regard to plant competition in small model species and crops. Unfortunately, this relationship has hardly been described in larger slow growing species like trees. These concepts are beneficial to understan ding growth and spatial arrangement of species in regard to forest systems which has been poorly understood. This presentation expands these topics and highlights these responses in regard to the American chestnut tree, a highly threatened and historically important species that has been nearly eradicated due to an invasive pathogen, and the Northern red oak, a commonly found Northern hardwood and ornamental. Growth of tree species is compared to different densities and diversities of trees in plantation pl ots at the Martell forest near West Lafayette IN, which represent native species including the American chestnut. Growth is measured by extracting tree cores and using CooR Dendro software to average growth per year of tree rings. Mixed plots of diversity and density are compared, and the expected results show that density has more effects then diversity on growth. By better understanding the ecological principals of diversity and density, then restoration of the American chestnut can be aided, and ecologis t will have a better understanding of basic ecological principles in regard to old standing growth plots.

The Wabash River is situated along the bustling campus of Purdue University and the West Lafayette community, but residents are not able to properl y acknowledge and engage with the river due to a lack of knowledge and infrastructure. The Wabash River is currently prone to flooding often and lacks diverse, vibrant wildlife habitat, yet it has great potential for conceptual and physical connections to the larger community. These connections could manifest through educational opportunities as well as bridging the gaps in existing trail and recreational infrastructure. The project addresses where connections to existing trail systems, parks, and streets c ould be implemented as well as procedures to address flooding and water quality concerns. Through assessing information found on site, ArcGIS data, and in Purdue University's Campus Master Plan (Giant Leaps), an overlay analysis was created to identify pri ority areas for each type of implemented change. The project also seeks to identify research and educational opportunities that would strengthen the overall character of the site and connection to educational institutions. These opportunities have been ide ntified through analysis of current ongoing research that relates to the river habitats. The overlay analysis indicated that there are several access points that could connect to existing Wabash Heritage Trail, River Road, and Tapawingo Park infrastructure and programming through enhanced plant and land manipulation that mitigates flooding and promotes habitat. Educational opportunities are present with natural resources and wildlife research being conducted at Purdue University.

One enrichment technique that can help is rat tickling, which mimics aspects of rat rough -and-tumble play. In juvenile and singly housed adult rats, tickling has been shown to elicit 50 -kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) - indicative of positive emotions - and increase approach behavior. However, it's unknown if adult breeder rats (who may play less) could also benefit from tickling. Therefore, our o bjective was to explore responses of adult breeder rats to tickling by analyzing USVs. Eight 8 week old Long Evans (LE) and CD breeder rat pair (N=16) were tickled for 7 non -consecutive weekdays and then at weekly cage changes. Tickling continued througho ut breeding/gestation as pairs were separated and females had pups. USVs were recorded and coded into subcategories: 50 -kHz (trills, flats, or other), 22 -kHz (short or long), and lows. Long 22 -kHz range are indicative of negative emotions. Preliminary results were analyzed with descriptive statistics (median; minimum -maximum). Although data analysis is still in progress, our initial analysis of 90 vocalization files show large individual differences in response to tickling. Positive 50 -kHz other (69; 2 -365) and trills Long 22 -kHz USVs (0; 0 -56) were less common, but occurred in high numbers in some sessions. In conclusion, it appears that breeder rats have large individual differences in response to tickling, with some animals showing very positive responses and others showing more negative responses. This suggests the importance of monitoring USVs when tickling breeding animals.

Predation also impacts plover chick survival. Both plovers and their predators are influenced by human activity on beaches. However, the interaction between the direct influence of recreating humans upon plovers and the effects of these same humans upon the plovers predators are less clear. Humans might create a pred ator-free space for the plovers by driving predators out of areas where plovers are found. Alternatively, humans might attract more predators to areas where plovers nest increasing the risk of predation. Individual -Based modeling (IBM) can be an important tool for comparing scenarios such as the concurrent interactions of predators and prey to human disturbance. IBMs work by incorporating empirical data into virtual models that predict outcomes for different circumstances given a common set of assumptions. We used such an IBM to investigate the effects of human density, beach configuration, and two separate avian predators on important population rates such as chick survival, nest survival, chick weight, and average time spent flushing in response to disturb ance. Using statistical models and effect sizes, we can relate our findings back to managers of plover habitat and advise them on which disturbances could be regulated to mitigate risk to plovers. Our findings will also inform and direct future research an d investigation into the most harmful disturbance combinations. For example, predators that flee from humans at far distances may forage exclusively in the dunes areas where plovers forage. This could be especially detrimental on a beach with high human de nsities or narrow dunes. Research Mentor : Patrick Zollner, Department of Forestry and Natural Resources, College of Agriculture ; Alexander Cohen, Cardno Poster Number: 27a :: Life Sciences College of Agriculture Neuroprotective Abilities of Overexpressing Nfe2L1 in disease (PD) is a complex progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects 6 -7 million people. PD is characterized by a profound loss of dopamin ergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. One of the defining pathological events occurring in PD is the aggregation of aSyn which ultimately leads to formation of Lewy bodies and neurotoxicity. While abnormal protein accumulation is key, a co mbination of age induced oxidative damage, proteasome dysfunction, and environmental factors plays a significant role as well in the progression of pathology. Alpha -synuclein aggregation leads to oxidative and proteasomal stress, and the proteasomal stress results in inefficient protein clearance systems which in turn increases aggregation of alpha -synuclein. Such a vicious circle culminates in the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Thus, any therapeutic strategies to attenuate alpha -synuclein aggregation or in creasing proteasomal and antioxidant activities would be beneficial. Nuclear factor erythroid -derived 2 -related factor 1 (Nfe2L1) is an ER bound transcription factor which translocates to the nucleus then upregulates the expression of Antioxidant Response Elements (ARE) - regulated genes and proteasome assembly genes when proteasomal activities are inhibited. In recent research, it has been shown that Nfe2L1 is downregulated in PD patients' brains, and the lack of Nfe2L1 increases the sensitivity to oxidative and proteotoxic stress. These observations suggested the hypothesis that overexpressing Nfe2L1 would alleviate oxidative stress and proteasomal dysfunction to protect neurons against PD -related insults. Our data suggests that Nfe2L1 expression can decreas e the MG132 induced proteasomal stress in rat primary cortical astrocytes oxidative stress induced by neurotoxin paraquat. Nfe2L1 overexpression also shows a trend towards protection against aSyn neurotoxicity. Currently we are working to test t he neuroprotective effects of different variants of Nfe2L1 in order to find the most and transcriptionally active form.

The city of Gary, Indiana has suffered from decades of decline, being so intimately tied to the fortunes of the U.S. Steel industry. It has resulted in a dramatic depopulation of the city, resulting in much of Gary being overtaken by nature. We will be explor ing and codifying steps taken by the Philadelphia Horticultural Society through their LandCare program to inform us on how we can better address blight issues in Gary, on a limited budget while maximizing the involvement of local stakeholders. Our proposal will additionally include plans to develop renewable energy on existing \"brownfield\" sites in Gary, on places already identified through the EPA's Re -Power program, as this will be an additional means of generating more taxable revenue, on a city notoriou s for having too much land for too little people. We will be using the neighborhood of Central in Gary, as our pilot neighborhood for our purposed interventions, with an eye for further expansion to other neighborhoods, in time. Using GIS for inventory pu rposes and layering layers of information over one another for analysis, we proposed ways to turn Gary around, by the way of many cost effective, small but socially conscious neighborhood projects.

Traditionally, the poultry industry has managed the gut microbiome composition and diversity with the use of antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs). Lately these products have shown ineffe ctiveness and have increased the concern about antibiotic resistant bacteria and transmission to humans, through the consumption of contaminated products. This project will determine the effects of feeding corn with different carotenoid (lutein and zeaxant hin) profiles on the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome of broilers and layers, across three animal trials with a total of 70 pens and 1620 animals. Additionally, the project will determine if the microbiome composition has correlation with an imal production characteristics such as weight, color of muscles, eggs and susceptibility to diseases (coccidiosis and footpad dermatitis). To perform the study, the DNA of 198 cecal and 144 ileal samples of fully -grown chicken will be extracted, quantifie d and normalized. Then, amplicon libraries will be made by amplifying the 16s rRNA gene. Next, the resulting PCR products will be normalized and pooled in equal ratios. Finally, the amplicon library will be submitted for sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq seq uencer. Overall, the project will compare differences between bacterial populations among the treatments, and determine correlations between gut microbiome, different corn diets and litter environment. The identification of dominant bacterial genus in eac h of the treatments will allow the establishment of a relationship between bacterial genus and productive variables.

Labor is the single largest expense in agriculture, and the landscape m aintenance industry is not an exception. Labor costs can represent between 30% to 55% of all costs for landscape business (IBIS World, 2018). Thus, labor savings is one of the most important tasks for managers in the landscape industry. In looking for cos t-effective ways to lower labor costs, landscape maintenance businesses have started using Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs), being paclobutrazol one of the most tested products. Our study investigates the economic impact of PGRs on the labor savings of lands cape maintenance companies. Specifically, we investigate the labor savings (in dollars) determined by shortening pruning time and waste disposal reductions. We used a partial budget analysis to evaluate the financial effect of incremental changes in labor savings due to an adoption of PGRs for shrub maintenance. Some results show that applying PGRs can, on average, reduce the number of prunes by 64.5% and the time of pruning by 56%. Together, these results show landscape maintenance businesses can reduce 44 3 hours of labor per year due to labor savings in pruning, depending on shrub specie. Considering a minimum wage of $7.25/hour, this translates into expected savings of around $3,217 per year. In addition to the data obtained from the study, our study will draw conclusions on improved occupational safety, labor reallocation savings, and labor productivity due to shorter maintenance time.

The hypoxic zone impacts the productivity of aquatic ecosystems and threatens industries that rely on coastal areas. Soil Health Management Sys tems (SHMS) have been introduced to reduce nutrient runoff and downstream pollution. Farming practices impact downstream waterways so it is important to understand what influences the adoption of conservation practices such as SHMS. A survey was developed to collect producer and farmland owner demographic information and to determine whether they adopt conservation practices. Five conservation practices were evaluated: SHMS, nutrient management plans, conservation plans, conservation tillage, and cover crop s. We sought to deduce if there were demographic differences between SHMS users and non -users and if SHMS users were more likely to adopt other conservation practices. Overall, the response rate was 36% and just over a quarter (26%; n=96) of respondents us e SHMS. Both SHMS users and non -users tend to be male, approximately 60 years old, and have been farming for about 35 years. However, SHMS users have higher levels of education and tend to have smaller farm sizes. Additionally, SHMS users are more likely t o implement the four other conservation practices. Low education and large farm size may be barriers to the adoption of conservation practices. To increase adoption, it may be effective to target farmers in those categories to create accessible conservatio n programs. Since SHMS use increases the adoption of other conservation practices, it may be useful to facilitate the implementation of SHMS to increase the adoption of other conservation practices.

Our objectives were to determine the effect of disrupting the CTS on: 1) Blood glucose, beta-hydroxy butyrate (BHBA) and non -esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in the pre and post -partum, and 2) milk production to 60 days in milk (DIM). Five weeks before expected calving (B EC) multiparous cows (n=32) were moved to a tie -stall barn and divided into two treatments: control (n=16; 16 h light: 8 h dark) or phase -shifted (PS, n=16), a chronic jet lag paradigm which shifted the light -dark phase 6 h every 3 days until parturition. All cows were exposed to control lighting after calving. Blood samples were taken at least bi -weekly at 0600 in the pre- and postpartum to measure glucose, BHBA and NEFA, and every 4 h over 48 h at three time points: 23 BEC, 9 BEC, and 5 days postpartum ( PP). NEFA was measured using colorimetric assay; blood glucose and BHBA were measured with a Centrivet monitor. Core body temperature was recorded vaginally using ibutton data loggers at 23 BEC, 9 BEC, and 5 PP. PS significantly (P<0.05) shifted phase and attenuated circadian rhythms of core body temperature. Daily feed intake was not different between control (30.5 \u00b1 0.6 kg) and PS (29.8 \u00b1 0.6 kg) cows. Blood glucose was significantly (P<0.05) decreased in PS cows pre and postpartum, however there was no effect of treatment on BHBA or NEFA concentration. Cosine fit analysis found control cows exhibited circadian rhythms of plasma NEFA only at 5PP (R2=0.69; P=0.002); whereas PS cows lacked circadian rhythms throughout study. Milk yield and fat corrected m ilk yield were significantly increased (P<0.05) through 60 DIM in PS (42 \u00b1 0.92 and 43.5 \u00b1 1.04 kg/d) 0.92 and 40.3 \u00b1 1.04 kg/d) cows. Thus, lack of difference in BHBA, NEFA and feed intake along with decreased blood glucose, support s that disrupting circadian rhythms in late parturition increases milk production efficiency.

Two key aspects of diversity, important to consider in the classroom, are sex and race. To create a safe, inclusive classroom environment and provide students with appropriate instruction, teachers must have the knowledge, skills, and confidence to integrate issues of social justice. However, limited evidence exists in this area. Our proposed study employs survey methodology to meet this need. Using both open -and closed - ended items, we examine responses from a representative sample of Indiana elementary school teachers. Mixed -methods analyses will: (a) document teachers' knowledge and efficacy in diversity instruction; (b) address the extent to which teacher responses differ depending on sex, race, grade -level, content area, and school locale (urban vs rural), and (b) identify teachers' concerns and needs. Our findings will yield implications for practice as well as for research on this critical issue. Research Mentor : P.

However, we find that individual captives' stories complicate the picture, especially when European captives convert to Islam (called becoming Renegades), such as Ahmed el Inglizi, an Englishmen, and French mathema tician and architect Theodore Cornut. Captured Europeans often returned home to tell of mistreatment, but we often miss the story of the European that stayed in Muslim countries after being captured.

The project focuses on one individual, Victor L. Berge r, from Milwaukee, WI. The goal is to investigate the actual attitudes of major media sources per the time period, not the assumed. The method that has been used for this investigation is article analysis and classification into one of three categories. Af ter reading an article from a major media publisher, such as Current Events, the articles were categorized based on bias towards the subject, Victor L. Berger, and the citation was added in an electronic spreadsheet. This project has been a continuation ov er the course of multiple semesters in which over 340 articles have been compiled. It has been observed that the overwhelming majority of the articles that were sampled from the period held a neutral bias towards Victor L. Berger and socialists in general, which is not what is generally perceived by many individuals in our current time. The data compiled asserts the stance that many major media outlets in the period of 1917 to 1921 gave vastly neutral reports on events that were happening in Congress and ma jor urban areas concerning national -scale socialists and pacifists.

While professional development opportunities are oftentimes limited for special education teachers, such professional growth opportunities are typically c ompletely unavailable for paraprofessionals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a program in which preschool special education teachers served as coaches for paraprofessionals. Using a single case research multiple baseline design across paraprofess ionals and child dyads, we evaluated the effects of the teachers as coaches program on paraprofessional implementation fidelity of a behavior intervention and corresponding child engagement in challenging behavior and appropriate communication. Results sho wed that with teacher coaching, paraprofessionals increased their behavior intervention implementation fidelity to 100%. Results maintained 100% fidelity for two participants and were above baseline for one participant. Results also showed corresponding de creases in child challenging behavior and increases in appropriate communication. Implications for research and practice in supporting paraprofessionals are discussed.

Jose, McKenzie Elliott, Vishal Meyyappan The experiment's objective was to measure the amount of unintentional electromagnetic radiated and conducted emissions from a 2.5 GHz router to estimate compliance with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. Conducted emissions were tested using a line impedance network stabilizer (LISN) and radiated emissions were tested using an antenna and near field probes. Emissions were measur ed using an oscilloscope and a spectrum analyzer. The emissions from the router to power line were certainly in the allowable emission range specified by FCC Electromagnetic Compliance limits. The in -band radiated emissions were in compliance. Some out-of-band emissions were noted outside the 2.5 GHz operating range of the router. Based on these observations, it was concluded that the product met the FCC compliance limits for in -band emissions. Further study of the exact FCC limits for the out -of-band emissions is needed.

When one of the sticks is removed, the energy is released in the form of an \"explosion\". Stick bombs are a pop ular toy, but they also have properties that may be useful in engineering applications. Several models of different stick bomb configurations were created in Abaqus to observe the build -up and release of energy in each structure. Each model consisted of an assembly of multiple instances of a single part, which had the material properties of a popsicle stick. Boundary conditions and contact definitions were then added to the model to \"assemble\" the stick bomb. The constraints were removed, resulting in the f ormation of residual stress in a similar way to a real stick bomb. Finally, the end \"trigger\" stick was released to create the explosion. The models provide both a visual representation of the reaction and results about the residual stress and release of e nergy throughout the simulations.

Previous work has explored the student experience of higher education within refugee camps, but focu sed on differing types of data [2]. Surveys provide a unique opportunity to look at trends over time using analysis of repeated measures, while also using the same subjects to analyze specific points in the course. Preliminary findings of these data publ ished in prior work [3] examined the more surface level experience of students in the course. This research will build upon the original findings by analyzing the student experience in a more holistic view, by confirming initial findings and generating ne w results through more robust quantitative measures. Qualitative analysis will also be a component, using interviews from previous courses, as well as incorporating preliminary findings from open - ended responses from students enrolled in the current cours e, with which thematic analysis will be utilized to confirm and expand upon the quantitative findings.

Bioengineering, or the use of artificial tissue, organs, or organ components to replace damaged or absent parts of the body, has been impacting the field of medicine for generatio ns because of its ability to replace an organ donor. Commonly known as regenerative medicine, this technique uses a biological scaffold, or a structure that has the capability to grow human tissue, to inject a human's stem cells into; thus, decreasing the risk of the patient rejecting the newly transplanted organ. As many researchers concluded, the biological scaffold approach is the most effective; however, there are certain ethical concerns related to 3D -printing biological tissue, especially when using the stem cells of various patients, or 3D -printing body parts for the use in teaching.

By using Reinforced Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks performing image processing, the drone will be trained to navigate itself towards buildings and perform bu ilding inspection without scanning the whole structure. The algorithms for Reinforced Deep Learning can be used to drive drones autonomously and perform inspections currently done by humans. The stability of the structure of buildings are unknown when thes e inspections are performed. This application would greatly reduce the risk of individuals involved in inspecting the building structures and provide greater insight into the stability of these structures.

Because the color space CMY is used as the input for printing modules, converting color from YyCxCz to CMY plays a key role in getting the most vibrant colored results from printers. While the process is very likely nonlinear, the current approaches are mostly simple linear interpolation methods, which leaves an untapped potential to researc h new, unconventional ways of mapping the two color -spaces. In this project, we proposed to use machine learning for converting YyCxCz color spaces to CMY color spaces. This was done by gathering large amounts of YyCxCz -CMY combination data, and feeding th at data into a neural network which uses regression to map the two spaces. In the end, the results from the neural net were tested for accuracy by comparing the results from using linear interpolation and seeing the actual color printed. Research Mentor : Baekdu Choi, ECE, Purdue University Jan Allebach, ECE, Purdue University ; Poster Number: 45a :: Life Sciences College of Engineering Improved Biofuel The metabolism of E. coli and other microbes can be engineered to create valuable chemicals such as biofuels, and medicines. However, process efficiency is limited by the toxicity of intermediates in the production pathway, which induces cellular stress and kills production in cells. By fusing elastin -like polypeptides (ELPs) with sigma factors (SF), we propose a stress feedback system can be created to recognize cues of cellular health and autoregulate expression of bioproduction pathways for improved health and production. ELPs undergo a sharp, reversible, phase transition causing an aggregation above a certain temperature (Tt) based on conditions that align with intracellular health such as intracellular pH. This b ehavior, along with the ability to control Tt through sequence alterations, makes ELPs ideal sensors for controlling gene expression. Fused SF, which activated gene expression, are sequestered in ELP -SF aggregates above the transition temperature, reducing their free concentration. To evaluate the potential of ELP -SF to control gene expression, we expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) from a promoter driven by the fused SF. In vivo, this system activated the expression of GFP at levels comparable to a S F control. However, at elevated temperatures, the system reduces gene expression by 20% relative to the control demonstrating the ability of the construct to control gene expression. The dynamic performance of the system was also modeled in MATLAB to revea l key parameters that affect system behavior. Parameter values were determined experimentally, and a range of temperatures were used to further evaluate the system. These results validate our main hypothesis and suggest a new strategy to optimize the susta inable production of valuable chemicals from microbes. Research Mentor : Kevin Solomon, ABE, engineering ; Mrugesh Parasa, ABE, engineering Poster Number: 46a :: Innovative Technology/Entrepreneurship/Design College of Engineering Poster Presentation Author: Hao Chen Yining Huang Abstract: The milestone management project aims to provide a solution to better manage the more than 20 simultaneous, interdependent research projects within the Arequipa Nexus Institute for Sustainable F ood, Energy, Water, and the Environment to allow stronger collaboration and resource management. To achieve this, we have created a web -based visual analytics dashboard that ingests project progress data from different research teams, and presents the comb ined knowledge on a progress timeline, the dependency between different collaborating parts, and the geospatial locations of the research, allowing more effective knowledge transfer and project management. We update our design iteratively based on the feed back we receive from the collaborators to address the following challenges: First, we aim to improve the usability of the map view, which displays the location of projects. We have updated the project selection process from hover to mouse click and provide d an intuitive way to return to displaying the overview. We are also collecting spatial data from different collaborators, and the data received might be in different formats. Thereby another task is to feed the data given onto the map with data cleaning from different types of data to a uniform format. Second, we updated the visual analytics in the system to help users understand the connections and dependencies between the different collaborators and projects better. As part of future research, we plan o n designing a new visual representation for project dependencies. The goal is to help users better understand the different perspectives of the project more efficiently.

We are developing a reinforcement learning agent to play Factorio, a game where you build and maintain factor ies, without prior domain knowledge. Factorio is the perfect environment for deep reinforcement learning as it supports extensive modification using an in -game debugging mode which allows our agent to interface with the game effortlessly. The reinforcement learning agent implements a policy of actions based on the reward function, continuously optimizing towards incremental goals specified by the user. The ultimate goal of our agent is to learn how to automate production, find creative solutions to maximize production efficiency in the game, and then transfer this learning to the design and management of real -world factories.

There have been little interventions or assessments of intervention benefits in operating room (OR) environments. Passive upper -body exoskeletons may decrease upper -body biomechanical loads by supporting worker s' arms, shoulders, and/or back, decreasing risk for MS symptoms. However, feasibility of exoskeletons for sterile OR environments and complex surgical work requires investigation. Purpose: Determine the facilitators and barriers to adopting passive exosk eletons in the OR. Methods: Seven surgical residents, four surgicaltechnicians, and one attending surgeon participated in focus groups answering questions regarding technology adoption, supporting worker tasks, safety, and health. Responses were recorde d, and transcribed. Then content analysis was performed by three raters using NVivo to identify themes regarding exoskeleton implementation in the OR. Results: Four main themes emerged: 1) characteristics of individuals, 2) benefits, 3) barriers, and 4) intervention characteristics. Barriersincluded maintaining sterilization, lack of familiarity, and inability to immediately observe the exoskeletons' benefits. Benefits identified were long -term reduction of MS symptoms and development of ergonomics traini ng. Exoskeleton intervention characteristics such as usability in the OR, and characteristics of individuals were perceived to impact adoption. Themes identified can be used to support future work facilitating adopting exoskeletons for surgical teams. Conclusions: The potential of exoskeletons to improve workforce retention, decrease MS symptoms, and prompt development of ergonomics training was recognized. Results suggest that adopting exoskeletons can be advantageous in the OR. However, barriers such as cost, maintenance, and team member buy -in of exoskeleton adoption need to be addressed. Research Mentor : Jackie S. Cha School of Industrial Engineering College of Engineering ; Poster Number: 49a :: Innovative Technology/Entrepreneurship/Design College of Engineering Virtual Teaching Assistant Author: Elliot Edmunds Mithuna Thottethodi Abstract: With a growing size of classes in universities and the increasing demand for online courses, professors and teaching assistants are noticing an increasing burden on communication with students, such as email, discussion board, Piazza etc. Additionally, it is usually found that similar questions are asked and answered repeatedly. Therefore, there is a need to filter the frequently asked questions out and leave teaching staff to more intellectually demanding issues. In addition, instant responses to students are also conducive to improving their learning experience. This project is aimed to provide a chatbot to fulfill all the needs stated above. It is expected to read users' questions and give a corresponding response. In order to accomplish this objective, an open -source NLP software \"ChatScript\" is used as the backbone of our application. The chatbot will be able to i dentify students' needs and provide a proper response based on a knowledge base the admin created. The usual responses could be the answers from the knowledge base, forwarding questions to teaching staff, scheduled appointments etc. For the convenience of admins, the knowledge base should be the only place to keep all the answers to the questions the chatbot is designed to answer. Additionally, it should be readable and comprehensible for a layman of ChatScript language. The expectation is that one can lear n to create a knowledge base within 5 minutes. The main tasks are the following: Building a simple bot that can answer basic questions about the ECE 477 course: Parse information from the website. E.g. The due dates of homework assignments, important event dates, course policies, etc. Using python to transform human -readable data into ChatScript knowledge base. Writing the ChatScript rules to provide a response to incoming sentences and query the knowledgebase. Develop the connection between a database int elligible to normal people and the knowledge base of the ChatScript engine. The database must be designed as it can be built easily by people with no understanding of ChatScript language, so that teaching staff is willing to use the product. Set up the web server and frontend design for teachers and students. Teachers will be able to easily input information into the database, and track student's questions from their log. Students will be able to talk to the chatbot easily. The preliminary product will be tested on previous data of interactions between students and teaching staff. The testing will be considered as a pass if the chatbot successfully provides correct answers to corresponding questions and forwards to teaching staff the questions without a co rresponding answer in the knowledge base. The plan for next semester is to expand the chatbot so that it can answer more questions, and provide more functions that are needed by users. In addition, we hope to connect our chatbot to the popular chatting app s such as Messenger and WhatsApp so that students can get easy access.

This analysis is done by hand, and can be laborious and exhaustive work - classifying the species, measuring the diameter of the trunk at breast height, and so on. Our team seeks to automate this process by employing an array of cameras mounted on a backpack, which is operated by a single person traversing the forest while the cameras record footage. This video footage is then interpreted off -site autonomously. Our team has adopted specialized cameras that return both color and depth information. The color information is exceedingly useful in classifying the sp ecies and visually derivable characteristics of a tree, while the depth information is used to compute physical dimensions and properties of each tree.The FIA team is invested in developing a machine -learning solution that is able to classify each tree's s pecies, as well as algorithmically detect the trunk diameters of each tree from only the recorded video. The success of our solution here could be adapted to analyze more than just trees, but entire ecosystems and environments. The information that we are able to gather can be cross - referenced and layered with other geographical information to give a clear picture on the state of a forest, but also the environment itself.

The motivation behind the SoC design is to create a core based on a free and open -source instruction set architecture for a wide range of hardware design users, including students and researchers. Applications of this design include, but are not limited to, resources for microcontroll er-based projects for ECE 36200 (Microprocessor Systems and Interfacing) and ECE 47700 (Digital Systems Senior Design). Multiple sub -teams are working to build and test the different parts of the SoC. The core sub -team is responsible for designing, impleme nting and integrating the digital logic that goes into the chip. They are also updating the core to the most recent version of the RISC - V instruction set architecture (ISA). It will then integrate a floating -point unit (FPU) to allow the chip to perform operations on non -integer values, which is essential in scientific workloads. The analog sub -team is responsible for the transistor level design of the chip to allow the chip to process analog signals. While basic tests will be conducted to improve the overa ll performance after the design is finished, more rigorous testing will be performed by the verification sub -team. This sub -team's mission is to validate and confirm the peripherals on the chip are working as expected. To accomplish this, Universal Verific ation Methodology (UVM) was employed to structure the tests. This project allows students to have hands -on experience with the full integrated circuit design flow, from specification and implementation to verification and fabrication.

We want to design, implement and evaluate a database that can retrieve image or video data, build index by object detection and store the respective data and index in an easy to access manner. Due to lack of image feature information, indexing and accessing data is cumbersome. However with the image database, students and researchers can furthe r their work by having access to specialized datasets. We are using a scalable object storing service, Minio, to store images that are retrieved from cameras. Features extracted from these images will be stored as indexes in Vitess, our MySQL database syst em and data can be queried by users through our command line interface.

In order to support teachers, we need to develop a better understanding of the actions of experienced teachers who are successfully engaging their students in these new topics. To do this, we qualitatively analyzed the actions of experienced teachers to address the following research question: How do first grade teachers' classroom actions change as they gain experience teaching engineering and CT? Thr ee first grade teachers from the same school who had implemented the same integrated STEM and CT curriculum and followed the curriculum closely for at least two years in a row were the focus of this study. Researchers analyzed video and interview data with the help of a veteran teacher to identify teacher and student actions and talk across the curriculum. Interviews with each teacher following completion of the unit were also used to assess experience with CT and engineering design. Results from the video analysis show that many teacher actions change from year one to year two. One interesting difference that was seen from year one to year two was the extent to which the teachers let students ramble until they come up with relevant ideas versus when the tea chers' decided to intervene or redirect conversation to keep the lesson moving. Analysis of the interview data revealed that teachers felt more comfortable and even willing to make small modifications to the curriculum and their teaching in the second year. Developing a better understanding of how veteran teachers engage their students with computational thinking and EDP lessons can provide insight for professional development and for supporting early elementary teachers when implementing STEM and CT curric ula.

Tank, Education, College of Human Sciences, Iowa State University Poster Number: 54a :: Mathematical/Computa tional Sciences College of Engineering Cost -Effective Active Transfer Learning Author s: Jacob Harmon Li Yon Tan Jack Hyslop Isha Ghodgaonkar Abstract: Training a neural network often requires large datasets that may contain redundant data. An instance of data is redundant if it contains features from a previously learned domain or features repeated within the current target domain. For supervised learni ng, redundant data increases the cost of labeling. Active learning methods strive to filter for the most informative instances. Transfer learning is used to boost model accuracy while exploiting the overlap between the source domain of the pre -trained mode l and the target domain. Previous active learning methods incorporate some form of outlier detection. However, these methods rely on clustering and reduced dimensional graphs that result in information loss. We propose a solution that entails curating a smaller subset of the larger dataset that is representative and informative. Our approach is a three -step process. The first step pools data using an open set classifier that distinguishes between seen and unseen classes. The second step sorts instances from highest entropy to lowest entropy. Finally, a novel batch sampling step uses the Kullback -Leibler divergence to identify diverse data between instances from the sorted set. Our approach outperforms active learning methods when compared and evaluated by t he change in training accuracy for each additional label queried.

They can degrade water quality, severely impacting the economies of fisheries, tourism industries, and residential properties. We present an autonomous multi -robot system for algae removal in various environments usin g mechanical measures, which seemed to be the most environmental -friendly and immediate method of control for the algae bloom. The proposed system is based on a multi -robot system composed of a heterogeneous team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and Unmann ed Surface Vehicles (USVs). The main task of the UAV is to provide a global view of the environment to identify algae patches. We developed a machine learning - based computer vision system to detect algae in various environments and conduct a path planning for the USVs, which are allocated near algae patches and remove the algae. We aimed for the small size and the low cost of the USV by assembling most of the components from PVC pipes. After extensive simulations on the model regarding the structural safety and the water/air flow, the USV was assembled and tested in indoor water, where we had success in its floatation, the algae suction, and the device control. As for the future work, the filtering system will be designed in order to separate algae from wate r efficiently and perform its task in outdoor water resources, such as lakes and ponds. The problem tended to occur due to the algae attachment to the device in the unexpected areas, so the algae separation will be very significant in the future work. Research Mentor : Byung -Cheol Min, Department of Computer and Information Technology, Polytechnic Institute ; Wonse Jo, Department of Computer and Information Technology, Polytechnic Institute Poster Number: 56a :: Mathematical/Computa tional Sciences College Abstract: The purpose of this project is to reliably detect and classify emotions portrayed in facial expressions. Facial expressions are often classified using appearance -based features or geometric -based features from the faces. We will be using a two -branched network that will utilize both appearance -based features and geometric -based feature s during its classification decision. We will utilize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn appearance -based features from each emotion. We will train the CNN model using an image dataset of 305GB containing 750,000 images that are labeled with the emotions each picture is expressing. As for the geometric - based features, we plan on training a Neural Network with features from facial landmarks of faces expressing each emotion. The Neural Network will serve as the second branch of the classification m ethod. Both branches will then be joined at the end and make the final decision of what emotion the face is expressing. One of our applications would be using this emotion detection model to detect undesired emotions to help manage large audiences/excessiv e images, giving feedback to the user. We have done much research on Image Processing and plan on doing extensive research on the topics of Machine Learning and facial recognition to design the project. We also have an immense dataset that should allow us to train our CNN very well, leading to very accurate results. After two semesters of work, we are hoping for around 80 -85% accuracy on emotion detection - a number decided on by the group since we have very powerful dataset that should be enough for a very high accuracy percent. We do not plan on building a flawless CNN though, which would lower the effectiveness or our dataset. We plan on measuring our results primarily on the satisfaction of the user since our emotion detection can be used in many ways, bu t we will also consider the increase in productivity/production the user has gained from our product. Detecting emotions from images and videos has many implementations for everyday tasks, so creating such a project will have many benefits for all people.

ADEPT -m is user-based MATLAB toolbox that has the visualization and data manipulation capabilities focused on simulating and modeling photovoltaic cells. The matter in concern regarding ADEPT -m is that it a tedious job to set each of the 128 variables a nd learn the appropriate commands. An extensive knowledge of programming in MATLAB is required to simulate a proper photovoltaic device. Therefore, our goal is to design a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that is simple yet intuitive enough so that it can be nefit a multitude of users. Previously, the ADEPT -m team created a main page which directs the user to each of the three prominent function menus; Build, Test and Examine. The basic functionality requirements of Test and Examine menus have been met. In order to complete the GUI, the focus will be the Build menu so that it will make constructing the desired device to model more effective for research purposes. Currently, the focus is on creating pre -determined classes that store default values for common dev ice materials such as Silicon, without having manually look up parameters to set up their desired device. This feature will also be able to reduce user -based error in order to construct an accurate device. Ultimately, the GUI aims to ease the simulation pr ocess, allowing users with less knowledge of MATLAB programming to utilize this research tool. Research Mentor : JEFFERY L GRAY Electrical and Computer Engineering ; None Poster Number: 58a :: Life Sciences College of Engineering The S tudy of Common Foodborne Pathogens and Functions that Influence Biofilm Author: Carroll Abstract: The food pathogens Salmonella, Listeria, and Escherichia coli, present a growing problem for society because of their ability to form and maintain biofilms. The current focus of food safety is preventing bacterial contamination, however, if these methods f ail to prevent biofilm formation and attachment, there are few to no effective procedures preventing contamination outbreaks. Through bioinformatics research surrounding biofilm triggers and pathogenicity functions, possible methods to destroy and preven t biofilms can be found. Specifically, investigating the evolutionary relationships of these species, the various causes of biofilm formation, the functions of antibiotic resistance, and the proteins that can break down biofilms all help form a deeper unde rstanding of the issue and how to solve it. This study found that many environmental factors cause Salmonella and E. Coli to form biofilms. All three species rely on the Lux S gene involved in quorum sensing to begin biofilm creation. The protein familie s of penicillin binding proteins and beta -lactamase have a strong presence in the genomes of all three species, while Listeria is the only species with the VEG gene and significantly higher amounts of metallo -beta- lactamase. Lastly, the glycosyl hydrolase protein families found in the bacteria have a potential to break down their own biofilms, eliminating the need for antibiotics and harsh chemicals. The results presented in this study form a critical foundation calling for further lab research.

Google's DeepMind Technologies developed learning algorithms that could play Atari video games and also demonstrated the ir famous AlphaGo algorithm which outperformed professional Go players. However, little research has been done on learning algorithms developed to complete the particularly difficult single -player games. In particular, much further research could be done o n developing learning algorithms for mechanically challenging games such as \"bullet hell\" games. We believe that agents could learn to efficiently evade obstacles utilizing deep reinforcement learning. The purpose of this study is to understand how to crea te such an efficient evasion algorithm. The deep learning model utilized is a convolutional neural network trained with a variant of the Q -learning algorithm. The model is given positional coordinate data and bullet location data as its input and outputs a value function to determine the best following action. The agent controls the directional inputs of the game's user avatar and its inputs, or actions, are modeled as a two -dimensional Markov decision process. The agent uses the game's internal score and t he amount of time its user avatar avoids being hit by obstacles as its target and experiments with its inputs each episode to increase the maximum reward. Each training episode is reset when the user avatar is hit by the bullets.

Our team is tasked with utilizing Signals of Opportunity to determine changes in the coefficient of reflection of the surface of the earth. This data can then be used to determine soil moisture content several meters below the surface, in the root - zone of the farmland we are surveying. Previous attempts have been made in the EHF band, but these signals only penetrate a few centimeters into the ground. By receiving signals in the VHF band, we are able to calculate soil moi sture content several times further beneath the surface, leading to more long -term measurements of soil moisture. Previously, performing remote sensing with Signals of Opportunity was limited to stationary towers or manned flights. Stationary towers have l imited range, and manned flights are expensive. By utilizing a Software Defined Radio and a commercial UAV, remote sensing using these signals can be done autonomously. A USRP E310 Software Defined Radio has been configured to collect VHF signals from ORB COMM communication satellites. The radio and RX antennas are attached to a DJI Matrice 600 Pro UAV such that the receiver can collect data from different locations autonomously. Our team expects to measure various coefficients of reflection dependent upon the moisture content of the medium that the signal reflects off of. In the case of more torrid soil conditions, we would expect a low relative coefficient, properly irrigated soil would have a coefficient between 0.6 -0.9, and a body of water would produce a coefficient and a body of water would produce a coefficient ~1.0.

Research Mentor : Jared / College of Engineering ; Poster Number: 61a :: Life Sciences College of Engineering An Automated Supine Pressor Test: Implications for the Ma Aditi Acharya Abstract: Preeclampsia, which involves excess protein in the urine as well as hypertension in pregnancy, affects up to 5 - 8% of pregnancies and 50 -75,000 women die from preeclampsia -related complications every year [1]. This is a dangerous obstacle that can affect both the mother and fetus, often leading to premature birth. For those in low-resource settings, more than 250,000 neonatal preterm births are a result of preeclampsia because these mothers lack the necessary access to healthcare and the opportunit y to seek out medical expertise. In this study, we are automating a detection tool for preeclampsia, referred to as the supine pressor test (SPT), to allow clinicians and expecting mothers to track the risk for preeclampsia longitudinally throughout pregna ncy.

An automatic pilot has been built that can drive the vehicle in real time. The purpose of this pilot is to generate vehicle c ontrol commands that will direct the vehicle from the starting point to the finishing point, without hitting unforeseen obstacles. A remote controlled vehicle has been transformed into an autonomous vehicle by implementing appropriate steering logic based on incoming data from ultrasonic distance sensors. The Team has strategized that the use of the Raspberry Pi single board computer would be the best candidate to function as the brain of the project due to open source software and familiarity of use.The cu rrent steering logic has been refined through an obstacle course based testing in scenarios with low gradient surfaces.For future iterations of this project, implementation of object recognition via a Pi CAM can relay what the ALV is seeing and with the in troduction of a GPS module the user can actively monitor the coordinates of the vehicle . In addition to this, the project could be improved with a wider variation of testing in less controlled environments. : Dr. Samuel Midkiff, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University ; Poster Number: 63a :: Mathematical/Computational Sciences College of Engineering Machine Learning Edge Node Processor for Remote Sensing Applications Author: Vadim Nikiforov Chan Weng Yan Abstract: Lightweight microcontrollers typically don't have the computational power required for performing machine learning algorithms locally. This restricts their options to either transmitting significant amounts of raw data over a network where inferencing is performed remotely or limiting the amount of data it can process. If a microcontroller can perform inference locally and thus \"sense -and-act\", it can have significant time and energy savings compared to a microcontroller implementing a \"sense -and-send\" model. Additionally, a microcontroller that is less reliant on a network will have a smaller attack su rface, thus improving its security as well. However, most hardware accelerators for machine learning come with significant area and energy costs, which make them unsuitable for highly low -power and cost -effective systems. We plan to implement an ISA extens ion for our RISC -V core that will dynamically identify zero -value registers and skip future instructions that depend on them. This technique exploits a common attribute of Deep Neural Networks known as sparsity. This method has been proven in simulation to significantly reduce computation time and energy consumption, while requiring minimal architectural changes [Sanchari Sen et. al., IEEE Transactions on Computers, 2018]. We plan to implement this by adding hardware tables to the core that track registers that contain zero values as well as skippable instructions. Given that our current RISC -V implementation uses a minimal instruction set, we expect to see greater performance and energy savings by implementing this optimization compared to prior simulations . The goal of our project is to design, synthesize, and fabricate a general purpose processor with these improvements. The proposed optimizations could allow proven machine learning software techniques to be implemented on embedded devices with minimal alg orithmic changes.

The design process started with research of the performance parameters and mission profiles of current tanker and fighter aircraft, which was leveraged to create a missi on profile and a set of specifications for the conceptual design. The tanker aircraft was required to have a flight range of 3,000 miles, cruise at 35,000 feet at Mach 0.85, and offload 36,000 pounds of fuel amongst two fighter aircraft. The next step was to iterate through aircraft weight and engine performance estimates until the calculated performance values met a basic set of mission specifications. Once the basic parameters for the aircraft were decided, various software tools, such as Open Vehicle Ske tch Pad, were used to refine the shape, aerodynamics, and stability of the aircraft to fulfill the remaining mission requirements. Weighing just over 100,000 pounds at takeoff, the autonomous tanker aircraft carries about 66,000 pounds of fuel, has a range of 3,500 miles, and cruises at 35,000 feet at Mach 0.85. Novel features were incorporated into the design such as a flying wing body, engines embedded within the body, and a retractable refueling boom to increase survivability. Military researchers might consider developing low -cost, expendable, unmanned aircraft that augment the capabilities of existing military aircraft while taking risk away from pilots.

With the laptop running several high performance programs, the laptop was tested for radiated and conducted emissions. All of the ports of a laptop were analyzed with a spectrum analyzer fitted with a specialized antenna to test for the radiation testings and a calibrated loop for the magnetic induction testing. The laptop, with perip heral cables, was also tested for the conducted emissions of the power adapter using a Line Impedance Stabilization Network. Emissions were measured using a spectrum analyzer in the frequency domain and an oscilloscope in the time domain. The results of the tests indicated that it met the pertinent regulations for compliance with FCC and European EMC standards. While the measurements met the requirements, the laptop did emit other radiations. All the emissions were within the appropriate standards. Research Mentor : Robin Barrett, ECE ; Poster Number: 66a :: Mathematical/Computational Sciences College of Engineering Computational Model of Ebolavirus Matrix Assembly: Phospholipid Influence on Production of Viral Particles Author : Ethan Pappas Abstract: VP40 is a vital matrix protein to the Ebolavirus (EBOV). During viral budding, VP40 progressively oligomerizes at the host cell surface to form the mature EBOV matrix. VP40 association to the inner leaflet of the host cell membran e is essential in this assembly process [1]. Recent experimental studies indicate that inhibition of host cell membrane -associated phosphatidylserine (PS) significantly lowers VP40 membrane -binding affinity, thereby inhibiting assembly of mature virus -like particles (VLPs) [2],[3]. This indicates that host cell membrane PS content could present a viable drug target in treating Ebola virus disease. However, quantitative dynamic effects of PS inhibition on VP40 oligomerization are largely uncharacterized. The refore, the potential of PS as a drug target is challenging to evaluate. We describe an ordinary differential equation -based computational model to evaluate PS influence on VP40 oligomerization at various membrane PS concentrations. This model presents a v aluable tool in evaluating potential treatment options. The model considers VP40 production, PS regulation, VP40 membrane -association affinities as a function of PS, VP40 oligomerization, VLP formation and budding. The model is calibrated to an experimenta lly calculated ratio of VP40 oligomers of size hexamer and higher relative to VP40 monomers and dimers. This mathematical model provides insights into production dynamics of developing and mature viral particles, how PS concentration affects these dynamics , and an estimation of VP40 oligomerization rate constants. The model is now poised to consider additional viral proteins, dose -response predictions for drugs that affect membrane PS concentration, and mechanism identification for drug discovery in paralle l with experimental studies.

On Earth, desalination systems are often characterized by their thermodynamic energy requirement. There is limited development regarding the thermodynamic energy requirements of obtaining fresh water in systems where there is some form of water present. In ou r solar system,trace amounts of water have been found to exists in the form of ice caps, salty bodies of liquid water, and atmospheric vapor. In this work, we investigate the minimum energy associated with obtaining pure water from its available states, on Enceladus,Europa, Ganymede, Jupiter, Mars, and Venus. A comprehensive breakdown of the least work associated with obtaining pure water at consumable conditions (1 bar and 300K) is presented.Results show that desalination is by far the method with the leas t energy cost. For systems where liquid water is not available,melting ice is generally more efficient than atmospheric vapor condensation. Overall, as the change in temperature and pressure required to bring the ambient water to the desired state increase s,the energy requirement increases. By modeling the energy cost associated with each method of obtaining water, as a function of each system's atmospheric conditions, it is possible to begin to understand design parameters of real water systems in these harsh environments.

The primary idea is to process the input of a human facial expression frame and output a result that classifies such expression into some designated emotions such as basic seven emotions or other compound emotions.The existing conventional method requires a handcrafted feature extractor of facial Action Units(AUs) to extract feature from designated Facial Landmark regions, and these extracted AUs codes are processed through traditional machine learning alg orithm such as Nearest Neighbors and SVM, which is a typical type of linear classifier. The problem with conventional method is that the lighting variations and different position of object may corrupt the feature vector so that the accuracy is greatly re duced. In this project, we approach the problem by applying Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs), which does not require the step of handcrafted feature extraction in some fixed designated facial landmark region but produces an system that automatically ext racts feature segments and completes classification process by feedforward calculations . This system achieves the relatively most optimal solution through the process of backpropagation in which the algorithm learns the weights through stochastic gradient descent that can find the directions that best minimize the loss from the ground truth. The numerical result of the algorithm will show a probabilistic result of each labeled class. Furthermore, such method best resolves the issues of lighting variations and different orientation of object in the image and thus achieves a higher accuracy.

An alternate approach, continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing, offers many advantages over batch manufacturing and may be a new direction for many pharmaceutical manufacturers seeking a higher qual ity product for a lower manufacturing cost. Some advantages of continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing include simplified process scale -up, shorter supply chains, and ideally, a more consistent product. The inherent disadvantage of continuous pharmaceutica l processing is the complex sensing and control schemes required. As process monitoring and control technology rapidly improves, it has now becoming possible to reliably operate a continuous pharmaceutical process. Ongoing research at Purdue University is focused on not only the tools used to monitor these processes, but the data infrastructure associated with these measurements. These tools, known as process analytical technology (PAT), are used to monitor critical quality attributes (CQA's) and to verify that the pharmaceutical product meets all quality specifications. The measurement of one particular CQA, the particle size distribution, has been an area of focus over the past year. A visual imaging sensor, the Innopharma Eyecon has been used to estimate the particle size distribution of a flowing particle stream in real - time. The Eyecon, other PAT tools, and process equipment generate vast streams of valuable data when operated continuously. However, this data is useless unless it is properly collected, analyzed, and visualized. The data associated with the operation of continuous pharmaceutical processes has been the subject of significant research. Enterprise -level data management systems including OSI -PI, have been implemented at Purdue's continuous ph armaceutical manufacturing line and are currently being studied. With adequate data acquisition, manipulation, and visualization, continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing will allow for the production of low -cost, quality pharmaceutical products.

Methods were developed to communicate the effect of microcracks numeri cally, as well as visually through computer and physical modeling. Trabecular bone samples were stained with BaSO4 scanned using micro CT. The resultant volumetric scan data was processed to create a finite element model and a stereolithographic reconstruc tion. The finite element model was used to quantify up to a 3.5% reduction in elastic modulus of the bone sample due to the microdamage at a level of 2.5% damage volume fraction. This reduction in stiffness was analyzed at the local trabecular level by comparing high stress/strain regions to the areas with microdamage. Results showed that high stress and strain regions both correlate to the localization of microcracks. Additionally, microcracks were shown to alter overall stress and strain distributions in predictable ways. The stereolithographic reconstruction was used to create an augmented reality visualization as well as for 3D printing physical models. These three kinds of modeling techniques allow microcracking in osteoporosis to be visualized in novel ways, which may provide ease of understanding to patients in the future.

This pollution is primarily caused by the burning of biomass fuels inside an enclosed kitchen in order to provide heat for cooking. Global Air Quality Trekkers is an undergraduate engineering team within the EPICS department at Purdue, and our goal is to create a kitchen design that utilizes natural ventilation to mitigate the amount of air pollutants present in these kitchens, specifically in Nandi, Kenya. This year, our goal is to analyze the ability of 9 different kitchen designs to reduce the amount of air p ollution present. After this semester, the team will be traveling to Nandi, a community that has already begun to use these modified kitchens. After conducting research this semester on our West Lafayette test kitchen, we will be able to determine the most effective kitchen designs and share this with our project partners in Nandi. Additionally, we will be analyzing the effectiveness of different types of kitchens in Nandi, conducting surveys within the community regarding the new kitchen designs, and teach ing an engineering module at the Tumaini school in Nairobi, Kenya. Overall, our hope is that these new kitchen designs will be adopted by more members of the community. These designs have the potential to save the lives of women and children, who become vi ctim to diseases such as COPD and pneumonia after many years of smoke inhalation. Ultimately, our goal is for these designs to spread to all areas of Kenya and Africa, and improve the health of the people who live there.

While the Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) is a commonly used biotemplate, its ability to be coated with metals is limited relative to Barley Stripe Mosaic virus (BSMV). In spite of this attractive characteristic, BSMV can only be coated with specific metals due to its sensitivit y to the extreme pHs and calcium concentrations required for metal deposition. Here, we present our efforts to engineer BSMV to enhance its stability and increase possible processing conditions for metal deposition. By comparing the structure of BSMV to that of TMV, we identified several candidate amino acid residues within a predicted carboxylate center, which govern the self -assembly and stability of BSMV coat proteins. We then neutralized the negative charge of the carboxylate center by genetic modificat ion and tested whether the changes allow for the assembly of more stable BSMV biotemplate. Expression of native BSMV coat proteins in a bacterial system does not form a viable BSMV biotemplate. However, our engineered modifications of the coat protein with in the predicted carboxylate center increased stability, forming BSMV bio templates (BSMV -VLPs) for the first time without the help of RNA. We are currently evaluating whether other modifications form BSMV -VLPs without RNA. Together, we demonstrate BSMV -VLPs production without RNA in a bacterial system for the first time and develop more stable biotemplate for nanoparticles synthesis.

However, fusion reactors need to be made of a material that shows strong resistance to the plasma and does not absorb fuel. Tungsten (W) is the primary candidate material for plasma facing components in nuclear fusion reactors due to its high melting temperature (3695 K), low sputtering yield and strong mechanical properties. Although the se properties are desirable, multiple studies have confirmed severe surface morphology on W when exposed to the plasma. Additionally, our previous studies indicate that tantalum (Ta) may show better resistance to the harsh radiation environment and there i s a dearth of literature on Ta. Therefore, the scope of this paper is to analyze the fuel retention in these materials at fusion -like conditions using thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). Preliminary results indicate that Ta has inferior fuel retention p roperties but due to the high temperatures involved, all the trapped fuel may escape, thus negating the effect.

Although Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) is currently the most popular biotemplate, our laboratory has shown that Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus (BSMV) is a potentially better alternative as it can bind more than twice the amount of metal. Despite attractive chara cteristics, the engineering of BSMV is limited by its requirement of a plant cell production platform which is associated with the virus' replication and recombination processes. In our research, we have developed a BSMV biotemplate production platform in the Escherichia coli bacterial system. To synthesize BSMV biotemplates in this bacterial system, we have expressed the coat protein of BSMV and verified the formation of the biotemplate through transmission electron microscopy. As initial efforts to expres s BSMV coat proteins in E. coli failed to form biotemplates, the research team decided to fuse a linker and a genetic sequence that initiates self -assembly to our BSMV constructs. As a result, we are able to report the first successful production of BSMV b iotemplates in a bacterial system. Current work is focused on controlling the dimensions of our produced BSMV biotemplates. By selecting the length of the linker sequence, we believe that we can customize the length of the expressed BSMV biotemplate. More specifically, we are investigating the effect of varying the length of the linker sequence. Collectively, we have developed a bacterial system for BSMV biotemplate production with potentially customizable lengths, expanding the nanomaterials synthesis tool kit.

As an advantage, it allows for cheaper manufacturing cost per watt produced, the potential to achieve higher efficiency (the current world record is at 22.9% for copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) cells), and the requirement of remarkably thin film making it compatible to be implemented on a wider -spectrum of surfaces including flexible surfaces and more resilient compared to the silicon -wafer cells. However, the current manufacturing method requires the use of vacuum and other extreme con ditions to get high -performing thin - film cells. The current more scalable method of solution process uses metal salts and long -chain oleylamine ligands which resulted in ionic impurities and carbon impurities, respectively. Our research group came up with a novel method to synthesize nanoparticle inks using pure metal precursor solutions to reduce the impurities of the absorber layer of the thin -film cells. To avoid the impurities from the salts, our team used amine -thiol solution to dissolve the pure metal s under an inert condition at 45oC, a relatively easy -to-achieve condition. To avoid the carbon impurities, our team came up with a strategy to use volatile ligands such as dodecylamine and the decomposition product of thioacetamide in the form of hydrogen sulfide as the ligand. Our ultimate target is to achieve high -performance, industrially -scalable thin film cells technology by reducing impurities and controlling particle size by time and ligand variations.

Transfer learning methods are typically used to make use of a source domain, where there is an abundance of labeled data, to make inferences in a target domain, where labeled data is scarce. In the digital age, improving a model's ability to generalize knowledge gained from the massive amount of data available online to new contexts is crucial. Most new contexts of interest, like radiological scans, have very few labels, an obstacle that can be overcome with improved transfer learning methods. A basic transfer learning technique involves resetting the weights and biases associated with the last few layers of a deep learning model that has been trained on the source domain, and then re -training the model on the target domain. This a very widely used technique, but can often times result in a phenomenon known as negative transfer. Negative transfer occurs when the knowledge gained in the source domain proves to be harmful when transferring to the target domain. In order to prevent this phenomenon, our team is focusing on making a systematic method for determining which weights and biases should be reset when transferring knowledge. The basic idea is that if the source and target domains are similar, then most of the models knowledge gained in the s ource domain will be transferred to the target domain. However, if the source and target domains are different, the model will forget that knowledge which would be harmful in its learning the target domain.

We also seek to present webcam metadata to potential clients by displaying the stre ams of the active cameras in a map on the web site, so ordinary people can learn about the scope and purpose of CAM2. The health checker had problems detecting the activeness of a camera that are in the dark as well as with location checking of new camera s added to the database. A problem with the camera page was that Google Fusion tables was being deprecated and we needed to devise a new data visualization method. The camera health checker took snapshots from the cameras in the database and saw if there is a difference in the two images. If so, the camera is marked as active. The health checker function has been reconstructed to avoid redundant code. The CAM2ImageArchiver module was imported to parse the images from all types of cameras to include streami ng cameras. We implemented a script that ensures the latitude/longitude values match the location of the camera. For the camera page, we changed it so it no longer needs Google Fusion Tables or the old CAM2 REST API. It will now use Google Sheets, Google Charts, and the CAM2 API Python client to display the map and uses marker clustering to increase performance for the user. A clean camera database provides a large training set which supports CAM2's future research in computer vision technology.

Micro -CHPs, composed of a prime mover with integ rated waste heat recovery, are typically installed with heat -led or electricity -led control algorithms, which follow the thermal or electric load of the household, respectively. In this work we propose a novel rule -based control algorithm that determines t he least -cost operation of the micro -CHP to meet the highly -variable domestic hot water and electricity demands of a single household. We consider three modes of operation of the micro -CHP system, namely, when the system is off, when the the system is gene rating power equal to the electric demand of the household, and when the system is generating maximum power. The algorithm determines the least -cost mode of operation, and we propose logic for auxiliary support components to ensure household hot water and electricity demands are met. A 24 -hour simulation is performed on the controller and micro -CHP system for a variable time of use electricity price and hot water and electricity demand recorded at 1 minute intervals from a real household. Simulation results are used to demonstrate improved performance of the proposed algorithm over conventional heat-led and electricity -led algorithms.

Photographs taken in a less than ideal setting often have low aesthetic quality, making it necessary for companies to manually remove or edit images that may not fit what the company wants. By developing a model that can judge image aesthetic quality, it is possible to create a system that can promptly predict the aesthetics of an image and allow the comp any to decide whether to filter it out, keep it, or change it. Through a large -scale database used for Aesthetic Visual Analysis known as AVA, we can train a predictor model that can learn photography styles that correlate to higher aesthetic quality and a ppeal. With the information provided from this predictor model, image features marked as aesthetically pleasing can be used to further improve the company's future methods and practices. This will ultimately improve the aesthetic value of the company and their products.

The current need for localization extends beyond what GPS can provide in today's state of technology. Radio signals used in the global system are vast but weak, unable to penetrate obstacles and buildings in high density, populous areas of the world. Our system is designed to solve this problem by implementing an Indoor Localization System using a stronger ultra -wideband signal in the frequency spectrum. At a high level, the system is modeled after the architecture of the global positioning system by utilizing anchors as the satellites and tags as the receivers. With the use of up to date cloud technology, an end -to-end system is created through the Internet of Things with the inclusion of information security and a fully developed front-end user inter face. The packaging is encapsulated within a miniature PCB design at a low cost, aimed as a plug -and-play integration within other systems in need of indoor detection. Applications of our IPS design include domains such as navigation (room -to-room assistan ce in a building), national defense (search and rescue operations, underground tracking, surveillance), commercialized zones (indicators for specific products on shelf, asset tracking in warehouses), and robotics (autonomous vehicles, drone detection). We demonstrate that all the components mentioned are essential to effectively carry out successful indoor localization with a focus on user flexibility and efficiency in response. We are able to use the system to enable an indoor drone show.

In order to reduce the possibility of getting musculoskeletal injuries, an easily attainable and highly reliable technique of detecting unsafe muscle force exertion levels for human activities is needed. However, measurement of force exertio n levels of human being is challenging, and existing techniques are either subjective in nature, affected by the machine interface in unwanted ways, or highly intrusive, thus cannot be commonly applied to workers. In our studies, we used computer vision an d machine learning techniques to classify the muscle force exertion levels (0% = rest level, 50% = moderate effort level and 100% = high effort level). Subjects' face videos and PPG(Photoplethysmography) signals were recorded while they were holding a grip dynamometer with different force levels. Through some video process techniques, we put 128 landmarks on each subject's face and took the average movement of each landmark as one of the features for our neural network model. Distances between peaks and tr oughs in the PPG signals were extracted as the other feature of our model. Even with only 15 subjects collected, processed, trained and tested, the neural network model provided a 73% accuracy in classifying or predicting muscle force exertion levels. For future works, we plan to collect more subjects and explore different features to increase the performance of our model and thus the reliability of our approaches.

The present study assessed whether temperament, as measured by Negative Affect (NA) scores on the Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ -R), was predictive of changes in heart rate throughout an arm restraint task in typically -developing infants (n=24; 10 -13 months). Maternal responses to the IBQ -R were collected prior to a developmenta l assessment (NA=3.47+0.9; M+SD). Infants wore EKG monitors throughout the assessment. We hypothesized that (1) higher NA scores would be associated with a steeper rise in heart rate at the onset of arm restraint and (2) higher NA scores would be associate d with a more gradual decline in heart rate during recovery. At this point, heart rate data processing is still ongoing. Analysis of isolated segments of heart rate data will permit us to clarify the relationship between temperament and autonomic physiolog y in typically -developing infants. This will allow for stronger cross -syndromic comparisons in other areas of developmental research and inform the development of more individualized interventions and treatments.

The purpose of this project is a laboratory to clinical transformation of a bone anabolic agent, which when injected systematically would selectively accumulate on fracture surfaces, promoting quick healing. This anabolic agent was obtained by synthesizing abaloparatide with a spacer and binding acid, oligopeptide. While it demonstrated similar effects as Forteo used in clinical trials of osteoporosis, it works in a paracrine manner whilst give n subcutaneously. It is also observed that the inherent free GSK3B inhibitor is excreted, showing no affinity towards the fractured bone. The targeted abaloparatide surpasses the performance of the saline control, and the free -form abaloparatide showing be tter mechanical analysis, bone density and curative results in the subcutaneous as well as the in -vivo experiments. Blood chemistry results show no change (even with high dosage) and the heart rates and weights of the control and test animals are not diffe rent from each other, indicating safety of the targeted drug. This therapy will prove to be particularly applicable for osteoporotic hip fractures and will help avoid invasive surgery. Dangers of ectopic bone growth is eliminated, and the rate and quality of fracture repair is improved. Loss of mobility and fatality due to invasive -surgery associated complications, suffered by the aging population of US, undergoing treatment for frequency of hip fractures will also be reduced thus resulting in a promising e ffective treatment.

These proteins act predominantly as adenylyltransferases and are defined by a core HxFx(D/E)(G/A)N(G/K)RxxR motif, where the invariant His is required for activit y. By catalyzing an adenylylation or AMPylation reaction, Fic proteins are able to hydrolyze ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to covalently add an AMP (adenosine monophosphate) to their target proteins. Fic proteins were originally identified as bacterial toxi ns that translocate into mammalian host cells, where they induce cytotoxicity by AMPylating and inactivating Rho GTPases, as a mechanism of evading the host immune response (Mattoo et. al, 2011). The respiratory pathogen, Bordetella bronchiseptica, encodes a single Fic protein (called BbFic) of unknown function. Our preliminary characterization of BbFic led us to hypothesize that it could be important for pathogenesis. We, therefore, opted to analyze BbFic biochemically, by expressing and purifying it from a bacterial protein expression system, and by using mammalian and yeast models to assess morphological phenotypes. BbFic clones for bacterial, yeast, and mammalian expression were generated using the Gateway Cloning Technology. Gateway Cloning Technology i s a novel molecular biology technique that bypasses tedious DNA cutting and ligating methods that are traditionally used in cloning procedures. Instead, Gateway cloning relies on the use of a donor plasmid to transfer the same DNA insert into several vecto r backbones as a single event. With this technology, the wildtype BbFic gene was inserted into a bacterial expression vector containing an N -terminal His6 tag for protein purification by affinity chromatography. Additionally, mammalian and yeast expression constructs with GFP and V5 tags were also generated. Using site directed mutagenesis, I also created the constitutively active BbFic -E62G mutant and its catalytically inactive BbFic -E62G/H196A mutant. The creation of these clones and establishing the Gate way Cloning protocol in the lab has greatly facilitated not just further analysis of BbFic activity in various model systems, but has also allowed us to expand this technology to other Fic proteins being studied in the lab - in particular, Fic proteins fro m the genetically intractable gastric pathogen, Helicobacter pylori.

The current study examined a relatively understudied aspect o f relationship quality - the eudaimonic well -being domain of positive relations with others - and its independent associations with change in and incidence of mobility limitations in a sample of mid -life and older adults from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study. Using data from all 3 waves of MIDUS, we examined the extent to which positive relations with others predicted smaller increases in limitations and reduced risk of onset of new limitations over a 18-20 follow -up period. Linear and logisti c regression models, adjusted for demographic and health confounds, showed that higher positive relations scores predicted slower increase in limitations over time (p=.003) and reduced risk of incidence of new limitations (p=.01). These effects were also o bserved over and above the associations with more traditional structural and functional measures of social relationships, neither of which was significantly linked to changes in functional abilities. These results suggest that positive relations with other s may act as a unique protective factor for functional decline in individuals with no initial functional limitations as well as in individuals with at least one initial functional limitation. They also extend prior research on the potential health benefits of social relationships to include a social dimension of eudaimonic well -being. Finally, they suggest that vulnerability to functional limitations and the potential benefits of social connectedness extend to mid -life as well as older adults. Research Mentor : Elliot Friedman, HDFS in Health and Human Sciences ; Poster Number: 90a :: Social Sciences/Humanities College of Health and Human Sciences \"Going somewhere makes sense, but somehow it seems more shameful:\" Italian women's attitudes and perceptions of reproductive tourism Author: Kelsie Basile Background: Law 40/2004 transformed Italy from a place with a largely unregulated commercial medically assisted reproduction (MAR) market to a country with the most conservative approach to MAR. As a result, the number of Italians seeking MAR outside of Italy skyrocketed, doubling in one year as citizens sought to escape the strict legislation. Even though restrictions were lifted on procedures like gamete donation, surrogacy is still banned, and single women and homosexual couples still cannot access MAR in Italy. Objective: The purpose of this study is to understand Italian women's perceptions of, and ex periences with, reproductive tourism, including benefits and barriers, and emotional, mental and physical costs. Methods: Using qualitative methodology techniques, in -depth interviews with 30 (May -June 2018) women aged 18-50 living in or around Florence, Italy and using the Italian healthcare system. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. HyperRESEARCH data assisted in data management, and open and axial coding were conducted to break down data using a grounded theory approach. Results: Limitations in Italian reproductive care are a result of restrictive legislature and religious presence, causing Italians to travel abroad for treatments. The current perceptions and attitudes Italian women have towards reproductive tourism show that wome n do not commonly discuss this among others and are not completely knowledgeable of the circumstances. The financial cost of traveling for reproductive care complicates women's access, and traveling abroad for such care can increase the emotional impact of being infertile. Conclusions: Reproductive tourism in Italy is misunderstood and difficult for Italians to pursue. Policy change is necessary to further adapt laws and provide options for individuals, especially same -sex couples and single women, seeking reproductive treatments. Italian women often experience emotional and financial burdens when experiencing infertility and while reproductive tourism is not a perfect solution, it is sometimes the only option. Thus, ways to facilitate access (i.e., referra ls, financial assistance, etc.) to MAR could mitigate the effects of the strict legislation.

Interventions to prevent falls are effective, but resources are limited. Currently, there is no practical solution to assess those at risk of falling to prioritize intervention resources. Due to these limitations, we are evaluating a monthly assessment approach using a smartphone -based system as a biometric measure of gait changes and fall risk in older adults. Methods: The gait monitoring approach was evaluated by tracking the gait characteristics of 43 older adults, over a period ranging from 1 -11 months (mean of 5 months). In addition to gait measurements, participants recorded any inc idences of falling. Using this data, a logistic regression model was created to identify the occurrence of a fall within one month preceding a gait recording session. A non -fall-month indicated that no fall was reported in the month following the gait ass essment (214 assessments), and a fall -month indicated that a fall occurred within one month following the gait assessment (11 assessments). Results: Sensitivity results showed that 72.7% of falls were predicted in the specific month the fall occurred. In addition, the system correctly predicted months without falls with 74.2% specificity. This performance is comparable to that of other established fall risk assessment tools features the added benefits of objectivity and ease of use. Conclusion: The system warrants continued evaluation and future consideration for health care industry adoption.

However, little research has investigated whether this relation between math anxiety and math performance is present prior to the elementary school years (Ganley & McGraw, 2016; Vukovic et. al., 2013), or whether the math anxiety of children's primary caregivers (e.g., parents, teachers) is associated with children's early math performance. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the relation between p arent math anxiety and child mathematical performance during the pre -kindergarten year. The participants included 310 preschool -age children (155 female) and a parent of each child. Structural equation modeling (SEM) results demonstrated that a latent fact or representing parents' math anxiety was significantly negatively related to children's performance on the Preschool Early Numeracy Skills Screener (PENS) in the spring of their pre -kindergarten year. Multi -group path analyses were used to further probe t he effect of child gender on this relation and revealed that the association between parents' math anxiety and children's math outcomes did not differ for male versus female children.

Both herbicides can move in the environment, which results in contamination of drinking water sources increasing the risk of human exposure. Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) are an emerging nanoparti cle with potential uses for the remediation of environmental contamination. This study's main aim was to determine whether GNPs can be used as a tool for environmental remediation of atrazine and glyphosate contamination. Mixtures involving nonfunctionaliz ed GNPs (at 1 mg/ml) and the herbicides atrazine (at 3 ppb) and glyphosate (at 700 ppb) at their current US maximum contaminant level (MCL) in drinking water were created to mimic environmental conditions. The mixtures were incubated for 24 hours on a rota ting apparatus. Following incubation samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was collected. The supernatant was used to quantify the concentration of atrazine and glyphosate using Abraxis unbound atrazine and glyp hosate. Data was analyzed in order to determine the binding interactions, if any, among the nonfunctionalized GNPs, atrazine, and glyphosate. The data from this study demonstrated that nonfunctionalized GNPs bind to atrazine, and binding does not occur bet ween glyphosate and nonfunctionalized GNPs. In addition, glyphosate did not with the binding between atrazine and nonfunctionalized GNPs (ANOVA with a Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test, p<0.05, n=4).

Methods: eighteen, 6 (Age: 12\u00b11y; BMI weight age: 75.6\u00b11.8%) participated in the following 16 -wk crossover study. During the first 8 -weeks, the students were provided wi th NP school breakfasts (420kcal; 83g CHO/11g PRO/5g FAT) to consume every day prior to the start of school through the 'Breakfast in the Classroom' program. During the second 8 -weeks, the students were provided with isocaloric HP school breakfasts (48g CHO/24g PRO/15g FAT) using similar procedures. At the end of each 8 -week period, the participants completed a modified Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ -C) to assess daily physical activity over the past 7 -days. In addition, pre -breakfast, post -breakfast, and pre -lunch 100 mm visual analog scale questionnaires were completed to assess perceived energy. Per protocol analyses were performed on the participants who participated in the school breakfast programs at least 50% of the time. Results: The participants displayed an overall average physical activity score of 2.5, indicating low physical activity levels. No difference in physical activity was observed following the HP vs. NP breakfast programs (P=0.59). Regarding perceived ene rgy, the HP breakfast consumption led to greater increases in postprandial energy (+12.8\u00b13.4 mm) vs. the NP breakfast consumption (+2.6\u00b12.7 mm, P<0.03). Pre -lunch energy was not different following the breakfast programs (P=0.27). Conclusion: Regardless of breakfast quality, the daily consumption of breakfast did not influence physical activity. However, the consumption of the higher -protein school breakfast elicited greater postprandial increases in perceived energy compared to consuming the normal - prote in school breakfast in middle -school students.

These herbicides are sprayed on crops to reduce weed populations, but move into drinking water sources following rain events. They are both controversial because of suspected hazardous health effects. The US EPA established the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of glyphosate in drinking w ater at ppb (\u00b5g/L), and IARC designated glyphosate as \"probably carcinogenic to humans.\" Atrazine is also suspected of being a carcinogen but, it's main concern is endocrine disruption. Atrazine's MCL is set at 3 ppb. Though there are countless stu dies concerning the individual toxicity of these herbicides, there is limited research on the potential toxic interaction making this a substantial gap in our knowledge. This study aims to test the hypothesis that a toxicity interaction occurs between atra zine and glyphosate at treatment concentrations below those observed for the single chemical exposure. In order to observe toxicity interactions, zebrafish were employed as a model organism. They were bred and their embryos immediately collected and expose d to one of four treatments (0 ppb, 3 ppb atrazine (ATZ), 700 ppb glyphosate (GLY), or 3 ppb ATZ and 700 ppb GLY mixture). Currently, at 120 hours post fertilization the behavior results showed that all treatment groups were significantly different from th e control (p<0.05; n=4 with 32 subsamples/biological replicate). The morphological data including total larval length, head length, head width, and brain length were not significantly different in the mixture exposure (p>0.05; n=7 with 11 -12 subsamples/bio logical replicate).

Author: Cidney Colby Abstract: My research focuses on the gendered aspects of reporting within the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). The NVDRS database compiles information from 42 U.S states, including law enforcement and medical examiner reports. I specifically looked at whether narratives written by NVDRS abstractors take a softer tone with females perpetrators compared to male perpetrators, such as providing multi -layered reasoning for why females commit filicide (e.g., ongoing mental health issues, experiencing bad breakups, etc.) while male perpetrators actions are due to lack of control in the moment or aggression towards others. Female perpetrators are mor e likely to be referred in reference to their relationship to the victim, while male perpetrators are more likely to be described as suspect/victim (i.e., S/V or B) and by the victim's relationship to the perpetrator. My paper narrows in on these differenc es to help facilitate conversations on both how gender norms emerge in abstractors descriptions and the stressors mentioned for male and female perpetrators.

Author: Myia Dorsey Rebecca Coan Abstract: Ketogenic diets (KD), which are high in fat and low in carbohydrates, are designed to shift energy utilization from glucose as a primary fuel source to ketone bodies such as beta -hydroxybutyrate (b -HB). The popularity of ketogenic diets has increased as they are purported to aid in weight loss and ameliorate metabolic diseases such as type -2 diabetes. Non -nutritive s weeteners (NNS), such as sucralose (the sweetener in Splenda) have been promoted for use in conjunction with a KD because they allow the consumer to stay in ketosis, and while avoiding sugars typically included in sweet tasting foods. However, it is not cl ear that weight loss observed with KD is an effect of achieving ketosis while on the KD, or secondary due to decreases in caloric intake that occur as a result of restriction of foods that are consumed. In addition, evidence has suggested that consuming NN S may actually promote weight gain by interfering with metabolic responses to sugars consumed along with NNS. The goal of the present experiment was to , examine the effects of consuming the NNS sucralose or the nutritive sweetener sucrose in conjunction w ith a KD. Female Sprague -Dawley rats, were assigned to a control (standard chow) diet or a KD ad lib. Animals consuming the KD also received a fixed quantity of Crisco\u00ae daily. For one group, the Crisco mixed with sucralose (0.15 mg/g); for the second group , no sweetener was added (plain). These groups were expected to enter a state of ketosis. The third KD group received Crisco mixed 1:1 with sucrose; this group was expected to have lower levels of ketones due to consumption of the carbohydrate. Rats receiv ed the diets for 12 weeks and body weight, food intake, b -HB levels, blood glucose, and body composition were measured. After 12 weeks, animals were given an oral glucose tolerance test . The results showed that weight gain and percent body fat were simila r in control and KD+sucrose fed animals, while KD+sucralose and KD+plain animals gained significantly more weight and fat compared to control animals. B - HB levels were similar in chow and KD+sucrose animals, but were significantly higher in KD+plain and KD+sucralose animals . All animals on the KD showed impaired glucoregulation durng the OGTT compared to control animals. These results suggest that KD do not prevent excess weight gain, and the addition of a NNS to a KD diet was less successful than the addi tion of sucrose at preventing weight gain.

Without Arf1, the function of the Golgi apparatus is severely compromised. Recent data suggest that Arf1 is involved in copper intracellular trafficking. Regulation of cellular copper (Cu) homeostasis involves transporting ATPases (Cu -ATPases), i.e., ATP7A and ATP7B. This lab has shown that the presence of excess Cu or Mn in the choroid plexus c ells led to ATP7A relocating toward the apical microvilli facing the CSF, but ATP7B toward the basolateral membrane facing blood. Collectively, these data suggest that Cu is transported by the blood brain barrier (BBB) from the blood to brain, which is med iated by ATP7A in brain capillary. By diffusion, Cu ions move from the interstitial fluid into the CSF, where they are taken up by the BCB. However, the role of Arf1 in this translocation is unknown. Less is known the presence of Arf1 in brain barrier syst ems, i.e., BBB. This study was designed to test the hypothesis: \"Arf1 is present in the BBB. We used Z310, RBE4, and N27 cells to test this hypothesis. By using qPCR, the expression of Arf1 was detected. The abundance, however, is unknown. The function of Arf1 under toxic metal exposures is currently in progress in this lab. Within the choroidal epithelial cells, Cu ions are transported by ATP7B back to the blood. This research is interested in understanding the expression of Arf1 in the choroid plexus cell s, dopaminergic neurons, and kidney cells.

Fertility rates have fallen considerably since 1995, with an especially steep drop in the last decade; 91,000 fewer live births in 2015 than in 2008. Women living in Italy face a unique reproductive health culture, m olded by social pressures (i.e., pro -reproduction health campaigns, motherhood expectations) and health challenges (i.e., increasing maternal age). This study sought to understand attitudes, behaviors, and expectations surrounding reproductive planning, in fertility, and motherhood among women living in Italy. Methods: Researchers conducted 55 in -depth interviews from February to August 2017. Participants included 46 reproductive -aged women (M=32.16.3 years) located in Florence, Italy, currently utilizing t he Italian healthcare system, and 9 Italian healthcare professionals. Researchers used an expanded grounded theory approach to understand women's reproduction experiences with the social ecological model serving as a conceptual lens for data analysis. Hype rRESEARCH, a data management system, assisted with open and axial coding and theme development. Results: Fertility care inadequacy and financial instability impacted participants' attitudes toward reproduction. Women's shifting roles and reduced marital s alience prompted decisions to delay or forego childbearing. For reproducing women, perceived postpartum challenges included employment discrimination, childrearing costs, and variable paternal support. Some participants discussed increased parental respons ibility sharing, but many noted lingering expectations that women prioritize motherhood above other pursuits. Competing maternal role expectations - sexual/romantic partner, friend, employee - created stress, but also presented opportunities for satisfacti on through balanced, social living. Conclusion: Findings provide insight into Italian women's reproduction attitudes and behaviors in the current economic and social environment. Results suggest practical recommendations for policy and sociocultural interventions to address reproductive barriers, such as affordable childcare, improved fertility care, and better maternal employment protection and acceptance. Rather than using fear messaging to boost birth rates, campaigns should focus on creating a supporti ve and empowering environment for women choosing motherhood informed by Italian cultural values.

One specific area nanoparticles are being studied and utilized is in biomedical applications. Several different nanoparticles such as iron oxide, gold and silver are all being researched due to their unique properties. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have large surface areas, and antibacterial properties. Because of these properties, they are often used in coating medical devices/ IV bags as well as personal health care products. Recently in the United States, prevalence o f chronic diseases such as obesity and high cholesterol have been becoming increasingly more common, with over 95 million adults being affected for each disease. Because these diseases are so prevalent, it is important to identify how the compromised body will impact uptake and/or distribution of the silver nanoparticles. In order to test this, mice (C57BL/6) were given a high fat diet (60% calories) to induce obesity (50g) or a low -fat diet (10% calories) to maintain a healthy weight (30g). Silver nanopart icles (20 nm) were then characterized by size, charge, particle counts and imaging. After being characterized, AgNPs were utilized in a pilot study where they were injected through the tail vein at doses of 1, 2, or 4 mg/kg in both healthy and obese mice. After 24 hours, tissues were necropsied and used for sampling to identify biodistribution (CT scanning, Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy(AAS)) and evaluate toxicity levels (Inflammation, Oxidative stress). Our AAS results determined that the most AgNP uptake (ug/g of tissue) occurred in the liver and spleen. However, our CT scans were inconclusive in visibly identifying silver in the tissues at the concentrations utilized. Our future studies will aim to evaluate potential differences in silver nanoparticle de position due to obesity.

Author: Alexa Gordon Alyssa Prohofsky Abstract: The onset of independent walking in infants is associated with increases in language ability, but the mechanisms underlying this relationship are unknown. One explanation could be object carriage. Carrying objects while walking leads to increased stability in newly walking infants and this increase in stability could enhance language learning opportuni ties. Infants who spend more time walking while carrying a toy have a higher receptive but not productive vocabulary at 13 -months; however, productive vocabulary lags receptive vocabulary and therefore, the toy walking -productive vocabulary relationship ma y develop later. We examined whether the amount of time walking while carrying a toy at 13 -months predicts productive vocabulary abilities at 24 -months. Eleven children participated in the longitudinal portion of a larger project. At 13 -months, infants engaged in a video recorded 20 -minute free -play session during which they played with a variety of toys. From the videos, trained coders identified toy walking bouts (walking bouts of four or more continuous steps where the infant was carrying a toy). At 24 -months, parents completed a productive vocabulary ability assessment (MacArthur -Bates Communicative Development Inventory). There was no relationship between toy walking bouts at 13 -months and productive vocabulary abilities at 24 -months (r=0.17, p=0.62), s uggesting the toy walking -productive vocabulary relationship may not exist, or the relationship may develop after 13 -months of age but be washed out by other experiences by 24 -months of age. Therefore, carrying a toy while walking may not have long term be nefits for productive vocabulary. However, given the small sample size, more data needs to be collected before these results are conclusive. Research Mentor : Amanda J. Arnold & Laura J.

La Bella Figura plays an essential role in shaping Italian consumer behavior and consumerism. The current study sought to understand how women living in Italy conceptualize La Bella Figura and how it affects their day -to-day lives, attitudes, and consumption behaviors. This research extracted concepts from Consumer Culture Theory to construct a qu alitative codebook and structure thematic data analyses. Semi -structured interviews were conducted with 30 women aged 18 -50 years living in Florence, Italy. Participants were recruited through study flyers, social media, and snowball sampling. Open and axi al coding were facilitated by HyperRESEARCH 4.0.1 software to generate key themes. Data were collected and analyzed by trained researchers living in Florence, Italy, who utilized grounded theory techniques to identify emergent themes. Results indicated var ious components of La Bella Figura contributed to consumer behavior, namely its influence on identity (i.e., appearance, confidence), lifestyle goals (i.e., health, consumerism), and social norms (i.e., perceptions of others, media). Findings offer practic al recommendations for marketers and retailers to appeal to the Italian market through effective and informed mediums.

When an infant's mother's milk is not available donated breast milk is an option; however, donated human breast milk has a limited supply and is very costly. To increase the supply and availability of donated breast milk we must first understand the population of breast milk donors and the obstacles they experience throughout the donation process. Purpose: To determine the significance of human milk donor demographic and obstacles encountered during the donation process. Methods: A cross -sectional online survey with a convenience sample of 227 women who previously donated breastmilk from various regions of the United States collected information on their demographics and whether they encountered an obstacle during the dona tion process, such as having difficulty transporting milk to bank, finding time to pump, etc. Descriptive statistics and logistic regressions were conducted using SPSS software. Results: Out of the sample of 227 women, the average woman was white, 33 ye ars old, employed, holding a graduate or professional degree, and living in an owned home in a suburban community with a household earnings of $50,000 or more annually. At a significance level of 0.1, there was no evidence that race, employment, education, type of residence, community, or household income was associated with a higher rate of obstacles to donate breastmilk encountered. Conclusions: Demographics could influence a mother's chances of experiencing obstacles during the process of donating breas t milk. Response bias and lurking variables may exist. Further studies with more diverse populations are needed.

Lead was extensively used in the mid -20th century, especially in mining and metal industries. It has been shown that workers can bring home lead to their families as dust on their clothes. For this reason, 1930s census data on occupational activity was used to estimate early -life lead exposure. A Historical Exposure Index (HEI) was created for each major city, which estimates lead exposure for the population in that city based on how many people were in each occupation and how likely it was that the occupation involved lead exposure. AD mortality data from the Center for Disease Control was obtained; this data is measured in percent of total deaths. The HEIs for each city and Alzheimer's disease mortality in each county were mapped using ArcGIS software. Descriptive statistical analyses of the HEIs and AD mortality were performed and maps were compared qualitatively. The average HEI was found to be higher (126.388) in Illinois than in K entucky (114.104), and the average percent of total deaths caused by AD was also found to be higher in Illinois (0.75%) than in Kentucky (0.50%). Overall, though, it was found that there was no clear correlation between areas that had high lead exposure a nd areas that had high Alzheimer's disease mortality. However, it was found that in both states, the areas with the densest populations had the highest per capita rates of Alzheimer's disease mortality. Further statistical analysis needs to be done to co nfirm or deny any correlation.

Optimism is linked to psychological and physical health, as well as important constructs such as motivation, hope, s elf-efficacy, and positive attribution style. Optimism is a particularly important adolescent cognitive factor for moderating the effects of stressors. However, researchers have less often assessed optimism in Latino youth, despite their higher risk for he alth disparities and higher levels of stressors. Furthermore, researchers have rarely assessed antecedents to optimism, so it is unclear how optimism can be fostered in Latino youth. In the present study, participants included 119 Latino youth in the 5th or 6th grade and their mothers. We examined whether salient developmental tasks (ethnic pride, school attachment, and resilience) positively affected optimism cross -sectionally (Time 1) and one year later (Time 2), controlling for depression. In our cross -sectional model, resilience and school attachment were positively associated with T1 optimism. Longitudinal models found resilience and school attachment at T1 were marginally associated with T2 optimism (controlling for T1 optimism); however, unexpectedl y, resilience was negatively associated with T2 optimism. T1 depression was marginally negatively associated with T2 optimism when controlled for prior levels. Contrary to prior literature, we found no visible association between optimism and ethnic pride at either T1 or T2. By noting the association between salient developmental tasks and optimism, many avenues for intervention can be provided for Latino youth and families to help foster optimism, which could improve health and well -being.

Due to recent legislation, this infertility crisis is far from being settled. Women who experience infertility face adverse physical and psychological outcomes. Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate Italian w omen's infertility perspectives and experiences, and how cultural constructs (e.g., recent legislation, social stigma, and religion) intersect with the issue. Inclusion criteria included women (ages 18 - 50 years) who lived in Florence and were utilizing t he Italian healthcare system at the time of study enrollment. Methods: Researchers conducted 30 in -depth, one hour interviews during May and June 2018. The explored women's experiences with infertility and the treatment options that women seek within the healthcare system. All interviews were transcribed verbatim along with observer comments in order to identify emerging themes and patterns, using HyperRESEARCH as a data management program. A constant comparative and grounded theory approach was completed to analyze all data and build conceptual categories and themes. Results: Several participants expressed a lack of knowledge on infertility treatments and options. Those that were informed suggested a desire for reform of the Italian healthcare system in regards to infertility, as participants perceived it as unsupportive of women's and families' goals. Findings suggest that psychological distress may be present in infertile couples. Italian culture and religion may play an influential part in legislation and family planning. Findings also explore the different resources women use for infertility information. Conclusions: Findings from the research assist in understanding the women's healthcare system in Italy and how it affects women experiencing infertil ity. Results also identify the dynamic of social rejection among women that are experiencing difficulties, often resulting from cultural and social norms. Further, findings underscore the impact of religion on infertility experience, including within the h ealthcare system and in the social environment.

Yet, interventions that emphasize the pervasiveness of bias may inadvertently damage efficacy to confront sexism by creating the perception that bias is immutable. We examined this po ssibility in the context of a successful bias literacy program, Video Interventions for Diversity in STEM (VIDS). In two studies with working adults from the general public (N = 343) and science faculty (N = 149), we modified VIDS by developing an addition al module (UNITE) that offers tools for addressing bias and promotes the mindset that bias is malleable. VIDS alone was sufficient to increase awareness of bias, reduce sexism, and improve bias identification. However, UNITE buffered against perceptions th at bias is immutable and restored self -efficacy to address bias. We conclude that interventions must aim not only to increase bias literacy but also offer concrete tools and avoid implying that these problems are insurmountable.

Author: Jade Meekin Kennedy Skipper Abstract: While research on healthcare disparities exist, specifically about racial disparities and pain, no studies have explored how these implicit biases impact young adults and their social interactions with their doctors. This study e xplored how race, age, and gender impacts the way that their medical professionals interact with their patients. A survey was sent out to many students of Purdue University where they answered various questions regarding their doctor visits. African Americ an participants reported feeling as though their medical doctors were unwilling to pursue more extensive or serious treatment when compared to the responses of Caucasians, Asians, and other ethnicities. A larger percentage of African Americans, when compar ed to other races, also felt as though their symptoms were ignored by their medical doctors.

Despite incidence rates for traumatic events being nearly equal between the sexes, women are twice as likely to develop PTSD. To explore these sex differences, we are examining how microglia in the prefrontal cortex respond to stress in both male and female Long Evans rats. Specifically, male and female rats were exposed to 15 1.0 mA unsignaled footshocks over the course of 90 min \u2014control animals were exposed to the context without any shock deliver y. 9 or 15 days after this acute stressor, rats were euthanized, and their brains were removed and sectioned for immunohistochemical staining with IBA1 antibodies and DAB. Preliminary data demonstrate differences in microglial morphology between 9 and 15 days after exposure to an acute stressor in male rats, and current analyses are evaluating whether these differences are also occurring in females. These morphological analyses will determine if microglia are operating differently between males and females in response to stress, which may serve as a stepping stone for future research investigating sex differences in developing PTSD.

Despite this, empirical evidence of the relationship between these two functio ns in child development is sparse. To start addressing this gap, this study investigated the relationship between eating and speech efficiency in a group of typically developing children (TDC) and a group of children with unilateral CP (UCP). Fifteen TDC a nd 13 children with UCP (age range: 7 -12 years of age) participated. Average mealtime duration was used as a measure of swallowing/eating efficiency, and speech rate was used as a measure of communication efficiency. Average bite/sip duration was calculate d by measuring total snack consumption duration and dividing it by total number of bites/sips. Communication efficiency was assessed through a standard protocol for assessing speech rate using a delayed speech imitation paradigm. Results showed that TDC ha ve significantly shorter average mealtime duration tha n the UCP children (mean=179.37; SD=35.78) (p<0.0004). Although in the TDC group the two measures are not correlated, for the UCP group, a moderate negative correlation (r= -0.51) is seen, indicating that children with UCP with longer average mealtime durat ion have a faster speech rate. Further analysis of our data taking into account the prevalence of dysarthria and dysphagia in our UCP group will elucidate the reasons behind this finding.

For any region, it is important to understand the breadth and severity of potential environmental health threats because this know ledge helps organizations implement solutions in a more comprehensive, effective manner. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to gauge environmental health risks in the Cusco region of Peru. This project is intended to serve as preliminary data to inf orm development of future studies. Using government -funded studies and mapping data from Peru, key environmental health issues have been identified. Additionally, data were obtained from the USDA website on agricultural and pharmaceutical exports into the US from Peru. During the research process, key search terms included \"mining and environmental health Cusco\", \"Peru contaminated exports\", and \"environmental impacts Peru\". The three largest issues were based on prevalence in news articles and research rep orts. These issues include yearly increases in illegal mining operations, deforestation around rivers, and agricultural expansion. These issues were shown to be interconnected. Mining operations are generally located near rivers or tributaries and increase the amounts of heavy metal contamination in the waterways and soil. Agricultural expansion increases the likelihood of harmful chemicals such as pesticides to enter the soil system. Deforestation makes it easier for contaminants to leach through the soil into waterways and occurs to create more room for mining operations and agriculture. This study provides insight about the areas of most concern in Peru's environmental health. Future studies can use this information as a baseline to further identify, anal yze, and solve these prevalent issues in the Cusco region.

The goal of this study was to map GABA and Glutamate (Glu) levels using MRS imaging (MRSI) in the insula of the brain and determine whether their levels correlated with pain perception. To achieve this, two dimensional (2D) MRSI acquisition techniques with asymmetric narr owtransition band adiabatic pulses was used for the detection of the metabolites using double spin -echo localization pulse sequence at 3T. The greatest alteration of the neurotransmitter, Glutamate, was observed for anterior to posterior in the insula. This study demonstrates the ability to obtain neurotransmitter signals from the entire insula with a resolution of 2 mL. The resultant data provides a reference for subsequent utilization for studies of pain perception. Resear ch Mentor : Dr. Uzay Emir, PhD, School of Health Sciences, College of Health and Human Sciences ; Poster Number: 115a :: Life Sciences College of Health and Human Sciences Characteristics of Nanoparticles Emitted from Kanthal and Nichrome Heaters Used Cigarettes. Author: Kaushal Prasad Alec Graff Abstract: Electronic (e -) cigarettes consist of a heater to vaporize nicotine solution, a reservoir containing nicotine solution, and a wick to deliver nicotine solution to the heater. The Kanthal (iron+aluminum+chromium alloy) and Nichrome (iron+nickel+chromium alloy) coils are most commonly used for e -cigarette heaters. When the heater is operating, metal vapor can be produced from the heater surface, cooled by air, and then proceed to form nanopa rticles (<100 nm) through condensation, nucleation and coagulation. In this study, metallic nanoparticles produced from the heaters were characterized. The Kanthal or Nichrome heater was installed in a lab -made e -cigarette system without the wick and the n icotine solution. The e -cigarette system was operated under various conditions (coil resistance of 0.1 -1.0 and applied power of 10 -70 W). The size distribution of airborne particles emitted from each test heater was measured using a scanning mobility par ticle sizer for 30 minutes. When the coil resistance increased from 0.1 to 1.0 , the initial number median diameter (NMD) of airborne particles was maintained between 40 -52 nm for both Kanthal and Nichrome heaters. Under the normal testing conditions of 0 .5 at 10W, the initial total number concentration (TNC) of particles from Kanthal heater was 1.1\u00d7106 particles/cm3 and decreased to 2.4\u00d7105 particles/cm3 after 30 minutes. Similarly, the TNC from Nichrome heater was decreased from 1.9\u00d7106 particles/cm3 t o 2.5\u00d7105 particles/cm3 after 30 minutes. The heater resistance was proportional to the initial TNC. When the applied power increased from 10 to 70 W, both NMD and TNC were increased. In all cases, the particle number concentrations decreased over time bec ause surface oxidation (aluminum oxides layer on coil surface) prevented further nanoparticle formation. As a result, a used coil may reduce the risk of the metal exposure from e -cigarettes.

Price, John P. Wise, Jr., Rachel Foguth, Jason R. Cannon Abstract Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that targets the brain's nigrostriatal dopamine system. Although it affects more than ten million people around the world, it's pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Furthermore, early detection and curative therapies are lacking. It is known that dysfunction in mitochondr ial autophagy (mitophagy) is critical in early stage PD. Mitophagy dysfunction and the formation of aggregated protein inclusions in the brain's nigrostriatal region likely induce oxidative stress, thus impairing the dopaminergic neurons. Optineurin, a pro tein involved in the signaling pathway for mitophagy, has been linked to other neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and glaucoma. The current purpose of this study is to determine if optineurin expression has an important role in modulating neuronal oxid ative stress levels in the substantia nigra, the brain region most affected in PD. Brains from transgenic mice expressing wild -type optineurin, optineurin knock -out, or an E50K mutation linked to glaucoma were analyzed. Immunocytochemistry followed by conf ocal imaging analysis was performed on nigral brain sections. Tissues were stained for optineurin, nitrotyrosine (a marker for oxidative stress), and alpha synuclein (a main component of protein aggregates common in PD). Ongoing analyses are determining th e role of optineurin in PD-relevant neuropathology. This serves as a pilot study to open the doors for future, more extensive investigations into the role of optineurin in PD pathogenesis, ultimately leading to early detection and/or prevention techniques.

Wells, and Dr. Ulrike Dydak Heavy metal exposure is a serious occupational health hazard for many industrial workers. Exposures can cause behavioral changes, nausea, anemia, and damage to the nervous system. Biomarkers for short term exposures of heavy metals have been shown to be inconclusive in which is more accurate in showing acute concentrations. The goal for this project is to describe and compare air, blood, and toenail measurements of manganese, zinc, and copper in a cross -sectional study of semi -trailer factory workers Thirty -nine subjects (welders and non -welders) were sampled from a semi -trailer welding factory. Biomarke r samples were taken from each of the subjects and concentrations of the metals were determined using ICP -MS. Population demographics were collected by questionnaire and include age, race, BMI, smoking use, and alcohol use. Mean and standard deviation valu es were found for each biomarker and metal, stratified by welding status. Pearson correlation values comparing the different biomarkers for each metal were determined. Overall, concentrations of manganese and zinc were higher for welders versus non -welders , while the copper serum value was higher for non -welders than welders. The correlation of air copper with serum copper (Pearson's =0.53, p=0.0087) was higher than comparisons of either air or serum with toenail copper (=0.12, p=0.6720 and =0.11, p=0.66 28, respectively). For zinc, serum and toenails had the highest correlation (=0.31, p=0.2234) while toenail and air had the lowest (=0.20, p=0.4450). For, manganese air and toenail concentrations had the highest correlation (=0.0.58, p=0.0024) while the toenail and blood sample had the lowest (=0.21, p=0.3940). Correlation values could be influenced by sampling methods and homeostatic control of the metals within blood tissue. Future work includes analyzing other concentration samples that were found wi thin this sample set as well as explore the correlation values when non -welder data is taken out of the initial analysis.

Early intervention services (occupation therapy (OT), physical therapy (PT), and speech language therapy (SLT)) are often administered to children with these rare neurogenetic syndromes. Little information is available on the prevalence of therapy services in these groups. Methods: The present study is an ongoing collection of data on the development of children w ith neurogenetic syndromes. Parents completed an online questionnaire about their child's development. Participants include 90 children (AS=30, PWS=28, WS=32) with reported intervention service use. Hypothesis: (1)Across disorders, children with AS will s how the highest percent of service utilization. (2)Within AS, percent of children using therapy will be similar across interventions. (3)Within PWS and WS, OT and PT will be most common. (4)Across disorders, children with AS will show the highest rates of hours/week across all therapy types. (5)Families with lower income will have the fewest hours/week of services. Analyses: Statistical analyses include descriptive statistics, Fisher's exact test, Kruskal -Wallis one -way analysis of variance, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. AS does not significantly show highest percent of service utilization (p=0.825; p=0.738; p=.658). Within all syndromes, analyses suggest percent of children using therapy do not differ (p's>.368). Groups differ in hours of ser vice utilization for OT (p=0.012) and PT (p=0.001). Analyses indicate that income does not differ by hours/week of intervention (p=0.94). Impact: The data analyzed can assist future studies in determining satisfaction and effectiveness of intervention ser vices in neurogenetic syndromes.

Concurrent increases in sedentary behavior may put adolescents at a greater risk for T2D. Objective: Using baseline data from an ongoing clinical trial called Dietary Interventions for Glucose Tolerance in Teens (DIG IT), we determined relationships among physical activity, sedentary behavior, and measures of glycemia. Methods: Adolescents, who were overweight or obese wore an activPAL accelerometer (PAL Technologies, Glasgow, United Kingdom) for seven days to as sess physical activity and sedentary behavior. Glycemia, during oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT), was measured using point -of-care instrumentation. We analyzed 34 participants (64.7% girls) age 13 \u00b1 2 years, who were obese (BMI z -score, 2.12 \u00b1 0.48). Daily activity averages for the total sample were: sedentary time, 618 \u00b1 87 min; total 2406; stepping time, 92 \u00b1 30 min; and moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) time, 44 \u00b1 62 min (which is below the MVPA recommendations of 60 minut es per day). Average glycemia measures for the total sample were: HbA1c, order correlations did not find significant correlations between the measures of glycemia and any measures of ac tivity/sedentary behavior; however, there were trends (HbA1c concentrations and MVPA time, r= -0.26, p = 0.15). Conclusions: Glycemia may not be associated with activity levels in boys and girls who are obese; however, a larger sample size may be more concl usive.

If an item has an unusual or counteri ntuitive property, such as a ball that rises rather than falls when dropped, the unusual property makes the item more memorable. However, experiments investigating this effect tend to have experimental confounds that make interpretation difficult. Our ex periment aimed to solve these problems by using counterbalanced lists of nonwords, using the nonwords to control for prior associations and experiences. Participants viewed a series of nonwords along with a noun -adjective pair (e.g. Frav - a roaring tiger) and were told that each nonword represented a name. Some nonwords were the names of an intuitive item (e.g. a roaring tiger) whereas others were counterintuitive (e.g. a writing tiger). Participants rated the likelihood that the described nonword was fr om Earth or from a parallel universe where things were different. Everyone was told to remember the nonwords and noun -adjective pairs for a later test. To improve overall recall, each item was presented and rated twice. After a distractor, participants were asked to recall as many of the nonwords as possible. The results revealed that counterintuitive items were not better -recalled than intuitive items. In fact, in most tests, intuitive items were recalled significantly more often than intuitive items. Our results do not support the Minimal Counterintuitiveness Effect and suggest that when to -be-remembered words and their accompanying nouns are matched across conditions (counterintuitive and intuitive), that intuitive information is more memorable than counterintuitive information.

Staff employe d by medical facilities receive training about the safety risks due to radiation exposure and take proper precautions to protect themselves. However, personnel receive very little information about the potential security risks of radioactive material that may result due to malicious acts, such as theft or sabotage. To increase awareness of the potential radiological security risk, a probability model and written survey were developed and conducted for a medical facility. The model considered threat frequenc y and vulnerability, which was further broken down into natural disasters, power outages, and crime. The specific radioactive material (asset) used in this study was Gamma Knife\u00ae, which is a Category -1 medical device as designated by the International Atom ic Energy Agency (IAEA). Data regarding natural disasters such as tornados, extreme wind, or snow, was taken from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and narrowed down by state or county. County crime statistics were obtained from t he Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) website. The written survey consisted of questions intended to reveal general nuclear security awareness and technical nuclear security awareness that included topics such as detection, response, transportation, tra ining, accountability and physical security. The goal of this study was to give medical facilities an understanding of the security of radioactive materials as well as identify areas of improvement, such as additional training or better metrics for physica l protection.

Biometrics are used across the world as a form of security and a mode of identification. This is especially prevalent in the United States, w here there is a spike of interest in increased security measures since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. After these events, an ongoing rise of biometric technology, or identification technology, was initiated. By analyzing different physical and behavioral fact ors about a person or tendencies that they possess, a biometric profile can be created. By using these profiles, biometrics can help to distinguish one individual from another. This can be applied to identifying criminals, personalizing of social services, or even tracking medical history. The goal of this essay will be to analyze the impact that these biometric security measures have on the population. I will achieve this by using a mixture of both scholarly and popular sources to evaluate the presence of biometric technologies in modern society. I will analyze the presence of biometric technology in a nation where technology is constantly evolving. Specifically, I will ask: What are biometrics? How has the use of biometrics increased since the 9/11 terrorist attacks? What is the role of biometrics in the aspect of security in our present society? And finally, I will examine how the rise of biometric technologies correlate with the increase of societal control by specifically looking at the role of bi ometrics in the United States government.

Recent studies have shown that these regions support the stem -like properties of cancer and provide ways of escaping the body's immune system. Delta -Like-Ligand 1 (DLL1), a Notch pathway ligand, plays an important role in T-cell lineage and cancer stem cell (CSC) maintenance, and thus may play a role in allowing CSC's to escape the body's immune system. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the relationship between DLL1 expression and TME through the usage of anti -angiogenic drugs. For this experiment, SUM149 TNB tumors from athymic mice were treated with either no, low, moderate, or high doses of DC101, a monoclonal antibody targeting VEGFR2. Pathological analysis of DLL1 was performed post -treatment. Total DLL1 e xpression significantly decreased for treated mice compared to controls, while increasing at high doses. These regions were then scored based on the percentage of cells showing nuclear staining and the percentage showing cytoplasmic staining, demonstrating drug activity at the mRNA level. In conclusion, low doses of DC101 can significantly downregulate DLL1 reducing CSC prevalence in breast tumors, while higher doses can be detrimental. Future work investigates the effects of TME on immune cells.

These delays can have significant impact on the family environment, with 58% of mothers reporting high parenting stress (Wulffaert, Schoelte, & Van - Berckelaer, 2010). Our research focuses on the relationship between a child's language abilities and paren ting stress. Our study included 32 children (15 AS,17 LRC), aged 6.44 -46.85 months. Each child completed a day - long in -home recording using a LENA device. We examined a child's language ability using the Language Environment Analysis (LENA) system, a speci alized audio recorder worn by the child that collects information about the child's language environment. The LENA produces a Vocal Productivity (VP) score, which measures the length of children's vocal output in well -formed consonant -vowel pairs. Parentin g stress was examined using the Total Parenting Stress score from the Parenting Stress Index, Fourth Edition - Short Form, a 36 -item self-report survey completed by the child's mother that incorporates three domains of stress: child characteristics, parent characteristics, and situational/demographic stress. We will examine differences in VP among children with AS compared to low -risk controls (LRCs) using a Wilcoxon -Rank Sum test, as well as the association of child VP score with parental stress using a Sp earman's Correlation test. We hypothesize that the AS group will have significantly lower VP than the LRC group and that lower VP scores will be associated with higher levels of parental stress in both groups. Understanding the association between VP and p arenting stress will be beneficial in creating an optimal language environment for children to ensure best possible outcome.

To improve swallowing safety, beverages are typically thickened, which creates a new problem: the thickened beverages are disgusting. New work suggests chemesthesis, particularly intense sourness , spiciness, or carbonation, could improve swallowing without the need for thickeners. Yet, work is needed to assess the palatability of chemesthetic beverages among older adults. Thus, we recruited participants to rate sweetness, sourness, fizziness, stin ging, and overall liking of unsweetened carbonated waters (1 plain, 5 flavored), sour orange juice, spicy ginger beer, and colas (sugar or aspartame sweetened). Initial tests (N=30) indicated sour orange juice, spicy ginger beer, and two of the flavored wa ters were not well -liked, so the other beverages were selected for larger tests (N=64). All the flavored sparkling waters and colas were rated as sweeter than the carbonated water (all p<0.05). Both colas were rated as sweeter than any of the flavored wate rs, but there was no significant difference in sweetness between colas (p= 0.696). All beverages had a mean liking rating above 2 (Dislike, all p<0.05), and the sugar -sweetened cola had a mean liking rating above 3 (Neutral, p<0.05). Participants liked the colas more than any of the flavored sparkling waters and carbonated water, and liked sugar -sweetened cola more than aspartame -sweetened cola. The stinging of plain carbonated water was marginally greater than diet cola (p=0.051). Further work is ongoing t o determine if any of these chemesthetic beverages will effective in improving swallowing safety, as well as to determine if these beverages, despite having relatively low liking ratings in isolation, would be preferable to thickened beverages.

Half of six -month radiotherapy survivors develop signifi cant changes in white matter. Previous research has shown that a mouse model can be used to show similar cognitive and behavioral deficits shown in human patients. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of two drug therapies, Donepezil a nd 3,3 -Diindolylmethane, (DIM), that could be used to either protect the brain from radiation injury or cure the cognitive injury and behavioral deficits that result from whole -brain irradiation. This project consisted of two parts: administration of Donep ezil post -radiation as a symptomatic cure and administration of DIM before radiation as a protectant. The mice received 30 gray whole brain radiation and their behavioral changes were measured at 4 and 8 weeks post -radiation. The behavioral changes were observed using two tests: Open Field Test and a Marble Burying test. The goal of using these tests was to see if the treated mice would have results closer to the baselines established in previous research. From our data, we observed Donepezil to be an ineff ective form of therapy, as the deficits did not improve. However, DIM has shown to be a promising protectant drug therapy as the behavioral data is close to the results of a healthy control. This research validates the potential of DIM to be used as a radi o protectant in preventing radiation injury from occurring and also preventing any cognitive deficits following.

Transhumanism is the idea that individuals are capable of transcending their mortal bodies through various means, including genetic engineering, extermination, spirituality as w ell as technological progression, which all point towards human enhancement. Thus, the purpose of this research is to comprehend the political and bioethical implications of transhumanism, especially its impact on disability. The purpose is achieved throug h close analysis of the 20th - century literature in reference to transhumanism, with the focus on science fiction. This project encompasses a thorough investigation of articles, scholarly findings and works of nonfiction and fiction written in the early 2 0th century that are relevant to the study. Results of the investigation elaborate upon what the writers thought of transhumanism, the rationale behind their perspective, as well as the contemporary implications of the society's understanding of transhuman ism. The contemporary connotations, which will be discussed through the results of the research study, include the influence that transhumanism, in reference to disability, has on public policy, literature and scientific enhancements.

We intended to contribute to the growing literature on 'hook -up' culture by understan ding the often -overlooked decisions which lead up to these encounters. These micro -decisions include who the participant attends social events with, where they go, alcohol consumption, as well as interactions with potential partners. By using a methodology of asking participants to photographically record their night to use later in the interview to spark memories and gain a better understanding of the settings where these events and decisions take place. We found that participants were able to more clearly articulate their evening through using these photographs and often sparked discussions about the evening which may not have been uncovered without the photographs. The participants presented a mix of outcomes that allowed us to see how the decision to 'ho ok up' with someone can be influenced by a number of factors such as an obligation to stay with the original friend groups or a setting which does not encourage hooking up.

The project is in the initial stages and will examine the unique nature of these early modern books and their printing history including printer's marks, embossing, watermarks, and dedications using original copies. This research will also explore the connection between two eminent authors w ho were rivals in different religious perspectives and created their books with opposing philosophies. Mor\u00e9ri, a French Catholic priest, first published his book in 1674 and it is unique for its strong focus on geographical and historical subjects for that time. As a result, it was translated into French, Spanish, German, and English, which marked an epoch for encyclopedias becoming available in Europe's vernaculars and having entries listed alphabetically. Additionally, the book inspired Pierre Bayle, an i conoclast French Huguenot, to create his version of the encyclopedia in 1697 whereby Bayle updated the content by correcting and adding entries and expanding footnotes. Bayle's aspersions denounced Mor\u00e9ri's work by elucidating and superseding the Catholic perspective contained in the entries with his own philosophy furthering the acrimonious divide between the Catholics and persecuted Huguenots of 17th century France.

For this research three different types of marks are being studied: trampling, butchery, and crocodile marks. These marks are expe rimentally made, then 3D scanned and edited. Editing of the scans is completed through the use of the computer program Meshlab and solely limited to the extraction of the marks of interest from the 3D scans. The scans must be edited in -order to remove unne cessary variables from them such as generic bone surface or other insignificant marks. The isolated marks are then further processed through the use of R -programming to create a generic shape for each individually extracted mark. These mark shapes are then further compared using statistical analysis in R -programming in order to observe general trends of difference in each of the types of marks. The data can eventually be used to be compared to unidentifiable mark types, allowing for statistical analysis of the probability an unknown mark is one of the types. Research Mentor : Dr. Erik Otarola -Castillo Anthropology Liberal Arts ; Poster Number: 133a :: Social Sciences/Humanities College of Liberal Arts Beyond English Author: Hollis Druhet Vitasta Singh Grace Morris Abstract: Our research strives to situate and re -examine what benefits can be gained from reading and studying literature in the modern world. As less people today choose to read or pursue literary studies, we experience a loss of good reading practices in a fast -pace technology driven society. To engage these problems our research analyzes benefits of deep reading, how exposure to literature can affect the public good, and how literature courses can better prepare student s with the skills to maneuvre their future career paths. It is important to remember that reading is epigenetic, making the practice impossible to inherit. With a loss of deep -reading, we will be negatively influencing how the future generations adapt to t his habit. Overall, we seek to understand the deep -reading processes and how the brain responds when presented with a text. We also aim to understand how we can successfully transfer these deep reading skills in a digital -media setting, guiding the brain to adapt to digital media without losing the tools inherited by the consumption of print media. Our work examines how expanded digital media exposure can take away from the benefits of literacy and written communication. Additionally, our work examines th e idea that the loss of critical analysis, reflection, and constantly evolving thought can severely harm the intellectual and emotional growth of a human being. We also explore how literary reading offers a place for individuals to escape, enabling them to discover the full human experience. Approaching these topics, we look to revitalize the importance of a literary education and how an engagement with literature engenders a more thoughtful and empathetic citizen for the global world.

In this research, metatheater and metatheatrical moments are defined in a number of different ways. This may include, but is not limited to: a character o r characters speaking directly to the audience, characters alluding to the fact that they are in a play, or play -within -a-play moments. The texts explored are ancient Roman plays by Plautus and Terence, and Greek plays by Aristophanes and Menander. This r esearch is ongoing, but modern comedy will also be analyzed in television shows such as \"30 Rock\" and \"Community.\" Throughout history, metatheater has served as an important component in challenging authority and social hierarchies, as metatheatrical langu age is often related to low -status characters.

To be more specific, we focus on Mandarin and investigate the underlying syntactic structure resulting in the ambiguous properties that Mandarin Localizers manifest, which further leads to controversial categorization. Localizer phrases in Mandarin possess features of both XP locative phrase and nominal phrase.To add ress this conflicting behavior, we use Svenonius (2007), who postulates different projections for DP and AxParts. Our hypothesis is that the mixed behavior observed in Mandarin can be the result of the localizer occupying different syntactic positions with in the constituent (either as a DP or as an AxPart). This research distinguishes monosyllabic and disyllabic localizers by identifying how nominal suffixes (i.e. \"bian\", \"mian\" and \"fang\") of the latter one serve as a functor which shift the vector spaces denoted by AxPart into a region within the projection of vector spaces. Base on this assumption, some controversial features of Mandarin localizers (i.e. the incompatibility of AxPart and degree modification marker such as \"zui\" , which fill in the positio n of Deg) can be explained. By considering the underlying structure of the elements under question, we are able to provide an explanation for the apparent ambiguity of Mandarin localizers' distributional behavior in particular, and supplement the structure of human language to a more comprehensive and insightful degree.

With predators like Jack the Ripper, and the popularity of the hyperbolic crime plot in literature, the era is strife with instances of both real and fictional violence. However, the rich space of street harassment in Victorian London remains largely unexplored. As the 19th century ur ban space was being occupied and navigated by both genders, women became subject to a number of public \"micro -aggressions.\" This research investigates contemporary conceptions of women in urban spaces by analyzing Sensation novels. Character travels and mi cro- aggressions are tracked and digitally mapped to visualize trends of violence according to gender, class, and circumstance. We broadly define micro -aggressions to include leers, feelings of dread, hostile glances, stalking, and unwelcome flirtatious adv ances. Our findings show that, though the fictional urban woman traveled less often and for shorter distances than her male counterpart, she was far more likely to be subject to violence. Interestingly, the women's aggressors were often known to them, whet her as husbands, fathers, and acquaintances, with private disputes following female characters out of the home and into the streets. This indicates a need to broaden popular conceptions of harassment, which often assume that an aggressor is a stranger. Cur rent issues surrounding gendered violence have roots in these early, urban interactions \u2014both real and fictional. Taken in the historical context of increased literacy rates and urbanization, our research indicates that the prevalence of micro -aggressions i n Sensation literature worked to normalize street harassment in a crucial point of urban development.

This work is part of the Pres ence to Influence project, which is a multi -sited, multi -year collaborative research project that seeks to understand how marginalized and underrepresented groups in global environmental governance access and influence these governance processes. Our sites currently include three main events, the 2015 Paris Climate Summit (COP21), the 2016 World Conservation Congress, and the 2018 International Society of Ethnobiology Meetings (Bel\u00e9m +30). Specifically, we engage with an intersectionality approach and decol onial work to determine: How is gender discussed and in what context? How do different actors define gender issues and solutions in global environmental governance? How does gender discourse frame environmental action and global environmental policy? This poster will highlight key findings from a narrative literature review and point to findings from grounded qualitative data analysis across our data sets from sites of global environmental governance. Our work addresses how engaging with an intersectionalit y approach can foster interdisciplinary -oriented theoretical synergies in analyzing the processual unfolding of representational politics at sites of global environmental governance, expand how and in what way scholars engage with questions of gender acros s polycentric scales, identify the power -laden contexts of constructions of bodies and identities, and draw sharp attention to hegemonic configurations of discourses that currently dominate at sites of global environmental governance.

For that purpose, after researching relevant topics in the fields of intercultural theory and language instruction, we developed a pilot -instructional unit in the target lan guage that integrates cultural content commonly taught in Italian 102 with a deliberate focus on developing the intercultural attitude of curiosity. The instructional unit, structured as a guided virtual scavenger hunt, taking place in Venice, Italy, follo ws the guidelines of ACTFL Intercultural Can -Do Statements. Rather than placing students in the role of recipients of cultural knowledge and facts that remain external to the learners, our instructional unit gives students the role of active intercultural investigators. This shift in perspective will enable students to develop intercultural attitude of curiosity, as well as other skills and behaviors in addition to knowledge, leading to a potential transformation of their existing cultural perspectives. The overarching goal of our project is to exemplify a methodology that would complement the redesign of the Italian curriculum currently underway at Purdue, which focuses on the implementation of intercultural perspective through discrete intercultural labora tories that target the skills of curiosity and openness (as defined by the AAC&U Rubric), and that are conducted mainly in English. We predict that the combination of the methodology exemplified by our pilot -unit with the approach currently applied in the Italian program will lead to an increase in student's intercultural curiosity, as well as in their motivation to continue studying the Italian language and culture.

The media highlights mass shootings, and often the question is posed 'are we doing enough to monitor the sale of firearms?' However, it's not often discussed how imposing strict regulations may or may not produce the desired effect of lowering violent crime due t o easy access of weapons from low -regulated neighboring states. Current research on gun control policy shows contradicting evidence of its effect on violent crime. The project will examine how violent crime rates in states with strict gun regulations are a ffected by their proximity to states with weaker policies. As a participant in this work, my contribution will be mainly focused on literature reviews, building data sets, and conducting legislative history. By drafting memos on current research related to gun control, identifying various state policies and documenting changes over time, we can create a data set that we can compare to violent crime rates reported by the FBI. Our goal is that this will allow us to analyze the impact that gun control has on v iolent crime, and whether or not proximity to states with lighter control has an effect. The findings of this project could impact policy formation surrounding gun control on both a state and federal level.

A comparative analysis examines the communication strategies of the four international pageant's websites and Instagram accounts. A SWOT Analysis was used to further evaluate MUO. The data reveals that MUO has an effective website design and social media presence due to the accessibility of the website and number of followers on Instagram. However, the use of advertisements on their website disrupts their et hos, as they are a non -profit organization. MUO has the opportunity to expand their reach to younger generations of women. The competing organizations pose large threats to MUO due to similar web designs and logos, and negative media portrayal of pageantry threatens success. Three suggestions for the Miss Universe Organization are: (1) In light of recent negative media coverage about pageantry, create a team of marketers to communicate the positive effects of pageantry before December 2019 to improve TV rat ings of the competition, (2) Form a marketing team to target women who are younger than 18 within the next year, and (3) Considering the similarity of website designs between MUO and Miss World, collaborate with the current MUO website designer to differen tiate the organization from Miss World within the next six months. In conclusion, the current communication strategies are efficient in reaching MUO's target audience, however the competing organizations pose a threat.

Author: Alejandra May Abstract: Most researchers agree th at the extinction events of North American megafauna, including proboscideans, occurred approximately 13,000 years ago. The reason for the demise of these creatures, in particular proboscideans such as mammoth and mastodon, is a matter of debate. There are three accepted general hypotheses explaining the extinction of these North American megafauna: (1) human over -hunting (2) climate change leading to a reduced niche, or (3) a combination of climate change and human over -hunting. While two of the three hyp otheses invoke climate and environmental change as a factor impacting proboscidean extinctions, how climate change might have affected the suitability of the proboscideans' environments remains unclear. Here, using archaeological and paleontological locati on data and paleoenvironmental reconstructions of key environmental variables, we reconstruct and examine the niche space occupied by North American proboscideans and investigate the effects of climate -variable changes on niche space fluctuations between 30,000 and 10,000 years ago. Studying the impact of climate change on the proboscidean niche should facilitate parsing the non -human effects on their disappearance, and increase focus on the effects that human hunting might have had on these mammal extincti ons.

Our work involves discussions of the physical use of the interactive wearable technolo gy which includes a flex sensor of the elbow and two flex sensors of the knees. Overall, these flex sensors manipulate theatre lights through a sensor network that can change the lights' intensity, the lights' colors, and the colors' saturation. Through th is interaction of movement and the wearable technology, we can track whether communication occurs and determine how this affects the audience's understanding of the work in a performance setting. Through our research, we found that it is easier to track communication occurring between the dancers and the lights in specific sections of the work that directly relate the two elements. Although communication occurs in other sections of the work as well, it can be difficult for the audience to recognize and tr ack it. We seek to understand whether an easier process can occur to better equip the audience with the ability to recognize the lights and dancers' interactions. Additionally, we seek to determine the ways choreographed and improvisational movement influe nces how the dancers communicate in the space, which further influences their interaction with the theatre lights. Ultimately, in this process, communication does occur between the multiple entities in the space, and it enhances the work in a performance s etting by making the dancers aware of theatre lights communicating with them.

The context of the Great Recession provides a strong backdrop to discussions of what social actions exist in our modern economy and what rights might apply to those actions i n a philosophical sense. This project is primarily rooted in literature reviews of works concerning economic pathologies, studies of workforce behavior, and other explorations of behavior and outcomes in the modern economy. These works provide significant context to what motivates individuals in the post -recession economy and how their behavior may effect the economy. This project also serves as a complimentary basis to an ongoing book project undertaken by the advisor for the project.

Afte r a thorough analysis of the historical impact, the paper will then focus on direct comparisons between each genre's components. The research utilizes a variety of novels as well as academic writings to analyze the distinctiveness between aspects such as g enre origin, features of main characters, narrative landscape, and sexually empowered women. Often, each genre's individualities of overlooked because both are subgenres of detective fiction; however, critical scrutiny of the social and historical events t hat took place around the genesis of both genres, as well as selected examples pulled directly from texts and scholarly articles, reveals that the components of each genre are far more different than they are similar. A thorough examination of each of the selected texts highlights the unique socio -political issues that occurred at the naissances of both American Noir and Scandinavian Noir and how these events acted as a framework that influenced the various qualities of both genres. An explication of the so cial unrest and political instability during both time periods illuminates the ties that each genre held to their respective cultures and highlights the powerful effects that civil unrest has on literature. This paper further develops the way American even ts between World War I and World War II and Scandinavian events in the twentieth and twenty -first centuries comparatively impact each detective fiction subgenre. Research Mentor : Professor Shaun Hughes, Linguistics, Comparative Litera ture, Medieval Studies, English, College of Liberal Arts ; Poster Number: 148a :: Social Sciences/Humanities College of Liberal Arts The Grammar of Necessity in Epistemic vs. Deontic Language (ASL) linguistics is an understudied field. Here, we investigate how ASL shows necessity in two types of modal verbs: deontic and epistemic. Deontic modal verbs indicate or duty (e.g. \"You must go to work\") while an epistemic mod al verb expresses one's evaluation of the obligation (e.g. \"You must be hungry\"). In English, the deontic and epistemic form do not have to be differentiated. We propose that in ASL, these forms differ in non -manual markers (NMMs) (grammatical facial expre ssions or body movements). Specifically, the signs MUST and REQUIRE convey a deontic commitment, whereas SHOULD, which shares 2 of 3 manual features with MUST, show the epistemic form. We identify the combination of \"taut -mouth\" (tm) and \"head -back\" (hb) a s unique deontic modal verbs. Additionally, we find that the epistemic forms occur with 'hb', \"eye -squint\" (es), and mouthing of the first phoneme of the English equivalent. These differences in NMMs are crucial in differentiating SHOULD and MUST. Our r esults are consistent with Bross & Hole (2017). This study proposed that the universal hierarchy of syntactic projections (Cinque, 2006) applies to sign languages in addition to spoken languages. They theorized that higher projections will translate to hig her production locations on the body. In this hierarchy, the epistemic is placed higher than the deontic. This supports our findings of the epistemic 'es' occurring higher on the face than the deontic 'tm'. These results contribute to the limited understan ding of NMMs in ASL and linguistics as a whole.

The focus of my research examined Earhart's time at Purdue where she worked in the Department of Aeronautics as well as a consultant in careers for women. Most of my research was done by examining primary source documents from the Georg e Palmer Putnam Collection of Amelia Earhart Papers. In accordance with the archival material, I also used secondary sources to gain a greater perspective of the Purdue community's relationship with Earhart. My findings are that the impact of Amelia Earhar t's presence at Purdue University extends beyond her lifetime in terms of legacy. While at Purdue, Earhart proposed new academic curriculums, created support systems for female students, and made technological advances in the field of aviation. My research also suggests that AE influenced the mindset of women at Purdue and her achievements were jointly celebrated by her and the university.

The goal of thi s team is to analyze the Paris Climate Summit (COP21), the World Conservation Congress (WCC), and the XVI Congress of the International Society of Ethnobiology (ISE) in order to determine the extent to which underrepresented groups influence environmental governance. Undergraduate and graduate students from both Purdue University and Northwestern University have attended these policy events and have been working together as a collaborative group to analyze their in -field collection of data. Types of data c ollected at COP2, WCC, and the ISE events include photos, audio and visual recordings of proceedings, blog posts, spatial sketch mapping, interviews, documents and materials, and field notes. We use three innovative methodologies, collaborative event eth nography, visual ethnography, and digital ethnography, to examine how the practices and politics of global environmental governance shape the possibilities for influence. Data curation is a critical part of supporting collaborative qualitative work among ethnographic teams and producing transferable knowledge. My role in the P2I is to assist with data curation and management of multimodal data gathered from the collaborative event ethnography at ISE Bel\u00e9m +30. The goal is to replicate the data in a standard ized format, make data useable in excel sheets, and gain familiarity with the qualitative data for common themes that have emerged within and across the teams. Using BOX.com, I use our qualitative data protocols to sort through the mass amounts of digital data collected from the researchers in order to compose a collaborative archiving system. I have practiced different forms of data literacy associated with taking inventory of each piece of data, and translating the inventory to make sense in shared group space. The importance of a critical approach to data management in a collaborative research group promotes interdisciplinary team building, allows for other scientific communities to make sense of the great amount of data collections within our project, an d renders our data visible and useable for Indigenous Peoples.

Then it seeks to critically analyze the thematic progression of Jewish films in an attempt to find common themes among them in an effort to answer the question: what is a Jewish film? It also seeks to make predictions as to what the future of Jewish films could look like. This study was done by watching, analyzing, and dissecting films that are typically deemed as Jewish while taking into account the historical conditions of the Jewish people during the films' respective eras. Films of different eras, countries of origin, and genres were surveyed for the study. Then, the films were critically compared to find commonalities between them. The research concluded that Jewish films fall very well into certain pre -existing categorical eras coinciding with the historical condition that the Jewish people were in at the time of the film. Also, the theme of identity struggle was present and foregrounded in every film surveyed. However, this theme manifested itself in different ways depending on the film; some dealt with national identity, some with religious identity, etc. Thus, it seems that the theme of identity struggle persists in Jewish films over the boundaries of language, time, and country of origin. Given that identity is such a pertinent theme throughout all of Jewish cinema, it is safe to predict t hat this theme will carry over into the future; albeit manifesting itself in whatever way the future historical condition of the Jewish people dictates.

The role of human predation in these extinctions is widely debated in the field of archaeology. Experts now question the validity of qualitatively assessed bone surface modification (BSM) which was once interpreted as evidence of butchery, thereby implicating humans as proboscidean predators. This study utilizes new statistical techniques using 3D -imaging data to determine the origin of BSM observed on the skeletal remains of the Bowser Road Mastodon, excavated from Middletown, N.Y. This technique has been shown to have high accuracy in identifying types of BSM. Through this analysis the origin of the marks will be determined - whether from human activities such as hunting and butchering, or from taphanomic processes such plowing or trampling. This project will contribute to the dialogue surrounding the role of humans in the extinction of North America n megafauna. More specifically, the project will test a new method in identifying bone surface modification on faunal remains with a higher accuracy than current methods.

From the beginning of the project, the researchers experiment with utilizing different choreographic elements and proximity sensors to convey different themes and meanings. For the past two semesters, the research has continued to refine the choreography and the functionality of the proximity sensors. The goal of the current research culminates into the effective translation of the phenomenon of gender politics in social media and professional environments through choreography and interactive technology. There are two sections of the research. The first section is the creation of the visual performance utilizing the interactive technology and the choreography. The lights changing in the piece are a result of the interaction between the performers' proximities to each other, which is sensed through the proximity sensors (interactive technology). The choreography is designed to function in cooperation with the interactive technology to convey the power struggle and oppression that wome n face in professional settings. The second section of the research is done through literature review, in order to support the themes and motifs present in the meaning of the performance. Thorough research was conducted on the treatment of women in profess ional and academic settings, as well as treatment within the usage of social media. Research sourcing primary sources were also utilized in the performance in order to bolster the conveyance of the themes within the piece through spoken word. Both sections then amalgamate into the final performance, which combines choreographic movement, interactive technology, and spoken word in order to create an effective and impactful piece for the public.

It explores Mariana of Austria's activities while she was Queen Mother of Spain (1679 -1696), using her private re sidence as a means to understand the political influence she wielded in the court of her son, King Carlos II of Spain (r. 1665 -1700). The palace of Uceda served as a social and political hub for visiting dignitaries and guests who sought to gain favor with the Queen Mother in order to gain favor with the King. This project has looked specifically at the location of the palace relative to other government buildings in Madrid. We worked with an original seventeenth -century map of Madrid in order to identify t he location of the Palace of Uceda. We have dedicated part of our time during the WILKE internship to track down primary source documents on the diplomatic negotiations with France, the Holy Roman Empire, and other princes of Europe using the online catal ogues of the Newberry Library in Chicago. We approached our research based on specific periods and topics, such as the Peace of Nijmegen (1679), the War of Reunions (1683 -1684), intra -Hapsburg relations, the formation of the Grand Alliance against Louis XI V, the War of the Grand Alliance (1689 -1697), and many others.

The height, weight, arm length, arm circumference, skin folds, and percent body fat were measured in children in order to analyze this relationship. All of these measurements were taken throughout several year s from 2010 to 2018. The study measured children from ages 0 to 18. Children who were born vaginally were compared to children born via cesarean section in order to infer the relationship between birth mode and overweight in Mayan children. Tests have not been run yet, but we suspect that they will follow similar studies that have shown that children born via cesarean section in the Maya are subject to being overweight or obese as compared to other Mayan children that were born vaginally.

The Habsburg dynasty that ruled over the Habsburg lands, held the office of Holy Roman Emperor and ruled the Spanish monarchy in the Early Modern Period, very successfully executed marriage alliances that pass ed power, capital, and titles through the women. In this project we traced six women, starting with Maria of Austria (b. 1528) and ending with Maria Antonia of Austria (d. 1692). Through these women we studied the amount of money given to them at marriage, titles given to them through their marriage, and importantly what they were required to capitulate upon getting married. We studied them by looking at primary sources, including their marriage capitulations, as well as secondary sources. In this case, we have found that over the century and a half that these six women span, the amount given to them upon getting married increased, also women marrying into the French monarchy frequently gave up their inheritance rights to the Spanish throne. Most importantly , we found that the inheritance rights that passed through these women ultimately led to the War of the Spanish Succession, as there were many claimants to the throne through the Habsburg women they were related to. These Hapsburg women were exceptionally wealthy and powerful, and they only gained more wealth and power after they married.

Author: Abdulganiyu Gborigi Abstract: The TCA cycle enzyme fumarase is both found in the mitochondria as well as in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic organisms. Upon exposure to DNA damaging agents, expression of fumarase is induced and fumarase migrates to the nucleus. Double stranded DNA breaks ca n be repaired by two ways: non -homologous end joining, (NHEJ) and homologous recombination, (HR). HR requires homology of DNA in order to carry out its repair function while NHEJ repair DNA and doesn't require sequence homology, It joins two non -homologous ends together. In mammals, upon DNA damage, fumarase binds to H2A.Z, an ortholog of HTZ1p in yeast, and this interaction promotes the repair of damaged DNA. We hypothesize exogenous fumarate can bypass the interaction between fumarase and HTZ1 to promot e DNA repair. To test this hypothesis, we are testing the efficiency of DNA repair in cells containing or lacking HTZ1 and also the presence and absence of the metabolite fumarate. Fumarase produces a metabolite alpha -ketoglutarate -dependent histone demethylases, thus promoting double stranded DNA break repair by NHEJ in mammals. We speculate that if fumarate is provided as a supplement, it can improve the efficiency of this type of DNA repair. A re -ligation assay is bei ng used to measure the efficiency of NHEJ with or without exogenous fumarate, and a growth - based assay is being used to monitor HR.

Preliminary data from animal studies suggests that blueberries prevent bone loss due to their high polyphenolic content. This study quantified changes in urinary excretion of calcium radioisotope Ca -41 in postmenopausal women to assess the effects of the addition of blueberries to a regular diet on bone resorption. Methods: Freeze -dried blueberry powder was given to 14 healthy women who were at least 4 years past menopause. To determine the dose -response effect of blueberries on bone re sorption, all participants were administered with Ca -41 and changes in urinary Ca -41/Ca were measured by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry. The study consisted of a 5 -mo equilibration period for Ca -41 deposition in bone and a 6 - wk baseline period, in which non e of the participants were administered blueberries. This period was then followed by three alternating rounds of 6 -wk intervention periods and 6 -wk washout periods. Participants were given a randomly assigned sequence of low, medium, or high daily intake of freeze -dried blueberry powder during each intervention period. Twenty -four h urine was collected on a weekly basis during intervention and every 3 weeks during washout to compare the amount of Ca -41 lost from bone with and without the consumption of blu eberries. Results: Eighteen healthy postmenopausal women (average BMI = 26.2 \u00b1 3.9) were successfully recruited for this study and n = 14 successfully completed the entire study. Specimen analyses are in progress and their results will be presented at the Purdue Undergraduate Research Conference. Conclusion: Results from this study will help develop a better understanding of the effect of blueberries on bone health and determine whether some properties of berries have a therapeutic advantage in comparison t o other current methods to treating bone loss.

The goal of my research is to compare medications across drug manufacturers by quantifying these metrics. My team and I compile this information from reliable resources, such as the FDA Enforcement Reports and the FDA Data Dashboard, and then compile this information into a scorecard. By using graphs and charts to visually display each metric, this format consolidates high -level quality information in a way that patients are able to easily understand. As we continue, we hope to allow consumers to interact with the scorecard digitally by linking the overview of a metric to more detailed information. For example, we currently display a manufacturer's fie most recent recalls within the Recall Section. Later versions of the scorecard to link this section to a more comprehensive listing of all the recalls a firm has exper ienced. Having a way to quickly relate various drug manufacturers allows consumers to make more educated decisions regarding their medications. In an age of rising drug prices and competitive generic pharmaceutical market, it is imperative that patients a re given every resource possible to be smart consumers. The Drug Manufacturer Quality Scorecard is an important step to providing patients with the tools that they need to hold pharmaceutical manufacturers accountable for their products.

Organisms that may be affected by leachate include pathogens of aquatic organisms. The aquatic fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is a primary cause of amphibian populations declines over recent decades in many parts of the world. However, it is unclear how leachate from different tree species impacts Bd growth. To explore this topic, we tested the hypothesis that the leachate of various tree species would influence Bd growth due to their chemical composition. We predicted that gre ater Bd growth would occur at lower concentrations of leachate across all species. We also predicted greater Bd growth in leachate from invasive species relative to non -invasive species. A single strain of Bd was exposed to solutions of leachate from soake d leaves of one of six species for 10 days. The number of zoospores and zoosporangia were then quantified via light microscopy. We will present results of zoospore and zoosporangia densities across tree species and concentrations of leachate. These results can be a step towards a solution that might help mitigate the impact of Bd on amphibians.

This study examined for common genetic risk factors in Myasthenia Gravis (MG), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Celiac Disease (CEL), and Narcolepsy (NAR) in European popul ations. Meta - analysis genome -wide association scans were performed with publicly available datasets for the autoimmune diseases and disorders. METAL software was used to filter out the heterogeneous SNPs among the datasets to determine the common SNPs shar ed throughout at least any three of the examined autoimmune complications. METACARPA software was then used to calculate the meta -analysis p -value by correcting for any sample overlaps between the datasets. Initial scans showed an overlap in the genetic va riants with significant meta -analysis p -value scores, indicating that a number of autoimmune diseases and disorders share common genetic risk factors. The findings of common genetic risk factors can help in understanding the common genetic mechanisms and p athways that are shared among the studied autoimmune diseases and disorders.

In this type of molecular dispersion, the amorphous form of the drug achieves a thermodynamic solubility advantage over the crystalline form, resulting in higher bioavailability. Hot melt extrusion (HME) is one of two major techniques used to manufacture these amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs). Material, equipment, and process design variables contribute to the product performance of the ASD, and the goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of drug particle size on ASD formation. Physical mixtures of bicalutamide and PVPVA were prepared and analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry, and the calorimetric data was used to construct a te mperature -composition phase diagram. The acceptable processing design space for extrusion was derived from this phase diagram and guided the preparation of bicalutamide - PVPVA ASDs at various temperatures and residence times. The extent of residual crystall inity was determined by polarized light microscopy and powder X -ray diffraction. As expected, residual crystallinity decreases with increasing temperature and residence times across all particle sizes. ASDs prepared with larger starting particle sizes cons istently possess more residual crystallinity than ASDs prepared with smaller starting particle sizes. The extent of crystallinity in extruded ASDs reflect the kinetic nature of crystal dissolution in a polymer melt. Additional work will include preparation of ASDs from an intermediate particle size, additional sample characterization, and comparison of results to existing dissolution models.

For accomplishing this purpose, we created a private tool for professors and employers alike to provide surveys to their students/employees. The analysis of the data from these sur vey responses is done via scripts in R and the result from this consequent analysis is used to create personality characteristic based data visualizations with the aim of facilitating comparisons of an individual's characteristics with the broad characteri stics of the demographic. The individual completing the survey receives this information via a report which they can download from the ABAKAS website. In the report the individual also receives suggestions to improve in the said characteristics. The eventu al goal of ABAKAS is to reach a larger base of universities and businesses so as to promote a more self -aware and self -growth - based student body/workforce and enable individuals to seek out roles and tasks based on their evaluations either to reinforce exi sting strengths or strengthen weaker personality traits.

The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are comprised of multiple protein subunits and are known to alter chromatin structure to regulate transcription. One complex group in the SWI/SNF family, PBAF, is comprised of several subunits, including BRD7, ARID2, and BAF180. In previous studi es, conflicting information about intracellular localization of BRD7 in 4 -cell stage embryos has been reported. Porcine preimplantation embryos are a good model for human embryos because of their similar size and development. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the localization patterns of BRD7 in 4 -cell stage porcine embryos at various timepoints. We hypothesized that BRD7 would show a localization shift from the nucleus to the cytoplasm over the course of the 4 -cell stage. To assess thi s, porcine oocytes were parthenogenetically activated, cultured, and fixed at discrete timepoints. The intracellular localization of BRD7 in the parthenogenetic embryos was determined using an immunocytochemical staining approach. We found that at 36 hour s post -activation, only 13% of embryos showed a cytoplasmic enrichment of BRD7 (n=2/15), while the remaining embryos possessed ubiquitous staining (n=8/15) or weak nuclear localization (n=5/15). In contrast, at 52 hours post -activation, 30% of embryos show ed a cytoplasmic enrichment of BRD7 (n=6/20), while the remaining embryos possessed ubiquitous staining (n=9/25) or weak nuclear localization (n=5/20). These results indicate that BRD7 may be required up to the 4 -cell stage, at which point a shift to other SWI/SNF complexes might occur.

For example, pollution and habitat modification are common risks in human -made habitats that can often have unknown effects on host -pathogen dynamics. Wetlands are a common human -made habitat that are becoming increasingly common across much of No rth America and have the potential to support native plant and wildlife communities. However, these wetlands are typically established for water retention, and therefore do not prioritize habitat quality and wildlife health. Accordingly, we aimed to compar e differences in anuran community composition and infection levels of the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) between human -made and natural wetlands in central Indiana. We conducted visual encounter surveys of anurans communities and est imated Bd infection prevalence and infection load at 8 localities in Tippecanoe County (IN). Habitat characteristics, water parameters, and surrounding land -use practices were also compared across sites to examine their influence on anuran communities. We found significantly higher levels of infection prevalence at human -made sites than at natural sites. Several water parameters such as salinity and total dissolved solids were consistently higher at human -made sites than natural sites. These findings sugges t human -made wetlands pose a greater risk to anurans in contracting Bd infections. Understanding how environmental conditions common in human -made sites can direct conservation efforts to slow Bd spread or prevent outbreaks.

Studies have shown that the 35S promoter is often used in genetic research because it is a strong promoter in many plants. However, the 35S promoter in Ceratopteris richardii is relatively weak . Thus, the purpose of this project is to identify a strong promoter in Ceratopteris richardii that can be used for research regarding gene expression. To discover this pro moter, we used RNA sequencing technology to identify genes that were expressed at high levels in all parts of the plant. We originally collected the sequences of two such candidate promoters and identified primers that could be used to amplify the suspecte d location of the promoter using PCR. These PCR products were run in an ethidium bromide gel to determine the size of the fragments, and the resulting size was then compared with the predicted size of the fragment. The PCRs using these two gene sequences w ere not successful, so four more genes were used with the same process. Amplification of a sequence in the cyclophilin -like peptidyl -prolyl cis -trans isomerase gene has shown multiple fragments, including a band similar in size as the expected fragment. As this project continues, we will be working to isolate and sequence this fragment using a nested PCR as well as use other genes to identify promoter sequences. Once a promoter region is determined, this promoter can be cloned into a vector to promote the e xpression of green fluorescent protein. The vector will then be used to transform Ceratopteris richardii to determine if the promoter is expressed in all parts of the plant.

Though the precise mechanism of this specialized structure varies from species to species, adhesion is considered an incredibly effective approach to climbing in this manner. In this project focused on the Cre eping Fig (Ficus pumila), a common ornamental vine, we study the development and behavior of the adhesive pads present in the mature plant, and report on the chemical mechanism of adhesion which is used. This biological tool which has arisen from evolution ary differentiation has tremendous potential in the field of strong synthetic adhesives, as it may be incorporated in glues with the unique property of being biodegradable. The demand for biodegradable adhesives is ever increasing, as in today's world virt ually all manufacturing processes and components are being driven toward more \"green\" methods. Possible applications for such a glue span from the world of agriscience to biomedical use.

PFAS rapidly bioaccumulate in larval amphibians, and studies increasingly demonstrate detrimental effects on larval growth and development. Additionally, it has been hypothesized that PFAS could impair the immune function of amphibians. Given that disease is one of the major contributors to global amphibian declines, PFAS has t he potential to significantly alter host -pathogen interactions in this system. However, the effects of PFAS in conjunction with other natural stressors are unknown. We examined the effects of PFAS exposure on the interaction between larval Northern leopar d (Lithobates (PFHxS), which commonly occur at contaminated sites. Larvae were exposed to 10 ppb or 100 ppb concentra tions of each PFAS for 10 days. Following the chemical exposure, the larvae were moved to fresh water and exposed individually to 50 trematodes to their ability to resist infections. We found that exposure to PFAS significantly influenced trematode loads in Northern Leopard larvae. However, the effects were dependent on the chemical and concentration. More specifically, larvae exposed to 10 ppb of PFHxS had 17.5% greater parasite loads relative to the control, while exposure to 100 ppb of PFHxS did not a lter parasite load. We also found no effect of either concentration of PFOS on parasite loads in the larvae compared to the control. These findings suggest that PFHxS may have greater immunosuppressive effects on amphibian larvae than PFOS. Figure work exa mining a broader range of concentrations and parasite exposure levels is warranted. Collectively, our study calls attention to the potential effects of PFAS exposure on disease risk in natural systems. Research Mentor : Jason T.

Growth and motility of Bd c an be inhibited by elevated salt concentrations (NaCl), which has been suggested to be a mitigation technique. However, salts often infiltrate wetlands after they are applied to roads in many parts of North America. There is little known about how various road salts impact Bd proliferation, and how they differ from common NaCl exposure. This study investigated how different road salts at various concentrations affect the growth and motility of Bd. We predicted that Bd growth would be lowest when exposed t o road salts that contain more de -icing chemicals such as calcium chloride (CaCl2) and that Bd growth would be the greatest in salts that contain fewer de -icing chemicals, such as Beet -infused road salt. Bd was cultured in NaCl, CaCl2, and Beet salt at con centrations of 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 parts per thousand (ppt). We measured growth and viability via zoospore and zoosporangia identification and quantification. We found that mean number of zoospores was higher in no -salt controls than in Beet salt and NaCl t reatments. Further, mean density of zoosporangia did not differ across salt treatments, but all salt -exposed treatments had lower zoosporangia densities than no -salt controls. Our findings suggest several types of roads salts may have negative effects on B d growth that could translate to lower infections in amphibians. Mean zoospore and zoosporangia densities did not differ across salinity concentrations suggesting that Bd can equally tolerate concentrations of several salt types up to 2.0 ppt. Future s tudies should explore how road salts directly affect amphibians and how infection dynamics change when both host and pathogen are in the presence of these salts.

As a result, new methods for generating, simulating, testing, and proving out network optimization techniques are essential to maintaining performant wireless communications.This project explores a novel application of genetic algorithms for generating network topologies which are leveraged to dynamically test protoc ol level network optimizations in an autonomous fashion. By approaching optimization testing in this manner, potential optimization approaches can be validated against a far greater number of potential network variations while also gradually isolating exac tly which types of topologies a specific optimization technique is most vulnerable to. Certain optimization techniques which may at first seem robust, can be proven to have critical weaknesses through the application of this process.This end to end process has yielded non trivial benefits in rapidly classifying which avenues of optimization will potentially yield useful performance gains and which will not - ultimately providing an efficient approach to network optimization development.

These attractive orange and yellow fungi are a natural delicacy, and the global trade in chanterelles exceeds $1 b illion per year. Like so many other clades of fungi, only a fraction of the chanterelles' true diversity in North America is known to science. Given their economic and ecological value, I believe that chanterelles deserve a phylogenetic analysis using the full capabilities of modern DNA sequencing technology. This project will determine how many species of chanterelles there are within Indiana and how they are related to each other and species across the world. DNA was extracted from over 100 chanterelle sp ecimens collected during the recent Indiana Mycoflora Project, and the genes for transcription elongation factor 1 (TEF1) and the large ribosomal subunit (LSU) were used as barcode regions. Incorporating observations of each specimen's morphology, the sequ ence data were compared with previous database entries and published literature on Midwestern chanterelles. Evidence of chanterelle species never before recorded in the Midwest was found, and some specimens may represent species new to science. Further phy logenetic analysis will clarify chanterelle taxonomy, identifying synonymous and divergent species and establishing the evolutionary relationship between them. The project will contribute nearly 200 barcode sequences of Indiana chanterelles to public datab ases, and hopefully generate public interest in mycology from mushroom hunters throughout the state and beyond.

IL- 9 producing T helper cells (Th9) are mainly known for their role against parasitic infections and driving allergic and intestinal inflammation, though there is still much left not understood about their mechanisms of differentiation. The cytokine IL -2 has proven to be an important cytokine in Th9 differentiation in vitro but the environments where Th9 cells are typically found in vivo are largely depleted of IL -2. Previous experiments indicate that other signals could be present in vivo that substitute I L-2 signaling in Th9 differentiation. Our first experiments tested several cytokines/inflammatory mediators present in highly inflammatory and IL -2-depleted environments in vivo to identify if these signals could replace IL -2 signaling in the in vitro cult ure system. Both IL-1b and the TLR2 ligand, Pam3CSK4, were capable of rescuing IL -9 production when IL -2 signaling was blocked. Additional experiments showed that both IL -1b and Pam3CSK4 induced expression of the Th9 - associated transcription factor BATF, s uggesting this pathway may be involved. As both IL -1b and Pam3CSK4 signal through MyD88 and NFkB protein pathways, we can speculate that several cytokines that signal in this pathway may function to rescue IL -9 production in IL -2-depleted environments. The se data overall give a clearer indication of the mechanism of Th9 differentiation in vivo and the relation between the MyD88 and NFkB pathways and IL -9 production. Research Mentor : Matthew R. Olson, Biological Sciences, College of Sci ence ; Poster Number: 175a :: Life Sciences College of Science Expression and Purification of a Putative Chromodomain from BAF155 - A Subunit of the SWI/SNF Complex Author: Rachel Collicott Abstract: Small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT), is a rare type of ovarian cancer. Although it is rare, it is extremely aggressive, primarily affects young women, with an average age of diagnosis of 23, and the majority of patients die within 2 years. By sequencing cohorts of tumors from SCCOH T patients, scientists recently discovered that these cancers are driven by an inactivating mutation of a single gene called SMARCA4, also known as BRG1. BRG1 is the ATPase of the SWI/SNF, also known as the BRG1 associating factors (BAF) complex. This comp lex is a chromatin remodeling complex, which creates regions of accessible DNA required for gene activation. BRG1 has a series of bromodomains that it uses to create these accessible regions of DNA through interactions with acetylated lysine residues on hi stone tails. The presence of BRG1 is essential for function of the BAF complex. The BAF complex is needed for gene expression and, without BRG1 to power the complex, the mechanism of gene expression in these cell lines is unknown. Determining the specific interactions between chromatin and BRG1's bromodomains is essential for understanding the mechanism of gene expression in SCCOHT cell lines. To accomplish this, BRG1 bromodomain mutant lines in SCCOHT cell lines COV 434 and TOV122D will be constructed. Aft er confirmed mutant lines have been established, sequential salt extractions will be performed to determine how presence or absence of the various bromodomains effect the binding affinity of the BAF complex to chromatin. Over 20% of cancers have mutations in one or more subunits of this complex, making uncovering the mechanism by which the BAF complex suppresses cancer of utmost importance. Specifically, the mutation of another subunit, ARID1A, is present in the majority of ovarian clear cell carcinoma pati ents, making our work with the SWI/SNF complex in regard to SCCOHT relevant for many other ovarian cancers.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the microenvironment that may lead to oxidative stress (OS), interact with stromal components, change ECM stiffness, and may play a role in carcinogenesis. Interestingly, ROS has been reported to alter nuclear morphometry (shape and size) itself under the influence of mechanotransduction from the ECM that is known to control gene expression. Our central hypothesis is that the density of ECM, influenced by ROS, increases the risk of can cer via an altered nuclear morphology controlling gene expression. We have used a three -dimensional (3D) cell culture model that comprises non - neoplastic HMT 3522 breast epithelial S1 cells embedded in collagen 1 matrix with stiffness (800 Pa) similar to that of real tissue, and a higher stiffness of 1500 Pa which correlates with the density of tissues -at-risk for cancer. To induce acute OS, cells were exposed to 250 M H2O2 for four hours on day 10 of culture. Using immunostaining for the distribution of Z O-1, a marker of apical polarity we have measured a significant loss of polarity in the cell population exposed to ROS compared to the control group. Moreover, cells cultured on a stiffer matrix, exhibited bigger and less circular nuclei compared to those cultured in the matrix of 800 Pa. These results confirm the role of microenvironment on influencing cell phenotype. Further we will study induced -changes in matrix stiffness under ROS by incorporating fibroblasts in the culture model. Research Mentor : Dr. Sophie A.

Although they are one of the leading causes of death in these areas there has been very little research done on them. Previous studies have shown that the current first aid treatment protocol is not effective.This project aims to design an improved snake bite kit to replace the traditional ace bandage developed in A ustralia and distributed by humanitarian organizations. Data from previous studies were analyzed to determine the most effective combination of snake bite treatments. Tourniquets, local herbal remedies, and incisions were found to have no increase in survi val rates. The single variable most strongly liked to rates of survival was distance to a healthcare facility and ability to immobalize the limb. A tightly wrapped crepe bandage to limit flow of poison was found to have the highest improvement in survival rates out of any currently used treatment if applied correctly; however, further studies have shown that very few people including healthcare professionals and the layperson could effectively wrap the bandage after being instructed on how to do so. One exp erimental study has shown that a small high pressure rubber bandage on the location of the snake bite with immobalisation could have similar if not greater benefits than the crepe bandage. Current materials to allow easy immobalisation of a limb exist but have never been put together in an effective snake bite kit to be distributed to poisonous snake prone areas of the world. This kid would include a retractable splint to be used on either an arm or a leg and sling materials to allow for immobalisation of a n arm. The proposed device to take the place of the crepe bandage is a localized pressure bandage similar to a blood pressure cuff. The bandage will allow for increase of pressure when an air pump is pushed and will have a small pressure gauge with marking s to allow the layperson to see when they have increased the pressure enough. This device would also allow for slow reduction of pressure by a healthcare professional after antivenom has been administered to prevent sudden envenomation. This device would a llow the average layperson to be able to administer the correct amount of pressure on the area of a snakebite until a healthcare facility could be reached.

Our preliminary studies revealed that under acute ROS exposure, the breast epithelium produced in 3D cell culture displayed loss of polarity, a barrier against cancer development. Our central hypothesis is that microenvironmental oxidative stress in synergy with altered matrix stiffness promotes breast cancer risk via activation of stromal cells. To test our hypothesis we are using 3D cell culture models that comprise human mammary fibroblasts HMS32 -hTER T cells. Exposure to 250 M H2O2 for four hours and 25 M H2O2 for 10 days, induced acute and chronic OS respectively. To test the effect of matrix stiffness on stromal cells, fibroblasts were embedded in collagen I matrices of 770 Pa and 2000 Pa stiffnes s. Phenotypic changes were measured on a per cell basis using cell shape (phalloidin staining of the actin skeleton) and nuclear morphometry (DAPI staining of DNA). Fibroblasts displayed a higher percentage of activated phenotype under increased stiffness and chronic OS. In addition at higher stiffness (2000 Pa), HMS320 -hTERT cells displayed bigger and less circular nuclei compared to those at 770 Pa. To better understand the effect of ROS activated fibroblasts on tissue stiffness and breast epithelium, we will coculture epithelial cells on fibroblasts embedded in collagen I matrix and expose them to a gradient of ROS using a microfluidics -based tissue -chip.

Salt concentrations may also influence other aspects of the ecosystem, in cluding the invasion of non -native species. In this experiment, two freshwater species were used to study the effects of salinity on invasion. A salt sensitive zooplankton native to North America ( lumholtzi ) were used to simulate an invasion scenario across three salt concentration treatments (0 g/L, 0.75 g/L, and 1.5g/L of NaCl). Because D. dentifera appear to be more sensitive to salt concentrations, it was predicted that D. lumholtzi would be m ore likely favored to invade the population of D. dentifera at higher salt concentrations. D. lumholtzi and D. dentifera were counted weekly to monitor population density over time. On the day of invasion, densities of D. dentifera were significantly lower in the 1.5 g/L salt concentration when compared to the 0.75 g/L and 0 g/L salt treatments. These differences in D. dentifera densities across salt concentrations diminished by the final sampling day. In addition, there were no significant differences in D. lumholtzi densities or total Daphnia densities between salt treatments by the last sampling day. It was expected that D. lumholtzi invasion would be facilitated by higher salt concentrations, however this experiment contradicted that prediction by ultima tely showing no significant differences in D. lumholtzi population densities. Although D. dentifera populations appear relatively resilient to high salinity, the low overall numbers of D. lumholtzi could have limited our ability to observe any significant impacts their invasion had on the populations of D. dentifera . Ultimately, our data could suggest some mechanism of tolerance to high salinity in D. dentifera , perhaps through the uptake of salt or evolved tolerance and that the trajectory of D. lumholtzi populations in invaded communities may not be influenced by salinity.

However, roles are being found for lncRNAs in beneficial processes such as controlling gene expression. In some of these cases, lncRNAs form R -loops in vivo. R -loops are nucleic acid structures consisting of hybridized strands of single -stranded DNA (ssDNA) and single -stranded RNA as well as a displaced strand of ssDNA. Formation of these R -loops is important for gene regulation by the lncRNAs. However, the mechanisms by which this form of regul ation occurs is poorly understood. Thus, there is a need to identify factors that participate in R -loop mediated gene repression. To identify such factors, a genetic reporter strain has been constructed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the PHO84 gene. It is an appropriate gene for the reporter because expression of PHO84 is suppressed by the formation of R -loops containing an antisense lncRNA produced downstream of PHO84. The PHO84 reporter strain is being used to perform direct testing of factors that pot entially interact with R -loops to suppress gene expression. A synthetic gene array screen will also be performed in S. cerevisiae to identify genes that promote R -loop formation genome -wide. The effects of these genes will be studied thoroughly to develop a mechanistic understanding of how they interact with R -loops and how they suppress gene expression.

Previous studies have shown that a natura l extract from Lippia origanoides possesses significant anti -cancer properties. In this study we confirm the concentration -dependent decrease in viability of MDA -MB-231 cells treated with L42, as well as a significant increase in cleaved caspase 8 in MDA -MB-231 cells treated with L42, demonstrating the activation of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, and thereby explaining the decrease in cell viability. We also show that the main metabolic pathways were being targeted by the extract. In this study we pro vide evidences that L42 is a potential source of bioactive compounds that could be used for alternative treatment for TNBC.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the biological pathways and key genetic contributors that lead to MG. In this study, we performed functional annotation of the significant variants from the results of an MG Genome -Wide Association (GWAS) study on a Southeastern European population. Furthermore, the three approaches used were positional mapping of the SNPs, pathway analysis, and eQTL mapping. The positional and eQTL mapping were performed through FUMA. We annotated the SNPs to genes based on their physical position, and for the eQTL we used data from public repositories to test whether the expression of the gene is associated with allelic variation at the SNP. For the pathway analysis we used MAGMA; first, gene -analysis was performed in order to determine the p -value per gene based on whether the SNPs included in a gene were significantly associated with MG. Thirty -five genes were detected by all three approaches using the early -onset MG cases; all of them are located in the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region, which is reported to be associated with MG in previous studies. Five genes in the dataset including both early and late onset cases were detected by all three approaches, one being THEMIS and the other fou r are located in the MHC region. Overall, our study supports the results of previous studies as well as identifying novel risk factors. Further studies into the functions and mechanisms of these novel genes may allow researchers to develop therapeutics and treatments which would delay the progression of the disease or lessen the symptoms.

Virulent Agrobacterium strains contain a large tumor inducing (Ti) plasmid. A portion of the Ti plasmid, the transferred DNA (T -DNA) region, is mobilized into the plant and randomly integrates into the plant genome, creating genetically mod ified (GM) organisms. Researchers have used this system to make transgenic plants by placing genes of interest in the T -DNA. However, the exact mechanism of T -DNA integration is unknown. T - DNA most likely integrates into nicks or breaks in the plant genome using an unknown DNA repair pathway. T - DNA border sequences are located at the sites where the Ti -plasmid is nicked so that a single strand T -DNA molecule (the T -strand) can be peeled off and transferred to the plant; T -DNA borders thus define and delimit T-DNA. T -circles, which are circular, double -stranded, extrachromosomal T -DNA structures found in plants after Agrobacterium -mediated transformation, may serve as surrogates to study T -DNA integration in plants. Previous sequencing of T -circles showed tha t conjoined T -DNA border sequences mimic T -DNA/plant DNA junction sites in transgenic plants. T -circles and integrated T -DNA/plant DNA junction sites both show patterns such as small deletions or filler DNA insertions around the left and right T -DNA border s. I have constructed a plasmid that can be used more efficiently to isolate T -circles from Agrobacterium -infected plants. I plan to use this plasmid to isolate and characterize T -circles from wild -type Arabidopsis thaliana and several different DNA repair mutants. I shall determine if specific DNA repair pathways affect T -circle prevalence or the sequences of T-circle border junctions, and apply these results to understand the role of these pathways in T -DNA integration into the plant genome.

Gelvin Department of Biological Sciences College of Science ; Poster Number: 184a :: Mathematical/Computational Sciences College of Science Reflection learning with Neural Network Ensemble Author: Mars Gao Abstract: For the current architecture of neural networks, it usually requires a high training cost in time and computation. From our perspective, the current methods in deep learn - ing might not be optimal in architecture and it fails to have an effective le arning strategy. To solve these problems, in this paper, we would like to introduce the Collaborative Neural Network Group (CNNG). CNNG is a series of neural networks that work collaboratively to handle different tasks separately in the same learning syste m. It is evolved from a single neural network by our designed algorithm \u2014 Reflection. In this way, based on different situations extracted by the algorithm, the CNNG is able to perform different strategies when predicting the input data. In our implementat ion, the CNNG is combined with several relatively small neural networks. We provide a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of CNNG compared to other learning methods on three public datasets. The CNNG is able to get a higher accuracy with a mu ch lower training cost. With CNNG by reflection, we can reduce the error rate of 74.6% by average and reach a high accuracy for many tasks, which is superior to VGG and ResNet on the tested datasets. For Fashion -MNIST and EMNIST, it can reach 98.81% and 90 .88% which is the best performance currently. Moreover, the required training time is usually less than 40 minutes in our experiments. Details can be found in the experiment part. Research Mentor : He Wang, Computer Science Department, Purdue ; Poster Number: 185a :: Life Sciences College of Science Structural Analysis BamB bacteria have both a plasma membrane and an outer membrane, whereas gram -positive bacteria only have a plasma membrane. The outer membranes of gram -negative bacteria have outer membrane proteins(OMPs) which are essential for the bacteria's survival. Folding and insertion of OMPs into the outer membrane is facilitated by th e multi -component beta -barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex. The BAM complex is comprised of an integral membrane, BamA, and four periplasmic lipoproteins BamB -E. Although not an essential part of the complex, BamB is required for proper folding of OMPs and its disruption leads to decreased virulence in various pathogenic bacteria. Acinetobacter baumannii is a gram negative and multi -drug resistant bacteria that is responsible for a major fraction of hospital -acquired infections. Previous studies have sh own that BamB is a potential target for novel anti -microbial therapies against A. baumannii; therefore, a proficient understanding of its structure may aid in the development of such therapies. In this study, A. baumannii BamB was expressed and purified fr om Escherichia coli using nickel affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. Protein crystals were obtained using the hanging drop crystallization method and diffracted at a resolution of 2.14 angstroms. We have yet to solve the structure, b ut ongoing research is underway using molecular replacement and experimental phasing. Research Mentor : Nicholas Noinaj, Biology, College of Science ; Robert E.

This project used a genetic approach to better understand the biology of the Montezuma quail (Cyrtonyx montezumae), a gamebird found in the Southwestern United States and Mexico. This species is considered vulnerable to extirpation in Texas, but populations in Arizona and New Mexico are robust and have the potential to serve as a source for active management actions such as translocations, assisted gene flow or genetic rescue. We analyzed molecular evolution, and spatial genetic variation of Montezuma quail using both high co verage whole genome sequencing (WGS) and SNP array genotyping techniques. Our SNP results indicate the isolated Texas population exhibits a very small effective population size, is genetically distinct from our Arizona and New Mexico samples, and has reduc ed heterozygosity at fitness -related markers, exacerbating its risk for local extirpation.

In doing so, the goal was to provide the Honors College with a list of factors that contribute to enrollment persistence. Related research projects have focused on specific honors college programs in other universities and the pros and cons of their specific programs, the most common benefits cited being smaller class size, relationships to faculty, the living community, a rigorous curriculum, and peer interaction. However, no such research had been done for the Purdue University Honors College. Our research team dispersed a survey to current junior and senior honors students at Purdue in spring of 2019, asking our participants why they elected to complete the Honors College curriculum and how their values ha d changed over the course of their college experience. Results are currently being evaluated, however, we expect a small number of \"core\" reasons for staying in the Honors College to emerge in our data. We also expect those reasons to change over time, suc h as decreasing value for seniors. Once we have a sufficient population, data will be analyzed by finding majority reasons for continuing with the curriculum and adapting to the Honors College. Any pertinent trends within those majorities related to demogr aphics of the population will be highlighted.

Biochemical characterization of the yeast homolog Ste24 will help elucidate the catalytic mechanism and function of human ZMPSTE24. The yeast zinc metalloprotease Ste24 is an integral membrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and inner nuclear membranes. The main function of Ste24 is to mediate two cleavage events in the maturation of the yeast a -factor mating pheromone. This enzyme first catalyzes the endoproteolysis of C -terminal -aaX residues and a second upstream N -terminal cleavage of the a -factor substrate. Ste24 is unique in st ructure, as it comprises seven membrane -spanning helices to form a hollow catalytic chamber containing four portals, which are suspected to be sites for the a -factor substrate entrance and release. To examine the role of portal 1 as the substrate entry po int, Ste24 double cysteine mutants were generated around the portal, chosen for its proximity to the enzyme active site. Membrane -permeable disulfide crosslinkers were then used to block the portal to substrate entry. The AAX cleavage activity was subseque ntly methylation assay. After crosslinking, the radioactive assay revealed lower activity in the crosslinked proteins, as expected due to portal occlusion. These results indicate the importance of portal 1 in C-terminal cleavage and suggest a major role for portal 1 as the entry site for a - factor.

Identification is determined through matching a scan/photo back to a template of the original subject through quality metrics. As subjects age, there is a possibly that matching back to the template could become more difficult because of changes to the body. Humans go through the most rapid physical and developmental changes during early childhood, particularly from ages zero months to eight years. This project focused on the impact on iris quality scores for 80 participants as they age. Participants' ages ranged from 2 to 75 months and iris data was col lected from three biometric devices: VistaEY2H (556 images), M6 -Dim (982 images), and AOptix (2304 images). Subjects visited up to 12 times for image captures. Data from subjects were collected by the International Center for Biometrics f or a study of iris identification for the Global Good Foundation. All the statistics from the iris image captures are from NeuroTechnology VeriEye. Quality score is the focus statistic for this project. Presented is preliminary analysis that shows a weak c orrelation between the statistics.

Phages are extensively studied so that they can act as potential alternative to antibiotics. The purpose of this study is to examine a phage DNA sequence and identify possible genes by using a variety of software and comparing its genome to known conserved sequences. DNA Master was used to perform an auto -annotation of the Mycobacterium bacteriophage of the 3' end of Cora zon, specifically genes 93 -108 (56145 -64744 bp) of the genome. These results were compared to start sites recommended by GeneMarkS, Starterator, NCBI BLAST, and Phamerator. Corazon has 108 genes before editing the auto annotation, and we added genes 93.5 a nd 106.5, which is a total of 18 genes. For this study, 16 genes were annotated at the 3' end of the Corazon draft; most of the genes were reverse genes with no associated functions. Each start site for the 16 genes found was supported with evidence from t he software. In the future, the work done with the Corazon genome can be compared to other phage genomes under annotation to help generate the correct gene calls. Because the majority of gene functions are NKF, future research would require using reverse g enetics to knock out the genes of interest in order to observe the mutated phenotypes of the phages.

Insecticide resistance has made it difficult to control ticks and the diseases they transmit. Studying the IscaW1 genome assembly of I. scapularis can provide insights to genetic factors related to vector competence and acaricide targets. Here we analyzed genetic variation in populations of I. scapularis collected from sites in Indiana and Northeast regions. Heterogeneity among the individual ticks was analyzed using small nucleot ide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers previous identified in genes from the IscaW1 genome assembly. Variation between different regions was analyzed using genomic DNA pools composed of several different ticks. Primer pairs were designed to amplify SNPs predicte d in multiple I. scapularis genes potentially associated with tick parasitism or identified as under positive selection pressure. Following PCR amplification, amplicons were analyzed and purified on 1.5% agarose gel, and excised bands were gel purified and sequenced. Heterogeneity at SNP loci was determined by comparing sequences to the IscaW1 reference assembly via multiple alignment software. One SNP predicted in a hypothetical protein gene was confirmed in ticks collected from Indiana, Massachusetts, an d New Hampshire, suggesting little heterogeneity at this locus in ticks from Midwest and Northeastern states. PCR revealed that bioinformatic analyses were most predictive for SNP loci in Southeastern I. scapularis, and less predictive for loci in Midweste rn and Northeastern ticks. For the loci analyzed in this study, our data suggests greater genetic variation in Midwest and Northeast I. scapularis populations, consistent with theories regarding the evolution of this vector in North America.

Not only is it notorious for its casualty rate, but also for the sheer amount of planning and preparation on both sides. The allies with their bombing raids, and false flag operations to sow confusion, a nd the axis with their formidable Atlantic wall defenses and veteran troops, this was a battle doomed to end violently. And that it did, with almost three thousand allied losses, this was one of the bloodiest battles of World War Two for the American force s. The documentation for this battle has been carefully recorded and expanded upon over the years in many publications. However, the lack of a truly convincing visual representation is apparent. Many films and video games have tried to replicate Omaha beac h to varying degrees of success. Films are usually highly detailed and historically accurate, but are only visible to the public in predetermined shots and sequences. Videogames on the other hand have the opposite problem, they are detailed enough and easi ly explored by the player, but often fall flat in terms of the scale and true historical layout of Omaha. Not to mention the player will find himself dodging bullets while trying to get a good view of the terrain. To solve these limitations, we have decid ed to take a hybrid approach to bring Omaha beach to the public as a general purpose, educational, and open source model. With full freedom to explore in a virtual environment, this model will be the ultimate educational tool. Using real -world terrain data that accurately reflects the topographical conditions of 1944, and fortifications as they looked on the fateful morning of June 6th, this project will be the principle recreation of Omaha beach.

In some research, there is indication that adoption of conservation pract ices improves producers' abilities to withstand these events, as well as benefit the environment overall. Adoption of these practices requires awareness from the producer, as well as the understanding that these practices may be used as a risk management s trategy. It is largely unknown what impact the presence of crop insurance has on producers' long -term risk management strategies, and whether conservation practices are included as risk management. To determine this, we developed a survey assessing produce rs' views on crop insurance, risk management, and the adoption of conservation practices. This survey was then sent out to 2000 producers throughout Indiana and Iowa, with a response rate of 38%. Results from this survey indicate that while producers do no t directly associate crop insurance as limiting, there is indication that producers' reliance on crop insurance may have a nuanced effect on their risk management decisions and view of conservation practices, which may impact their security in the face of climate change.

Though ROS are typically associated with oxidative stress, there has been emerging evidence that ROS regulate neuronal development. It is, however, presently unknown whether Nox enzymes act downstream of growth and guidance cue receptors. Previous work in the lab has shown that neurite growth and guidance in response to specific guidance cues is abolished when Nox enzymes are inhibited or mutated. In order to test the hypothesis that growth cone ROS levels are altered in res ponse to guidance cues, we will express the ROS biosensor roGFP2 -orp1 in developing zebrafish embryos. We will then culture retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from these zebrafish embryos and treat them with the guidance cues netrin -1, BDNF, and slit2. It is hy pothesized that guidance cues alter ROS levels in the RGCs and that this would be hindered when Nox enzymes are inhibited. Research Mentor : Daniel M.

The earliest bacterial colonization of the infant's intestines can determine the fate of the gut microbiome for the rest of the life and even though the infa nt formula is fortified with nutrients, its effect on the gut microbiome remains to be addressed. We hypothesize that the nutrient composition of infant formula will control the composition, abundance, and function of the gut microbiome in developing infan ts, which could impact short and long -term health. The impact of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins as sources of nutrition are determined based on how they modulate the abundance and composition of the bacteria in the gut microbiome. These nutrients are individually tested in vitro in a chemically defined medium. The environment is anoxic and held at a 37\u00b0C to mimic the conditions found in the lower digestive tract. These experiments will highlight the importance of the bio-chemical link between the infant gut microbiome and infant diet.

This prevalence can be attributed to both a lack of prognosis and prevention. Therefore, it is important to identify biomarkers that can accurately predict and diagnose the onset of early -stage development of cancer. One way to possibly prevent lung cancer onset is through targeting a class of genes called cancer drivers. A cancer driver is defined as any genetic factor that can itself cause cancer. By targeting these drivers, we will have a better chance of controlling the transformation of a normal cell to a cancerous cell. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate cellular processes by repressing target gene expression by either inhibiting protein translation or cleaving the messenger RNAs. While miRNAs regulate normal cellular behavior, the deregulation of miRNA expression is associated with the initiation and progression of human cancers where they act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors contributing to tumorigenesis. The overarching aim of this project is to identify the driver genes and miRNAs that when knocked out, drive tra nsformation of the non -cancerous HBEC -KP cells. Cas9 and a CRISPR small guide RNA library were co -transduced in cells for generating genome -wide knockouts and three different assays were performed for selecting cells with transformed phenotypes. The overal l hypothesis of this project is that the loss of certain genes or miRNAs can potentiate the transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells that carry KRAS G12V; p53 knock -down (HBEC -KP).

Despite this, magnesium deficiencies are often overlooked. This project evaluated the bioavailability of Remag , a magnesium chloride sup plement, by comparing the bioavailability of magnesium in healthy, adult, participants taking this product versus a magnesium oxide or magnesium citrate supplement. It was hypothesized that Remag will be better absorbed as compared to the other supplement s because the company has marketed it's product as being a molecularly smaller form of magnesium then it's competitors. Participants were eligible if they were between the ages of 18-65 years, fell within an 18 -35 kg/m2 range for body mass index (BMI), a nd blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg. Analysis of each participant's blood and urine were used to determine magnesium status. Total magnesium in serum, red blood cells, and urine were assessed using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Ionized magnesium in wh ole blood and urine were determined using a magnesium selective electrode using a clinical analyzer. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) in serum was analyzed using an antibody -based assay. Lastly, urinary creatinine was measured to control for kidney function and urine volume. Currently, the first 15 participants to complete this study have been given Mg citrate (NatureCalm). While that last 15 participants to complete the study will be given a supplement by the company NOW, but this sample has not been tested yet.

Mushroom poisoning, a problem commonly related with mushrooms occurs due to misidentification of mushrooms. To accurately identify field mushrooms, rely on several morphological traits to discriminate between taxa, and on an understanding of how mushroom growth and development changes through time, climates, and environments. Here we have developed an application based on machine learning. We used Google's tensorflow library with to create our android application. The applications responsibility is to classify image s into its respective classes of mushrooms. For this purpose, we collected hundreds of images of mushrooms were collected, sanitized and then used in our machine learning algorithms. The resulting graphs were then converted into mobile version and transpor ted over to the android platform. As a proof -of-principle, we trained our application on the genuses, Gyromitra and Morchella and then tested. For our testing purposes we kept 20 images from the training sample as our unseen data. Afterwards the applicatio n was tested against these images and application returned the correct diagnosis as follows. Gyromitra in all test cases (100% sensitivity, and 90% specificity) and Morchella in all but one test cases (90% sensitivity and 100% specificity).

Presently, there is no targeted therapy against TNBC, and the survival rate of patients is poor. This low survival rate highlights the need of nov el therapies, which can target TNBC effectively. Towards this, electrochemotherapy can be an attractive alternative because it utilizes the synergy of electrical pulses and chemotherapeutics to target cancer cells which does not depend upon the receptors for its effects. We evaluated the effects of electrochemotherapy with cisplatin on the viability profile of MDA -MB-231 cells, an aggressive, metastatic and drug resistant TNBC cell line. We applied electric field intensity of 600V/cm and 800V/cm with dif ferent cisplatin concentrations of 10\u00b5M, 50\u00b5M, and 100\u00b5M and evaluated cell viability profile using the MT assay. Our results indicate that the viability loss in MDA -MB-231 cells directly correlates with the increase in the electrical pulse energy and cisp latin dosage. At 4 hours, the viability decreased by 46.5% at 800V/cm and 100\u00b5M of cisplatin, while the viability decrease was 28.6% for 600V/cm and 100\u00b5M of cisplatin. These results highlight that it is possible to tune the cell death in TNBC cells, by re fining the electrical pulse parameters and cisplatin dosage to effectively target TNBC cells.

PDAC is associated with robust coagulation system activity evidenced by high expression of the coagulation genes Protease Activated Receptor 1 PDAC patient samples. Previous studies in the lab have discovered that knocking down PAR -1 in a mouse PDAC cell line (KPC2) drastically reduced tumor growth in vivo and uPA and uPAR expression were significantly decreased in these tumors. In a ddition, uPA and uPAR knockout KPC2 cells (uPAKO and uPARKO) also had diminished tumor growth in vivo. Thus, we hypothesized that PAR -1 promotes PDAC tumor growth through upregulating uPA and uPAR. To test this hypothesis, PAR -1 knockout KPC2 cells (Par -1KO), uPAKO, and uPARKO cells were transfected with a Tet -inducible construct of the respective uPA or uPAR transgene to generate stable transfected Each transgene was successfully induced in each cell line upon doxycycline treatment in vitro. In allograft studies to test tumor growth, induction of either uPA, uPAR, or both in PAR -1KO cells failed to rescue tumor growth properties. In addition, restoration of either uPA or uPAR in both the uPAKO and uPARKO cells did not rescue tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic allograft models. Further analysis of expression patterns in these inducible cell lines revealed a 60 -fold increase in induced uPA and uPAR expressi on levels when compared to the treatment control or parental cell lines. In summary, restoration of uPA and uPAR expression upon doxycycline treatment was achieved in the respective cell lines. However, they were unable to rescue tumor growth properties of Par-1KO, uPAKO, and uPARKO cells in vivo, possibly owing to the very high levels of expression obtained in our inducible cell lines.

These antibiotics may have unintended consequences for the aquatic organisms that live in these water bodies. We investigated the effect of antibio tic exposure on disease dynamics using a freshwater zooplankton Daphnia dentifera and its fungal parasite Metschnikowia bicuspidata. In a series of experiments, antibiotics were first introduced to either the host or the parasite, followed by exposure of D. dentifera to M. bicuspidata. We hypothesized that the antibiotics would either allow the host's immune system to allocate its resources to combat M. bicuspidata infection, which would reduce rates of infection, or interfere with D. dentifera metabolism , which would increase rates of infection. Host exposure and parasite exposure to antibiotics were analyzed separately to better identify where antibiotics affect this system. Tetracycline significantly reduced infection prevalence when hosts were expose d (p < 0.05) but not when the parasite was exposed (p = 0.22) suggesting that the presence of tetracycline may affect the host rather than the parasite. This interaction prompted a subsequent large -scale population experiment aimed to observe the overall effect of both M. bicuspidata and tetracycline on D. dentifera populations. The presence of tetracycline significantly reduced population levels (p < 0.001) and infection density (p < 0.001) but increased infection prevalence (p = 0.005). Therefore, tetr acycline reduced infection prevalence individually but increased infection prevalence when we studied the whole population. The reduction in infection prevalence in the population -level experiment may have been caused by tetracycline -induced changes in dem ography; populations exposed to tetracycline had lower fecundity, which resulted in older populations that are more likely to exhibit high infection prevalence. This change in interaction shows how the introduction of antibiotics into naturally water syst ems via increased usage could impact aquatic organisms on a community scale over time.

This strategy is used by some bacterial toxins to destabilize immune cells and evade the host's immune response. Fic proteins are evolutionarily conserved, with most bacteria encoding a single protein. Helicobacter Pylori , the Gram -negative bacteria associated with gastric ulcers and cancer in humans, encodes up to five fic proteins. We cloned and purified two of these fic proteins from the Puno120 strain of Helicobacter and confirmed them to be enzymatically active proteins. We next asked if these tw o proteins could be involved in Helicobacter pathogenesis. Pathogenic strains of the bacteria utilize a dedicated Type IV toxin secretion system that is encoded by the Cag pathogenicity island. Helicobacter translocates virulence factors into host cells us ing the Cag apparatus. Using colorimetric assays, we are assessing whether the two fic proteins are translocated via the Type IV secretion system.

Current versions of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) impose write barriers on a running program in order to perform automatic garbage collection, to make sure that the running program does not i nterfere with marking up the heap. Not only does this slow down a program's execution time while the garbage collector is running, it also creates a \"tax\" during normal program runtime, via numerous checks to see if a write -barrier currently needs to be en forced. The goal of this research is to develop and implement algorithms of garbage collection that reduce this overhead, via copy -on-write methods. To accomplish this, snapshot -at-beginning approaches using virtual memory techniques will allow a program t o continue executing while the snapshot is scanned for unused memory. This will allow the marking phase of garbage collection to run concurrently with an executing program, significantly reducing the overhead imposed with traditional write -barrier methods. This copy -on-write method is applied to the Java Virtual Machine, and analyzed with benchmarks such as DaCapo and SPECjvm.

Virulence effector proteins transferred into the plant cell help the T -DNA traffick through the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Plants may recognize a bacterial pathogen, such as Agrobacterium, as a threat and trigger defense r esponses. Ensifer adhaerens, a soil bacterium, can also genetically transform plants when harboring a plasmid containing virulence genes and T -DNA. In nature, Ensifer is non -pathogenic to plants, and therefore, may not be perceived as a threat. We separat ely introduced the plasmid pCAMBIA 5105, which contains virulence genes and T -DNA with a plant -expressible GUS reporter and a hygromycin -resistance gene, into A. tumefaciens and E. adhaerens. These strains were then used to infect Arabidopsis roots. RNA se quencing data indicate that Ensifer induces expression of defense genes to a lesser extent than does Agrobacterium. Therefore, we compared the ability of Agrobacterium and Ensifer to transform different Arabidopsis defense mutants, including plants lacking either the PAMP receptor or the Botrytis -induced kinase 1 (BIK1) protein. EFR1 appears to defend plants against Agrobacterium - but not Ensifer -mediated transformation. However, several other proteins important for defending against Agrobacterium -medi ated transformation, including BIK1 and the flagellin receptor FLS2, appear to have similar functions in Ensifer -mediated transformation. In addition to testing the role that defense proteins play in Ensifer -mediated transformation, we also investigated wh ether plant proteins known to assist in Agrobacterium -mediated transformation also assist in Ensifer -mediated transformation. Current results indicate that Ensifer does not transform plants as well as Agrobacterium, but tends to follow the same transformat ion efficiency pattern with different Arabidopsis ecotypes. A better understanding of how plant proteins potentiate Agrobacterium and Ensifer -mediated transformation could lead to the development of Ensifer as a tool for plant genetic engineering.

Specifically, students measure the enthalpy of dissolution and qualitatively and quantitatively determi ne the effect of temperature on solubility. Students produce supersaturated solutions of sodium acetate as well as create a solubility graph for potassium chloride in water. Additionally, students will able to determine the heat of solution of potassium ch loride. In our work, we obtain an enthalpy value of 15.59 kJ/mol, which is within 9.5% of previously reported literature values. Our potassium chloride temperature -dependent solubility curves are also similar to solubility graphs previously reported.

This extends into linguistics with a subcorpora selection problem which attempts to balance the representation of all genres and years within a selection. This project proposes a Genetic Algorithm to find a valid representative sample in minimal time. The algorithm involves minimizing a fitness function which evaluates differences in a selection's representation from each year and genre in the sample and how different the total number of words in each genre is from a predetermined word count goal. This minimization is done with \"breeding\" and \"mutation\" of binary vectors. The vector's length is equal to the total number of texts from which to choose. Each entry (gene) in the vector represents if a text was i ncluded in the selection. Breeding occurs between the top 33% fittest individuals and a another randomly chosen individual. Genes of both individuals are spliced together at a randomly chosen splice point to create a new individual. This new individual the n goes through mutation. With a given probability that a gene will mutate, mutation attempts to only flip genes that will allow the individual to trend closer to the word count goal for each genre. This allows for the algorithm to quickly reach the word count goal and then focus on minimizing differences in representation as described in the fitness function. After mutation, the new generation breeds again until a certain number of generations have existed.This algorithm was able to outperform 85% of handpi cked samples from each decade between the 1820s to the 2000s with only 64 individuals 1000 generations and 95% of handpicked samples with only 64 individuals and 2000 generations. This algorithm allows researchers to validate their handpicked selections an d quickly generate new selections. This algorithm could be used to find disjoint selections that have similar fitness within a set of years. This could be useful in linguistic studies to find multiple samples to use in confirming theories.

It is proposed that changes to this rate -limiting step could increase or decrease the rate of photosynthesi s in cyanobacteria. B\u00ac\u00ac6f is responsible for mediating electron transfer between two proteins, photosystem II and photosystem I. The rate limitation in b\u00ac6f arises from a molecule, called plastoquinone, giving up its electrons to a part of b6f called the iron-sulfur cluster, which is buried in the protein. To reach the iron -sulfur cluster, plastoquinone enters through a narrow entry/exit portal. This portal is partially defined a structure called the f helix. The f helix is created from amino acids of the protein twisting on themselves. The amino acid proline has an unusual structure that causes the f helix to bend, resulting in the existence of the portal. Previous research from our lab has changed the two prolines to different amino acids through mu tagenesis. These changes have resulted in a smaller portal size, slower donation of electrons to b6f, and a slower rate of photosynthesis. Through the same process, I am currently developing two subtypes of cyanobacteria. One subtype has one additional proline, and the other has two extra prolines. The added prolines should cause the entry/exit portal to be larger, leading to a faster rate of electron donation to b6f, and a faster rate of photosynthesis. If successful, this same technique could be appl ied to crops, shortening the growth time.

Unfortunately, protein production and purification are often not robust enough for medical applications. However, recent advancements have shown the ability to purify ELPs by organic solvent extraction from E. coli using mixtures of short chain alcohols. This method is advantageous due to its ability to shorten processing time of purification to under an hour while maintaining high concentrations of ELP with little to no macromolecular contamination. Though this allows for a more efficient procurement of pure protein, i t exhibits a bottleneck in residual organic solvent. The protein expression of this ELP fusion was optimized through exposure to varying concentrations of Isopropyl - D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), induction/growth times, and temperatures. Once ample EL P fusion protein had been produced, a variety of approaches to eliminate excess organic compounds were taken through the incorporation of additional organic solvents, chromatography, and dialysis in order to increase purity and yield of ELP fusion proteins . Data was collected through SDS PAGE, BCA assay, UV -Vis, and visual analysis for protein aggregation.

These sensory vehicles detect substrate and chemical cues and transduce them towards the dynamic cytoskeleton that drives their motility. Axonal elongation has been previously shown to require both microtubule assembly and dynein -mediated microtubule translocation; however, the relative contributions of these processes to axonal elongation are not fully understood. To address this, we investigated the relationship between microtubule assembly, microtubule movement, dynein activity, and axonal elongation in Aplysia neurites using phase contrast, differential interference contrast and fluorescent speckle microscopy as well as immunolocalization. We found that pharmacologically inhibiting either microtubule assembly or dynein activity resulted in reduced neurite growth and microtubule translocation. Simultaneously suppressing both processes produced similar results, but to a lesser degree. Our results indicate microtubule assembly is necessary for dynein -mediated microtubule translocation and neurite elongation.

Cord characteristics, placenta shape, vein structure, external film, and occurrence of lesions and discolorations have each been linked to abnormal fetal/infant develo pment (Ismail et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2006; Stanek, 2013; Yampolsky et al., 2008). Given the crucial role of gross placenta morphology (GPM) for development, the present study hypothesized that GPM would be correlated with child health outcomes at 6 -months of age. Data are from a longitudinal pilot study of prenatal maternal experiences. N=17 pregnant women (87% White; 74% Married) completed the study (including prenatal questionnaires on demographics, health, and prenatal stress measures, placenta col lection at birth, and a 6 -month post -partum questionnaire). Placentas were collected, photographed, and coded for GPM. The post -partum questionnaire assessed parents' perception infant's general health, medical conditions (e.g., eczema), stomach/gastrointe stinal issues, food allergies, and infant prescription usage. Given that this is a pilot sample, practical significance was assessed using estimates of effect size (Cohen's d/Cramer's v). GPM was linked to child health outcomes as indicated by medium -to-large effect sizes. Chi -square tests indicated that when placental lesions were present, infants were more likely to have experienced special medication conditions and increased stomach and gastrointestinal issues, 2's(1)=4.96,v=.54. Independent t - tests ind icated infants with flatter cords, t(15)=1.63,p<.001,d=.88, thinner cords, t(15)= -1.83,p<.001,d=.88 and larger cord bases, t(15)=1.24,p=.03,d=.57, had poorer parent -reported general health. These findings provide preliminary evidence that variation in GPM may be an important predictor of infant health.

We have identified that the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), a chromatin organizer, interacts with transcriptional coactivator, lens epithelium derived growth factor (LE DGF) and remodeling and spacing factor (RSF -1) protein that under OS is overexpressed and is associated with H3K9me2, a known suppressor of LEDGF. Our central hypothesis is that NuMA -LEDGF -RSF1 interaction controls cancer progression under stress by influe ncing transcriptional regulation. We use the HMT -3522 model of triple negative breast cancer progression that in 3D cell culture mimics the phenotypically ductal carcinoma in -situ (S2 cells) and invasive ductal carcinoma (T4 -2 cells). Acute OS has been ind uced with exposure to 250 M H2O2 for four hours. NuMA, LEDGF and RSF -1 show lower expression in T4 -2 cells compared to S2 cells. However, prolonged exposure to ROS (25 M H202 for four weeks) results in a loss of NuMA and LEDGF and increased RSF1 expressi on in S2 cells, hence mimicking the changes observed in vivo. In addition, size of the nucleus increases in NuMA silenced S2 cells but not in those silenced for LEDGF under OS. These results highlight the need to investigate the role of NuMA and LEDGF in response to oxidative stress in cancer progression. To further understand the role of NuMA under chronic OS in influencing cancer cell phenotype, we will explore NuMA silencing using CRISPR in S2 cells.

However, recent studies have revealed that ROS should be regarded as second messengers in numerous signaling pathways in health and disease. ROS have been linked to neurogenesis, polarization, and maturation of neurons. Yet, th is needs to be distinguished from oxidative stress, which can compromise homeostasis. Therefore, the source, timing, localization, and targets of ROS are important when evaluating its effects on neural physiology. Specifically, I would like to determine whether there is an optimal level of ROS in the growth cone with respect to neurite outgrowth. A better understanding of ROS and their physiological roles will allow for improvement of antioxidant treatments of neurodegenerative diseases and injuries in the nervous system.

The resident immune cells in the brain called microglia become activated and produce inflammatory factors such as nitric oxide (NO) leading to neuroinflammation. Due to its chronic activation, microglia fail to clear the toxic Aplaque s and the dying neurons from the brain. Therefore, reducing the NO production by microglia along with preventing neurotoxicity is essential for formulating a treatment for AD. All previous attempts to formulate a treatment for AD have failed in clinic al trials because they focus on targeting a single protein which can have unintended effects on other cells. Thus, we hypothesize that a multi - targeted approach (targeting more than one functional pathway) may prove to be a better method. To test our hypot hesis, we utilize an in vitro model of BV2 cells - a mouse microglial cell line - and HT -22 cells - a mouse neuronal cell line - for the desired phenotypes of decreased microglial NO production and reduced neurotoxicity. The ability of various compoun ds to reduce microglial NO production is evaluated using a Griess assay at different concentrations, and the toxicity of the \"positive\" leads from this assay is tested on HT -22 cells using an MTT assay. Compounds that reduce NO that are also neuroprotectiv e will be taken for further in vitro and in vivo analysis. Our data suggests that utilizing approved drugs for multi -targeted drug discovery shows promise for AD.

Furthermore, there is currently no licensed vaccine available in the US and dengue hemorrhagic fever can occur upon second infection with a different serotype of the virus. DENV is a type of fl avivirus, a family of viruses that have a positive -sense RNA genome which encodes for a single viral polyprotein composed of three structural proteins and seven nonstructural proteins. Of these ten proteins, nonstructural protein one (NS1) has significant roles in viral pathogenesis and host immune evasion. NS1 exists as a membrane - associated dimer and a secreted hexamer. The dimer contains a hydrophobic and hydrophilic face which promotes association with membranes during replication and interaction with t he host innate immune system when secreted, respectively. While NS1 has a known function in viral replication, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that NS1 uses to accomplish this task. NS1 from Zika virus (ZIKV), another flavivirus, has high se quence identity and structural similarity with DENV NS1. Using this information, chimeras of DENV and ZIKV NS1 were designed and generated as a way to probe NS1's role in viral replication. Results from assays using the NS1 clones will reveal novel informa tion on NS1's function in the flavivirus lifecycle. Research Mentor : Richard J. Kuhn, Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science ; Poster Number: 216a :: Physical Sciences College of Science Determination of Nitrate, Sulfa te, and Chloride Concentration in the Mojave Desert, California and Rio Seco, Peru. Author: Silvana Villela Abstract: Particles suspended in the atmosphere, also known as aerosols, can be emitted through a variety of natural outputs (sea spray, \"mineral dust\"). However, there is growing concern from the scientific community with regards to excessive aerosol concentrations, particularly due to anthropogenic activity (fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, irrigation and more). An excess in aerosols, especi ally in urban environments, pose a threat to human health and have serious environmental impacts. This study investigates the concentration of certain aerosols in the sites of Mojave, California and Rio Seco, Peru. California and Peru are similar in that b oth are located in desert environments. The samples from California and Peru were collected by placing an air filter outside, allowing it to filter out the total suspended particles in the air over the course of 24 hours. These filters were then diluted in deionised water and analyzed for anion and cation concentration via ion chromatography (IC). The results of the study showed the that the minimum sulfate concentration was 3.4m3 in Mojave and 2.6m3 in Rio Seco, while the maximum sulfate concentration w as 2.59m3 in Mojave and 9.7m3 in Rio Seco. Additionally, the minimum nitrate concentration was 0.2m3 in Mojave and 0.5m3 in Rio Seco, while the maximum nitrate concentration was 1.78m3 in Mojave and 6.3m3 in Rio Seco. Finally, the minimum chloride co ncentration was found to be 0.04m3 in Mojave and 0.6m3 in Rio Seco, while the maximum nitrate concentration was 0.47m3 in Mojave and 3.5m3 in Rio Seco. Rio Seco in Peru, although similar to the Mojave Desert, contains a larger concentration of sulfate, nitrate and chloride aerosols. This may be attributed to Rio Seco being used for more industrial purposes, with little government regulation, while Mojave is more characteristic of an undisturbed desert characteristics and has nonindustrial activity.

Poster Number: 217a :: Physical Sciences College of Science Effects of Evaporation on Rain Water Isotope Composition Author: Brianna Westerberg Abstract: Isotopes are very useful in understanding hydrologic processes. When water evaporates, the lighter isotopes will evaporate more quickly than their heavier count erparts. When collecting water samples in an open environment, we want to make sure that what we are sampling is what fell. The purpose of this study was to test two techniques to limit evaporation and observe the isotope composition of water before and af ter evaporation, and how the weights of the isotopes effect the water composition before after a test period. Various methods were used to test how evaporation can be slowed. Nine collectors were filled with various volumes of deionized water and left in a n open area. Three were left open to the air, three were covered with a ping pong ball, and three had a thin layer of mineral oil. The initial samples were collected as well as the masses, then analyzed for isotope composition. The collectors were then lef t for almost a month to evaporate. The final samples were weighed and taken to analyze the isotope composition. The open collectors (control) had the greatest evaporation rates, followed by the ping pong balls, then the mineral oil. The data showed that after evaporation, the heavier isotope of 18O were more abundant than the lighter isotope of 17O. The data suggested a collector could be left open for 1 month if oil is used to limit evaporation and the isotopes would not be affected. These collectors can b e used to collect fog on or near coastlines and will be deployed in Arequipa Peru for an upcoming project. The mineral oil layer had the best results in hindering evaporation and halting the change in the isotope composition of the water.

The power of the Supreme Court does not become illuminated as clearly as when decades of precedents are wiped away with a single case. In 1976, Abood v. De troit Board of Education was decided by the highest court in the United States. The decision built upon three other Supreme Court cases. This decision allowed public sector unions to collect dues from all public employees, even if they were not union membe rs to avoid the economic problem known as \"free riders\". \"Free riding\" is the idea that people who are not contributing to the cause are still benefiting from the hard work of others. By allowing public sector unions to collect from non -union members, this problem was avoided. However, in 2018, the case Janus v. American Federation reversed the Abood decision from 1976. The composition of the court along with other factors led to the reversal of an earlier decision. Using this rare occurrence, the function of the Supreme Court can be analyzed to determine the evolving nature of a branch of our federal government that generally gets little attention from the public. The economic impact of a dramatic change in policy can be seen by analyzing these two cases and the effect they have on both members and non-members of public sector unions.

This study followed five hospitals through bankruptcy proceedings and utilized legal research developed through proceedings within the U.S. The proceeding of bankruptcy in itself requires a corporation, whether non-profit or for profit, to shift focus from shareholders, owners, or customers to the creditor. In healthcare, transitioning the focal point means shifting away from patient care. As healthcare corporations file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, attracting a buyer becom es challenging due to the affiliation with historical liabilities related to Medicare and Medicaid licensing. Healthcare being considered a public commodity with influences in both the private, public, and governmental sector, create a unique set of obsta cles. These hospitals and historical legal precedence show that Medicaid and Medicare do not allow healthcare corporations to use bankruptcy proceedings as a way to restructure. Bankruptcy declarations in the last year have increased in hospitals, predomi nately in rural areas. The analysis showed that the way that bankruptcies are carried out now, hospitals have a low chance of being acquired or paying off liabilities. The structure is misunderstood and has led to patient care neglect in many cases. Resea rch suggests that there are steps before declaring bankruptcy, from a financial perspective, that could help alleviate the uptrend in closures. A different structure to bankruptcy proceedings, with focus on packaging liabilities, the maintenance of strong governmental connections, Medicare and Medicaid status, could enable corporations and hospitals to sustain viability for repurchase. Fundamentally, healthcare's inability to adapt quickly to payment plans and policy changes poses financial risk that cannot be mitigated without substantial economic analysis for each potential change in policy. Research Mentor : Cara Putman, Business Law, Krannert School of Management ; Poster Number: 220a :: Innovative Technology/Entrepreneurship/Design Krannert School of Management Aligning Student Design Projects to Government Design Challenges through Collaboration with the Virtual Student Federal Service Program Author: JJ Jeongjin Park Abstract: The capstone projects that are currently implemented typically lack the crucial link between the theoretical book topics and the real -world. Also, there are limited opportunities for the undergraduate students to get involved in service learning or civic engagement in the STEM classroom. Therefore, this res earch project aims to test out a new approach to class projects through collaboration with the Virtual Student Federal Service Program. The study will be implemented by using two methods: intervention and participatory action research. The first method, i ntervention, involves undergraduate researchers actually participating in the VSFS program as interns in order to pilot the program to determine the feasibility of incorporating VSFS into a classroom environment. The second method deals with data collectio n through the use of participatory action research, specifically, photovoice. By using 8 photos collected from each undergraduate researcher, our research team will analyze the gathered data into three perspectives: benefit, challenges, and recommendations for effectively incorporating VSFS service learning projects in the STEM classroom. Although the virtual barrier, including limited face -to-face communication between VSFS participant and the agency is expected, it is also anticipated that there will be a benefit to learning to communicate in alternative ways. Student participants will be motivated in their both academic career and future career preparation, and the agency such as U.S. Agency for International Development, will experience work efficiency f rom the help from valuable student workforce, at a low cost. Overall, this study will clarify the both benefit and barrier to the students, university and industry in utilizing service learning project and will observe the causation relationship between th e service learning project and the generating of T -shaped future engineers and scientists. Research Mentor : Prof. Lisa Bosman, Polytech, technology and innovation center ; Poster Number: 221a :: Mathematical/Computational Sciences Krannert School of Management Applying Business Analytics to Improve Competitive League of Legends (LoL) Decision -Making Author: Aaron Rush Abstract: In this study, we developed a model to assist competitive League of Legends (LoL) eSports players in their pre-game decision making process, particularly in how to select in -game characters, colloquially known as \"champions\", based on certain game -winning factors. We complemented this decision model with a predicative model to accurately forecast match results based on known game factors (i.e. champion selection and historical data). The motivation for this study is that applications of analytics to support decision -making in eSports is sparse. Specifically, there has been little research to date in academic jo urnals. We found no LoL studies that investigated competitive play decision -making and game outcomes regarding pre -game decisions. Today, eSports is a massive industry that is estimated to generate $1.1 billion in 2019. Moreover, the 2018 LoL World Champio nships saw nearly 100 million unique viewers, with 44 million of them concurrent. Growing in popularity by the day, eSports, especially high stakes events with high prize pools, are proving to be a consistent cultural phenomenon, that could use analytics t o improve outcomes. In our study, we interviewed a multitude of highly ranked LoL players and had them assist us in creating mapping hypotheses of an individual profile for each champion in a game for five distinct core competencies (Engage, Catch, Poke, S plit, Protect). Subsequently we collected competitive match data over a period of roughly 1.5 years with Sportradar's API to determine which types of strategies perform best against others. In conclusion, we found that teams that have equal or superior pre -game team compositions have a 56.5% win -rate (given that League is an 50/50 game ideally). This equates to a 6.5% advantage to a team with an equal or better overall rating before a round even begins. Research Mentor : Matthew A.

Assessing different levels of expertise in experimentation is a difficult task since th ese are not usually visible as part of a student's final design solution. The purpose of this research is to investigate and characterize students' experimentation strategies while working on a design challenge. This paper explores the various aspects of e ngineering design behaviors in middle school students. Questionnaires, observations, CAD software logs and focus group methodology are employed for qualitative and quantitative data collection. R scripts models are used to visualize and characterize patter ns within educational data and validate them using statistical techniques. This study reveals interesting aspects of design thinking processes in students, provides recommendations and opens the discussion to engineering educators and researchers who are i nterested in understanding and assessing students' experimentation strategies in engineering design.

Although there has been a recent uptick in the need to integrate the humanities into the STEM classroom, service learning and/or civic engagement focused projects are l imited. This research is to investigate methods for incorporating authentic learning experiences into the post -secondary STEM classroom guided by the follow research question: How can we increase access to authentic learning in the higher education classro om? To answer the question, the pilot study will engage six undergraduate students of varying age, major, and genders in a two -phase approach. First, the students will participate in a group -like virtual internship offered by the U.S. government sponsored Virtual Student Federal Service (VSFS). Traditionally, these types of internships go to individuals rather than teams. The research will focus on team functions as well as project deadlines. The second phase is to use Participatory Action Research (PAR) an d Photovoice to evaluate this new approach to VSFS internships. Qualitative data such as photos, narratives, and transcripts will be analyzed using the NVivo software. The team will investigate the data and identify themes related to what went well, what d id not go well, what could be improved, and what lessons were learned. New knowledge from this research will be captured by usage of Photovoice and the team's insights from the experience. If VSFS works well as a team project, it could provide another opti on for the higher education classroom. Other programs such as service learning student organizations, industry -sponsored capstone projects, and co -ops all have implications that VSFS does not. The results have the potential to transform higher education, p roducing graduates more prepared to enter the workforce, improving educational institution's completion and placement rates, and increasing return for parents who help finance their children's tuition.

There is a wide range of symptoms that can manifest from lupus. This causes difficult y, as that range can often lead to misdiagnosis by making lupus look like another disease. To assist with improving this problem, we are conducting a systematic literature review with the goal of investigating innovative data visualization techniques that use symptom cluster data. Our current research shows significant research in the area of cancer symptom cluster management using basic visualization techniques, like bar charts, tables and scatter plots, but minimal to no published works in the area of lup us symptom cluster management. Results from the systematic review will inform the use of data visualization and visual analytics techniques in the analysis of symptom clusters. Our results will provide insight into the different kinds of data visualizatio n techniques currently used in symptom cluster management and the lack of innovative visualization techniques that could assist in the decision -making process for disease diagnosis and treatment.

In order to enhance students' ability to thrive in this collaborative environment, new pedagogies are needed to foster collaborative and transdisciplinary skills. In this submission, we explore how students take an active role in building their own educational experiences in one emerging, transdisciplinary context: User Experience (UX) Design. UX Design exists as a trans -discipline, drawing from multiple disciplinary roots, such as psychology, cognitive science, anthropology, and industrial engin eering, but reassembling these perspectives as an integrated whole. We deeply engaged with students in a novel undergraduate UX Design program to describe how students learn to construct their own integrative and discipline -specific competency in relation to leadership, analyzing their development as designers as they interact in physical and virtual learning environments. Using a bottom -up thematic analysis approach, we conducted a series of paired interviews with six UX Design students of varied backgroun ds, cohorts, and perceived competency. Through our analysis, we have found varying patterns of students' engagement in their own learning, which impacts their description of their developing design identity and their ability to cope with transdisciplinary complexity. We identify opportunities for supporting design leadership competency through approaches such as self -disclosure, design advocacy, and tracking students' expertise vs. their evolving identity.

However, little work has addressed ethical considerations as they emerge in everyday conversations about ethics outside of academia, within venues such as social media. We describe onli ne conversations about a concept known as \"asshole design\" on Reddit, and the relationship of this concept to another practitioner -focused concept known as \"dark patterns.\" In order to precisely define ethical concerns in this online space, we analyzed 100 2 posts from the subreddit '/r/assholedesign' to identify the types of artifact being shared and the interaction purposes that were perceived to be manipulative or unethical as a type of \"asshole design.\" Each artifact and its associated post information were coded to confirm whether it was an example of \"asshole design'' by the subreddit's definition, as well as being coded for the type of modality present. We identified a subset of these posts relating to dark patterns, and quantified their occurrence usi ng an existing dark patterns typology, including: nagging, obstruction, sneaking, interface interference, and forced action. We found substantial evidence of conversation about ethical concerns, indicating some level of interest in discussing ethical phen omena and complexity using real - world artifacts. These results indicate opportunities to expand the study of dark patterns beyond digital interfaces to investigate ethical concern in relation to physical artifacts.

Research Mentor : Research Sciences/Humanities Polytechnic Institute Qualitative, Quantitative, and Biometrics: Data Triangulation in Social Sciences Author: Andres Santiago Abstract: The business world is continuously changing due to technology and globalization. Because of these changes there is a strong need for companies to train employees to be ready for cross -cultural communication. Virtual Reality (VR) may be one of these tools companies can use to help train employees, however, there is not a lot of data about how VR c an effect cross - cultural communication. For this lab we ran randomly assigned participants into two conditions, which was either the control or VR condition. For the control condition participants just watched a video then answered a survey afterwards. Fo r the VR condition participants were run through simulations in which they were transported to another country to close a business deal for their company. In the VR condition participants would answer scenario questions during the simulation which were recorded. Then they would be asked to complete a survey to record their experience. Finally, participants where attached with shimmers that helped to read their biometrics during the simulations. These biometrics help us to see someone's arousal levels. The r ecorded questions is our quantitative data, the survey participants completed is our qualitative data, finally the shimmers gives us our biometric data. Using quantitative, qualitative, and biometrics we can triangulate the data. This gives us a good idea of how immersive VR is in comparison with video. For the most part, participants seemed to be more engrossed in VR reality then in the control condition.

An increasing number of Americans self -generate photovoltaic (PV) power and sell excess power back to utilities through a p rocess called net metering. Considering weather fluctuates daily, utilities cannot accurately predict incoming supply and demand of PV - generated power. As a result, they will over and under -purchase power, which costs them money and ultimately, the expense is passed onto the American public. To efficiently incorporate PV power into the grid, the challenges of local short -term weather and solar irradiance forecasting must be addressed. By reviewing existing literature and proposing a new approach, we will an swer the question of how to better predict PV generation and its impacts on the grid. In this research we look at the current approaches to weather prediction, including how weather station parameters impact PV energy production. Also, the challenges of w eather forecasting such as random weather parameters and accuracy of shorter time scale prediction are addressed. After reviewing existing approaches, this research demonstrates the potential for estimating individual PV system generation with weather stat ions and grid supply and demand. Weather data from local stations, long term weather data, and energy production data is used to forecast and assess short term future solar energy production. This will benefit both utility companies to balance load supply and demand as well as PV system owners to assure the effectiveness of their system. The lasting impact will be a more stable grid and lower, less volatile energy prices for the public.

Skilled workers in today's workforce are finding themselves in situations and work environments where their social norms are not shared by others because of a different cultural upbringing. While these relationships harbor untapped potential for innovation and success, many workers find it hard to communicate and engage in teamwork with those from different soc ial backgrounds. The lack of effective teamwork hinders productivity of global business world. Cultural competency, or more specifically intercultural competency, may help organizations address such challenges. Intercultural competence is the ability to co mmunicate effectively and appropriately in intercultural situations based on one's intercultural knowledge, skills, and attitudes (Deardorff, 2004). In the Purdue HRD Virtual Lab, I am part of an ongoing research supervised by Dr. Mesut Akdere, an associ ate professor of Human Resource Development, studying the development of intercultural knowledge and competence through simulated virtual reality (VR) training environment. VR -based training simulations are developed with advanced 360 -degree cameras and a special computer software to develop the simulations in specific format. Through simulated VR training, employees interact in strategically planned business and organizational scenarios where they learn about other cultures, engage in conflict resolution, and handle cultural differences throughout the simulations taking place in another country and cultural background. Intercultural competence allows employees from different backgrounds to come together to effectively engage in teamwork, regardless of their cultural, ethnic, or racial backgrounds. Businesses across the worldwide are in dire need to help their employees develop such skills sets in a cost -effective way (Akdere & Acheson -Clair, 2018); and, we believe that VR technology may provide a solution to address this gap through providing an immersive, safe, and scalable learning environment. This presentation will explore intercultural knowledge and competence development through VR learning environment and discusses its effectiveness for simulated training.

Professor Piller has been working with a company in Indiana that is looking to identify quality of dimensions of a part that is produced. Initially they look to identify rough geometry with width and height. The pr oduct has an embossed design that simulates grain in wood that would be interesting to confirm the quality. These two points will be the focus on how to identify the resolution required. Other significant quality features will be inspected such as a \"W\" formation of the part that can be created with inappropriate tooling. Three dimensional scanning is not new. Companies such as Cognex have cameras and scanners available to industry right now. The effort here is to create a low cost scanner that medium manufacturers can use and one of low power so that it can be used in the field on parts that have been in use. This way a technician can scan a part and add to the total life cycle of that specific part. The final outcome, and the portion of research Vi nce Tyson has worked on over the past two semesters, of this project is to develop create a surface map of that object that can be compared to a virtual model. Physical deliverables will be a prototype of the device as described in this application. Indu stry has a vast amount of data that is contained in machines on the factory floor. Quality scans of product can be used to create a live model of each piece as it is made. Scanning equipment is available, one system that has been identified is $20,000. The design of this project is to leverage the lower cost of single board computers to minimize the scanning costs and increase the availability of this technology to medium sized manufactures. This supports the idea of bringing more intelligence to the wh ole enterprise.

However, reducing image artifacts that result in visual deviations and improving efficiency still need to be conquered in order t o provide a better view of cerebrovascular system to doctors. The method of machine learning, enabling a program to be trained with data and improving performance on certain tasks used for training, has been proved to be an effective tool in many medical i maging applications. For our study we use convolutional neural network (CNN) method of machine learning that is used to classify tissue types. The CNN architecture was constructed with multiples convolutions layers, as well as an input and an output layers . CT image voxels served as an input to the network. A convolutional layer then applied operation to the input and processed the result to next layer until reached the output layer. Thus the output layer produced a classification of the tiss ue type in diff erent regions. The trained algorithm can then be applied to generate a 3D model model of cerebral vasculature.

Lack of real -world work experience or civic engagement opportunities in school may be the trigger for the problem. The main purpose of this study is to help undergradu ate students prepare for work or graduate school with real -life experience by determining whether or not civic engagement activities benefit students and how to incorporate civic engagement projects in the undergraduate classrooms. The basic design of the study involves reviewing the previous relevant literatures and studies to be clear about the advantages of undergraduate students doing civic engagement projects as well as the possible methods to set up the civic participation projects in classrooms. Most of the studies showed the evidence that the college students who graduated with more experience in civic engagement activities adapt better and more easily to their careers because they are better informed about current events.

Poster Number: 1b :: Life Sciences College of Agriculture Identifying New Drosophila melanogaster Cdc7 Regulatory Subunits Author: Benjamin Anderson Cycle 7 (Cdc7) is a serine/threonine kinase required for the activation of minichromosomal maintenance complex 2 -7 (Mcm2 -7) helicase and therefore DNA replication. Cdc7 itself must be bound to Dumbbell -Former 4 (Dbf4) to function. Cdc7 and Dbf4 are well conserved across many eukaryotic species, such as humans, Xenopus, yeast, and Drosophila melanogaster. This study focuses on D. melanogaster Cdc7 and its Dbf4 like regulator Chiffon. Recent studies have suggested that Chiffon may not be the sole regulator of Cdc7 and that a second regulatory protein might exist, and we hope to iden tify them. Human Dbf4 was discovered because of similarities to yeast Dbf4, thus by identifying D. melanogaster Cdc7 regulators it is possible that new human Cdc7 regulators could be identified. Cancer is caused by improper cell cycling, so perhaps by iden tifying Cdc7 regulators new targets for cancer medicines could be found. To find the new subunits a Yeast 2 -Hybrid Mating Assay was performed, which identified two interactors, Tubulin Binding Cofactor B (TBCB) and Maf1. These proteins will be further ana lyzed for activity as Cdc7 regulators. Research Mentor : Dr. Vikki Weake, Department of Biochemistry, College of Agriculture ; Eliana Torres -Zelada, Department of Biochemistry, College of Agriculture Poster Number: 2b :: Life Sciences College of Abstract: This project centers around a global effort to discover and annotate the draft genomes of bacteriophage (phage), which are a family of viruses with bacterial hosts. This distinct feature of phages makes them a suitable alternative to antibiotics in tacklin g antibiotic resistance bacteria causing infectious diseases. Phages were isolated from soil samples in the wet lab, and their DNA amplified for genome sequencing. The second part of the project involved the comprehensive annotation of genome segments, s uch as Corazon genes 75 through 86 and portions of Krili and Smooch. All three phages belong to the Siphoviridae morphotype. Corazon was isolated through the process at Lafayette College [40.698 N, 75.2102 W], and its data sequencing was completed on Decem ber 15, 2017. Corazon belongs to the S cluster (lytic life cycle), and Krili and Smooch belong to the O cluster. DNA Master and PECAAN, genome annotation tools, were used to analyze the genomes. Starterator and Phamerator were also used to compare these ge nomes with published phages in the same bacteriophage cluster. Start sites were selected for each gene and functions were determined through databases such as NCBI, HHPred, Phamerator -Synteny, and PhagesDB, which compared the draft genes to functions of ex isting, published genes. By comparing to published genes, four functions were determined for Corazon draft genes 75 through 86: glycosyl transferase, o -methyltransferase, methyltransferase, and galactosyltransferase. This project contributes to the nation -wide SEA -PHAGES program that works to discover unique bacteriophages.

In addition, 15q11.2 deletion syndrome appears to present not only with variable expressivity but also variable penetrance. We present clinical findings in a group of 16 patients with 15q11.2 deletion syndrome confirmed by microarray analysis. T he group consisted of 10 male and 6 female patients between the ages of 3 and 15 years. The most common clinical findings included developmental delay (94%), hypotonia (88%), ADHD (75%), (25%), 2 -3 toe seizure activity (19%), and congenital heart disease (13%). Additional findings included prominence the metopic suture, epicanthal folds, micrognathia, ankle torsion, incontinence, and sleeping difficulties. Our de velopmental evaluation by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development indicated an average Mental Developmental Index of 75 (NL = >85) and Motor Developmental Index of 75 (NL = >85). Close to 43% of patients had an occipito -frontal circumference (OFC) greater than or equal to the 97th percentile which suggests relative macrocephaly as a prominent feature in this group of patients. About 86 % of the cases required medical intervention of their neurobehavioral difficulties, and all responded well to treatment sh owing improvement of their neurocognitive functioning as evidenced by school reports and resolution of symptoms. The data provided here intends to expand the phenotype of the 15q11.2 deletion syndrome and contribute to the recognition of affected patient needs of treatment. Research Mentor : Dr. Luis Escobar, Medical Genetics and Neurodevelopmental Center, Peyton Manning Children's Hospital ; Poster Number: 4b :: Life Sciences College of Agriculture Measuring the Effects of pH on Fungal Growth in the Presence of Lead Author: Janice Chan Abstract: According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, at least twenty percent of the total exposure to lead for an individual comes from drinking water. Consuming lead causes d amage to the nervous system in both adults and children, and can affect blood pressure and kidney function in adults. The amount of lead in water not only affects human health, but is also toxic to animals as well. Current methods of decreasing the amount of lead contamination in water consists of filtration methods that can be expensive when implemented in larger bodies of water. A cheaper method of decreasing lead in water is through using corn stover lignin and the fungus Pleurotus ostreatus . Corn stover lignin effectively removes lead from water through absorption and is degraded by the fungus, which leads to the decrease in lead contamination. However, the effect of pH on the growth of the fungus in the presence of heavy metals such as lead is unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the survival rate of P. ostreatus in varying concentrations of lead and pH. The expected results from this research will help determine whether or not the fungus can be used as a successful biological means of meta l recovery in water. The methods used in this research can serve as a stepping stone into decreasing other heavy metals in water.

Increasing aggregate stability improves the structure of the soil and thus plays a significant role in improving the capacity of soil to act as a living ecosystem that sustains plants, animals , and humans. One way to improve aggregation is by growing cover crops. Cover crops are planted between cash crop growing seasons in order to provide year round cover for the soil, thus incorporating some attributes of natural ecosystems. The experiment t ested the influence of cover crops on soil aggregation over a growing season. Cover crops were planted in fall of 2018 at the Purdue Agronomy Center for Research and Education in West Lafayette, IN. Three treatments were tested: no cover, 14 species cover crop mix, and oats. Each treatment had seven replicate plots in a randomized block design. Observations on cover crop growth were regularly taken to track cover crop emergence, growth, and death. Cover crop biomass samples were harvested periodically to quantify aboveground biomass growth. Aggregate stability was tested using wet sieving analysis to test soil resistance to erosive forces. Aggregation changes over time due to seasonal weather changes and as cover crops grow, exude carbon, die, and decay. Thu s, soil aggregate stability will also be measured before planting in the 2019 season to observe the influence of fall cover crop treatments on soil aggregate stability in the spring compared to the fall.

Despite many medical advances, there is still a need for a reliable, non -invasive technique to accurately assess the structural ramifications of a heart attack. This p roject aims to use 4D ultrasound imaging to analyze changes in myocardial function and monitor cardiac remodeling after a heart attack. Fifteen adult, male C57BL/6 mice were separated into three equal groups: sham, myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemia -reperfusion (IR). Heart attacks were induced by permanently ligating the left coronary artery (MI) or temporarily ligating the artery for thirty minutes (IR). Ultrasound images were collected using a Vevo2100 ultrasound system at baseline and on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, and 28 post -surgery. Green -Lagrange myocardial strain was calculated with a noise - insensitive strain mapping technique. Cardiac tissue was harvested and stained with Masson's Trichrome. Analysis showed unremarkable changes in cardiac geome try and function between sham and baseline results. Both MI and IR showed significant decreases in ejection fraction, myocardial strain and E/A wave ratios, as well as increased chamber volume and collagen content. The MI group displayed more severe remod eling and impaired function when compared to IR. This project identifies several key findings that can potentially be used for early prediction of heart failure following a heart attack. Myocardial strain analysis offers a noninvasive estimation of the hea rt's mechanical function and may be used to create early prognoses for coronary artery disease patients.

They are of particular interest as they interact with the member of the genus Mycobacterium which contains many bacteria associated with dangero us diseases such as tuberculosis and leprosy. Understanding phages are thus advantageous for developing potential treatments for diseases associated with Mycobacteria. Within the grouping of phage, there are many different clusters that represent a smaller grouping of similar phages. This project will specifically look at the S cluster phage Corazon and a recently created map of the functions, start sites and final calls made on various genes within the genome. Corazon was found in Easton, PA at Lafayette College, and was sequenced at the Pittsburgh Bacteriophage Institute. Corazon is a siphoviridae morphotype of the S cluster and currently doesn't belong to a subcluster. This paper will not explore the entire genome of Corazon, rather take a more detailed look at the center of the Corazon genome, genes 39 to 57 to be specific. The program DNA Master was used in order to annotate the different genes of Corazon. DNA Master displays and produces auto -annotation and recommended site suggestions. DNA Master con tains a program that allows us to see the open reading frames, the strength of a start site as well as a genome comparison for those in the same cluster or sub -cluster as Corazon.

The sciences are much easier to grasp when a hands on component is incorporated, but due to the high cost of science equipment, most homesc hool students do not have access to it. Through my project, I have introduced nearly 20 homeschool students to beginning plant science topics through a middle school outreach program. Through this program, the students have been exposed to modern equipment , such as microscopes, by participating in lab type procedures, experiments, as well as botany lessons. They will also have the availability to work within greenhouses with various plant materials that are available within the Purdue Botany Department. The experiences the students gain in this program will better prepare them for post -secondary education and encourage them to explore careers in STEM related fields. As time progresses, more and more STEM jobs are available that need knowledgeable individuals to fill them. This experience will hopefully allow the students to discover their interests within such areas of work. The actual research component of this project is a post program survey evaluating the students' interest and enjoyment of the program, t heir thoughts on how valuable or useful the program was, their effort within the program, and their career or study interests after participating in this program. The goal of this survey is to determine if this program was, in fact, beneficial to the parti cipants and if it affected their interest within the plant sciences. Ultimately, we will learn if the program had a positive impact and if it is worth continuing in the future. Research Mentor : John Cavaletto, Botany and Plant Patholo gy, College of Agriculture ; Poster Number: 8.5b :: Life Sciences College of Agriculture The Influence of Freeze -Thaw Cycles on Floodplain P Release Author: Qijue Chen Abstract: Freeze -Thaw Cycles (FTC) are one of the abiotic perturbations experienced by floodplain soils that affect the release of phosphorus (P). It is acknowledged that overwhelming dissolved P is responsible for eutrophication of aquatic systems which is a local and regional water quality problem found worldwide. Currently, there has been an increasing interest in understanding what factors affect phosphorus release and how. P is found to be highly susceptible to abiotic perturbations experienced by soil, and various environmental characteristics such as soil type and land practice will influence this susceptibility. Thus, this experiment determines the impact of soil characteristics and land use on P release following a FTC in the floodplain. Soil cores were taken from four sites, each with nine subsites in different locations, with var ious soil types and land practices alongside the Wabash River. Two treatments of flooded soil incubations were established, one after FTC and the other as a control. Variables such as soluble P (PO4), temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH were measured periodically over the course of 21 days. It is hypothesized that FTCs in floodplains will cause increases in P release that vary in magnitude with land use and soil type as the result of microorganism death and root/plant cell lysis. Research Mentor : Sara McMillan, Agricultural & Biological Engineering, Agriculture ; Poster Number: 9b :: Life Sciences College of Agriculture Directed Evolution of ASGARD, a Guide -Dependent Targeting Endonuclease Author: Kevin Fitzgerald Abstract: Genome editing tools are necessary for the efficient manipulation of desired traits to create new medicines, therapies, biofuels and agricultural products. Although the popular CRISPR systems have been used as tools for the mediation of guide -specific DNA cleava ge, the need for a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) near targeted domains continues to limit their modularity in various applications. A different endonuclease, ASGARD, has demonstrated the ability to mediate targeted DNA cleavage in bacteria but without t he need for a PAM site. ASGARD, however, displays high off -target activity that is potentially lethal to engineered cells. Thus, a library of mutants will need to be created and screened for more efficient activity. Here, I describe two screening methods to select for highly specific ASGARD mutants. The first method features a plasmid encoding the CcdB toxin which will kill the cell should ASGARD fail to cleave the parent plasmid. The second method features a competing endonuclease system using I -SceI to cleave the host genome and kill the cell. In both systems, efficient and on -target ASGARD activity will rescue the cells, directly linking cell survival to the generation of an improved ASGARD mutant. Surviving cells can be recovered and used in the next iteration of directed evolution until a mutant with the desired level of activity is acquired. This highly functional mutant can then serve to effectively edit genomes for various applications.

In most of time, a large amount of walnut shells are disposed as waste. Phenolic compounds are potentially good natural sources of antioxidants; in addition, they prevent diseases that are associated with obesity and cancers. Therefore, if the phenolic compounds can be extracted from walnut shells, those walnut shells are able to turn from waste int o treasure. Ultrasound -assisted extraction is the unique process to increase the extraction of phenolic compounds, because it able to shorter the time and increase the extraction efficiency. Response surface methodology was applied in this research for opt imizing ultrasound -assisted extraction of phenolic compounds from walnut shell. 2,2 -1-picrylhydrazyl (FRAP) assay were used to test the antioxidant activity of the phenol ic compounds, which for the determination of whether walnut shell is a good candidate for natural antioxidant material or not.

Mortality losses following birth largely contribute to profit reductions in commercial swine management. Experimental proced ures aimed to decrease piglet mortality by increasing chances of successful suckling and decreasing heat loss due to chilling have been performed to test this theory. By artificially drying the piglets with towels directly following parturition, body tempe ratures can be controlled and raised, and overall teat -seeking success of the offspring is expected. The objective of this study aimed to evaluate fluctuations in body temperature and overall time -to-nurse when comparing piglet groups per sow that were art ificially towel dried vs. not. Flank and ear (external) along with internal body temperatures at birth, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes were recorded for 102 piglets across 13 sows / gilts. Additionally, the amount of time between time birth to successful latch ing on the teat was measured. Generally, flank and internal temperatures were higher in the test piglets (dried) vs. control piglets (non -dried); ear temperatures were relatively unchanged. Further groupings of high -body -weight piglets and low -body -weight piglets on the dried vs. non -dried trials was needed, as larger piglets tend to reach the teat faster despite drying. Overall, time from birth to first nursing event was decreased in dried piglets; however, this data was not conclusive enough to insinuate that drying piglets was ultimately effective. It is important to note that this procedure is routinely practiced in large commercial swine farms despite the evidence gained through this study.

Boar semen, however, often becomes contaminated with bacteria during the collection process through environmental factors, resulting in the transmission of disease, piglet loss, and significant economic losses across the industry. Among bacteria regularly isolated from boar semen, Serratia is among the most problematic. As an opportunistic pathogen, Serratia contamination decreases semen motility, increases semen clumping, and decreases the shelf life of dosage s resulting in lower conception rates and the possibility of disease transmission. Confounding the issue, Serratia is also resistant to many of the antibiotics approved for use in semen extenders. Bacteriophage are viruses that target and lyse specific bac teria and we hypothesized that bacteriophages could be employed to reduce Serratia in stored boar semen. We isolated wild -type Serratia phages from wastewater samples and screened isolated phages for their ability to lyse different types of Serratia. We th en compared the bactericidal capacity of phages to a battery dilution assay. Our results sho wed several bacteriophages alone were effective in reducing Serratia growth in a dose -dependent manner where high concentrations prevented all visible bacterial growth. In some cases, co -treatment with bacteriophages and antibiotics together reduced the mi nimum inhibitory concentration of several antibiotics (e.g., 16 \u00b5g/mL to 2 \u00b5g/mL), producing an additive antibacterial effect. Taken together, the data demonstrate the potential for bacteriophages to be used as a biocontrol agent in stored boar semen with or without accompanying antibiotics; however, the potential impact of bacteriophages on semen itself, remains to be studied.

Houston, Danny Haelewaters, M. Catherine Aime Department of Botany and Plant Pathology, Purdue University, 915 W. State Street, West Lafayette IN 47907 Romaine lettuce is becoming increasingly known for its pathogenic outbreaks caused by E. coli bacteria that are causing numerous illnesses and deaths. Despite these outbreaks, very little is known about the naturally occurring microbiome on the phylloplane of Romaine lettuce and its interactions with human pathogens. This project investigates the fungal microbiome of Romaine lettuce. We purchased 63 Romaine lettuce plants from 16 different stores throughout Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Virginia. Homogenized samples were plated onto corn-meal agar and individual cultures were isolated using axenic techniques, in an attempt to isolate individual species and observe and describe them. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify specific regions of ribos omal DNA, more specifically the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) fungal barcode region and the large subunit (LSU). We were able to isolate 330 cultures in total, representing 63 species based on comparisons with public and in -house ITS sequence databases . Of the 330 cultures, 254 were ITS barcoded. The process of sequencing the LSU locus is just now being started. At least 9 of the 63 species are new to science, in the generate two protein -coding genes, cytochrome b (cytb) and translation elongation factor 1 -alpha (tef-1a). With select cultures of new speci es, physiological tests are being run to determine which environments and nutrients these species grow well in and what they need to survive. Some species will grow better in certain carbon and nitrogen sources than others. This will give us insight to und erstand and describe the new species, possibly attributing to future research. The combination of molecular phylogenetic analyses, physiological tests, and morphological characterizations, will allow us to generate a formal description for each new species .

However the yields obtained are not commercially viable. In order to improve the yields, we developed an auto -gene regulator system, which can prolong cellular health by decreasing the amounts of toxic intermediates accumulated during the production of valuable products. The regulator i s made up of elastin -like polypeptides (ELPs) attached to transcription factors. ELPs can sense the health of the cell and respond to changes in temperature and intracellular pH by aggregating. The goal of the project is to increase the yields of mevalonat e, which is a precursor to several drugs, using our regulator. As proof of concept, we show that E. coli transformed with the mevalonate pathway and our regulator system, produce higher yields when grown at 30C compared to 37C.

However, the current standard, CRISPR/Cas9, can only edit DNA adjacent to a sequence -specific motif. Prokaryotic Ar gonautes (pAgos) have been proposed as a more flexible gene -editing tool that does not require these motifs. One of the pAgo members developed in our lab, ASGARD, has been shown to cut DNA with programmable guides, allowing for gene -editing. Despite it's cutting capability, ASGARD's ability to be used as a precise editing tool is limited by its off -target activity. Here, we engineered ASGARD and evaluated its off -target activity with a cell -free system. Through protein structure comparison, we identified ca ndidates with potential reduced off -target activity and created mutants for subsequent evaluation with a cell -free system. Using a cell -free system eliminates complex interactions in a cell that confound the effects of off -target activity. We have develope d a system containing three circular pieces of DNA harboring genes for T7 RNA Polymerase (T7RNAP), ASGARD, and a green fluorescent protein (GFP), individually. T7RNAP induces ASGARD expression, which in turn reduces GFP expression if there is off-target ac tivity. By measuring the GFP output, these assays can be used to assess the off -target activity and select an ASGARD mutant with limited off -target activity for genome editing. Identifying mutants with reduced off-target activity may lead to more precise g ene-editing tools that can be used to extend the impact of genome engineering by editing any genetic region.

Its plaque was small, round and clear with siphoviridae morphology type. The approximate length of Corazon is 64931 bp with 3' sticky overhang. The overhang had 1 1 base length with 'GCGCGCAGCGC' sequence. To perform a manual inspection of Corazon, we performed gene annotation by reviewing and revising the prediction and identifying any missing genes using DNA Annotation programs such as DNA Master, GeneMark, BLAST, Phamerator, and HHPred. We annotated the Corazon genome in three distinct steps. First, we established a relationship with our phage, Corazon, and other phages to understand the overall genomic architectures. Second, we ran automated gene prediction prote ins and functional data on the predicted gene. Third, we reviewed the prediction and made necessary changes to delete or identify any missing genes. The group annotated the mycobacterium Corazon genes 33 -48. Based on the evidence supported by the programs, most of the Corazon genes from 33 to 48 were forward genes with functions such as terminase, portal protein, capsid maturation protease, scaffolding protein, head decorate protein, major capsid protein, portal protein, major tail protein, and tail assembl y chaperone. Tail assembly chaperones are only shown in frameshift genes, in this case, Gene 47. Gene 47 is a frameshift gene which a nucleotide reads more than once or omitted to have two genes in the same space. Since Gene 47 is a frameshift gene, Gene 4 6 and 47 are overlapping. Based on the predicted functions, the segment of genes 33 to 48 of Corazon mainly consists of structural genes that are largely responsible for the formation of the phage structure. By annotating the gene in this project, it will determine the known functions of the newly discovered phage, and it will contribute to the exploration of phage genomes.

Previous research has confirmed the presence of contaminants including perfluoroalkyl acids ( PFAAs) in biosolids -based fertilizers, raising concern over the risk of contaminating food sources. In this study, the uptake of 17 PFAAs in a commercially available biosolids - based fertilizer (Milorganite) was investigated in turnip plants (Brassica rapa) . The plants were cultivated in a greenhouse setting, with a control (no amended biosolids) and two biosolids treatments: the recommended application rate and four times the recommended application rate. At maturity, the plants were harvested and the leave s, bulbs, and peel were analyzed separately. PFAAs were extracted from plant samples using ion -pair extraction and analyzed via liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry. The biosolids and biosolids - amended soils were also extracted to quantify the le vel of PFAAs and to perform a mass balance analysis. In order of increasing application, the mean total PFAS concentrations in: the bulbs were 0.6 1.0, 2.7 0.4, and 4.8 1.4 ug/kg;; the leaves were 3.8 1.3, 13.8 1.2, and 18.6 3.9 ug/kg;; and th e peels were 2.0 1.7, 7.4 1.8, and 13.1 4.7 ug/kg.. For each application rate, the PFAA concentrations were highest in leaves > peel > bulb. Higher application rates resulted in higher PFAA concentrations in the plants, but the four-fold increase of biosolid treatment was not directly proportional to the PFAA concentration. PFBA, PFPeA, and PFHxA were detected in higher concentrations for all treatment levels and plant parts, suggesting that short -chain PFAAs have a higher mobility than longer -chain P FAAs. This study suggests that PFAAs from biosolids -based fertilizers have the potential for uptake and partitioning into different portions of the turnip plant. More research is needed to fully understand the potential risk of PFAAs plant uptake to human and environmental health from biosolids -based fertilizers in urban and suburban gardening.

Thus, scientists have analyzed thousands of phages to see if there are potential new treatments for bacterial infections. In order to understand the function and properties of a phage, its genome must be analyzed. The purpose of this particular study was to completely annotate a set of genes (Genes 17 -32) within the unique bacteriophage, Corazon, isolated from 538 7-10351 bp. Corazon is a lytic bacteriophage in the S cluster belonging to the family Siphoviridae . Corazon's genome originally consisted of 108 genes, for a total length of 64931 base pairs (bp). This study utilized a DNA annotation software, DNAMast er, and several online resources, including PhagesDB, HHPred, Phamerator, and Starterator, to determine optimal gene start sites and to predict respective functions. This was done by comparing the genome of Corazon to the phages in the S cluster. The start sites for Genes 19 and 21 were changed after comparing BLAST results of potential start sites. Gene 24 was deleted because the gene was not conserved in phages from the S cluster. Among the 15 annotated genes, functions were identified in two reverse gene s. Gene 23's function is \"helix -turn-helix DNA binding domain protein,\" which modulates the process of transcription. Gene 32's function is \"DNA -methylase,\" which adds methyl groups to alter DNA activity. The remaining genes had unknown functions, deemed \" no known function.\" These annotations will help identify start sites and functions of similar S cluster genes discovered in the future. This research aids in further understanding of how bacteriophage genomes have unique properties that can be applied t o modern day medical techniques and phage therapy.

These include enzymes in polyketide synthase pathways (PKSs), fatty acid biosynthesis, energy production, and secondary metabolism. The products from these enzymes often include pharm aceutically important natural products. ATs can transfer a variety of metabolites, such as acetyl, malonyl, succinyl, and larger chain fatty acyl groups using Coenzyme A (CoA). The reactivity of the thioester sulfur allows for transfer of these metabolites to secondary metabolites or enzymes. One such example of an AT is type III chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CATIII) from E. coli. CATIII of acetyl -CoA to a hydroxyl group on the antibiotic chloramphenicol, thus conferring chloramphenicol resistance to bacterial cells via O -acetylation. Previously, the structure of CATIII had been solved with its first substrate, chloramphenicol, bound. However, the interaction between CATIII and its second substrate, acetyl -CoA, is not unde rstood very well. Through x -ray crystallography and the synthesis of analogs of acetyl -CoA, this project aims to elucidate the interaction between CATIII and both of its substrates (chloramphenicol + acetyl -CoA). This will validate the usefulness of a wide variety of acyl -CoA analogs for use in other acyltransferases.

This material is referred to as orts. Pr evious studies have demonstrated that giving mice sunflower seeds reduces ort production. However, it is unknown if the seeds help because of the natural shelling behavior they let mice express or if grinding is driven by nutritional needs. We hypothesize that that nutritional components are driving grinding behavior and therefore both treatments will similarly reduce ort production compared to controls. A total of 24 mouse cages (Crl:CD1; 4 mice per cage; 12 male and 12 female cages) were randomly allocate d to a treatment: control, sunflower seeds (nutrition+behavior; 50g), like sunflower seeds (nutrition; 25g). All cages received these treatments in addition to their regular diet. Bedding was collected once a week for 2 bas eline weeks, 3 treatment weeks, and finally 2 weeks after the treatments were removed. Bedding was dried then sifted to determine weekly ort production. The difference in ort weight from baseline was calculated and averaged for each time point. Surprisingl y, when given the nutrition only treatment, average ort production increased compared to control cages. The nutrition+behavior treatment was not different than other treatments. Overall, average ort production decreased during the treatment period compared to after the treatment was removed, regardless of treatment the cage received. This suggests that nutritional value of the seeds may not explain the motivation for food grinding behavior.

This attribute can be exploited to fight antibiotic resistance mycobacteria. As of February 2019, only 14 Cluster S types (a specific group of mycobacteriophage) have been completely sequenced and published in the Actinobacteriophage Database. The purpose of this investigation is to establish the presence, location, and function of genes within the genome of a novel bacteriophage, Corazon and add to this database. Corazon, isolated from a soil sample collected in Lafayette, Indiana, is a member of Cluster S and belongs to the Siphoviridae morphotype. It has 109 genes and a 64kbp genome size. The genome was analyzed with the program DNA Master and a variety of sources such as NCBI BLAST, HHPred, and Phamerator to determine the location and function of genes within the auto -annotated range of genes 4 -16. Within the investigated range, only one gene was assigned a function (MazG -like nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase, which interacts with an essential GTPase in bacteria). The other 13 genes were annotated as genes with no known function. The investigation of significant gaps in the genome resulted in an additional gene (14.5) being added. Contributing to the global understanding of bacteriophages is of interest since the phage -bacteria model has expanded scientists' capabilities of studying evolution and exploring novel medical applications. Publishing these annotations will allow generations of researchers to compare their results to this member of Cluster S and potentially identify a new candidate for phage -mediated transduction, phage therapy, or other application.

Several cultural practices have been evaluated for managing this pest as available options for registered organic pesticides are limited. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of cultural practices designed to reduce ALM population, on the post harvest pungency, sugar content, antioxidant activity and total phenolic content of onions. To ac hieve this, the study followed different variables such as cover crop mixtures (crops associated - or not -associated with mycorrhizal fungi), onion variety (Talon, Cortland, and Sedona), floating row covers during different periods of time (0, 1, and 2 mont hs) and planting technique (bare ground and use of different plastic colors). According to the preliminary data, it suggests that cultural practices significantly alter the phytochemical content of the onions. We are still measuring the pungency and sugar content of post -harvest onion bulbs. Considering there is a lack of scientific -based information on viable practices that detect or avoid the ALM population, and their effect on phytochemicals, this project will assist onion growers in determining how to m anage ALM in order to improve onion yields and the nutritional quality.

Stomata are small openings found on the leaves of vascular plants to allow for water and carbon dioxide transfer, but in bryophytes the sexual organ, or sporophyte, has been found to also have stomata. Using collected mosses from central Indiana, this study is intended to determine the presence of stomata across differe nt moss lineages and their anatomy. Mosses were keyed out using a dichotomous key according to gametophyte characteristics, and stomata were examined using a compound microscope to determine size and shape. Afterwards, a simple parsimony tree was created u sing this information to determine when stomata likely evolved. Additional genomic information was collected from the 1000 Plant Project and BLASTPed against the SPEECHLESS (SPCH) transcription factor in Arabidopsis thaliana to find species across all line ages with similar proteins. The SPCH transcription factor has been confirmed to allow for the development of guard cells that form stomata, and its presence in various moss lineages was used to build another phylogenetic tree. Together, the physiological i nformation and genomic analysis support the theory that modern stomata originated in non -vascular plants, but the history appears to be more complicated than previously thought. Stomata are present in numerous lineages of moss with varying amino acid conte nt and structures. The hypothesis of multiple losses and gains across mosses was supported.

In Arabidopsis alone, there are approximately 450 members of this protein family. PPR proteins associate with plant editosomes and facilitate RNA ed iting, splicing, processing, and stability. We have identified a gene SLOW GROWTH4 (SLO4) encoding an E/E+ -motif containing PPR protein. This protein is predicted to be localized in the mitochondria. We developed homozygous knockout mutants and observed th eir growth using the agar -plate method. slo4 mutants are characterized by retarded plant growth and development. We hypothesize that SLO4 is required for carbon energy balance and plays an important role in the maintenance of the mitochondrial electron tra nsport chain.

To understand the dynamics of population recovery in Indiana, we tracked bobcat expansion at the county level by collecting data from road mortalities from 1993 -2012 and from observations made by deer hunters during bow hunting season from 1995 -2017. We created maps for 1) bobcat mortality and 2) bow hunter observations by county for each year within the ranges of respective data sets in ArcMap 10.5. Maps of road mortality and bow hunter observations indicate that bobcat expansion in Indiana began in the southwestern portion of the state and expanded east along the Kentucky border and also north up to the border of Lake Michigan and Michigan state. The patterns of expansion from these data sets at the co unty level seem to positively correspond to forested habitat and corridors and negatively correspond to agricultural habitat in Indiana. Assessing the environmental covariates of bobcat expansion in the state will be the focus of our next analyses. Underst anding these patterns of bobcat expansion in Indiana will aid managers in the conservation and potential harvest of this species in the future.

Author: Claire Stamper Abstract: In this experiment the visual behavior of Drosophila melanogaster at different times throughout the day was characterized. The circadian rhythms of Drosophila melanogaster are known to dictate the organism's behavioral cycles, particularly as they relate to vision, and locomotor rhythms (such as movement in response to light) [4]. The aim of this experiment was to measure the visual behavior trends of the genotype UAS -eclosion in the morning versus the afternoon. It was anticipated that flies assayed in the morning would have greate r phototactic behavior than flies assayed in the afternoon because the activity of flies in their circadian rhythm peaks at dusk and dawn [1]. Phototaxis assays were performed on male, 10 -day post -eclosion flies in order to test this hypothesis. It was fou nd that flies assayed in the afternoon had greater phototaxis than flies assayed in the morning. The phototactic behavior for flies assayed in the morning was not only lower but also highly variable. These results suggest that there is a difference between phototactic response of flies in the morning as compared to the afternoon.

A dysregulation of inflammation has been implicated in the progression of this disease, but the role of inflammatory neuropeptides such as bradykini n is not understood. Monitoring the alterations to neuropeptide signaling could reveal further insights into the pathophysiology underlying Parkinson's Disease. However, there is currently a lack of tools with sufficiently high spatial and temporal resolut ion to track these changes in real -time across large regions of the nervous system. One potential method of addressing this demand is to develop a genetically encoded fluorescent neuropeptide sensor. An approach to developing these sensors uses a \"Venus Fl ytrap\", which is a dedicated neuropeptide binding domain that binds target neuropeptides and undergoes a conformational change from an open to a closed state. When fused to an engineered fluorescent protein, neuropeptide binding to the flytrap protein indu ces a change in the fluorescence emission. Changes in the fluorescent emission of these sensors can act as readouts for changes in neuropeptide signaling that occur during the progression of Parkinson's Disease, with both high spatial and temporal resoluti on. The purpose of this investigation is to identify neuropeptide sensing domains that can bind bradykinin with high affinity and retain functionality under physiologically relevant pH and temperature. Three candidate sensing domains were investigated: BsA ppA, ScOppA2, and TmOppA. We optimized the expression and purification of these sensing domains in E. coli, in preparation for future characterization of binding affinities and heat stability with competitive fluorescent anisotropy binding assays and circu lar dichromism temperature ramps.

Phage have become the most abundant organisms on earth and have been used for over 90 years in the treatment of bacterial infections in humans. However, there are many types of phages that are still undiscovered and researched. Discovering and annotating new phages will expand the scientific knowledge of bacteriophage and contribute to new infect ion treatments. In this project, the unique phage Corazon was investigated. This phage was discovered in Easton, PA at Lafayette College. Corazon is in the S cluster and belongs to the Siphoviridae family, which means it has a non-contractile tail. For t his project, Corazon was annotated with an annotation tool called DNA Master to call individual genes and decide their start positions. This decision was supported using programs including Phamerator, Starterator, and GeneMarkS maps. Once a start position was found, the gene was analyzed to determine its function. Programs like NCBI and HHPred were used to compare the potential functions of Corazon genes with other genomes in the database. Overall, our group received 18 auto annotated genes, and two more were discovered in the large gaps of over 30bp, totaling 20 genes that were identified for a start site, function and coding potential. Specifically, we annotated genes 57.5 through 75 (34135 -43828 bp). Due to the location of our genes, most of the gene functions were unable to be determined. This genome is a member of the S cluster, which has fewer genomes with known functions, making it difficult to call functions for our genes. The functions we had were HNH endonuclease, exonuclease, hydrolase, DNA bind ing domain protein and WhiB family transcription factor . Our contributions to the data of this genome will be added to a large database to assist more research regarding bacteriophage. These findings will contribute to understanding the different function s of genes in S cluster genomes. By expanding scientific knowledge on different functions of genes we can potentially contribute new phage therapies in the future. Source: Keen, E. C. (2015, January).

Clase, ABE, Purdue University ; Poster Number: 30b :: Life Sciences College of Antibiotic resistance occurs when a bacteria is no longer susceptible to the effects of an antibiotic. Antibiotic resistance has surged in recent years due to long -term antibiotic misuse and the unique ability for bacteria to share resista nt DNA with surrounding bacteria. This resistance makes the process of treating illnesses longer and more difficult. In order to combat this rising issue, scientists have resumed research on bacteriophages. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria, and then use them as a host for replication before ultimately killing the bacteria. Researchers seek to use bacteriophages as a type of \"new antibiotic\" due to their parasitic nature. The first step in this research is to isolate new and unique bacteriopha ges from the environment. After isolating these bacteriophages, the next step in is to annotate their genomes. This annotation is meant to provide more information on the genes within a specific bacteriophage, including their predicted functions. This can then be used to create better treatments, to replace antibiotics, and to fight illness. For this semester, the specific research focused on the annotation of the novel mycobacteriophage Corazon. The section of interest was the final set of genes in Corazon, Gene 99 through Gene 109. Using the suggested start sites given by DNA Master as a tem plate, it was necessary to determine and confirm which start site was the most likely start site for the gene. It is important to determine the appropriate start site for each gene as the respective start sites can significantly influence the function of t he gene. As a group, it was also imperative to check the possibility that DNA Master may have missed a gene in the genome. In order to do this, several different phage databases were used to determine the location and function of each gene. These databases included, but were not limited to, Starterator, Phamerator, and HHPred. Each of these programs store information about other previously -annotated genes from the same pham. In general, the majority of the genes placed at the end of the genome did not show case many functions. Only two out of the eleven genes annotated demonstrated a function, and the function listed by both of these genes was amidotransferase. Amidotransferase is an enzyme that catalyses the removal of the ammonia group from a glutamine mol ecule and transfers it to another substrate, which creates a new carbon -nitrogen group. Most of the genes in this section of the genome were reverse genes and the gaps in between them were could be very large. This was especially noted in the gaps between forward and reverse genes or vice versa. This information, along with the rest of the research gathered this semester, can be applied to future research that will increase the understanding of bacteriophage and how they can be applied to future medicine. T hese medical advancements can help with the current antibiotic epidemic which is vitally important as more bacteria and illnesses are becoming antibiotic resistant.

There is a positive relationship between the dietary intake of saturated fats and colon cancer risk, and a negative relationship between intake of unsaturated fatty acids and colon cancer risk, thus the role of dietary fats in colorectal cancer et iology is apparent, but not well understood. There are various ways that fat composition in the diet may be modulating cancer outcomes. One way is by modulating the types of fatty acids (FA) available to the tumor cells. We used the MC -38 mouse colon adeno carcinoma cell line as a model for studying the effects of FA availability on MC -38 colon cancer cell viability. We hypothesized that palmitate treatment would be positively correlated with viability and that oleate would be negatively associated with viability. Results from an MTT assay show that compared to the control, MC -38 cells have higher viability in media containing palmitate and have lower viability in media containing oleate. Imaging of the cells after Oil Red O staining show that the cells are n ot accumulating the FA, suggesting they are being utilized, and results from quantitative TAG assays confirm this. While FA can be used for energy metabolism, they also can be potent pro - and anti -inflammatory signaling molecules. Results from qRT -PCR show that both oleic and palmitic acid alter the inflammatory cytokine profile of the cells.

However, adverse effects, including stress and leg abnormalities, can also result from increased photoperiod. Currently, little information is available on th e impacts on meat quality and oxidative stability of broiler meat. Thus, the objectives of this study was to evaluate the effects of photoperiod on quality attributes and oxidative stability of broiler fillet meat (M. Pectoralis major). A total of 432 broi ler chicks was split among 6 pens per treatment and were subjected to one of 4 photoperiod treatments: 20L:4D, 18L:6D, 16L:8D and 12L:12D(hours light:dark). At of age, 2 broilers per pen (12 broilers per treatment) were randomly selected and slaugh tered under standard conditions. Fillets were removed, packaged with overwrap -PVC film and displayed for 7 d under light. Measures for meat and carcass quality, instrumental color stability and lipid/protein oxidation were taken. A significant increase in moisture loss during carcass chilling was found in the samples from broilers assigned to the 20L:4D compared to 16L:8D and 12L:12D treatments (P < 0.05). The 20L:4D fillets maintained highest lightness and instrumental discoloration, and least redness, thr oughout display compared to all other treatments (P < 0.05). A significant increase in lipid oxidation was found in the samples from the broilers assigned to 20L:4D and 18L:16D compared to the 12L:12D (P<0.05). These findings indicate that high photoperiod may be detrimental to the final meat quality and oxidative stability of fillet meat.

This study annotates the 36,500 -43,500 bp region of the Corazon genome in conjunction with the SEA -PHAGEs program. Corazon belongs to the Cluster S family, lytic phage that boast an average genome length of 65,000 bp and 107 genes. An auto -annotation was run on DNA Master followed by manual analysis, which was performed using the phagesDB database, DNA Master, NCBI BLAST, HHPred and Phamerator. Information such as high alignment percentages, matching query to target ratios and low e -values were used to call genes, identify gaps, and assign functions to genes within the region. Upon analysis, 14 total genes were called in the analyzed section, 13 of which were identi fied in the auto - annotation. The majority of these matched the original DNA Master call, except the start site of gene 62. Although most of the genes called in the aforementioned region do not have a known function, gene 64 is known to encode for a helix -turn-helix protein, while gene 65 and 68 are known to encode for an exo - and endo - nuclease respectively, indicating this section encodes for DNA regulation. Data generated from annotating the later mid -region of novel Corazon adds to the network of phage r esearch.

If the Wabash River is to improve, so must its tributaries. The Wildcat Creek has been identified as an impaired tributary of the Wabash due to nutrients and E. coli from agricultural runoff. There are two main goals of this assessment; first, identify areas of concern along the Wildcat, such as fields or development that are encroaching along the creek banks and determine best management practices or restoration of these areas, and secondly, identify areas with dense core habitat and strong riparian buffer and seek to improve these healthy systems. Utilizing Lidar data, overlaid with flood maps and land use layers in GIS the Wildcat Creek basin was identified as an area of great concern. Withi n the basin, areas of development and agriculture were identified as key sources of pollution. The study also utilized GIS tools to identify significant areas of core habitat. With these critical areas identified, best management practices and restoration work are recommended to restore riparian buffer along disturbed banks, resulting in connected habitat and diminished runoff along the Wildcat Creek.

Author: Julie Kim Madeline Gavin Abstract: Evaluating Assessments for Elementary Level Gifted Students In the elementary level, the issue of underrepresentation of gifted students is commonly overlooked. Although we recognize that this issue is multi - determined, we focus on assessments that are currently used and might be considered ideal for detecting giftedness in elementary school students. Through detailed evaluation of six quantitative and qualitative assessments, we examine factors that may limit each assessment's accuracy at identifying gifted students. Our analysis highlights how each measure gauges giftedn ess by addressing the purpose of each measure, its uses, and psychometric features. We suggest that multiple means of assessment may be the best way to accurately identify gifted students from culturally and economically diverse backgrounds. Incorporating a mix of both quantitative and qualitative assessments in the identification process is needed to reflect the multi - potentiality of students' giftedness. Our findings have implications for practice as well as for the development and use of these assessment s for research purposes. Research Mentor : Youli Mantzicopolous, Educational Psychology, College of Education ; Poster Number: 38b :: Social Sciences/Humanities College of Education An NCLB, RTTT, and ESSA Author: Jane Sherfey Abstract: Policies and opinions about how best to improve the education system in the United States date back to the inception of public education. In the last several decades, enacted policies are No Child Left Behind, Race to the Top, and Every Student Succeeds Act. These policies have permeated schools and likely will continue to affect them for years to come. With each policy iteration, law -makers have attempted to tackle the same problem - e.g., the need to increase student achievement. The re al question is; however, do they work? In this study, I examine evidence that targets this question. Data from school's achievement records, researchers, parents, teachers, and politicians challenge the effectiveness of these policies. Nonetheless, these policies have critical (yet largely ignored) implications for students, teachers, and schools. I highlight these implications in order to promote understanding of issues that merit critical examination in research in order to effectively inform policy.

The primary problem with handling large datasets (wi th tens of millions of records) is the long time it takes to retrieve the desired data based on specified criteria. This study focuses on addressing this problem by using an open source enterprise search platform called Apache Solr that enables effective a nd efficient data retrieval; due to its indexing, dynamic clustering and database integration features. The dataset used in this study is retrieved from GeoNames.org, which is an open -source dataset composed of 11.5 million records of places with various t ypes of attributes about each place name, such as population, postal codes, spatial hierarchy, and geographic location. The resulting spatio -textual index enables other applications to retrieve desired geographical data in a time efficient manner. One area for improvement and future research is to provide users with a portable platform that does not require users to have to download and configure Apache Solr from scratch.

Excessive Mn exposure commonly occurs in the smelting and welding industries, and previous studies have found significant Mn accumulation in the basal ganglia. This study investigates the pituitary gland, olfactory bulb, and the CA2 area of the hippocampus as additional regions of Mn deposition in the brain. Animal studies have shown Mn accumulation in these regions but there are few human studies investigating these brain regions. This st udy analyzed high - resolution 3D T1 -weighted (1x1x1.25 mm3) MRI data from a former study on 10 smelters from a Mn -Fe alloy factory and 10 controls with no history of Mn exposure. Manual regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in the pituitary gland, olfactor y bulb, hippocampus, and tongue (for reference) using ITK -SNAP. The relative intensity of each region was determined by calculating the ratio of the intensities of the brain region to the tongue in order to account for natural variability in the MRI. While no significant difference in relative intensity between smelters and controls was found in the olfactory bulb or the hippocampus, smelters showed a significant increase (p = 0.002) in relative intensity in the pituitary gland compared to controls, indic ating increased Mn accumulation in this region. Uptake of Mn into the pituitary gland is physiologically plausible due to the lack of blood brain barrier in the pituitary gland. This study provides preliminary evidence of increased Mn accumulation in the p ituitary gland in a human exposed population. This research is supported by NSF Grant DMS -1246818.

This study is focused on establishing baselines for succes sful sustainable development programs in the Fraternity, Sorority, and Cooperative Life Houses. One of the key metrics being investigated is the adoption rate and perception of recycling programs within shared community spaces. We hypothesize that convenie nce (e.g., distance to recycling drop off points) and economic perceptions are the primary drivers impacting individual sustainable practices and broader implementation within Fraternity, Sorority, and Cooperative Life housing. This study will gather infor mation on the successful implementation of existing programs and identify challenges and barriers to those without recycling initiatives. An educational targeted campaign will be implemented within houses. Electronic surveys will be conducted to identify a nd assess: (1) factors that influence diversion rates; (2) perceived barriers and challenges to implementing recycling programs, and (3) the impact of the educational campaign (i.e., to gauge changing attitudes). In focusing on Fraternity, Sorority, and Co operative Life students, we hope to utilize this information to implement long -term sustainable practices that will encompass the entirety of Purdue's undergraduate community. Research Mentor : Michael Mashtare, Agronomy and Environmen tal and Ecological Engineering, College of Engineering ; Poster Number: 42b :: Mathematical/Computational Sciences College of Engineering Evaluating the Consistency of Contemporary Object Detectors Author: Mridul Arora Peter Huang Abstract: Object detection neural networks are computer vision programs designed to recognize objects such as cars and humans in any given photo. They can conceivably be used for lifesaving, emergency response applications such as detecting car accidents from realtime traf c camera images. However, in order to fulll such duties, object detectors need to be reliable. More specically, they need to be accurate. For example, in a given photo, a car should be detected as a car, and not as anything else. In addition, an object detector should also be consistent. If the same two cars were to appear in a series of very similar, yet slightly different photos, then the two cars should be detected in each of the photos analyzed and detections should not randomly \"drop out\". Many publ ished performance metrics of object detectors include some accuracy information such as the mean average precision (mAP) and intersection over union (IoU). However, few of these papers evaluate consistency measurements. We evaluate the consistency/stabilit y of three different object detectors: YOLOv3, ResNet, and VGG16 by generating labels for the images and using a comparison metrics to test for consistency. Some consistency evaluation metrics we will use include average labels per image over time, histogr ams for the size of bounding boxes provided by each detector, as well as a heatmap of the locations of these bounding boxes. At the software level, we will also evaluate the three models based on metrics such as speed (frames per second), network size (num ber of parameters), as well as the dataset used to train the network. Research Mentor : Yung -Hsiang Lu, Professor, ECE Purdue University ; Poster Number: 43b :: Social Sciences/Humanities College of Engineering A Comparison of Peer Rating Behavior Between Students in Hard vs. Soft Disciplines Author: Maizey Benner Abstract: Many researchers believe that students in different majors/disciplines learn differently due to differences in both pedagogical approaches and personal preferen ces. Whether students of various disciplines behave differently in team contexts or view/perform peer evaluations differently has not been frequently explored. To remedy this, we study the differences in behavior of students in \"hard\" and \"soft\" discipline s. The notion of \"hard vs. soft\" disciplines has been discussed in a scholarly context at least as early as Comte's work in 1896. Kemp asserts that students who study \"hard\" (generally positivist) disciplines (like math and engineering) tend to take on a s urface level -thinking approach, while students in \"soft\" disciplines (non -positivist, such liberal arts, business, or law) tend to have a deeper thinking approach in their studies. A surface -level approach refers to concentrating on completing the task at hand, while a deeper approach refers to a deeper understanding of the meaning and interworking of a task. A common theme found in disciplines such as law is that teaching is often teacher -oriented, which is contrasted by behavioral sciences which tend to u se a learner -oriented approach to teaching. Lindblom -Yl\u00e4nne (2010) discovered that law students prefer a high quality lecture and class materials, as well as group work as most important in their learning, while behavioral science students prefer their ins truction to build on prior knowledge, encourage the use of critical thinking, and have positive interaction between professor and student. We hypothesize that these differences in expectations for a class may translate to differences in expectations for th e behavior of members of a group. This Work in Progress research focuses on the teamwork behaviors and ratings of students in business, engineering, and liberal arts. We examine whether there are comparable differences in teamwork behavior due to fundame ntal differences in their particular learning experiences and preferences, as measured by their evaluations in peer evaluation surveys. The hypothesis is that engineering students (\"hard discipline students\") will have significant differences in peer evalu ation scores from liberal arts or business students (\"soft discipline students\"). This analysis will use convergence in self and peer ratings, dispersion in ratings across peer evaluation dimensions, and the variances examined in the Social Relations Model as statistical analysis methods. Research Mentor : Dr. Daniel Ferguson Engineering Education College of Engineering ; Poster Number: 44b :: Mathematical/Computational Sciences College of Engineering An Evaluation of Modern Code Review in a Research Enviroment Author: Andrew Guo Abstract: While working within the Continuous Analysis of Many Cameras (CAM2) research group at Purdue University for several semesters we've observed that there is consistent difficulty in merging features. We hypothesize that the lack of proper code review practice is a primary factor affecting the difficulty when incremental updates are made. Our research attempts are made to find and mitigate issues regarding code review within our team through implementing a well -structured code review process. We hypothesize that instilling the methodologies of Modern Code Review through an interactive workshop will cause fewer evolvability defects, leading to a major increase in productivity. After reviewing existing literature, we have produced a 21 -question survey that will observe the current state of code review in CAM2 before and after an educational workshop. The aforementioned workshop will consist of three consecutive parts: an information session where attendees will be taught how to properly use Modern Code Review; an interactive code review session where common sub - team members will work together to review production code from their own project; and final ly, a discussion session to field any questions or comments attendees may have. We will use the collected data from before and after the workshop alongside the general comments at the conclusion of the workshop to determine if the compiled literature works in practice. Our definition of efficiency is achieved when teams avoid evolvability defects that slow down the progress of their individual projects and can instead make productive contributions. Should our findings verify our hypothesis we will further t est and manipulate particulars within our code review methodology to continue improving the software development process within our research group.

Currently, subtitles are automatically generated from audio. This project will explore the possibility of generatin g subtitles by analyzing the lip movement of the people talking in the videos. The team will use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to interpret the speaking and generate proper subtitles. To meet this goal, the team will train the machine with \"The Oxfo rd-BBC Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW)\" dataset, consisting of up to 1000 utterances of 500 different words spoken by hundreds of different speakers. The team will begin the project by developing a classification algorithm for still images using the MNIST da taset of handwritten digits from 0 -9. Methods used for 2D convolution in the digit classification algorithm will be extended to implement a 3D CNN for analyzing the video input from the LRW dataset. A 3D CNN differs from a 2D CNN in that the input is a sta ck of 2D images arranged in the order of time progression. The network makes changes to its parameters based on these ordered sets of images. The team will begin the project with a simple configuration that detects simple words (eg. \"yes\" and \"no\") with a target accuracy of 75%, a metric which has been achieved in similar studies. Later, the design will be expanded to a level that can detect continuous speech. The model can be developed further to achieve higher accuracy, or it can be expanded to cover diff erent languages. This project has several applications, such as aiding those with hearing disabilities and assisting subtitle generation algorithms based on auditory information. Research Mentor : Edward Delp, ECE, Engineering ; Carla Zoltowski, ECE, Engineering Poster Number: 46b :: Physical Sciences College of Engineering Power Characterization: Measuring Adhesion Forces Author: Kacie Bradfish Abstract: Powder behavior is a complex topic that influences many industrial processes, especially those involved with food and pharmaceutical processing, and has an important role in homeland security and military applications involving explosives and explosive residues. The goal of the research is to be able to predict bulk flow behavior f rom milligram -level quantities of powder. This is important for designing better industrial processes, and also for measuring forces between explosive particles and binders for controlling detonations. In order to characterize a powder, a centrifuge is u sed to determine the rotational speed, in RPM, needed to remove particles of different size from a surface of interest. Based on the size of the particles removed at each speed, their adhesion force can be determined. Using a modified van der Waals force model, it is possible to fit a distribution of 'effective' Hamaker constants to the adhesion force data. These constants are matched to the powder's particle size distribution. Using the van der Waals force model with the 'effective' Hamaker constant distribution, the adhesion behavior of the entire powder can now be described based only on the size distribution of the powder. Experiments are performed on flat surfaces with spherical particles to model the ideal case. More complex systems of ideal part icles on rough surfaces are being studied to determine how surface roughness will affect the adhesion forces. These experiments will validate the theory that the adhesion force distribution of a powder, which is critically linked to its flow characteristi cs, can be described using simple experiments, an effective Hamaker constant distribution, and the size distribution of the powder.

Beaudoin, Chemical Engineering ; Poster Number: 47b :: Social Sciences/Hu manities College of Engineering University Housing's Impact on Academic Success Author: Rachel Casetti Abstract: Universities around the U.S. are continuing to grow, and as they do the need for more student housing increases. Determining what type of hou sing is most beneficial for students in terms of student performance and success is one of the many factors in deciding the type of housing in which to invest. Purdue is in the midst of expanding its campus to accommodate more students. Knowing the benefit s and drawbacks between different types of housing can inform the type of housing Purdue chooses to develop. The primary difference is between on and off campus housing, but it is also important to look at the various types of on campus housing. For exampl e, there are some residence halls that have 'living learning communities,' which are groups of students who live in the same residence and take some of the same classes. Figuring out how effective these learning communities are in promoting student perform ance and success is important so that Purdue can decide whether or not to implement more of them in the future. In this research, cross tabulation methods were utilized on an institutional data set to compare the GPAs of students living both on and off cam pus. Initial findings suggest that students living on campus had statistically higher GPA than those living off campus. These findings point to the value of on campus housing. Based on student perception data in related literature, living learning communit ies have increased first year retention rates, promoted learning outside of the classroom, and provided an overall positive first year experience for freshman. As Purdue's incoming class size continues to grow, this research suggests that the university sh ould invest in on campus housing because of its value on academic outcomes.

One possible way designers can be more intentional with how they develop powerful visualizations is with the use of image schemas. Image schemas can be defined as conceptual structures that are utilized to organize models of understanding. It is reasonable to believe that users can benefit from a catalog of image schemas as it would lead to a better comprehension of information visualizations if the designer understood the str engths and weaknesses of each image schema of interest. Currently, there is little understanding of the cognitive basis of how individuals interpret and reason with various visualizations. One useful cognitive basis of interest is conceptual metaphors as t hey leverage universal image schemas. Through the development of a standardized catalog, designers of all levels can benefit and gain further aid in the creation of effective information visualizations. The purpose of this research is to create a standardi zed design catalog that will assist both users and designers by strengthening the visualizations that are produced. This poster illustrates the categorization of specific image schemas, its role in information visualization, and its potential applications.

Author: Haozhi Chen Abstract: The goal of this study is to develop a systematic model for the care coordination of children with complex medical conditions at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin.The purpose of this model to be set to better understand the information transfer process in care delivery. Currently two new tools are implemented for the Care Coordination Programs: the \"Special Needs Summary Note\" and \"Patient Care Coordination Note\". The two tools re side in the Electronic Health Record as notes to aid information transfer in Care Coordination. This study utilizes text data analysis and process mapping to analyze the structure and content of both notes, the effectiveness of both notes will be assessed by qualitative methods including surveys and interviews with faculties who constantly use the two tools. The log data from the EHR will be used to quantify the frequency of people, by different job role, viewing the two notes. The result includes a descrip tive data -driven model which maps the information transfer within the Care Coordination Programs. The current tools fail to build the perfect platform for information transfer due to the limitation of human -editing notes and the rapidly changing Healthcare environment for patients with complex medical conditions. With a focus on inpatient care, ambulatory care, or both, the descriptive model can facilitate better information transfer by categorizing the patient data by the specialty of the care provider. Th e developed data model for care coordination should aid in identifying the existing data loss and inconsistency in the current database. Combined with the Care Coordination Programs, they will become key strategies for improving the efficiency of care deli very.

Currently the team is focusing on monitoring the stability, and the cause of the crashes. There are two major crashes. One is inside docker container, checking whether application/server is running, which is our priority, and the other one is simply checking if the docker is running or not. The method used to monitor crash is to cre ate a new bash script inside docker container by using the terminal vim editor and somehow get it done so that it can check if the application (node app.js)/server.sh is running or not. It will also check whether disk and memory monitors are on or not. The n, in order to visualize it on website, a Java Script program must be made to visualize what we have in bash script. In both cases, whenever the server/application is offline, the program will automatically turn them on. Also, as the program is run in the docker, we need to make a file outside the docker to make sure the docker is on. We will also use the same method as the server monitor. As the future improvement, we will add the email notification function into the system so that it could notify the d eveloper who is in charge of the server that the system had some problem need to be fixed. If the program is successfully executed, users should be able to get warnings whenever the system has trouble, and the system is able to check crashes whenever it has one and solve the crashes itself. And if the time allows, team members are expected to start on other minor tasks in the project such adding data pack instead of only to replace it as and mapping interface.

However, in most commercial juices, high amounts of sugar and preservatives are added for flavor and shelf life. We have found that a healthier apple juice alternative can be enriched with B2 vitamin probiotic bacteria, L. plantarum, to become a natural riboflavin -fortified juice. A natural juice was created with red delicious apples that were boiled for four hours at 60C and then mashed. The apple mash was strained and th e juice was extracted. L. plantarum was grown in a medium containing only roseoflavin to allow for the identification of strains that can overproduce riboflavin in this environment. These strains were isolated and introduced into additional medium with hi gher concentrations of 50 L roseoflavin to mutate the bacteria further. Eventually, a strain grown on a plate containing 100 L roseoflavin was introduced into riboflavin assay medium to inoculate homemade apple juice. This apple juice was fermented at ro om temperature and 37C. The apple juice acts as a fermentation medium for the bacteria over a period of time and riboflavin concentration was monitored via spectrophotometry, where standards were created with acetic acid. Results showed that L. plantarum could successfully ferment apple juice to create a product with increased amounts of riboflavin. Further studies will need to be performed to monitor taste for potential production.

Previous work at Purdue has focused on the study of clay dispersions and their use for treating soils susceptible to earthquake induced liquefaction. Most recently Laponite has been studied due to its unique rheological response when dispersed in water which behaves as a Newtonian fluid immediately after mixin g and over time forms a thixotropic gel. Therefore, when the Laponite dispersion is disturbed, it will revert back to being a liquid and the gelling process will happen all over again. The thixotropic properties of Laponite dispersions are significant in u nderstanding how a significant shearing event such as an earthquake will impact the state of the dispersion. To study the thixotropic nature of the dispersions, amplitude sweeps were performed using a rheometer both prior to and after various oscillatory a nd rotational disturbances of different magnitudes to study the effect on the rheological properties (i.e. phase angle, storage modulus, and loss modulus). Initial testing shows that when disturbed, the recovery of the dispersions prior to disturbance vari es depending on time of aging, clay concentration and concentration of dispersant.

The work that was completed contributes to the overall research done for mycobacteriophage genom es. The overall objective for this project is to discover new bacteriophages and analyze their genomes; this information can then potentially be used in future research. Last semester, various species of mycobacteriophage were discovered and isolated using wet lab techniques, and this semester the project was continued by analyzing the genetic code and annotating potential genes. Mycobacterium phage Corazon was discovered in Easton, PA and is a lytic, siphoviridae, Cluster S phage. Using programs such as DN A Master, GeneMark, BLAST, Starterator, Phamerator, and HHPred, the genes of this mycobacteriophage were analyzed to determine which features were genes and the likely functions of these genes. The predictions from these programs and databases are heavily reliant on historical data from other related mycobacteriophages. Our group specifically annotated genes 49 - 61 from the overall gene list of Corazon which contained 109 genes total. Our group's specific set of annotated genes are very similar to mycobact erium phage MosMoris. Based on the functions of the genes found in our gene list, we can make the assumption that our genome segment relates to near the end of the phage reproduction cycle as most of our annotated genes have to do with cell lysis, cell deg radation, or are tail proteins. The next step for research is to see whether this new knowledge of phages can be applied to potential applications such as antibacterial resistance or genetic engineering. Research Mentor : Dr Kari Clase , ABE, colleges of Agriculture and Engineering ; Poster Number: 54b :: Mathematical/Computational Sciences College of Engineering Objective Muscular Fatigue Analysis in Minimally Invasive Surgeries Author: Rachel Harmon invasive surgeries, such as laparoscopic and robotic surgeries, commonly result in musculoskeletal neuromuscular injuries, muscular fatigue, and arthritic injury and pain. These surgeries allow for a quicker patient recovery tim e, but pose a hard physical toll on surgeons. If these problems are not prevented, they can impact the healthcare system by affecting operation schedules and the quality of surgeries. Studies were geared towards identifying physical symptoms and reducing p ain and discomfort from different surgeries. Physical discomfort, postural stability, ergonomic issues, stress, surgeons' activities, spinal motion, workload, and Electromyography (EMG) data were measured in order to determine the risks and effects of lapa roscopic surgeries on surgeons. EMG signals showed that certain muscles are used more frequently than others and therefore have a greater risk of fatiguing suggesting that operations requiring higher accuracy be performed earlier in a surgeon's schedule. I t was also found that laparoscopic surgeries have more taxing effects on surgeons due to the high physical muscular workload required of the thumb and forearm muscles, measured by surface EMG during a simulated task. However, studies were limited in measur ing fatigue due to identifying a specific point at which an individual is fatigued. Another issue was the difficulty ensuring constant conditions in real workplaces because there may be disturbances from time constraints, cleaning, or changing specificatio ns. The results of this research will provide more insights to the sources of fatigue (tools, procedure, posture, etc.) over the surgery time.

This causes a misrepresented view of generalized images within other domains and can lead to significant consequences when the classifier needs to disce rn specific attributes. This problem is addressed through a crowdsourced measure that will generate a large number of attributes within a given dataset and analyze it for bias; This will provide a corrective solution through identifying the initially biase d attributes and significantly reduce any punitive results. Other solutions provide a corrective measure through the restructuring of the intrinsic network so the image classifier may be extended to other image domains; However, the classifier can easily b ecome inaccurate without first identifying the biased attributes and the needed attributes to correct bias. Our crowdsourcing method provides a more reliable means for correcting the existing bias within the initial dataset. The crowdsourcing process desig n utilizes a gamification process in which players can compare images within a given dataset and provide attributes of similarity. The attributes generated by game players provide a holistic view of the attributes within the dataset, which can be further a nalyzed for bias through the backend workflow model. The results obtained show a significant improvement in classifier accuracy and a faster convergence of error compared to the unmodified, initial dataset. Overall, the crowdsourcing method presented prove s to be a more reliable and efficient means for correcting a training image dataset and improving the distribution of attributes supplied to the classifier.

In supervised learning, a successful model requires a lar ge scaled annotated data. In our project, we propose to reduce the number of required labeled data by utilizing the relationship between distinctiveness and a model's accuracy. Datasets used to train neural networks contain distinctive properties that requ ire the training process to heavily depend on the source domain. This requires a lot of labeled data while some are not improving the model when trained upon. Our project optimizes the training of deep neural networks by measuring dataset distinctiveness, identifying how distinctiveness impacts a model's accuracy, and performing domain specific data augmentation. Our data augmentation method demonstrates a reduction in the number of required annotations. We perform extensive simulations to show that our met hod outperforms traditional data augmentation and other GAN -based methods. These results suggest that when training neural networks with data augmentation on a model that is most similar to the targeted dataset, the accuracy and efficiency can be optimized .

Biodegradable films have been produced from a variety of biopolymeric matrices, including polysaccharides. However, polysaccharide films have usually poor tensile properties, besides being highly permeable to water vapor and sensitive to water. Cellulose Nano Crystals (CNC) have gained a wide spectrum of intere st in research due to its great barrier performance and tensile strength properties. CNC has also been an interest due to their chiral structure which enhances the barrier performance in packaging application. However, the brittle property of CNC has limit ed its application for packaging. The objective of our research was to apply thin layer coating of cellulose nano crystals -citric acid on polypropylene substrate for high barrier packaging application. Results suggested that addition of citric acid into co ating formulation enhance both oxygen and carbon -dioxide barrier performance because of the enhanced tortuosity of the passage of the gas molecules.

Three different compositio ns of 2.5%, 5%, and 8% solute were deposited to explore the hardening effect at different compositions. Nanoindentation tests showed the ultra -high hardness (exceeding 9.5 GPa) of Fe -Zr films. To explore the strengthening mechanisms, transmission electron microscopy was performed on the cross -section and plane -view samples of the pure Fe, Fe -Zr 2.5%, and Fe -Zr 8% films. The micrographs revealed that the grain size of Fe -Zr decreased with increasing Zr content. However, grain size reduction could not result in the substantial increase in hardness that was observed. Further analysis of the microstructure showed that high stacking faults near column boundaries could have lead to the extra hardening in Fe -Zr films. Our findings could provide general implications on the design of high -strength Fe alloys.

By applying Human Factors methods in the US healthcare system, resea rchers are able to expand their knowledge on how human interactions play a role in the care of patients. Human factors and ergonomics in healthcare pertains to a human's ability to work with systems and techniques in the healthcare industry. Since these st udies are in an early stage, there lacks a definition of this Patient Centered Physical Ergonomics. This poster presents findings of a Scoping Review of Patient Centered Physical Ergonomics (PCPE) in order to work towards creating a definition for PCPE. De fining this broad topic will help to develop techniques and designs to reduce burden on patients in the healthcare system. To develop this topic, a review of sources identified through Google scholar was conducted. Following this review, categories were cr eated to determine common themes of PCPE. By consulting two experts, many topics were found to be outside the definition of PCPE. In this poster, there are a range of categories to cover all aspects of PCPE, examples include usability and wearable devices. Patient Centered Physical Ergonomics is a topic that does not have a clear definition. This poster and research conducted offers a beginning definition of this topic in order to create a better experience for patients.

Using a machine learning algorithm that is trained to determine which tweets are relevant, all tweets are categorized based on their relevance within topics such as weath er, safety, traffic, etc. This project aims to visualize relevant tweets in the context of all incoming tweets. Specifically we use heat maps that show the location and volume of relevant tweets. Identifying relevant geographic areas is important as the vi sualization can be used by first responder groups in order to locate specific areas that are in need, such as people trapped in wildfires or other natural disasters. Twitter gives affected populations a platform to express their needs and local first responder groups can provide assistance based on where the tweets originated from. -Kalyan Mada Research Mentor : David S.

Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) inspections are used to prevent infiltration, sewer overflows, sinkholes and catastrophic failure. However, current CCTV sewer inspections involve a manual interpretation of videos, which is often slow, inconsistent, and erroneous. Automated inspections have the potential to improve the speed, consistency, and accuracy of sewer con dition assessment. In this study, an automated system was developed to take entire videos of sewer networks and identify the frames that harbor anomalies. The automated system is based on a ResNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that was trained on a da taset of 20,000 defect and defect free sewer pipe images. To evaluate the accuracy of the automated system, an additional 2,000 images unseen by the CNN were applied. On the test set, the prototype system achieved an accuracy of 87%. The prototype system w as further tested on CCTV videos, which televised 300 feet of sewer pipe line, to demonstrate practical applicability of the system. Once sufficiently robust, this automation tool will assist field analysis of real -time sewer video footage and reduce inspe ction time and potential error.

With an increasing interest in deep learning, large data sets of images are especially valuable. On the internet there is an abundance of cameras that are broadcasting live feeds to many publicly available websites. These network cameras could be used to create a valuable resource if organized in an efficient manner. However, there are several problems with collecting network cameras from various websites that must be addressed in order to produce a readily accessible database. Because every website has a unique design and structure, a generalizable method must be developed for identifying web cameras on individual websites. T his leads to a need to filter out content that is not from a network camera. This paper outlines approaches used to determine if an image is from a network camera. Methods looking at the data received from the webcam over an extended duration are proving t o show potential for success. Other techniques that analyze content surrounding the image such as the URL are also currently being explored.

Stability, rate of oligomerization and selectivity towards higher molecular weight oligomerization produ cts depend on active site proximity, crystallite size, and active site location in different pore sizes within the zeolite. MFI (ZSM -5) pore environments: straight channels, sinusoidal channels, and c hannel intersections. The structural complexity of MFI complicates investigation of the effects of Al proximity on oligomerization independent of other relevant parameters such as pore size and crystallite length. Herein we report our efforts to synthesize zeolite frameworks MEL (ZSM -11) and TON (ZSM -22) with different Al distribution and crystallite size. The structurally simplicity of MEL, which has only straight channels and channel intersections, and TON, which has only unidirectional straight channels, assists in synthetically decoupling Al proximity and size. Al-TON and Al -MEL (Si/Al 20 -60) zeolites were synthesized by previously reported methods using different ratios of potassium and structure directing agent (SDA) to influence Al siting [2][3]. Two structure directing agents were tested for the synthesis of Al -TON: 1,6 -diaminohexane (DAH) and 1,8 - diaminooctane (DAO). Water content in the synthesis gel was varied in Al -MEL synthesis (H2O/Si 6 -25) , since crystallite size in Al -MEL can be influenced by water content in synthesis [4]. The percentage of Al in proximity was quantified by Co2+ exchange. We will discuss how crystallite size and Al proximity vary with water content and SDA across this suite of catalysts.

By looking at the detection results on neighboring frames in a video stream, it is easy to observe that these models inconsistently detect objects of interest. This problem is apparent despite there being little visual difference between the neighboring frames. This project is focused on gaining a deep understanding of why object detection algorithms fail to consistently detect objects of interest on sequential image data. The fact that neural n etworks are not robust to small changes that are nearly imperceptible to humans introduces pressing security concerns for organizations with systems using this technology. For example, any organization selling intelligent security cameras or autonomous veh icles must guarantee the consistency of their products. Our work is in its' early stages, however, small -scale experiments have shown that specific features learned by the network are hyper -sensitive to small input perturbations. These sensitive features s eem to be correlated with poor detection stability. Our methods are unique such that we are examining the sensitivity of specific features learned by the network where as other work focuses on the sensitivity of the output of the entire network. Looking ah ead, some goals we are focused on are (1) reproducing our results at large -scale, (2) gaining a deeper understanding of the types of features that tend to be more sensitive, and (3) investigating if this problem exists across many network architectures.

Substantial research exists on the parameters contributing to successful or outstanding team performance and individual performance o n a team. Two of the bigger contributors to outstanding team performance are the characteristics and skills of team members relative to what the project needs and the student's motivation for selecting a particular team project. How these factors are consi dered in the formation of Capstone teams is the key focus of this research.Capstone team formation generally occurs in three different methods: random assignment of students to teams, systematic instructor assignment of students to teams, and student selec tion ofthe projects they prefer to work on. Many studies have been published describing each of these three methods and citing overall team/Capstone project/program success. Each of these Capstone team formation approaches were analyzed in terms of the p ros and cons of the method and then all three methods were compared to identify best practices in Capstone team formation. Finally, alternate approaches to Capstone team formation are discussed. Research Mentor : Dan Ferguson, Engineer ing, Engineering Education ; Poster Number: 66b :: Mathematical/Computational Sciences College of Engineering Thermodynamics of Coherent Structures near Phase Transitions Author: Julia Meyer Abstract: Phase transitions within large -scale systems may be modeled by using partial differential equations, in which system dynamics are captured by appropriate polynomial potentials. The ability to simulate and predict phase transition behavior has many applications, from material behaviors (e.g., liquid crystal phase transformations, coherent movement of granular materials) to traffic congestion. Coherent structures in these systems evolve along a single spatial dimension randomly through time; thus, the statistical behavior of these fields is of greater interest than particular system results. Past research focused on deriving solutions to the system probability density function (PDF) and verifying solutions for fourth -order and other simple potentials. Until recently, the extent to which these solutions could be verified was limited by computing power. This work focused on verifying solutions for PDFs of sixth -order and tenth -order potentials, which describe more complex phase transition behaviors, and determining their respective correlation functions. Large -scale MATLAB simulations were used to model the evolution of fields at certain system \"temperatures\", for which statistical PDFs and correlation functions were computed. Once fully validated, this approach will enable a better understanding of successive phas e transitions in complex materials, and allow for accurate modeling of these system behaviors based on material properties. In the future it would be beneficial to evaluate the field dynamics of higher -order potentials at a smaller scale to gain further in sight on the behavior of stochastic processes in large -scale systems.

To combat this, we are creating an optical tool to detect and understand how the endosomal pH activity affects activity of engulfed receptors by measuring the ratiometric changes of a red fluorescent protein, mKeima. Using this red fluorescent protein is advantageous because it allows for opportunities to dual image with other biosensors and conduct in vivo imaging in the future. Endocytosis can be induced through binding between a chemical ligand and its receptor, which in our case is accomplished through the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system. The SpyTag and SpyCatcher pair has been pro ven capable of selectively labeling membrane -localized proteins in live cells through its covalent, irreversible bond. The fluorescent protein mTurquoise is on the C - terminus of the receptor, which allows us to localize the membrane protein at all times, t racking it in live cells, and eventually neurons. After added exogenously, the SpyCatcher -mKeima fusion bonds and successively tracks the receptor trafficking, activity, and degradation. Successful development of this biosensor could potentially allow for detecting and preventing neurodegeneration through many diseases.

Shocking, isn't it? Author: Laura Mudge Fajar Ausri Abstract: Wearable sensors are a popular way to monitor health conditions and behavior. Although physiological measures like heart rate has been long collected using wearables, electrodermal activity which detects emotional arousal has only recently been integrated into wearables. Currently, researchers use gold standard devices, such as the Shimmer3 GSR+, to collect the data. However, the procedure is lengthy and inco mpatible with those who have a limited range of motion. Current wearable devices on the market struggle to deliver accurate results under various workloads and activities, especially with motion sensing. The Empatica E4 is a new wearable device designed to deliver accurate EDA measurements. The device is worn like a watch and markets itself as an unobtrusive monitoring solution with accurate and precise physiological data. The purpose of this project is to analyze the validity and reliability of the Empatic a E4 by comparing the accuracy of its readings to those of the Shimmer3 GSR+. For this experiment, participants (n = 10) completed a cognitive task at two levels of intensity and researchers compared the EDA values recorded by the E4 to those recorded by the Polar. In addition to monitoring these metrics, researchers tracked motion data by asking the participants to tap along with a metronome while performing the trials. Upon the conclusion of each task, participants completed a usability quiz, rating the d ifficulty of the task and their experience using the wearable devices. Preliminary results show that there is a significant difference between the devices when looking at EDA peak counts (p < 0.001) while there is no significant difference when looking at median EDA.

Only 5% of patients are expec ted to live longer than 5 years, and the median survival is approximately 15 months with treatment. Treatment options have not advanced much in the last two decades, making new GBM therapies an important area for exploration. In recent years, the use of a ketogenic diet and intermittent or prolonged fasting has gained attention as a potential therapeutic option for GBM patients. More research is required to further understand and refine these techniques before they may become part of the standard of care. W hile genomic data for GBM is more expansive, with many therapies targeting genes, lipidomics is a budding field that may prove useful in identifying potential targets of this disease. Lipidomic data may also help illustrate how the ketogenic diet and fasti ng techniques could be tailored to help correct abnormalities in GBM lipid profiles. Using laser capture microdissection (LCM) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), mass spectrometry data was gathered and analyzed from several grades of human GBM tissue samples. Significant differences from lipid profiles of the tumor and the brain around the tumor were determined. Future work may aim to target or correct some of these abnormalities in the lipidome, be it with the use of nutritional interventions like a ketogenic diet and fasting or drug therapies.

Topological quantum computing with Majorana zero modes has attracted intensive research interests because it is less vulnerable to noise and deco herence. Majorana zero modes can be engineered using materials with a strong spin -orbit interaction coupled to superconductors. InSb/AlInSb/GaAs semiconductor heterostructures with strong spin -orbit interaction are ideal candidates for engineering Majorana zero modes. Perpendicular field magnetotransport measurements show signatures of weak anti -localization and can be used to extract physical parameters related to the spin -orbit effect. We perform measurements on InSb/AlInSb/GaAs at 4K using a He4 dipping probe in magnetic fields from -50mT to 50mT. Measurement parameters such as sample rate and magnetic field sweep rate are optimized to yield reproducible results. We fit the resulting magnetotransport data with the Iordanskii, Lyanda -Geller, Pikus (ILP) Mo del for perpendicular field measurement to extract the strength of the spin -orbit coupling. The results are analyzed to determine the viability of the methodology to characterize the spin -orbit interaction in heterostructures from this lab.

Our tea m is tasked with utilizing Signals of Opportunity to determine changes in the coefficient of reflection of the surface of the earth. This data can then be used to determine soil moisture content several meters below the surface, in the root - zone of the fa rmland we are surveying. Previous attempts have been made in the EHF band, but these signals only penetrate a few centimeters into the ground. By receiving signals in the VHF band, we are able to calculate soil moisture content several times further bene ath the surface, leading to more long -term measurements of soil moisture. Previously, performing remote sensing with Signals of Opportunity was limited to stationary towers or manned flights. Stationary towers have limited range, and manned flights are exp ensive. By utilizing a Software Defined Radio and a commercial UAV, remote sensing using these signals can be done autonomously. A USRP E310 Software Defined Radio has been configured to collect VHF signals from ORBCOMM communication satellites. The radio and RX antennas are attached to a DJI Matrice 600 Pro UAV such that the receiver can collect data from different locations autonomously. Our team expects to measure various coefficients of reflection dependent upon the moisture content of the medium that the signal reflects off of. In the case of more torrid soil conditions, we would expect a low relative coefficient, properly irrigated soil would have a coefficient between 0.6 -0.9, and a body of water would produce a coefficient and a body of water would produce a coefficient ~1.0.

Phages play an important role in the universe. With the rise of antibiotic -resistant bacteria, other methods of combating bacte ria are required, and use of bacteriophages is one such option. There is a population of approximately 1031 phages in the world, but fewer than 1500 have been completely characterized in GenBank as of August 2014. We are working with the SEA -PHAGES Program to collect, isolate, extract, purify, and annotate DNA from phage using both hands -on field work and computer programs such as DNA Master. Mycobacteriophages are viruses that specifically infect Mycobacterium host cells. For this biotechnology project, t he mycobacteriophage Corazon genes 4 through 20, were auto -annotated and analyzed for correct start site call and function prediction using DNA Master. We were also able to recognize gaps and overlaps between gene calls. Corazon was found in Easton, PA bel onging to the S cluster and a Siphoviridae morphology. The resulting gene annotations were recognized to be very similar to gene sequences in Marvin, MosMoris, and LittleLaf, previously annotated genes. The functions were mainly unknown since this section is at the beginning of the genome. To continue expanding the phages database, the Corazon gene annotations will be added into the overall database system to share with the scientific community. Research Mentor : Dr. Kari Clase, ABE, Pu rdue University ; Poster Number: 73b :: Life Sciences College of Engineering Discovery, Characterization, and Annotation of Two Novel Mycobacteriophages Author: Lauren Novak Abstract: Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and have the potentia l to replace current popular medical methods such as the use of antibiotics for bacterial infections. It is estimated that there are 1031 bacteriophages in the biosphere; however, only a small portion has been discovered and an even smaller portion have th eir genomes annotated. In the fall of 2017, the Mycobacteriophage GreenWhale was isolated from a soil sample near the Engineering Fountain on Purdue University's Campus in West Lafayette, IN. GreenWhale was further purified, amplified, and imaged. TEM imag ing of GreenWhale showed that it has a long tail (approximately 265 nm), thus belonging to the morphotype Siphoviridae. Due to time limitations, GreenWhale was not sequenced because the titer was 1.2 x 109 pfu/ml which is not high enough for genomic sequen cing (> 5 x 109 pfu/ml). However, potential future experiments that could be performed include testing to see if the phage infects more than one type of bacteria, characterizing the genome using restriction enzyme digest, and performing a lysogeny test. In the spring semester of 2019, the Mycobacteriophage Kanye was adopted from Brown University for annotation of its genome (titer = 2.6 x 1010 pfu/ml). Kanye was discovered in 2014 in Providence, RI, belongs to phage cluster E and morphotype Siphoviridae, and has approximately 140 genes in its genome. DNA annotation software DNA Master, and other online genomic tools such as PECAAN, Starterator, and Phamerator were used to annotate the start sites and functions of the genes in Kanye's genome and compare it to other already annotated genomes. While there are some gene functions that are found in all phage genomes, Kanye's genome contains a variety of gene functions that are distinct to cluster E. The annotation of bacteriophage genomes is important because it further develops our understanding about protein diversity, deepens our knowledge about how evolution has differentiated different bacteriophage genomes, and allows us to explore how bacteriophage functions can be used in other areas of science.

Current traffic mapping of vehicles and pedestrians is limited to human observation, and the range and accuracy of this data is unreliable. A robust and accurate tracking method was developed for mapping object tr ajectories, involving a Regional Convolutional Neural Network (R -CNN) combined with a tracker. The objects identified by the detector (R -CNN) are passed to a tracker, GOTURN, which predicts their motion in the following frames. Additionally, parameters suc h as time, position, depth, and movement changes were extracted from the tracking data. As a result, we were able to map the movements of several people and characterize certain demographic information. The current tracker can be used to detect groups of p eople in each frame based on their relative speed and make use of this data for further developments in prediction of pathways.

This work tests the immunity of a Class -D Audio Amplifier which uses the Texas Instruments TPA3122D2 integrated circuit and its output signal performance and integrity when exposed to controlled electric field source was investigated. This study was conducted to determine the best PCB layout practices for digital switching circuits that operate at high frequencies which would lead to better EMC design practices. Two different testing solutions were adopted. First, a high intensity E -field near -field probe was designed and constructed and applied to different points on the printed circuit board of the amplifier. Next , the amplifier was exposed to other sources of relatively high intensity E -fields (cell -phones and Wi -Fi routers). Finally, E -Field intensities and output signal distortion were measured using calibrated near -field probes, a spectrum analyzer, and an osci lloscope. The result indicated that as the intensity of the E -field increased, the signal integrity of the integrated circuit of the Amplifier was affected and the signal output of the Amplifier was severely distorted. The cell phone and router caused no n oticeable changes. The Class -D amplifier seemed to be immune to the cell phone and router's electromagnetic emission.

There is an increasing number of applications that drones are being used for. With facial recognition, drones ca n be used for security purposes and many other important applications. For our drone specifically, a Pixhawk controller is used for the flight control and stability. The Pixhawk controls the attitude, and also enables the drone to follow pre -mapped routes. A wireless telemetry system is used to get first person view video from the drone, and to display flight information. The drone is flown primarily using the remote control but can also be operated from the mission planner application on a PC. In order to do image processing and object recognition, a Raspberry Pi controller is attached to the drone and serves as a slave computer that communicates to the Pixhawk via MavProxy. The Raspberry Pi runs an algorithm that identifies an object through the camera and tracks this object by keeping the object within a specified pixel range. To keep the drone positioned over the object, the Raspberry Pi sends commands to the Pixhawk controller through a serial port. The Raspberry Pi will be running an openCV library in o rder to access the necessary software. This technology is becoming very prevalent in our society today in both the private and public sectors. Bringing autonomous abilities to this quadcopter opens up limitless possibilities for the interaction of human an d machine and allows further exploration into this realm of technology.

We conducted content analysis on institution catalogues using Nvivo and investigated on the core courses required in engineering first year curricula. In addition, we investigated the different probation policies and compared them across different institutions. We hypothesized that as time has progressed, colleges have better refined and specified their policies and catalogs, generally in such a way that has led to higher academic standards. We also expected to see an increase in the required math and science courses as the yea rs went on. However, when we examined the data, there were more complex relationships than we had originally predicted. In conclusion, across multiple years, there is not much of a difference, but across colleges, more definitive trends can be observed.

Cities in areas where the temperature often is below 32 degrees Fahrenheit have a significantly harder time with po tholes. As water is trapped within cracks, it expands as it freezes and ultimately results in larger cracks and potholes on the roads. Current pothole detection methods are expensive and are not used enough to be effective. We are working on a small, cost effective system to attach to the backs of regular cars that can autonomously detect the locations and severity of potholes. Rather than have large, expensive vehicles that may only check a road once every three years, attaching a small and cheap device t o regular cars can provide near continuous monitoring of roads. The current system in place requires the use of vehicles with advanced systems that can detect potholes and relay accurate location and depth information on potholes. Unfortunately, these vehi cles can cost millions of dollars, and the extreme accuracy of their systems is not a necessity when it comes to pothole detections. Our system aims to reduce the price of a pothole detection system significantly by only utilizing technology necessary to s imply detect the locations and severity of potholes rather than relay extremely accurate information about the pothole itself. Deep learning is used in analyzing the data provided by the depth sensor in deciding the severity of the potholes. Upon detecting a pothole, our system will report it to the city so that it may be fixed in a timely manner. Ultimately, this will result in a decrease in the severity of potholes and the amount of time they are on the road.

The agent also needs to build troops and choose proper strategies to attack and destroy other agents' troops and base. In order to accomplish these goals, we programmed certain actions and limitations for the agent. The reward functions we programmed which will tell the agent the correct actions to take also give proper commands and constraints to the agent. We also trained with the \"computer players\", which is the agents controlled by the game itself to collect proper da ta set. Nevertheless, the agent we trained right now only has the limited ability which may not lead to the final goal. Thus, using Reinforcement Learning for Real Time Strategy Game offers a challenge for the programmer who studies the Reinforcement Learn ing and gives the programmer a brand new working experience which may be implemented during future working and learning circumstances. Research Mentor : Guang Lin, Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering ; Poster Number: 83b :: Life Sciences College of Engineering A Visual Analytics Approach to Detect Discontinuities of Movement Author: Feidi Xie Abstract: A wide range of applications use object movement analysis to improve decision making. This project focuses on the discontinuities of movement trends. Movement discontinuity is a common phenomenon in real world such as when obstacles (e.g., buildings, mountains) prevent objects from proceeding or when obstacles prevent monitoring devices from receiving movement signals . Identifying such discontinuity helps decision makers in planning for alternative strategies. For example, to improve public safety, supplementary surveillance devices are installed at areas where tracking signals are blocked. This project presents an approach to identify areas that cause potential discontinuity of object movement trends. Movement discontinuities are more likely to occur at disjoint areas that have fewer or no data records but are spatially close to logged movement records. In addition, th e movement trends in these disjoint regions are coherent, e.g., they follow similar directions. Therefore, the approach proposed in this project includes three parts. First, we outline spatial regions with dense movement records. We use one contour to vis ualize areas with dense records and a second contour to expand areas of the first contour to contain locations that have no or sparse data. Areas between the two contours have sparse data but are approximate to dense movement locations. Second, we use traj ectory clustering methods to find representative trajectories that describe movement directions and locations in detail. Finally, we use visualization techniques to highlight areas not only outlined by two contours but also connected by representative traj ectories. Thus, possible areas with movement discontinuities are presented to the end users for further verification. Research Mentor : Guizhen Wang, ECE, College of Engineering, ; Poster Number: 84b :: Mathematical/Computational Scie nces College of Abstract: The visualization of Earth History is a very wide team that creates and manages a line of software and cloud solutions that aid scientists and geologists around the world in their research by providing them tools necessary for their research. Currently, the team is split into different subteams, one of which is working on improving the memory and data storage eff iciency of our website. Another team is currently working on data mining, and another one working to add more functionality to the Time scale creator(name of our tools) web version. For the team that is adding more functionality to the website, we are work ing on the function of creating a data package and share that package to the cloud. When a user uploads a graph including the information about geology over different time periods, the user can add timeline manually on that graph and our program will read the information of those time periods automatically, then creating a package including the data in the graph. After the user hit the button \"send to cloud\", this package will be uploaded to TSCloud, and the user can have this package for later usage. The d ata mining subteam is working on creating new ways to visualize geologic data. For example, one new functionality being developed will allow a user to view the rates at which a certain data column is changing over an interval that the user inputs. Data tak en from this operation will then be examined by an algorithm that looks for periodic cycles in this particular dataset, and analyzes other sets parallel to this main set to find correlations between different types of data. Then, once this data is processe d, it will be sent to a plotting subroutine which will section the data off into individual points, and then plot them on the visual display. This has exciting possibilities for scientists and educators who wish to use this tool, as it will allow them to cross reference datasets such as levels of greenhouse gasses or tectonic activity with extinction events or population booms, and will also allow them to easily view and display periodic processes in the Earth's history. For the team that is working on imp roving the memory and data storage efficiency of our website, the goals are monitoring the stability, and the cause of the crashes, sending notifications when system encounters a problem, and few other minor tasks. Currently the team is focusing on monitor ing the stability, and the cause of the crashes. There are two major crashes. One is inside docker container, checking whether application/server is running, which is our priority, and the other one is simply checking if the docker is running or not. The method used to monitor crash is to create a new bash script inside docker container by using the terminal vim editor and somehow get it done so that it can check if the application (node app.js)/server.sh is running or not. It will also check whether disk a nd memory monitors are on or not. Then, in order to visualize it on website, a JavaScript program must be made to visualize what we have in bash script. In both cases, whenever the server/application is offline, the program will automatically turn them on. Also, as the program is run in the docker, we need to make a file outside the docker to make sure the docker is on. We will also use the same method as the server monitor. As the future improvement, we will add the email notification function into the system so that it could notify the developer who is in charge of the server that the system had some problem need to be fixed. Research Mentor : Andy Khan ; Poster Number: 85b :: Life Sciences College of Health and Human Sciences The Status of Complement Cascade Activation in Human Epilepsy Author: Zoe Carlson -Stadler Abstract: Rationale: Individuals with refractory epilepsy have drug -resistant seizures. Currently, surgical resection of the seizure focal point remains the next treatm ent option for refractory epilepsy, but not all patients are candidates. Thus, our objective is to identify novel therapeutic targets focusing on neuroimmune interactions. Histopathological features of drug -resistant epilepsy include a decline in synaptode ndritic elements and neurons, along with microgliosis. Through characterizations in brain samples from human refractory epilepsy we previously reported alterations in complement proteins C1q and C3. These proteins are associated with the regulation of infl ammatory and phagocytic responses, and with microglial dendritic and synaptic pruning in neurodegenerative disorders. In this study we further investigated the status of immune complement activation (C1q, C3, and C5) in a larger pool of brain samples from patients with refractory epilepsy, and their correlation with the levels of the synaptic protein PSD95. Methods: Western Blot analysis was done on brain tissue resected from humans with Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) (n=17) and human tissue from non -epilep tic patients (n=5) with antibodies against complements C1q, C3, and C5, along with PSD95. Results: Results from the western blot showed a significant correlation between the protein levels of C3 and C5 (p<0.0001), as well as between C3 and PSD95 (p=0.076). However, there was no significant correlation between proteins C1q and C5 (p=0.1085) and between C1q and C3 (p=0.5165). Conclusion: Based on these results, we speculate that the significant increase in complement proteins C3 and C5 may play a role in the synaptic structural changes in epilepsy. Mechanistic studies are currently underway to determine the role of complement proteins in pathological synaptic remodeling in epilepsy.

Although there are several evidence -based treatments for children with ASD, the variability in symptomatol ogy across the spectrum entails that each child responds to therapeutic approaches differently. Therefore, it is unclear which treatment may be most effective for each child. A future approach to ASD intervention includes the implementation of precision me dicine techniques, which will inform the types and intensities of interventions that may be most efficacious for individual children. The objective of this paper is to explore the behavioral characteristic of manual object exploration, defined as the use o f the hands (e.g., grasping, banging, shaking, rotating) to manipulate toys or objects, as a potential predictor of treatment response in infants and toddlers with ASD. To investigate this topic, a literature review of research examining predictors of trea tment response in ASD early intervention was conducted. Findings from an emerging body of research suggests that manual object exploration may be a valuable variable to include as a potential treatment predictor, and that targeting object exploration may b e an important first step in improving outcomes of children with ASD. However, there is a lack of standardization across study designs and more research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of object exploration and other child variables as predictors of treatment response for young children with ASD. Such research will enable clinicians and families to select treatments more efficiently, leading to better outcomes for each child and more productive use of time, energy, and resources. Research Mentor : Brandon Keehn, Speech, Language & Hearing Sciences, College of Health and Human Sciences ; Poster Number: 87b :: Social Sciences/Humanities College of Health and Human Sciences Relationships Between Free Speech and P rejudice Author: Jacob Cole Abstract: Prior research has shown that individuals who hold prejudiced attitudes toward Black people use free speech as a justification for the acceptability of racist rhetoric. Is such \"free speech justification\" unique to high- prejudice people? Or do people with low -prejudice attitudes also use the first amendment to justify inflammatory speech directed at racist people? Undergraduate research participants whose attitudes toward Blacks ranged from relatively low to high in prejudice viewed various social media posts and recorded impressions. After our critical post, which either included inflammatory racist rhetoric or inflammatory anti -racist rhetoric, participants rated the extent to which they endorsed free speech and the extent to which they personally agreed with the post (i.e., ideological symmetry). Results replicated past findings for justifying racist rhetoric with free speech among high -prejudiced participants when compared to low -prejudiced participants. This effec t was not mediated by ideological symmetry. In addition, low -prejudiced participants invoked free speech to justify anti -racist but not racist rhetoric, and this effect was mediated by ideological symmetry. These findings contribute to understanding contem porary polarization based on ideological symmetry and justifications.

A pre -post survey, or Medium Term Survey (MTS), is used t o determine participant behavior change as a result of the program. The objective of the present study was to determine the short -term (4 -10 weeks) and long -term (1 year) reliability of the Indiana SNAP -Ed MTS. Methods: Data for this secondary analysis was from an RCT evaluation of Indiana SNAP -Ed. SNAP -Ed-eligible adults (18yrs) living in Indiana and interested in receiving nutrition education (n=62) were recruited from 2015 -2016. Short -term and long -term test -retest reliability of the 17 pre - and post -test items on the Indiana SNAP -Ed MTS was determined using Spearman correlations. MTS pre -test results from the control group who did not receive SNAP -Ed were compared with post -test results collected 4 -10 weeks (short -term) later and 1 year (long -term) late r respectively. Analyses were completed using SAS 9.4. Results: The Indiana SNAP -Ed MTS demonstrated poor test -retest reliability with correlation coefficients of 0.4 to 0.6 in 15 items over the short -term (p<0.05) and correlation coefficients of 0.3 to 0.7 in 11 items over the long-term study period (p<0.05) among Indiana SNAP -Ed-eligible adults who did not receive the SNAP -Ed intervention (n=62). Significance level was set at p0.05. Conclusions: Among Indiana SNAP -Ed-eligible adults, the Indiana SNAP -Ed MTS is not a reliable survey instrument to assess nutrition -related behaviors over a short -term or long -term time period. Further research is needed to develop reliable survey items to conduct program evaluation.

The US government have taken a supply -reduction approach to tackle this public health crisis by increasing the restrictions to access opioid prescriptions and strengthening law enforcement against the illicit market. However, this one -sided punitive approach has indirectly turned dependent users to more harmful drugs such as fentanyl. This public health issue needs an integrative policy that includes prevention, treatment, and education. One alternative strategy has been spreading globally to reduce the harms associated with drug use. Harm reduction strategies are shown to decrease infectious dise ases and overdose rates, but implementation and evaluation of these programs face many challenges. This project aims to develop a tool that will inform future research questions for researchers and provide insight for policymakers. The disorder prevalence and death rates from 1990 to 2017 based on the country's status of harm reduction implementation will be compared using data visualization tool Tableau. We anticipate the resulting interactive visualization will show changes in opioid use disorder and the availability of harm reduction strategies in a global context. Research Mentor : Vetria L. Byrd Department of Computer Graphics Technology Purdue Polytechnic Institute ; Poster Number: 90b :: Social Sciences/Humanities College of Heal th and Human Sciences Peer Deviance, Adolescent Substance Use and The Moderating Role of Parental Monitoring Author: Shuyu Gao Emily Rolan Nayantara Nair Kristine parental monitoring (Barnes et al., 2006; Kiesner et al., 2010) and associating with deviant peers (Bahr et al., 2005; Barnes et al., 2006) has been linked to adolescents' substance use. Studies examining parenting and peers together typically assess whether low monitoring has an effect on substance use through increasing youths' ability to engage with deviant peers (Dishion et al., 2004; Pires & Jenkins, 2007). Fewer studies have investigated how these two factors interact to influence adolescent substance use, but suggest that the effect of peer deviance is stronger for y outh experiencing less monitoring (Kiesner et al., 2010). The current study extends this work by examining mothers and fathers and older and younger siblings separately. We hypothesized that peer deviance would be more strongly associated with adolescent s ubstance use when parental monitoring is low. Utilizing data from 395 families (father, mother, older sibling and younger sibling) from the US -based Nonshared Environmental in Adolescent Development study (NEAD; Neiderhiser et al., 2007), we ran a series o f hierarchical regressions testing interactions of parental monitoring and peer deviance predicting adolescent substance use. For younger siblings, the effect of peer deviance was strongest when maternal monitoring was low ( = .07, p = .036). However, con trary to our hypothesis, for older siblings, the effect of peer deviance was strongest when paternal monitoring was high ( = -.13, p = .001). Results indicate that for younger siblings with highly deviant peers, maternal monitoring plays a protective role , but for older siblings monitoring may be too restrictive and exacerbate risk associated with deviant peers.

This is important due to the increasing cases of radiological threats and terrorism with nuclear material. To assess nuclear security culture levels at a university, a survey was deployed and completed by 3,336 students and personnel. The survey contained a total of 12 questions and was divided into three categories: General Awareness, University Specific Awareness, and Behavior Response Awareness. Members were classified using a variety of demographics such as age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, work category, an d degree. Responses were evaluated using a variety of statistical methods that indicated which of the demographics affected a survey taker's response. The results of the survey evaluation using Chi -square showed that the demographic values chosen are depen dent or related. The ANOVA Regression for General Awareness demonstrates that age, gender, nationality, and ethnicity have statistical significance in regards to the mean scores of survey responses. The School Specific Awareness ANOVA Regression indicates that work status, nationality, and gender showed significant differences in the mean score of responses. The ANOVA Regression for Behavior Response Awareness were only significant for age, degree, and gender in the mean score of responses. The results sugg est that nuclear security cultural awareness across all areas is most affected by age and gender, meaning that these categories have the most significance in determining the overall awareness confidence of nuclear security culture.

Individual differences in working memory capacity and general fluid intelligence are positively correlated with success on these tests, but research on how and why test -takers make mistakes is limited. The current research explored item -level performance on a frequently used number series test, focusing on the incorrect choices subjects made if they selected an incorrect response option. We also analyzed self -report strategies that test -takers used, specifically constructive matching and response elimination. A large sample of young adults from three universities completed working memory tasks, number series, and a retrospective strategy questionnaire. Working memory was correlated with number series performance, as expected, but only weakly correlated with number series strategy use . Individuals self -reporting higher use of a constructive matching strategy got more items correct on number series, and those self -reporting higher use of response elimination got fewer items correct on number series. Number series items varied in success rates, and on specific items, individuals were likely to pick a specific incorrect item. The strategy and error results suggest that, similar to other reasoning tests, the relationship between working memory and number series is accounted for general control processes.

This aggressive type of breast cancer also has a high mortality rate for the se women. It was observed that the enzyme CYP7B1 could be associated with the survival outcomes of TNBC. The more deficient the enzyme is the more aggressive the cancer. When comparing TNBC to Luminal -A breast cancer (LABC), a less aggressive type of breas t cancer, LABC shows presence of this enzyme. Currently we are studying this comparison by perform western blots to find the prevalence on several breast cancer cell lines in African American women. For future research, we will observe the differences betw een rats with TNBC that have and do not have the CYP7B1 enzyme present. This enzyme could be a potential marker for predicting outcomes of aggressive breast cancer in African American women as well as developing pharmaceutical methods for assisting in depr essing the cancer.

Therefore, it is difficult to develop therapeutic treatments for various neurodegenerative diseases because there are currently not many tools available to track the damage of neurodegeneration. Our goal, is to develop a red fluorescent biosensor that monitors endosomal pH activity in live -cells that can be imaged by measuring the ratiometric change in fluorescence of our fluorescent protein \"tag\" through endocytosis. This will allow us to answer questions regarding receptor membrane activity, signaling of the receptor once it is engulfed into an endosome, and to what extent pH is a determining factor. In our experiment, we use two different FPs to track the membrane receptor -ligand, SpyTag -SpyCatcher, pathway post -endosomal integration. The benefits associated with using pr eviously studied SpyTag -SpyCatcher is that it has been shown to be biologically compatible with membrane surface proteins post -translationally, and without the use of synthetic dyes. Furthermore, the use of the SpyTag would eliminate the need to add an FP to the N -terminus of the membrane receptor and risk disrupting its functionality. The interaction between SpyTag and SpyCatcher is non -covalent and non -reversible which is advantageous to tracking the cellular biological processes unconcerned about weak in teractions being severed. Our biosensor is a protein, which makes it easy to produce and isolate, and is more easily recognizable when implemented in cells. The development of our sensor using a red FP opens the optical window for dual imaging with other s ensors and will hopefully give us more insight, in vivo, into the biochemical changes that influence neurodegeneration.

Additionally, the multitude of unique experiences facing National Guard members, such as social isolation and transitions within civilian employment, can have significant impacts on mental health. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of PTSD and depressive symptomology on commitment to military service. We addressed this goal using data from 129 National Guard service members three months (Time 1) and eight -months (Time 2) following deployment. We used three organiz ational commitment scales to measure service members' commitment to their military job: affective commitment (the \"want\" to continue), continuance commitment (the \"need\" to continue), and normative commitment (the \"ought\" to continue). Multiple regression analyses tested whether mental health symptomology significantly predicted different aspects of service members' commitment to the military. We found that Time 1 PTSD symptomology significantly predicted Time 2 continuance commitment (=.22, p<.05), but dr opped from significance when we controlled for Time 1 continuance commitment. We did not find a significant association between Time 1 PTSD symptomology and Time 2 affective commitment. The association between Time 1 PTSD symptomology and Time 2 normative commitment also was not significant. Furthermore, there was no significant association between Time 1 depressive symptoms and the three types of commitment at Time 2. Our results indicate that the \"need\" to continue service in the military when PTSD sympt omology is present might demonstrate the influence of financial and medical benefits within the military.

EC is now available over -the-counter for individuals 18 years and older; however, women living in Italy continue to face knowledge and access barriers. Conscientious objection, where providers and pharmacists refuse to prescribe or dispense EC due to personal beliefs, further complicate s access and dissemination. Objective: The purpose of the current paper is to understand EC knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among women living in Italy. Additionally, a secondary purpose is to explore the impact of the 2015 EC policy. Methods: Thirty in-person interviews were conducted among women living in or around Florence, aged 18 to 50 years, and using the Italian healthcare system at the time of study enrollment. Researchers used an expanded grounded theory approach to understand women's experien ces with EC with diffusion of innovations serving as a conceptual lens for data analysis. HyperRESEARCH, a data management system, assisted with open and axial coding and theme development. Results: Women described low observability of the 2015 policy, exp ressing surprise regarding increased EC availability. Participants suggested increased messaging in strategic locations to overcome this barrier. Participants held both positive and negative attitudes toward EC. While some perceived the relative advantage of EC compared with unintended pregnancy, others expressed concerns about irresponsibility and EC safety. Finally, conscientious objection impacted healthcare access, despite participant desire for autonomous EC decision -making, suggesting support for incr eased EC access despite provider barriers. Discussion: Findings offer practical recommendations to guide EC messaging in Italy to increase women's knowledge and to empower women's access. Additionally, opportunities for communication strategies and access campaigns to improve attitudes and increase knowledge and uptake of over -the-counter EC are discussed. Research Mentor : Andrea L.

Whereas some studies have found a positive association between religion and SWB (Emmons, Cheung, & Tehrani, 1998; e.g., Eryilmaz, 2015 ), other studies found that religiosity did not always benefit people's SWB (e.g., Barber, 2012; Snoep, 2008). Our study aims to find an explanation for this gap based on social norm theories. Social norm theories postulate that culturally normative behavi or or thoughts increases SWB. We hypothesized that religiosity will be related to greater SWB only when religious individuals belong to the majority religious denomination (e.g. Christianity in the United States). We used data collected by the World Values Survey (WVS), which consists of nationally representative surveys measuring an individuals` attitudes and beliefs towards political, cultural, economic, civic beliefs, and other aspects of life. We composited three items in WVS, i.e., life satisfaction, h appiness, and health, as the measure for SWB for a more comprehensive measure. SWB of the majority religious denomination and minority religious denomination (e.g., Islam in the United States) was analyzed and compared using regression models. Results supp orted our hypothesis that only identification with majority religious denomination was related with greater SWB. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of how religious beliefs relate to an individual's SWB. Research Mentor : Viola (Xiaofang) Zheng, Psychological Sciences, Health and Human Sciences ; None Poster Number: 99b :: Social Sciences/Humanities College of Health and Human Sciences Are they too young? Views about community and community change from young adolescents. Author: Jim Kanani Abstract: Background: Youth civic engagement has been found to promote youth development by enhancing awareness of personal potential and sense of community responsibility, and deterring health -diminishing behaviors such as substance use. Although, efforts have succ essfully engaged youth in community -level work, these tend to focus on older adolescents, consequently, limiting younger children's access to opportunities to showcase their potential as change agents. In this qualitative study we explore how young adolesc ents define community, their perspectives related to community issues and challenges faced by youth, their ideas to address these challenges, and their barriers to engaging in community change efforts. Methods: Youth ages 11 -13 (n = 39, Mage = 12.1, SD = 1.12, 51.2% male) from low -income families who attended a summer sports camp participated in semi -structured interviews (20 -40 minutes) that were thematically analyzed. Results: Youth -reported narrativ es defined community as a place where people bond and feel accepted and protected. Youth described poverty, crime, and substance use as pressing community issues and peer conflict and school pressures as issues youth in their community face. Youth offered ideas to address the challenges they identified including fundraising and bringing people together. They also spoke of barriers that prevented them from engaging in or believing in their ability to create change such as feeling devalued, dismissed by adults, and not having opportunities to engage in change efforts. Conclusion: The findings suggest that young adolescents are aware of and interested in participating in community change efforts. Given the evidence that youth civic engagement can lead to both community and individual -level benefits, efforts should be made to develop activities and programs that enable younger children to gain the skills needed for civic engagement. These findings can inform development of evidence - based strategies focused on p romoting younger children's involvement in civic engagement.

Copper homeostasis is dually important for optimal health. Excess copper has been associated wi th minor symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and memory loss as well as with neurological disorders such as Wilson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and some cancers in humans. Similarly, excess copper has been shown to damage visceral organs and produce abno rmal behaviors in multiple fish species including the zebrafish who has a high degree of genome sequence homology when compared to humans. For this reason, the zebrafish is an advantageous model for the study of copper toxicity. In this study, we assessed survival, behavioral alterations, and morphological changes in developing zebrafish. We hypothesized that zebrafish exposed to higher levels of copper during embryogenesis would show signs of increased physiological and behavioral stress. To test this hypo thesis, zebrafish embryos were obtained through natural spawning and exposed to a control or one of three experimental groups: 13ppb, 130ppb or 1300ppb (current regulatory concentration in US drinking water) copper. Fish were exposed through 120 hours post fertilization (hpf). Survival was assessed every 24 h and behavioral analysis was performed at 120 hpf using the DanioVision chamber and EthoVision software. Copper caused mortality at 1300ppb and decreased time spent moving as well as decreased countercl ockwise rotation frequency at 130ppb (p<0.05). Developmental exposure to copper produces dysfunctional locomotor behavior and mortality at concentrations lower than regulatory concentration in US drinking water.

In the present study, we sought to understand the differences in medication use and how usage differs by age in three NGS popul ations: Angelman hypothesize that the number of medications utilized between the NGS groups will vary significantly, with PWS demonstrating the most use due to early intervention strategies that emp hasize medication. We also hypothesize that there will be significantly more medication usage in older participants than younger due to developing or worsening symptomologies. Participants included 98 children (AS=35; WS=34; PWS=29), aged 6 -58 months, with currently reported medication use. All participants of the sample are enrolled in the Purdue Early Phenotype Survey, a longitudinal study examining early development in NGS populations. Preliminary statistical analyses suggest that PWS and AS show signifi cantly more medication use than WS. There is a significant correlation between age and medications specific for medical issues, both overall and within each NGS group.

T his study addresses the lack of literature surrounding medication patterns in NGS populations, providing comparisons of medication usage and trends related to age among these NGS groups.

Instead of having a word that means simply \"blue\" and using \"dark\" and \"light\" for different shades of the color, the Russian language has two completely different words: \"siniy\" means dark blue and \"goluboi\" means light blue. These words are not used interchangeably by native Russian speakers and are used differently for imagery and symbolism in literature. The purpose of this study is to collect and analyze the usage of \"si niy\" and \"goluboi\" in Russian literature to see whether there is significance difference between how these two words are used by Russian classical authors and how this differs from using the word \"blue\" in English. Additionally, we will be looking at the u sage of synonyms of these two words in Russian. The author chosen to specifically analyze is Pushkin, who is considered by many to be the greatest Russian poet in Russian literature. This research is currently in process, and we hope to have analyzed all o f Pushkin's poetry by the end of the project and analyzed all the different ways that the two different colors of \"blue\" are used.

Despite its theoretical importance, recent studies have found no evidence l inking socioeconomic status (SES) to infant sleep (Tomalski et al., 2016; Tomalski et al., 2013). However, prenatal maternal anxiety has been found to predict sleep problems in infants (O'Connor et al., 2007). The purpose of the present study was to determ ine whether SES emerged as a predictor of infant sleep in the context of maternal prenatal stress. Specifically, we examined: whether (1) SES and maternal prenatal stress were independently associated with infant sleep, and (2) the effect of SES on infant sleep depended on levels of prenatal maternal stress. We hypothesized that higher maternal prenatal stress and lower SES would be associated with poorer infant sleep, and that for mothers who report higher levels of prenatal stress, the association between SES and infant sleep would be stronger. Using data drawn from a pilot study (N = 16), regression analyses revealed that higher SES was associated with a higher number of minutes spent awake (d = .70), and higher maternal prenatal stress was associated wit h more time spent awake (d = .12), but there was no interaction effect. Our results suggest that both SES and prenatal maternal stress are linked to infant sleep independently. These are preliminary findings based on exploratory analyses; future research s hould examine these associations in a larger sample.

The ketogenic diet (KD), characterized by high fat and low carbohydrates, is a rising nutrition trend tha t many believe promotes fat loss and weight loss. Previous research has primarily focused on KD -induced ketosis and its effects on fat loss. However, the relationship between caloric intake during ketosis and effects on body composition is not well underst ood. Due to the high intensity, zero -calorie nature of non -nutritive sweeteners (NNS), NNS is commonly used in conjunction with KD because normal sugars are carbohydrates, and can compromise the ketogenic state. Therefore, we investigated the effect of adm inistering the NNS sucralose or the caloric sweetener sucrose along with a KD on weight gain and caloric intake. Adult male Sprague -Dawley rats were given a KD paired with either plain, sucralose - (0.01mg/g), or sucrose - (15%) sweetened Crisco for 7 weeks . We measured body weight, beta -hydroxybutyrate levels, food intake, and body composition along with an oral glucose tolerance test. The results indicated that there were no differences in weight gain or body fat across groups. Beta -hydroxybutyrate levels were similarly elevated compared to baseline in all groups and oral glucose tolerance responses were similar across groups. Animals given sucrose - sweetened Crisco consumed more grams of Crisco compared to plain or sucralose - sweetened Crisco, but fewer gr ams of the KD; no difference in total caloric intake were observed across groups. These results suggest that addition sucralose or low quantities of sucrose to a KD does not significantly affect body weight, body composition or glucose tolerance in male ra ts. Research Mentor : Susan E. Swithers, Department of Psychological Sciences, HHS ; Poster Number: 106b :: Life Sciences College of Health and Human Sciences Is There Greater Lactose Intolerance in Women? Author: Rebecca Lapides Abstract: Relevant literature has suggested that women perceive lactose intolerance (LI) and avoid lactose -containing products at a higher rate than males. Lactose -containing foods are ideal sources of essential nutrients such as fat-soluble vitamins and cal cium, so individuals who avoid lactose do not reap these nutritional benefits. This emphasizes the importance of investigating whether women actually experience more LI symptoms than men. The primary study aim was to determine if women and men who are lact ose maldigesters, perceive milk intolerance and avoid dairy foods experience different levels of symptoms when fed equivalent amounts of lactose in milk based on their body weights. This was a dose -controlled, single intervention study. Participants were asked to consume commercially available milk with a fat content of 2%. The milk was fed for breakfast following a 12 -hour overnight fast. Each subject was fed milk containing 0.5g lactose per kg of body weight. This study utilized baseline data from an ong oing randomized control trial that compares lactose digestion and tolerance to milks containing different genetic variants of beta -casein. A Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was performed to compare the peak and total symptom scores for each symptom between gende rs; as well as to compare the total symptom scores between genders. The results were that for each comparison measure, there was strong evidence to support that there is no difference in LI symptoms experienced between genders when body weight is accounted for by the dose.

Unfortunately, patients who are diagnosed with metastatic disease in distant organs suffer worst progression -free survival. Previously, we have developed a covalent inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, FIIN4, that prolongs the survival of mice with metastatic breast cancer. Mechanistically, FIIN4 treatment leads to increased infiltration of cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) which are expected to target and kill cancer cells in pulmonary metastatic tumors. However, the effects of FIIN4 on the antitumor function of CTLs remains unknown. Our preliminary data show that FIIN4 inhibits the functio n of CTLs both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we hypothesize that FIIN4 has off-target effects against the T -cell signaling pathway which subsequently affects CTL function. We have compared the levels of various adaptor proteins in drug -treated versus untreat ed Jurkat T cells following T cell receptor activation via immunoblot analyses. These experiments suggest that FIIN4 inhibits tyrosine -protein kinase Lck which plays a key role in T -cell signaling. In future experiments, we will evaluate whether FIIN4 treatment affects the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in Jurkat T cells via ELISA and flow cytometry. Our study may unveil the molecular mechanisms of the observed decrease in T cell function with FIIN4. This knowledge may facilitate the design of nove l therapeutics to better treat metastatic breast cancer patients in the future.

Personal finance experiences of Purdue alumni and advice for current undergraduate students Author: Andi Long Abstract: Undergraduate students in the United States typically lack the necessary money management skills to keep up with their personal finances and meet their current and future financial goals (Lusardi and Mit chell 2014; Lusardi et al. 2010). This has long -term negative consequences on wealth, savings, retirement preparedness, and other important economic outcomes. I conducted a survey of 400 alumni of Purdue's College of Health and Human Sciences and found tha t alumni have learned from their experience as college students and have valuable insights for current students. Specifically, they recommend that current students acquire additional knowledge about personal finance than they themselves had when they were at Purdue. Purdue's core curriculum does not include any economics, finance, or personal finance classes (Office of the Provost at Purdue University, \"Welcome to Purdue's Undergraduate Outcomes -based Core Curriculum\", 2018) and as a result only 15% of resp ondents voluntarily took a course on personal finance that was not required in their plan of study. Yet, in my survey 94% recommend that all current students take additional personal finance courses (Figure 1). In addition, only 50% of alumni indicated the y had a general knowledge of basic retirement savings vehicles upon graduation, but an overwhelming 95% advise current undergraduate students to be familiar in this area of personal finance. The evidence indicates that alumni have financial knowledge from which current students can benefit. In consequence, personal finance training of students could leverage the experiences of alumni to help students gain a more stable financial footing post -graduation.

Author: Christine Medin Abstract: The purpos e of this study is to analyze microbial preferences to wheat bran and its impact on metabolite production, which is dependent on food matrix size and accessibility. Prior results suggest that gut microbial species favoring smaller wheat bran particle sizes will elicit higher levels of propionic short chain fatty acid following fermentation, while species that favor larger particle sizes synthesize more butyric acid \u2014a preferred energy substrate of colonocytes. In our lab, fecal samples from three individual donors were inoculated with buffer and exposed to 180 -250 m, 300 -500 m and 1000 -1700 m wheat bran particle sizes over the course of a seven day fermentation cycle. Samples from day one and day seven were subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing, while only day seven samples succumbed to Gas Chromatography -Mass Spectrometry for global metabolites analysis. Samples from all seven days were subjected to short chain fatty acid analysis using Gas Chromatography. Findings substantiated that depending on preference to small, medium and/or large wheat bran particle sizes, colonic microbial species will produce different levels of short chain fatty acids and other metabolites. Advanced agricultural milling processes have developed more consistent, finer sizes of grains, which has improved the palatability and texture functionality of wheat bran. However, future studies in animal models \u2014and potentially humans \u2014may determine the physiological ramifications of selecting certain wheat bran particle sizes in foods, specifically from the perspective of colonic bacterial species, their fermentation metabolites and their role in human nutrition.

Physicians and other healthcare providers are under pressure to moderate the use of opioids for managing patients with chronic pain. When physicians and patients make decisions together (shared decision making, SDM), patients are more likely to adhere to the recommendations which may include the reductions of opioids and the use of alternative strategies such as diet, exercise, and orthopedics. We hypothesize that higher levels of SDM will be associated with reduction in the use of opioids, increase in use of OTC medications, and alternative approaches. I coded a sample of 20 transcripts of patient -physician interaction concerning the management of opi oids. I used an Excel coding template with indications of incremental, equivalent, and decremental amounts of opioids and OTC medications, as well as signs of other treatments such as non -opioid medicines, dietetics, surgery, or physical therapy. The preli minary results of the 19 cases found that 3 did not discuss about opioids, 5 lower or stopped the opioids, 7 where they gave in equal dosage, and 4 where they gave an increase.

Adolescence is a time of dynamic social experiences when children form their own social groups and lead independent social lives. This increase in social complexity compared to earlier stages of development makes it even more difficult for children with autism to fit in with their peers. Most of what we know about pragmatic language sk ills in adolescents with autism is based off standardized assessments and questionnaires. To improve interventions for pragmatic language, we first need to better understand communication processes within the contexts they occur. We examined the visual exp erience of children with autism in the first -person perspective and how this is related to their pragmatic skills. In this study we compare the interrelationship between pragmatic skills and visual experience in children with autism. Participants included 6 7-14 year -old children with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Participants were separated into two -person groups engaging in a question -answer game focusing on initiating conversations while wearing a head mounted camera. We coded for the duration of the conversation partner's hands, body, face, and eyes in the participant's visual field. Examining this may help us find the underlying mechanism of pragmatic deficiencies, as it has not been specifically studied in existing literature.

The present study provides further validation to FFOCI -SF by investigating the degree of overlap of self -report ratings o f FFOCI -SF, as well as ratings from a close friend. A total of 302 undergraduates completed FFOCI - SF, general personality measures and the information of a close friend to serve as an informant rater. One hundred thirty -five informants responded to the inv itation to participate in the study and completed ratings of their close friend on FFOCI -SF and measures of general personality.

Research Mentor : Dr. Douglas Samuel, Psychological Sciences, College of Health and Human Sciences ; Poster Number: 113b :: Life Sciences College of Health and Human Sc iences Evaluation of Harmane as a Potential (HCAs) are chemicals that are formed from reactions between amino acids, sugars, and creatine, whe n meat, pork, beef, fish, and poultry, are cooked at high temperatures. Harmane is one such HCA and a potential neurotoxin. It is found in cooked meat, roasted coffee beans and tobacco. Harmane accumulates in brain tissue and has been linked to neurologica l conditions such as essential tremor and Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we hypothesized that: harmane treatment would produce selective dopaminergic neurodegeneration. To test this hypothesis, we utilized C. elegans as a model organism. C. elegans is a u nique and simple model in terms of transparent body, GFP reporter strain, relatively low number of neurons and short lifespan. We observed morphological changes, such as, swollen neurons, dendrite breaks. Some worms also exhibited complete loss of neurons. The observed effects were dose -dependent. Mitochondrial viability (evaluated using Mitotracker red) exhibited significant decline, alongside reduced dopamine levels (as evaluated using 1 -nonanol repulsion assay). Overall results indicated significant symp tomatic overlap with PD pathology in terms of afflicted mitochondria, dopamine neurons and behavior. Considering the fact that < 10% cases of PD are familial in nature and in light of the preliminary findings, harmane should be further evaluated as a PD -relevant neurotoxin.

This form of treatment uses high doses of radiation to destroy cancer tissues and decrease tumor size, either given as an internal or external beam therapy. Accompanying the benefits of external radiation are side effects, including hair loss, fatigue, skin changes, shortness of brea th, and other changes in the tissue structure of the organ targeted. The purpose of this study is to test the ability of 3,3' -Diindolylmethane (DIM) to protect against the skin side effects of chest irradiation while still allowing radiation beams to treat the cancer. For this research study, a X -RAD 320 Precision X -ray was used to irradiate a mouse model aiming at the thoracic area. Test subjects were divided into a treatment and a control group. The mice from the treatment group received an intraperitonea l injection of DIM 30 minutes prior to irradiation. The control group only received irradiation without prior administration of the drug. Over a period of six weeks, mice were graded on the level of damage from 0 to 5, with 0 being no hair loss, and 5 bein g there is presence of skin tissue necrosis. Damage grade and time were graphed and critically analyzed, and results show the mice that received DIM treatment prior to irradiation experience less skin effects than those in the control group. These mice als o show sign of improvements such as hair growing back after having lost hair during the earlier weeks. These results are promising for using 3,3' - Diindolylmethane as a treatment for preventing severe radiation skin side effects in cancer patients.

Given the importance of EF to our lifelong health and wellbeing, identifying mechanisms underlying the development of EF could lead to better interventions. One promising factor is motor skills. Fine motor skills and EF are positively corre lated in 3 - to 6-year-olds (e.g., Oberer et al., 2017; MacDonald et al., 2016); however, it is unknown if this relation exists earlier. Therefore, our project explored EF and fine motor skills in 37 2 -year-olds (m=30.91mo; 14 girls; range=25 -35mo). Partici pants completed the Minnesota Executive Function Scale (MEFS) and the Fine Motor portion (FMQ) of the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale. The MEFS assesses EF (cognitive flexibility, inhibition, and working memory). The FMQ has two subtests: Grasping (whole -hand and finger grasping) and Visual Motor Integration (VMI; eye -hand coordination). To measure verbal IQ, parents identified the number of words children could produce (MacArthur -Bates Communicative Development Inventories). MEFS and FMQ were positively correlated (r=0.62, p=0.00) even when controlling for age (in mos) and verbal IQ (r=0.57, p=0.01). For the fine motor subtests, remained positively correlated with MEFS when verbal IQ (VMI: r=0.54, p=0.01; Grasping: r=0.25, p=0.26). These findings demonstrate a link between EF and visual - motor integration in 2 -year-olds. Future research should investigate how interventions focused on improvin g visual -motor integration impact EF development. Research Mentor : Laura J. Claxton, Health and Kinesiology, HHS ; Lucas J. Rooney, Health and Kinesiology, HHS Poster Number: 116b :: Life Sciences College of Health and Human Sciences Tracking the Oral Side Effects of Brain Irradiation in Mice With Magnetic Resonance Imaging Author: Elizabeth Roach Abstract: Typically, the goal of radiation therapy is to deliver doses in a precise manner to the tumor in order to prevent damage of heal thy surrounding tissue. While radiation is proven to be wildly successful in the destruction of tumors, the side effects and injury to adjacent tissue can lead to lifelong morbidity. When it comes to head and neck cancers, one tissue of concern is the jaw area. The aim of this study is to discover the root cause of the damage and develop techniques to prevent or lessen the side effects of radiation in the mandible area. Our first experiments included five BALB/cNHsd female mice aged seven to eight weeks rad iated in a 5 x 5 millimeter area between the cerebellum and eye using an X -Rad 320. Amifostine, an approved radioprotectant drug, was injected intraperitoneally 30 minutes prior to irradiation, at doses of either 0, 100, or 200 mg/kg. The study was blind i n order to prevent bias in knowing the concentration of the drug while viewing MRI results. After utilizing MRI, pathology was seen consistently within the alternate groups. More recently we have shifted towards a more clinically relevant topic, xerostomia , which is an underproduction of saliva due to damage of the salivary glands. Five BALB/cNHsd mice were split into groups and irradiated with 5 Gy, 10 Gy, or no dose. The irradiations alternated between left and ride sides in a 5 x 5 millimeter area. The m ice were monitored and imaged ten days post -irradiation. Weight was used as a measurement of damage as well as dark spots within the salivary glands on MRI images. Results were inconclusive. Future directions include increasing the dosage as well as irradi ation of the whole neck along with use of Amifostine.

Author: Carissa Serratos Abstract: With a current autism spectrum disorder (ASD) national prevalence of 1 in 59, research efforts are committed to identif ying potential risk markers for later diagnosis. Previous research tracking younger siblings of children with ASD (high -risk infants) have identified social communication difficulties in children later diagnosed with ASD, as well as children exhibiting sub clinical symptoms, such as the Broader Autism Phenotype (BAP). However, knowledge is limited about early social communication development in children exhibiting the BAP. Recognizing eye gaze is essential to social communication and is a key early risk mark er for ASD, understanding gaze patterns in the BAP may inform our developmental understanding of risk markers in high - risk infants. The present study assessed gaze patterns between children with BAP and their typically developing peers (TYP), during a play interaction to test whether the BAP group (1) looks less towards their mothers' face, and (2) look more towards toys. As part of a prospective study, 66 children completed a mother - child play task at their 18 - or 24 -month laboratory visit. The interaction was coded for the frequency and duration of look face and look object. At each child's final laboratory visit, outcome classifications of either BAP (n=18) or TYP (n=48) were assigned. A series of ANCOVAs, with infant sex and maternal education as covaria tes, were conducted and revealed no significant group differences. Our results suggest gaze may not be a core social difficulty in children exhibiting the BAP. Future studies may build upon our study by assessing other core social behaviors that may differ entiate risk. Research Mentor : Dr. A.J.

Author: Emily Stahly Abstract: Couples often are mis matched in their attachment orientations, their general level of comfort and trust toward relationship partners. These attachment orientations encapsulate one's past history with close others, and become expressed in a current relationship as expectations, beliefs, and strategies for managing moments of distress. Attachment tendencies are captured by two orientations: feelings of avoidance (distrust and discomfort with close emotional connections) and anxiety (feeling unlovable and fearing a partner leaving them). Some individuals feel relatively secure within partners, as they are comfortable being close to others and others being close to them (low on feelings of both avoidance and anxiety). The current project examined whether romantic partners become inc reasingly similar across time, adopting the other's attachment tendencies, or instead retain stable tendencies. The literature review evaluates three competing predictions: (1) romantic partners maintain their attachment tendencies over time (2) the more s ecure partner adopts the more insecure partner's attachment tendencies (becoming more insecure) (3) the more insecure partner adopts the secure partner's tendencies (becoming more secure). The current project examines the existing support for each predicti on and finds support for each. This project informs how attachment orientations may change in new relationships with romantic partners. Research Mentor : Dr. Ximena B.

Many caregivers anecdotally report dissatisfaction with these processes yet are not given the opportunity to report their concern s. We sought to investigate the concerns of caregivers in regard to their child's psychological assessments, and whether these concerns differ across NGS. 97 caregivers of children with NGS completed online questionnaires about their child's most recent ps ychological assessment. Open - ended survey responses were coded by two undergraduate research assistants with high agreement (87 - 96%). We examined the frequency of five themes: communication (A); environment (B); organization and preparations (C); resources , planning, and results (D); and testing (E). We hypothesized there would be more reported concerns with the A and E themes for the caregivers of children with other NGS (OTH) compared to caregivers of children with Down syndrome (DS). Due to small sample sizes within cells, we used Fisher's exact tests to examine proportional differences between DS and OTH for each of the five themes. Contrary to hypotheses, there were no significant differences between DS and OTH groups for each of the five themes; 22.7% OTH reported A concerns compared to 15.5% DS, p=.498; 9.3% OTH reported B concerns compared to 2.1% DS, p=.116; 11.3% OTH reported 11 concerns compared to 5.2% DS, p=.338; 6.2% OTH reported D concerns compared to 6.2%, p=.303; 24.7% OTH reported E concerns compared to 18.6%, p=.330. Further exploratory analyses will examine additional themes. Learning about caregivers' concerns will likely inform clinicians and researchers how to improve the assessment process for children with NGSs and their caregivers.

Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the US and world because of the genetically modified crops that have been developed to be resistant to glyphosate's herbicidal effects. Over the years, dicamba use has been modest throughout the United States; however, with Monsanto's introduction of Xtend crops including soybeans and cotton as a part of their Roundup Ready crop system in 2016, dicamba use is expected to increase in a similar manner as that of glyph osate. Glyphosate's maximum contaminant level (MCL) for drinking water has been set at 0.7 ppm (mg/L); however, an MCL still has not been set for dicamba. In the spring of 2017, the US EPA approved the mixture of dicamba and glyphosate in one tank for appl ication purposes by farmers in order to reduce the number of application trips. Although this decision was good for the farmers, there has been little research looking into the mixture toxicity of the two herbicides. One possible effect, synergism, happens when the combination of two chemicals has a greater effect, in this case toxicity, than the sum effects each one has individually. To study this, zebrafish embryos were collected immediately after fertilization and exposed to different concentrations of d icamba alone, glyphosate alone, and mixtures of dicamba and glyphosate through 120 hours post fertilization (hpf). After this exposure a visual motor response test was used to assess behavioral changes at 120 hpf. It was found that zebrafish larvae were ob served to be hypoactive at higher dicamba and glyphosate concentrations when tested individually and in mixture (p<0.05). Research Mentor : Dr. Jennifer L.

The purpose of this project is to determine the accuracy of the portable LXRF machine in measuring the lead content o f condor bones. While the existing K X -Ray Fluorescence (K XRF) system is the most accurate system to measure bone lead content in vivo because it has sufficient energy to overcome soft tissue attenuation, it is not very practical for use in a research lab with animals or for researchers covering a large migratory territory of condors (from California to Arizona). The portable L XRF machine is lightweight, does not require continuous maintenance, a radioisotope source, or nitrogen cooling, and provides imme diate spectra for analysis. I calibrated the system with Pb -doped bone -equivalent phantoms that were covered with 0.54 mm, 1 mm, and 1.5 mm Lucite to mimic the effects of soft tissue attenuation. The detection limit was calculated to be 0.6 ppm with 0.54 mm Lucite thickness. Seventeen condor cadaver bones were measured twice (for reproducibility) and the spectra were analyzed with our in -house spectral fitting program written with MatLab. Significant correlation was observed between the bone Pb concentrati ons measured by the portable XRF and ICP -MS (R2 = 0.68, 0.763, and 0.74 for 0.54, 1, and 1.54 mm tissue thicknesses, respectively) and the linear regression of the K XRF results versus the 0.54, 1, and 1.54 mm Lucite thickness measurements was R2 = 0.9, 0. 81, and 0.84. Two measurements of the same set of bones (Lucite thickness at 0.54 mm) gave rise to a strong correlation with an R2 of 0.95, which shows a great reproducibility of the results. In conclusion, the L XRF machine has sufficiently proven to prov ide accurate measurements, with a few consistent outliers across the tissue thicknesses; we expect the correlation constant to move further away from 1 as the tissue thickness increases, but this trend is not visible in the linear regressions of the portab le XRF versus the ICP -MS, while it can be observed in the trend of the K versus L XRF linear regressions.

These identified traits will become useful parameters for hospitality business in their effort to create compelling brand stories. Additi onally, given hospitality and tourism businesses tend to serve a wide population with various cultural backgrounds, we hope to identify culturally specific content traits that will assist companies to build emotional bonds with customers from various cultu ral backgrounds. An empirical study will be conducted on people's perception of images that are representative of various visual traits and data will be gathered through a survey. There will be also an analysis component where researchers will examine the effect of scenario -based visual storytelling in hospitality and tourism businesses. This second step in conjunction with the results of the experiment will allow researchers to provide suggestions in hospitality brand storytelling practices. This research shall provide evidence -based recommendations for the industry practitioners in better structuring their brand stories, and in better communicating their brand value to a global audience.

Out -of-home placement (OOHP) is a traumatic event experienced by children with substantiated child abuse and neglect. OOHP has been associated with more depression (Anderson, 2011) and post - traumatic stress symptoms (Kolko, Hurlburt, Barth, L eslie, & Burns, 2010) as well as with externalizing problems, such as delinquency and aggression (Newton, Litrownik, & Landsverk, 2000; Perry & Price, 2017). Few studies examine how change over time in OOHPs can influence internalizing and externalizing pr oblems during adolescence - a gap the current research addresses. Methods. Data come from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing I, which includes a national sample of children in contact with Child Protective Services (CPS). Three waves of data (waves 1, 2, and 4) over a three -year period was used in the present research. Latent transition analysis was conducted in Mplus 7.4 to evaluate patterns of change in OOHP over three years. OOHP patterns were used to assess outcomes among youth when they were between the ages of 13 and 17 using regression models. Results. Results from the latent transition analysis indicate four patterns of change over time in children's OOHP: 1) no OOHP, 2) OOHP one time, 3) OOHP two times, 4) OOHP two times with c hange in placements, 5) OOHP three times, and 6) OOHP three times with change in placement.. Results demonstrate that greater instability in placement (i.e. more frequency and change in placement) was associated with more depressive and trauma symptoms as well as more delinquent and aggressive behaviors. Conclusion. Greater instability of out of home placements can make children more vulnerable in terms of negative outcomes when they reach adolescence - a finding that is rooted in attachment theory. Specif ically, greater instability can result in the lack of strong caregiver -child attachment which has been linked to poorer adjustment among children throughout their life (Hardt & Rutter, 2004). Findings highlight a need for prevention efforts aimed at improv ing outcomes among children with unstable placements following child abuse and neglect.

Author: Frank Yanko Chloe Rivers Abstract: Manganese (Mn) is an essential metal in the human body that has significant implications in maintaining normal brain and nerve function. Numerous accessible biological specimen Mn levels may serve as biomarkers of internal Mn exposure such as blood, urine, plasma, nail and hair samples. The absence of a proven biomarker to quantify internal exposure drives this study. We aim to determine if hair is a reliable biomarker for internal Mn exposure in the body. We used 12 week old male and female C5 7BL/6J mice. The animals were exposed in two blocks of 3 subcutaneous injections every 3 days starting day 0 and 20. There are three treatment groups in this study. The control group received saline (vehicle), second treatment group received two blocks of Mn (50 mg/kg MnCl2*4H20) and the third group received only one block of Mn injections. Methylmercury (MeHg) was used as a positive control (3mg/kg) as it is known to accumulate in hair upon internal exposure. The third treatment group received MeHg injecti ons in the second block. Hair was collected on day 0 and day 60 from all three treatment groups. The animals were sacrificed on day 60 of the study, tissue from brain, liver and kidney were also collected. Mn concentrations in the hair samples were quantif ied by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP -MS). We have successfully established the methods for hair digestion and detection of Mn in mouse hair using ICP -MS. We will be using this protocol to analyze our samples. We will determine if a sign ificant correlation between the internal doses of Mn and the levels of Mn found in the collected hair is found. Potentially, hair can be used as a reliable and non -invasive biomarker for internal Mn exposure in humans to lead to earlier detection of neurot oxicity. Research Mentor : Aaron B.

Poster Number: 125b :: Social Sciences/Humanities College of Health and Human Sciences Ostracism and Passive Receptivity Author: Yichuan Yin Abstract: Abstract Ren et al (2016) found that ostracism induced a stronger desire to seek solitude among ostracized individuals, and the effect is especially strong among introverted individuals. The current study examined whether ostracized individuals would become more passive toward proactive taking actions to join the group, but, would be receptive to invitations from others (passive receptivity). We also investigated s everal individual differences that might moderate these effects. All participants were randomly assigned to be included or ostracized in Cyberball. After which, they entered Cyberchat, a simulated chatroom invitation site, where they were asked to decide w hether they wanted a partner for subsequent tasks. If they did, they could send an invitation; if not, they needed to do nothing. Participants who did not proactively send an invitation received an invitation from another \"user\" 55 -second later. We recorde d the time span between when they entered Cyberchat and when they sent an invitation for those who proactively sent an invitation as well as the acceptance rate of invitation for those who were invited at 55th second. Ostracism threatened fundamental needs , however nearly everyone proactively invited a partner prior to the 55 -second delay. Among ostracized participants, introverted individuals had a longer delay to invite than extroverted ones. I discuss potential improvements to Cyberchat that will better test my hypotheses.

Data from the study include field notes taken during weekly committee meetings and general sessions (both live and archived video) and interviews with various stakeholders in education policy. Two important issues have been brought up numerous times in committee hearings and testimony, these are the central topic of this poster symposium: a civics literacy test for high school students and school safety. Legislators in the state's capitol have struggled over the years to enforce a mandatory one hundred question civics literacy test for high school students. This year momentum has built up as university's like Purdue and several other states are proposing similar bills as part of their curriculum. School safety has been a topic of contentious debate at the national and state lev el after incidents such as Parkland. With Hoosiers demanding solutions to avoid the loss of lives, a Republican -controlled congress has vowed to solve the problem through pro -gun legislation.

P'urh\u00e9pecha is an agglutinative language that relies heavily on concatenative morphology within words to create complex meaning. This project explores classifier morphemes found in locative ve rb constructions, as in (1) -nu-sti terunukwa -rhu Post CLF -CLF-is patio -on The post is laying on the patio The verb contains several morphemes: ana - referring to the DP 'patio'); and -sti marking tense and person agreement of the initial DP. These morphemes carry information regarding specific properties attributable to the constituent they refer to. The question this project aims to answer invo lves the nature of the relation between the classifier morphemes and their corresponding arguments within the sentence unit and how to represent it in a syntactic structure. Following Benedicto (2018), this project hypothesizes that these classifier morphe mes can be parasitically merged with a functional head already existing in locative expressions. This can be represented in syntactic structures from which we can derive the observed distribution.

We took footage previously filmed in the town of Menominee by Professor Osman, and combined it with home video and archived footage of Michigan to create a documentary film propelled by nostalgia. We took this angle because we believed it would be the best way to get the most people involved and interested about a natural area that could be hundreds of miles away from them. This film is meant to play at numerous film festivals across the country. Afterward it would most likely be uploaded to Vimeo so to be seen by a world -wide audience.

The project is significant because it allows for easier visualization of integral cities, houses, and other signific ant locations and displays how these various locations connect and overlap. These locations are then hyperlinked within a multitude of scholarly articles published on British Representation and Nineteenth -Century History (BRANCH). Through deeper research i nto these locations, and in retrofitting the BRANCH articles with hyperlinks to the COVE map, this project cultivates a furthered understanding of the physical world during the Victorian Era and adds to the materials available digitally in this discipline. This project involves summarizing the main points of interest about these specific locations, researching their exact locations, and finding a suitable image. These map pins are then inserted as hyperlinks in every article within the published, peer -revie wed works of BRANCH so that Victorian scholars can better visualize the locations to which these articles refer and in turn cultivate a deeper understanding of the time period. This resource also allows for a more advanced visualization of the connection b etween these different locations as well as the vast number of significant events that shaped the development of these different cultures during the nineteenth -century.

For this research three different types of marks are being studied: trampling, butchery, and crocodile marks. These marks are experimentally made, then 3D scanned and edited. Editing of the scans is completed through the use of the computer program Meshlab and solely limited to the extraction of the marks of interest from the 3D scans. The scans must be edited in -order to remove unnecessary variables from them such as generic bone surface or other insignificant marks. The isolated marks are then further processed through the use of R -programming to create a generic shape for each individually extracted mark. These mark shapes are then further compared using statistical analysis in R -programming in order to observe general trends of difference in each of the types of marks. The data can eventually be used to be compared to unidentifiable mark types, allowing for statistical analysis of the probability an unknown mark is o ne of the types.

The end of the documentary calls the viewer to be more courteous and kind to wildlife and to advocate for conservation in the United States. The script will take on a horror /visceral tone throughout, which will harken back to the time of carnivorous plants used in horror films in the Golden Age of Hollywood. The goal is to get a high -profile celebrity, perhaps one with a stake in environmentalism/conservationism, to narrate t he documentary.

Both directors' films have received critical praise and have been internationally recognized, their films both have a sense of showing the real life of ordinary or marginalized people in a specific time of history. And Hou Hsiao -hsien was featured in on e of Jia Zhangke's documentary I Wish I Knew in 2010. As I noticed from watching Platform and A City of Sadness, two pieces have many cultural references and symbolized moments hide underneath the quiet and static long takes, Also there are some similar ae sthetics of camera angles and shots between two directors. In this research paper, I want to analyze and compare two films from these two great directors based on the aesthetic use of long shots and long takes, the intentional use of dialects, use of cult ural reference in different media, the choice of using main protagonists represent society, also their attitude as narrative and observative directors.

Certain jobs require you to act nicer than you may be feeling, like a teacher or a nursing home aid who cannot show if they are frustrated o r angry in the workplace. While others may force you to act more angry than you may usually be, like a bill collector, who cannot show sympathy towards their clients. These jobs often see you putting your actual feelings aside and acting in a way that you are expected to when interacting with clients and coworkers while in a professional setting. There are three main ways that emotional labor is regulated: bodily, cognitive and expressive. Bodily Emotions include doing physical things in order to change the way that one feels, such as taking deep breathes to calm down or reduce anger. Cognitive strategies look at how workers change their thoughts and ideas so that they may change the way they feel towards things. A worker may place a picture of their family on their desk so they can look at that and feel happier. Expressive links ones gestures to inner feelings. Someone may smile even if they are not happy so that they can attempt to change how they are feeling. Through this research, we hope to see how emot ional labor has a toll on those in the workplace and who it is affecting the most.

Countless factors influence these areas, some of which include Confucian values, high beauty standards, feminist organizations, Western ideologies, and legislation on the feminist movement, which I analyze. Then, I evaluate the representation of women in a very popular South Korean television series called Secret Garden, a soap opera -style drama series. This form of media is very pervasive in South Korean popular culture, so it can have a profound impact on social no rm and self -image constructions. This project aims to provide an example of how one such influential drama series serves as an intimate part of the reality and well - being of many people and reinforces deeply -rooted gender ideologies harmful to women.

This research attempts to tie both the valu e of media as film with the importance in promoting such films adequately through social media. Through the gathering of films and relating common themes, the value in promoting these themes through social media tools was seen. However, the need for expert knowledge of these social media tools created a need for a social media guide. The social media guide created highlights three major social media outlets and walks the individual through creating an account, managing who views their posts, deleting their account if needed, and more, while also identifying important areas to consider: sharing, privacy, and security. The aforementioned guide will be translated into Portuguese. Though this is an evolving project and its reception is currently unknown, this project supports the importance of indigenous media as a resource for cultural preservation and promoting indigenous lifestyles, ultimately serving as a vehicle for political change. From this understanding, the social media guide was created for the Kayap \u00f3 peoples to add to and strengthen their voices in today's cultural climate.

Following this, Linguists for NIcaragua had been a presence in NIcaragua providing help to indigenous people throughout the 80s and 90s, with even my own research mentor for the project, Elena Benedicto having participated. Since many of the the original members have passed away, there has been an effort to capture the stories of the surviving members, wanting to preserve their stories and not allow their work to go unrecognized by others how may not be a ware of their contributions. As such interviews were conducted with the remaining original members of the first endeavor of Linguists for Nicaragua, with recordings done in English, Spanish, and French. My research done with Professor Elena Benedicto invol ves taking the interviews of the remaining original participants of the Linguists for Nicaragua who arrived in the country all those years ago, transcribing them, and putting them in story format for a website chronicling their works. The audio, which came from english recordings of the participants' interviews, is transcribed with help of the software program Elan. Once transcriptions are written down, I put them into a more biographic/story -like format. Once the writings are all done, we put them onto a w ebsite that we created that will preserve and showcase the stories of these linguists for all to see, learn from, and appreciate.

A survey was distributed through Google Forms to current PW st udents during the Fall 2018 Semester, with five topics covering: demographics, extracurricular activities, education history, future goals, and suggestions for the PW program. Our survey contained a total of 23 questions distributed to students via the PW -Talk email list. Student identities were left anonymous and all long -answer questions were optional. The data collected gives an brief synopsis of the people that were in the PW major or minor during Fall 2018 semester. Many students are: involved in stude nt organizations, value internships, don't feel ready for graduation, and interested in revision of the PW program. Some students included comments and suggestions on the program, which can be addressed by the program's facilitators. Many participants indi cated a lack of advertising for the program by stating that they didn't know about the major/minor until later in their academic careers. We concluded that the PW department may want to consider more advertising to students both in and out of the college o f Liberal Arts. The opinions and views discussed by students should be presented to those in charge of PW, who can decide to further research these needs. Those in charge of the program can use our data to conduct research on the needs of current students. Overall, our research gathered previously unknown knowledge about PW students that is useful to both students and administrators.

This pilot study addresses the lack of usability scholarship in web -based writing lab materials by using talk aloud protocol to measure the usability of the Purdue Writing Lab Data Usage tables. Undergraduate tutors -in-training were asked to verbalize their thoughts while completing a series of tasks using the data tables. The tasks assessed if data trends were easily interpret ed and if the level of accessibility for color blind or motor impaired users was adequate. Results indicate that students have difficulty distinguishing the purpose of the data tables based on their titles. Accessibility for motor impaired users was deemed satisfactory; however, accessibility for colorblind users was limited and screen reading features were nonexistent. This study indicates areas that warrant future usability testing and suggests changes that should be made, such as implementing an optional color coding feature and screen reading software. Continuation of this research will further enhance user experience by establishing a method of usability testing that can be applied and replicated in writing centers worldwide .

Author: L. Nikolai Abstract: In American Sign Language (ASL), little is known about the linguistic function of the non -manual marker (NMM) \"flat chin,\" also known in the literature as Action Unit 17 (AU -17) (Ekman & Friesen, 1978). Previous research suggests AU -17 correlates cross -culturally with expressing disgust and anger (Ekman, Sorenson, & Friesen, 1969) and in ASL with negation -Quiroz, Wilbur, & Mart\u00ednez, 2016). Bross & Hole (2017) propose that in all sign languages the lower face (i.e., nose, mouth, chin, etc.) conveys linguistics information about scalarity and eva luation . Given Bross & Hole (2017)'s predictions, we hypothesize that AU -17's functions can be extended into these domains.. We propose several functions of AU -17 based on analysis of a video corpus taken from the published video series Face of ASL as wel l as initial analysis of elicited data. First, we note that lexical functions account for 3% of appearances of AU -17 in our corpus data (e.g., ss). Beyond this we identify three wider functions: speaker evaluation, uncertainty, and context narrowing. Fo r speaker evaluation, AU -17 occurs where the signer is making a judgment about what they are stating (27% of the appearances of AU -17 in our corpus). Evaluation seems to be supported by our elicitation data thus far. For uncertainty, AU -17 occurs where the signer is uncertain about what they are saying or is offering a possibility for the future (13%). For context narrowing, AU -17 occurs over a phrase where the signer wants to focus on part of a larger topic (~33%). These functions account for approximately 76% of the appearances of AU-17 in our corpus, indicating that AU -17 does indeed have wider linguistic functions than previously noted. Moreover, our findings correlate with Bross & Hole (2017)'s predictions about the functionality of the lower face. Ulti mately, our analysis of AU -17 will feed the development of automatic non -manual detection algorithms, improve education of both native and non -native ASL signers, and fill in a gap in our overall linguistic knowledge.

This study examines burials excavated from a subterranean vault and shaft tomb, Unit 36, locate d in an elite area of the Tombos cemetery. Comingled remains and 13 separate burials have been evaluated for age, sex, and pathological conditions to generate biological profiles of the occupants of this tomb. Transition Analysis was used to determine an a ge of maximum likelihood (AML) and lower and upper 95% CI ages for each combination of skull and or pelvis. Sex, measurements, and differential diagnoses were obtained in accordance with standards set by Buikstra and Ubelaker following a full inventory of each set of remains. Unit 36 contained comingled material and 13 discrete burials, including 3 children under the age of 10, as well as 6 adult females and 4 adult males with calculated AML ranging from 15 - 60+ years. Pathological conditions observed incl ude a case of significant lower body muscle atrophy in the body of an elderly female, as well as healed cribra orbitalia, porotic hyperostosis, and dental abscesses. Burial positions and grave goods represent a fusion of Nubian and Egyptian cultural practi ces, following a precedent set by other areas of the New Kingdom cemetery. Elite individuals experienced physiological stress but were able to survive with some conditions likely causing impairment.

In par ticular, I focused on the variance in how they communicate with their different audiences as a 'social good start -up' company. This study involved in depth rhetorical analyses of Bangs shoes' communication artifacts including their website and blog, social media, brand ambassador documents, and information presented by their business partner: Kiva. Through a comparative analysis of Bangs shoes and other 'social good' shoe companies such as Toms, that the juvenile tone that Bangs shoes has elected to communi cate to their audience with will ultimately inhibit their growth as a legitimate competitor for companies like Toms and Bobs shoes. The lack of representation of their philanthropic work in their social media and marketing materials greatly differs from th e advertising tactics used by other companies and is a major oversight in their marketing plan, costing them a large potential consumer base. They are limiting their audience and potential investors by relating their entire communication model around mille nnials and young audiences, and in the future they will need to blend the way they communicate with their consumer base and the way they communicate with those who are interested in their philanthropy into one targeted audience.

But that doesn't mean that these technologies disappear; in fact, they are often reborn into a new phase of life. In this study, I seek to answer the question of where the value of a text ends and begins. From binder's waste torn from Medieval manuscripts to 17th century books used as Disney props, the cycle of the written word doesn't end with indefinite storage. Using an archive of early modern print books that show evidence of both recycling and being recycled., I analyze two opposing views: books as material that must be used to be valuable, and books as cultura l artifacts that must be preserved ad nauseum. The line between print as material and print as artifact becomes less distinct as we look at texts that have survived both. I concluded that, though the modification or destruction of historic texts should not be deliberate, that destruction does not eliminate the value of the new product. The significance of historic texts comes from three aspects: craftsmanship, culture, and information. The resulting value of the new, modified text is not necessarily less th an the significance that it had before, especially if the \"new\" text ages and eventually becomes an artifact in and of itself, or if recycling old material vastly decreases waste of raw material and human labor. Certain books, however, should never be dest royed, such as sacred texts and texts with priceless cultural significance. Ultimately the risks and rewards of harming a book can only be known in retrospect. Research Mentor : Elizabeth E.

Effects of Climate Change on the Transition to Farming Author: Isabella Zuffoletti Abstract: On a global scale, warming trends began at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum about 20,000 years ago. Since the beginning of this interglacial period, sporadic, but overall directional changes in climatic conditions occurred. Changing conditions led to ch anges in plant and animal ranges, temperature, and precipitation. It is presumed these climatic changes would have impacted the subsistence strategies of prehistoric populations and are related to the independent invention of agriculture at many locations across the world. However, the effect of climate change on subsistence transition has not been examined. This project involves examining archaeological evidence of the transition from foraging to farming in response to climate change in the Interior East ern Woodland region of North America during the Late Archaic and Early Woodland periods. This project combines research of paleoenvironmental and paleoecological data, botanical and faunal remains, and cultural materials. Information will be collected from existing publications and compiled into a database. This information will contribute to an existing database on climate change and the human diet. From this database, questions about how climate change in the early Holocene was related to the development of agriculture in the American Midwest can be answered. This research will also allow for future studies examining what we may learn from the Native American response to climate change, as our current food production strategies may need to be adaptive to o ngoing climate change.

Half of women ove r the age of 50 will suffer from a bone fracture during the rest of their lifetime. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables has been found to reduce oxidative stress and increase bone mineral density. Blueberries have one of the highest antioxidant properties among fruits due to the high concentration of polyphenolics. Animal studies in ovariectomized rat model of osteoporosis found that blueberries can protect bones due to their high content of polyphenolics. Our study aims to examine the effects of three dif ferent doses of dried blueberry powder added to a regular diet on net bone calcium retention and bone turnover in postmenopausal women. We hypothesize that an increased consumption of blueberry powder will improve the retention of calcium in bones. Using t he Ca41 labeling methodology, we tracked the excretion of Ca14 in urine and used the changes in urinary Ca41 excretion to estimate the effect of blueberry consumption on bone loss. In total, 18 healthy postmenopausal women were enrolled in the study and 14 have completed it. The results of this study are forthcoming and will be presented at the Undergraduate Research Conference on April 9, 2019. This study will increase our understanding of calcium metabolism in humans and provide insights about potential n on-pharmacological treatment of osteoporosis.

To achieve this, an inhaled drug must exhibit a high aerosolisation performance, or the ability of fine drug particles to disperse and act at the target site of action in the lungs. Proper deposition of the aerosol drug particles at the target s ite is dependent upon chemical properties and the aerodynamic diameter of the particles. Preliminary data demonstrated that the aerosolisation performance of colistin, a hydroscopic antibiotic, notably decreased when stored at a relative humidity (RH) of 7 5% due to its moisture absorption. To prevent moisture absorption, my goal is to combine two antibiotics, colistin and azithromycin, into one formulation to improve the combination drug's delivery to the respiratory passageways and produce a synergistic ef fect. Both aims intend to reduce undesired side effects and minimize antibiotic resistance, respectively. Azithromycin, a broad -spectrum antibiotic, exhibits hydrophobic properties and is able to encapsulate colistin through spray -drying, a method used to generate a fine-particle powder. Additional methods include high -performance liquid chromatography and cascade impactor to assess the drug's efficacy. Ultimately, simultaneous local delivery of colistin and azithromycin can not only treat multi -drug resist ant bacterial infections, but it can also reduce side effects of long -term drug delivery. A better understanding of colistin and azithromycin's properties is important in strengthening therapeutic methods to treat patients with lower respiratory infections .

This stud y examines to what extent gender is associated with key two aspects of the language environment (i.e., the number of conversational turns and the number of adult words children hear) within childcare settings. The sample of preschool children (N = 44; 26 m ales and 18 females) were assessed during 2 preschool days at their respective childcare centers. The Language Environmental Analysis (LENA) device was used to assess language environments, which was placed in vests that the children wore throughout the sc hool day (from approximately 9:30am until 3:30pm). Multi -level regression analyses (clustering at the child and center level) were conducted that predicted number of adult words heard and conversational turns based on child gender and controlling for chil d vocalizations, age, and day of recording (one versus two). An interaction term was also examined between gender and the number of child vocalizations predicting both outcomes. Gender was not associated with the number of adult words children heard thro ughout the preschool day, nor was the interaction statistically significant. However, for conversational turn taking, there was a statistically significant interaction between gender and child vocalizations. Specifically, for children who were highly vocal (one standard deviation above the mean), females had substantially more conversational turns than males. Children who were not very vocal (one standard deviation below the mean), conversational turns did not substantially differ between males and females. These findings suggest that the experiences of children in childcare potentially differ in meaningful ways between males and females.

For cancer, the folate receptor has been identified as a potential target as it is highly overexpressed on cancer cells. The folate receptor binds extracellular folates with high affinity and internalizes them through an endocytic process. This mechanism can be exploited for drug delivery. The focus of this project is to create a mechanism for development of a self -immolative linker between a targeting agent and the ther apeutic cargo. The linker is then cleaved inside the cell due to glutathione (GSH) in the endocytic environment to cleanly release the drug without modifying chemical function. Target molecule was successfully created and found to be highly reactive, showi ng promise as a cleavable linker. The linker will then be attached to a drug and targeting agent. The finished product is planned to be tested in vitro, simulating cell conditions, for effectiveness. Though the resulting product is exciting, it is also imp ortant to understand the chemistry and process behind the molecule. The project is still in progress and results have not yet been published. Therefore, this poster will focus on the process and development of the project, summarizing its progress thus far and future steps.

Therapeutic effects of KD are often attributed to diet -induced elevation of circulating ketones such as beta -hydroxybutyrate (BHB), although recent research has challenged this idea and suggested that therapeutic effects may be due to increased circulating medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) instead. MCFAs are the digested by -product of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) found in some foods and are more easily transported throughout the body's metabolic pathways than their counterparts, long chain triglycerides (LCT). To test the ketogenic potential of MCT -rich diets vs LCT -rich diets, 16 female Long Evans rats were assigned to one of four diet types: chow, LCT, MCT, or Coconut oil (composed of LCT and MCT). Rats were given ad libitum access to their assigned diets for 3 weeks. Food intake, bodyweight, body composition, and blood BHB levels were recorded before, during, and after the st udy. There were no differences in BHB between MCT and LCT groups, and females consuming the LCT diet gained more bodyweight and fat mass than the chow and MCT groups, but not the coconut oil group. These results suggest that there may be some differential effect caused by the type of fat intake when given ad libitum . To further elucidate these effects, we calorie -matched fat -enriched groups to a chow control group for three weeks and measured body weight, body composition, and ketone levels. Preliminary dat a suggests that effects of LCT on body composition persist, suggesting that dietary fats have differential effects on body composition that are not dependent on the elevation of BHB. Collectively, these data demonstrate that LCTs may promote fat storage that is not observed in MCT -consuming groups. More research is necessary to fully understand these differential effects, and further elucidate the therapeutic potential of MCTs. Research Mentor s: Dr. Kimberly P.

The exp eriment was inspired by an article published in C&EN News 2018, 96, 18 -21. The article describes solid shampoos as trendy new consumer products with the added value that they are not packaged in plastic bottles and thus produce less plastic waste. Green pr oduct development is highlighted while learning about the chemistry of shampoo and soap. The objectives of the chemistry laboratory experiment are as follows: i) Develop hands -on skills on how to formulate solid shampoo and synthesize soap. ii) Prepare emulsions using the new shampoo and soap. Observe, record and explain results in terms of surfactant molecules and the molecular interactions important to the washing process. iii) Observe and analyze the influence of ions on surfactant molecules in hard water. Record data, evaluate and generate evidence supported conclusions. The new laboratory experiment introduces students to hands -on synthesis and formulation of surfactants, solubility, and the molecular interactions washing. The prediction of molecu lar interactions is very important in soap synthesis and shampoo formulation because damage to hair must be avoided. For example, soaps work best at a basic pH, but shampoos are formulated for cleaning hair protein at an acidic to neutral pH. At this pH th e molecular forces that hold the hair protein together are maintained. A second part of the experiment focuses on emulsions and the influence of ions on surfactant molecules in hard water. Students learn about the chemistry of surfactants, emulsions, and t he molecular interactions that lead to micelles.

These are particles that are suspended in the atmosphere that have a wide range of different properties. Aerosols anions such as nitrate, sulfate, and chloride are major causes for acid rain and can result in multiple respiratory illnesses. This study compares the concentration of these harmful a erosols between a small town in California and a small town in Peru. Measurements were taken from multiple air filter samples throughout a calendar year. The filters collected suspended particulate matter for 24 hours and the total mass was then measured. Filters were extracted in deionized water and the ion measurements were made using ion chromatography to find out the concentration of nitrates, sulfates, and chloride anions and cations. It was determined that the California aerosols ranged from 0.16 ug/m 3 to 6.54 ug/m3 1.01 ug/m3 for nitrate anions. For the Peru site, the concentration ranged from 3.2 ug/m3 to 6.7 ug/m3 for sulfate anions, and 0.6 ug/m3 to 2.4 ug/m3 for nitra te anions. These results give insight into how the government regulations affect the air quality in developing countries such as Peru, when compared to developed countries such as the United States.

Stable isotopes of nitrate can help deepen our understan ding of nitrogen sources and chemistry. For nitrate to be measured in an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS), it must be converted to the gas phase. Currently, the most popular method uses a bacterial species ( P. auerofaciens ) that lacks the nitrous oxide reductase enzyme, allowing the species to reduce NO3- to nitrous oxide (N 2O), and the N 2O is subsequently measured by IRMS. However, this method is complicated, as it is labor intensive, requires high expertise, and is susceptible to contamination. T o simplify this process, we have developed a new inorganic approach using titanium (III) chloride (TiCl 3) to reduce NO 3- to N 2O. Because this method involves controlled physical chemistry, factors that influence the reaction can be more readily constrained . Thus, our study aims to understand these factors and determine what conditions lead to the greatest N 2O production. Test variables consist of: 1) the concentration of TiCl 3 and 2) the composition of the atmosphere (aerobic vs anaerobic). Our results show that 0.06 to 0.12% TiCl 3 under an anaerobic condition provides NO 3- conversion to N 2O at near a 100% yield with consistent results. This complete conversion provides excellent accuracy and precision for stable isotope analysis of nitrate. Compared to the traditional bacteria approach, this approach is more cost - and time -efficient, is more environmentally friendly, and has the potential for broad applications for nitrate analysis.

Using a freshwater snail host (Biomphalaria glabrata), we studied the ability of a highly competitive trematode, Echinostoma caproni, to establish and reproduce in a host previously infected with a less competitive trematode species, Schistosoma mansoni. Snails were exposed to S. mansoni and co - exposed to E. caproni either simultaneously or after 1 week, 4 weeks, or 6 weeks. Control treatments were established as unexposed, exposed to E. caproni only, or exposed to S. mansoni only. Co -exposure decreased the infection prevalence of S. mansoni for all treatment groups relative to the S. mansoni \u00ac\u00acexposure control Infection prevalence of E. caproni was lower for the 4 week exposure group than for all other treatment gr oups and the E. caproni control. E. caproni infections 4 and 6 weeks after S. mansoni exposure took longer to reach patency than infections in E. caproni control snails. Survivorship of co -exposed snails did not significantly differ from survivorship of E. caproni controls but was significantly lower than survival of S. mansoni controls. These results indicate that the timing of infection is important for parasite competition, affecting successful parasite establishment and developmental time.

In addition to vitamins and minerals, fruits and vegetables provide health -promoting polyphenols. While not essential to the diet, regularly consuming polyphenols may aid in cardiovascular and neurocognitive health. These health benefits have spurred the consumption of herbal and botanical dietary supple ments, providing consumers with concentrated extracts of purified polyphenols. Often times, however, the phenolic content of these extracts differs from the composition in the whole fruit. Thus, in the current project, we examine the differences in polyphe nols between lyophilized wild blueberries and a concentrated blueberry extract. Methods: Polyphenol were extracted with an acidified methanol -water solution, purified via solid phase extraction in order to remove vitamin C and carbohydrates, and phenolics quantified colorimetrically via the Folin -Ciocalteu method. Additionally, in support of an on -going animal study, starting materials and blueberry doses were monitored every 10d for changes in phenolic content. Results: Total polyphenols in wild blueberr ies and the purified extract were 3.5% and 27% (w/w), respectively. Analysis of blueberry doses given throughout the study is ongoing and results will be presented at the Purdue Undergraduate Research Conference. Conclusion: By monitoring the stability an d consistency of blueberries and blueberry doses throughout the animal study, this analysis provides continual monitoring of the polyphenol content of doses to ensure animals are correctly dosed. This analysis is crucial to the success of the study and dir ectly influences how the data for the animal study are interpreted.

RP can be inherited through many mutations, including the Q344X mutation in the human rhodopsin gene. This mutation causes the truncation of the rhodopsin and causes rod degeneration. To discover an effective treatment for patients with RP, we use a transgen ic zebrafish model expressing the Q344X mutation. The Q344X larvae show onset of rod degeneration at 5 days post fertilization (dpf) which progresses significantly by 7 dpf. The extent of diminished vision in the 7 dpf Q344X larvae can be assessed with The VMR to dim light within larval rod range preceding a dark flash, which does not induce a significant behavioral response. Therefore, the behavioral phenotype of Q344X is due to rod deg eneration. Previous studies indicate that degenerating rods undergo apoptosis. Inhibition of apoptosis to decrease rod degeneration is investigated further with our model by screening the Selleckhem anti -apoptotic compound library with the VMR assay. The Q 344X larvae are treated with these compounds between 5 - 7 dpf. Compounds that decrease rod degeneration by inhibiting apoptosis pathways would be expected to show an increased behavior in the VMR. 82 of the 142 compounds in the anti -apoptosis library have been screened and analyzed with the VMR assay, and 7 showed an increase in behavior. In the future, the extent of apoptosis in rods could be verified using TUNEL staining of retinal cryosections. Drugs that produce consistent results can be reimplemented toward an effective and operational treatment for RP.

The primary risk factor associated with the development of gastric cancer is infection by Helicobacter pylori, a gram -negative bacterium that inhabits highly acidic environments, such as the human stomach. Specifically, the cag pathogenicity island, a collection of genes coding for various virulence factors produced by H. pylori, serves as a significant risk factor in the development of gastric cancer. This pathogenicity island is secreted using a type IV secretion system. Helicobacter also produces fi ve Fic proteins, a family of proteins characterized as bacterial toxins. Fic proteins are unique for their ability to AMPylate, or add an AMP molecule to, their targets. This enables their function as a bacterial toxin, allowing them to destabilize phagocy tic immune cells, effectively dodging the host's immune system. The purpose of this study is to enzymatically characterize and assess the secretion mechanisms and targets of these proteins, with the intention of investigating their relationship to H. pylor i infection and virulence. Research Mentor : Dr. Seema Mattoo Department of Biological Sciences College of Science ; Poster Number: 166b :: Life Sciences College of Science Characterizing a Zebrafish Model to Study Dendritic Spine neuronal communication. Excitatory synapses in the human brain are primarily formed at dendritic spines, specialized neuronal compartments which are often disrupted in various neurologic conditions. In Fragile X Syndrome, reduced amounts of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) result in learning deficits, increased susceptibility to seizures, and changes to spine density and stability. To enable in vivo analysis of spine development, we have identified and developed a cell -type specific genetic labeling system in the larval zebrafish brain using an id2b:gal4 transgene that selectively and consistently labels pyramidal neurons (PyrNs) of the zebrafish optic tectum, cholinergic interneurons that forms dendritic spines. Confocal image volumes of single PyrNs labeled with a membrane -targeted EGFP were collected throughout early larval development to monitor spine morphology and maturation. Analysis of static images demonstrated a developmental transition from long, thin filopodia to short protrusions with enlarged heads. To examine the dynamics of spine stabilization during larval development, timelapse image series were collected and analyzed to quantify protrusion lifetime. Spine lifetime increased over this developmental period, suggesting changes in spine morphology may reflect the formation of stable synaptic connections. To determine if spine development in zebrafish is regulated by FMRP, we examined PyrN morpho logy in mutant larvae with reduced levels of FMRP. Preliminary data indicate that PyrNs in mutant larvae exhibit decreased spine density and reduced spine stability, confirming this genetic animal model as a viable system to study the disruption of spine d evelopment in Fragile X syndrome.

Fokker -Planck -Landau equation) is an integro -differential equation widely used to describe the collisional effects among particles. Yet, due to the high -dimensional, nonlinear, a nd nonlocal structure of the integral operator, direct simulation of the Landau equation is very challenging. In this project, we propose a novel particle method to solve the Landau equation. The method renders the original PDE into a system of ODEs that i s easier to solve. Most importantly, it preserves the physical properties of the solution, such as positivity, conservation, and energy decay. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method by implementing the code in MATLAB, with comparison to an e xact solution. The research indicated this particle method can be used for Landau equation with other parameters which have significant applications in real life situations. Regrading to its low order of accuracy, the particle method has the advantage of e asy implementation, comparing to other numerical methods like the spectral method. Research Mentor : Jingwei Hu.

We aim to replicate these findings in the hope of further elucidating the visual capabilities of mice in a research setting. A popular method of evaluating visual abilities in mice is by utilizing a touchscreen -based learning paradigm, similar to tests used with both humans and primate models. We have applied this paradigm in our laboratory to study mice's ability to perceive subjective contours. Mice were first taught to select a visual stimulus for a food reward, then trained to discr iminate the presence or absence of an illusory square. Our results demonstrate that mice may be trained to discriminate subjective contours, although more work is needed to verify these results and improve our training paradigm. Future directions for this project hope to apply this subjective contour training paradigm to further study the neural pathways involved with visual information processing.

Therefore, anion composition of rainwater gives insight into biological system's aerosols, climate, and acid rain. These aerosols and aci d rain cause damage to environmental systems as well as causing health concerns. This experiment's purpose was to develop a new, low cost method for collecting anions in remote locations. To do so, I determined how much rainwater can pass through columns f illed with anion exchange resin before the resin no longer effectively traps the anions. To accomplish this, synthetic rainwater was made based on previously determined average concentrations of anions around the globe. 100 milliliters of the synthetic rai nwater were run through the resin columns, and the eluted water was analyzed using ion chromatography to determine concentrations of eluted anions. The washes were repeated, analyzing ionic chromatography after each wash, until the eluant no longer contain ed common anions, and only eluting a high concentration of chloride anions that desorbed from the resin. The result of this experiment showed how long the resin columns were able to effectively trap anions and be left in the field. It also showed this meth od is effective at trapping anions until a certain point. This gives an inexpensive way to collect and analyze anions from rainwater in various remote locations. The rain collectors will be distributed around of Arequipa, Peru to measure rainwater anions.

Earlier stage prostate cancer can be treated usin g surgical or medical castration, but most patients subsequently develop Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC), which has no therapy. Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) is overexpressed in multiple cancers including CRPC. inhibition reverses tumorigenesis and metastasis in mice. However, AURKA is also essential for mitosis in all dividing cells. Thus, targeting cancer -specific substrates of AURKA is a more effective approach for developing safer therapies. To this end, we utilized a chemical genetic approa ch developed in our lab and identified \"Protein X\" as a direct oncogenic target of AURKA. Our goal is to uncover the molecular mechanisms by which AURKA regulates Protein X to promote cancer. Therefore, site -directed mutagenesis was used to determine AURKA -mediated phosphorylation sites on Protein X. Once both single mutants were generated using PCR, corresponding double mutant was generated. Each mutant was then ligated into an E. coli vector. Once the correct colonies were identified, the corresponding DN As were transformed into BL21 cells to facilitate expression of each protein. All mutant proteins were expressed, purified and their expression was confirmed using western blotting. Subsequently, we performed a kinase assay using wild -type and mutant prote ins using AURKA. This study revealed AURKA - mediated phosphorylation sites on Protein X. We are using this information to uncover the molecular mechanisms by which AURKA promotes CRPC by harnessing Protein X.

Using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as an inexpensive alternative to surveying waterbirds compared to other aerial methods and ground counts can alleviate the difficulties of surveying waterbird colonies, improve counting accuracy, and reduce bias. To validate this method for surveying waterbirds, we compared counts from images collected from a fixed -wing UAV to groun d counts using a double -observer method or direct counts at three study sites: 1) decoys in a field representing three waterbird species, 2) Great Egrets ( Ardea alba ) roosting on platforms in and 3) Brown Pelicans ( Pelecanus occidentalis ) nesting in a colony on an island. Direct counts from UAV images were similar or more accurate than ground counts for decoys, Great Egrets, and Brown Pelicans. UAV flights did not disturb either Great Egrets or Brown Pelicans. Among decoys, detection probability w as lower and visibility bias was higher for blue decoys against a dark background, compared to white and Brown Pelican decoys. Direct counts from UAV images of juvenile Brown Pelicans were almost twice as high as ground counts. Ground surveys flushed adult pelicans from the survey area; however, UAV images permitted counting adults, as well as eggs in nests that could not be seen by ground surveyors. Our results indicate that UAVs can provide a cost -effective method to survey waterbirds with similar to incr eased accuracy and reduced bias compared to ground counts.

Despite years of research to understand underlying mechanisms and develop more effective treatment approaches, numerous challenges still exist. There are many chronic stress models and genetic strains used to study mood disorders, however the majority have been developed with adult males. This is problemat ic considering that affective disorders are more common in women, and generally develop particularly during late adolescence. Additionally, studies have shown that there are fundamental behavioral and physiological differences between males and females in response to the same external stressors, furthering a need to develop sex -specific paradigms to accurately model the etiology of mood disorders in females. In this study, we tested stress susceptibility of Wistar (Ws) and Wistar -Kyoto (Ky) female rats by u sing a three -week chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm during late adolescence (days 45 -66). To test this, body weight, food intake, and corticosterone levels during restraint stress were measured during CMS to evaluate physiological effects of stress. Immed iately following CMS, animals underwent behavioral assessments of helplessness, anxiety, anhedonia, to evaluate the development of mood disorder phenotypes. Ky rat demonstrated endogenous behavioral and hormonal abnormalities that many symptom -presenting p atients with depression exhibit, making them an ideal model for testing promising therapeutic treatments. Ws rats demonstrated higher susceptibility to CMS -induced symptoms, suggesting that Ws are a better model for understanding the underlying mechanisms linking stress and mood disorders. These tests are repeated during late adulthood (~ day 90) to determine whether expected stress -induced behavioral deficits persist later in life.

Baseflow sustains streams through periods of low precipitation and is largely comprised of groundwater flowpaths. Groundwater flow in alpine glaciated systems is largely unexplored and remains poorly understood. However, the signal captured by stream gauges in alpine glaciated catchments provides a mechanism to investigate baseflow, and therefore contribution of groundwater, to that str eam. Using the catchment of Aletsch Glacier in Switzerland as a model, we attempt to separate the groundwater component of baseflow over recent decades and decouple it from surface runoff (event flow or glacial melt). We hypothesize that baseflow in the ga uged Massa River draining the Aletsch Glacier catchment is increasing due to increased recharge from glacial meltwater. By assessing the monthly and yearly minimum discharge data and combining these data with air temperature, precipitation records, and local geology, we investigate how changes in baseflow are related to the retreat of the Aletsch Glacier. Preliminarily, a relationship was found between the minimum discharge data and air temperature data indicating that the outlet flow from this glacier is d ominated by surficial melt and that the relative groundwater contribution to baseflow is buried due to the rapid release of meltwater. Further research is needed to separate the glacial groundwater signal from recharge due to rain and snowpack.

Fo rbidden transition emission lines of oxygen and sulfur are detected with expansion velocities of 2300 km s^1 . The lack of narrow H Balmer lines suggests that interaction with circumstellar material is not a dominant source of the observed latetime emis sion. We also present a deep Chandra observation that reveals no X -ray emission down to a luminosity of LX < 2 \u00d7 10^38 erg s^1 (0.5 -10 keV). Our findings are consistent with the notion that SN 2012au is associated with a diverse subset of SNe, l ong-duration gamma harboring pulsar/magnetar wind nebulae that influence core -collapse explosion dynamics on a wide range of energy scales. We hypothesize that these systems may all evolve into a similar late -time phase dominated by forbidden oxygen transitions, and predict that emission line widths should remain constant or broaden a few per cent per year due to the acceleration of ejecta by the pulsar/magnetar bubble.

Fine particulate matter can cause serious respiratory issues and aerosols in the atmosphere absorb and reflect radiation which can warm or cool the atmosphere, respectively. This study compares air quality at two urban areas, the city of Wilmington, CA in the United States and the city of Arequipa, Peru. Concentrations of emissions are under higher regulation standards in California than in Peru which is a developing country. Air filters that measured total suspended particles were collected every 24 hours on Marine Avenue in Wilmington, CA and Avenida Independencia in Arequipa, Peru. Anion concentrations were measured using ion chromatography after they were extracted from the filters by dissolving in water and filtered (0.45 m). For Wilmington, the sulfate concentration ranged from 0.74 to 7.48 g/m3, the nitrate concentration ranged 5.23 ug/m3, and the concentr 6.18 g/m3. Nitrate and chloride concentrations tended to increase from January to December while sulfate concentrations tended to decrease from March to December. For Avenida Independencia the sulfate concentration ranged from 3.0 to 6.0 g/m3, the nitrate concentration ranged from 1.9 to 2.0 g/m3, and the chloride concentration ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 g/m3. There was no discernible trend in anion concentrations in Avenida Independencia. By comparing California to Peru, the data shows t hat having regulations on air pollution successfully decreases anion concentrations which can improve human health and reduce environmental damage.

Author: Charlotte Jaeger Abstract: This study has focused on the analysis and comparison of the two greatest outbreaks of tornado activity in the modern U.S. record (1950 -2018). The most productive 24 hour period of tornado activity for each was selected: 3 April 1974 and 27 April 2011 from 12 am CST to 11:59 pm CST. The 3 April 1974 outbreak totaled 119 tornadoes ranging from (E)F1 - (E)F5, 88 of which were significant. The 27 April 2011 outbreak totaled 137 tornadoes ranging from (E)F1 - (E)F5, 59 of which were significant. These e vents far exceed the criteria for a tornado outbreak, defined as 6 -10 tornadoes in a 24 hour period with intensity (E)F1, and including at least one significant tornado (of intensity (E)F2). The objective of this study was to determine appropriate phy sical quantities of severity for the two superoutbreaks in order to analyze and compare the extremeness of the events. These quantities consisted of path width, path length, maximum intensity, and the Total Destructive Index (TDI). Based on these results t he 27 April 2011 outbreak is determined to be the most destructive tornado outbreak in the modern tornado record. The quantities calculated showed the 27 April 2011 had twice as much destructive power as the 3 April 1974 outbreak.

Due to their abundance and low costs sugars serve as ideal starting materials in the synthesis of a variety of useful compounds. D -Galactose is one such sugar. D -Galactose is a readily available monosaccharide found in dairy products, fruits, gums, and is synthesized in the human body. Its structure lends itself to being readily modified for various purposes. Our project seeks to synthesis a variety of biologicall y active molecules as well as produce various other products that can serve as the base for building other biologically relevant products. Thus far, our research has demonstrated that the synthesis of products from D -Galactose proceeds in high yields and i s extremely cost efficient. The biologically active nature of these products has given rise to the potential of using D -Galactose derivatives as a building block for the making of compounds that could be used in the treatment of a variety of diseases, such as diabetes. One particularly intriguing molecule is currently being investigated, for which results will be disclosed once research is complete.

This study was set up in glass test tubes containing hydroxyapatite discs, an artificial saliva and 5 percent natural saliva combination, Strepto coccus mutans, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Food items from three meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) were selected for each diet, blended to form a consistent mixture, and added to 25 percent final volume in the test tubes. Biofilms were grown for 48, 60, and 72 hours. Biofilm density was measured quantitatively using a crystal violet assay. Cell number was determined using a vortexing -sonication -vortexing method to remove biofilm cells from the discs, followed by plating. Preliminary results show biofi lm formation on the hydroxyapatite discs was significantly higher for both methods compared to a control, which contained saliva combination, Ketogenic diet mixture, and no organisms. For the zero -time control, where the discs were briefly immersed in a ba cterial culture and then plated, there were no colonies present on the plates. When comparing biofilm formation on the walls of glass tubes to formation on the discs using a crystal violet assay, the discs had a higher absorbance, indicating a denser biofi lm, and justifying use of the discs. These preliminary results suggest that hydroxyapatite discs are sufficient substrates for biofilm formation. The zero -time control demonstrates only biofilm cells, not planktonic cells, are being measured. It can also b e concluded that the growth medium is suitable for growth of the biofilms.

One of the greatest barriers to treatment of NSCLC brain metastases is the shift of the blood -brain barrier (BBB), the tightest barrier in the body, tot the blood -tumor barrier (BTB). The BTB stands as one of the greatest barriers to effective delivery of therapeutics, including chemotherapies and other targeted therapies, to brain metastases. There is a gap in our knowledge of the molecular and pathologic characteristics of the BTB in brain metastases of lung cancer. We have establis hed a reliable experimental model of brain metastases of lung cancer using A549 -Br cells and defined the characteristics of the BTB tight junctions using immunofluorescence microscopy. In this study, athymic nude mice, which are T -cell deficient and were u sed as xenograft models to facilitate the growth of human cancer cell lines. To form brain metastases, cells were injected via ultrasound guided -intracardiac injection. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of immunofluorescence microscopy samples revealed a 1.38 -fold increase in capillary diameter in the BTB compared to the BBB after 4 and 6 weeks of A549 -Br cellular colonization. More interestingly, after six weeks of cellular colonization, there was a 1.41 -fold (p<0.001) increase in expression of the ti ght junction protein, claudin -5, in the BTB compared to the BBB. These preliminary data provide a foundation for continued investigation into tight junction proteins in the BTB, as they may serve as therapeutic targets in brain metastases of lung cancer.

These pesticide intensive practices, however, can be detrimental to aquatic ecosystems. Direct pesticide exposure through runoff or cont aminated soil has lethal and sublethal effects on pond communities, especially amphibians. In addition to the threat of pesticide exposure, amphibians are susceptible to ranavirus, an infectious disease that has been linked to declines in amphibian populat ions. A recent study has shown that chronic exposure to a singular pesticide can influence ranaviral infection rates (Pochini & Hoverman, 2017); however, amphibians are likely to face a mixture of pesticides of different types while in their larval stage. In this study, we examined how chronic exposure to various pesticide and their mixtures influences ranaviral disease risk, specifically in larval gray tree frogs (Hyla versicolor). We chose three pesticides that are widely used in Indiana to constitute our pesticide mixtures: an herbicide (atrazine), an insecticide (clothianidin) and a fungicide (azoxystrobin). The tadpoles were chronically exposed to either one or a combination of two pesticides prior to ranavirus exposure. At the conclusion of the study, we analyzed how the pesticide mixtures influenced infection and mortality rates. Our results revealed no significant infection or mortality differences between treatments, and all treatments, including the virus -exposed controls, resulted in uncharacterist ically low infection rates. Our future efforts will be directed toward understanding what caused the low infection rates.

Although the 5 -year survival rate has increased from 6% to 90% in the last 30 years from the introduction of imatinib, there are several mutated forms of the cancer that are resistant treatment. Treatments such as Ponatinib can be used to treat CML patients that harbor the T315I mutation, but they have toxic effects on the body. Safer treatmen ts need to be discovered to inhibit the proliferation of these resistant lines by inhibiting the activity of proteins and mutated proteins. Through research done utilizing cell cultures of CML lines K562 and KCL22 and the resistant line KCL22 -IR, several c ompounds have been found to be effective in inhibiting the proliferation of these cancer cell lines. This research suggests that isoquinoline - or napthyridine - based compounds could be safer alternatives for treating drug resistant CML.

Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) I evaluate a sample of 11,434 young adults (ages 18 -26 in 2001 -2002) on their experiences with non - parental mentors during adolescence and young adulthood. Description of the characteristics of mentors and the type of mentorship provided are prese nted. The association of characteristics of mentors and type of mentorship with young adult well -being were estimated. Seventy -six percent of young adults indicated that they had a non -parent adult who made a positive difference in their life. For these yo ung adults, 66% say these mentors are still important in their lives. These mentors were described as relatives (26%), teachers or counselors (15%), or friends (13%). These mentors were reported to primarily provide advice and guidance, emotional support, and role modeling. Preliminary analyses suggests that having an adult mentor in adolescence and young adulthood is generally associated with positive outcomes in several domains. The benefits of different types of mentorship will be described. Descriptive and inferential statistics were obtained using The STATA Programming Language version 15.

Cdc14 preferentially recognizes Cdk phosphorylation sites with the sequence pSer -Pro-X-Lys (X is ideally Lys or Arg). In most PTPs, a conserved catalytic core is sufficien t for full activity. However, in Cdc14 enzymes, the non -conserved C -terminal tail appears to make a large contribution to activity. My project was to identify what part of the C -terminal region contributes to catalysis and to test if it is biologically imp ortant in yeast cells. Multiple -sequence alignments revealed a widely conserved amino acid sequence, Gln -Pro-Arg-Lys, in the C -terminal tail in all fungal species. We hypothesized that this motif mimics a substrate and contributes to activity by interactin g with the active site. A truncated enzyme that included QPRK had similar catalytic activity as a full -length enzyme, whereas a truncated enzyme lacking QPRK was catalytically deficient. Point mutation of the QPRK sequence into QARA resulted in a catalytic defect similar to the truncation missing QPRK, confirming that this motif is the functionally important part of the C -terminal tail. Growth assays demonstrated that this motif is biologically important to yeast cells. Future directions include characteriz ing the mechanism by which the QPRK motif contributes to activity. Since Cdc14 is essential for fungal pathogenesis, detailed knowledge of its catalytic mechanism could guide the development of novel antifungal agents.

Here, we set out to investigate rare genetic variation in patients with MG by analyzing copy number variants (CNVs). CNVs occur when the number of copies o f a specific gene varies in the population. Our study represents the first attempt to examine this type of genetic variation in association to MG. We studied a dataset of 1,243 European MG cases and 2,569 ancestry -matched healthy controls. To increase sens itivity, we used two software tools, PennCNV and QuantiSNP, to call the CNVs and collect consensual calls. We performed a quality control to filter out low confidence variants and included only the rare (freq < 0.01) variants in the downstream analyses. We conducted several CNV burden tests to evaluate if there were differences between cases and controls and found an increased burden in duplications in cases. We performed association tests to detect variants that are associated with MG. We analyzed duplicat ions and deletions both independently and jointly. We obtained 33 regions of interest from the joint, genome -wide analysis; upon analyzing CNVs in known genes, we found 47 genic regions associated with MG. Identified genes were found to be associated with conditions having similar pathologies. The implications of this study are vast, as this is the first CNV study for MG and its results can contribute to the exploration of the genetic architecture of MG.

Author: Kiersten Nelson Abstract: Amphibian populations are declining globally at a historically unprecedented rate. Numerous examples of these population declines have occurred in seemingly pri stine environments, where human disturbance is minimal. One factor that may be responsible for many of these declines is the high susceptibility of amphibian species to chytridiomycosis, a potentially deadly skin disease caused by the fungal parasite Batra chochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). In Central America, many of these declines have been observed at high elevation sites. We examined prevalence and infection intensity of Bd in amphibian assemblages across an elevational gradient in Costa Rica (from 0 -2500 m elevation), in both versants (Caribbean and Pacific). We swabbed 265 frogs to detect Bd and quantified the pathogenic load though qPCR approaches in eight localities between 2015 -2017. We hypothesized that all study locations would exhibit low to intermed iate levels of Bd prevalence and intensity of infection suggesting enzootic dynamics. We also hypothesized that disease prevalence and intensity would increase with elevation, because midlands and highlands of Central America are suggested to exhibit optim al ranges of temperature and humidity similar to those where Bd grows best in lab conditions. We found a very low prevalence of Bd (19%) and low infection intensity (0.1 -94.5 genomic equivalents) in one of our lowland sites (Foothills of Talamanca Mountain Range, 300 -600 m elevation) on the Caribbean side, which matches with our predictions. We also found six Bd -positive species at lowland sites (Leptodactylus ridens, Smilisca phaeota, and S. sordida) This value coincides with similar studies that show mid to low Bd prevalence and low infection intensity in lowlands, indicating enzootic dynamics. These findings demonstrate that Bd can be present in multiple species at low elevations, even though most of the documented die -offs associated with Bd have occurred at higher elevations.

They have properties that make them appealing to different fields, such as medicine and agriculture, because they can be used to target and terminate undesired bacterial colonies. Sequencing and annotation of the genome encoded by different phages is of great import ance due to the fact that the more knowledge we have about these viruses, the more we can use them for designing tools for the mentioned fields. The focus of this paper is on the discovery, sequencing and analysis of the genetic code of a unique phage. Cor azon was isolated from a Mycobacterium smegmatis mc\u00b2155 host found in Easton, PA and is a siphoviridae phage. It belongs to the cluster \"S\" and has a lytic life cycle. We will be conducting our analysis through the electronic tool, DNA Master. During our examination, we will evaluate start/stop codons, coding potential, start choice source, gap, and longest ORF. Additionally, we will look at Starterator, Phamerator, Function Analysis, NCBI Blast, Local Nucleotide Blast, Phagesdb, and HHPred. Our analysis so far has proven that genes in the middle of Corazon genome have specific functions and were mostly auto -annotated. In conclusion, our goal is to discover and sequence new phages. This is crucial because phage DNA can be used to solve questions about gene s tructure, organization, regulation, and function that may provide the scientific community with new genes that may have therapeutic and diagnostic uses as mentioned before.

A novel genome editing tool, ASGARD, was developed in our laboratory as a more flexible tool for editing genomes without a binding site requirement, in contrast to the currently popular CRISPR systems (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Despite ASGARD's attractive characteristics, it suffers from low efficiency and off -target activity. We aim to mutate ASGARD and design a screening system that selects for mutants that display highly efficient DNA cleavage activ ity with minimal off -target effects. As current methods fail to fulfill our needs, we created a new positive screening method based on a homing endonuclease, I -SceI. I -SceI, encoded on a plasmid, could create a deadly double stranded break in the E. coli genome unless our ASGARD mutants efficiently cut the I -SceI plasmid, rescuing the cell from I -SceI activity and preventing a double stranded break in the genome. Survived cells will then contain DNA encoding highly efficient ASGARDs for the next round of di rected evolution. Using the inducible I -SceI system, we have halted cell growth by over 50%, illustrating our system's potential as a selection screen. We now aim to rescue cell growth targeting ASGARD to the I -SceI plasmid. Using a high efficiency select ion system for directed evolution could lead to a highly active programmable endonuclease which will efficiently cut dsDNA without the limitation of a binding sequence, expanding the toolkits for genome engineering Research Mentor : Michael Mechikoff, Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, College of Engineering ; Kok Zhi Lee, Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, College of Engineering Poster Number: 189b :: Life Sciences College of Science AAV CRISPR Delivery Author: Alexa Parker Abstract: Since its discovery in 2015, CRISPR -Cas9 gene -editing technology has opened the door to exciting advances in immunotherapy development for treating cancer and infectious disease.

The first goal of the proposed research project is to generate adeno -associated viruses (AA V-DJ) as a potential delivery system of the CRISPR -Cas9 system to cells in vitro. So far we have transfected HEK 293 cells with a lenti -viral vector system the lab has used before in order to have a standard of comparison for the AAV-DJ system. We are curr ently working on obtaining the particular cell line which will be transfected with the AAV-DJ recombinant viral vectors for virus production. This AAV -DJ \"transfer vector\" is currently being modified by our lab to include the Cas9 endonuclease from Staphyl ococcus aureus (SaCas9) and guide RNAs designed to target either the NPC1 or SPCS1 gene for excision by the SaCas9 endonuclease. The second goal is to test the efficiency of this delivery system for CRISPR -mediated gene deletions and then evaluate its potential as a preventative immunotherapy against Ebola infection. Upon purification of the virus generated by the AAV -DJ viral vector system, we will determine the transduction efficiency and tissue - type specificity of our recombinant virus using a variet y of cultured cell lines each representing different human tissues. This CRISPR -based system will allow us to knock out the genes of interest in the HEK 293 cells and other human cell lines. The last step will be to analyze the transduction efficiency and tissue specificity data to evaluate this vector system's potential effectiveness in immunotherapy applications for preventing Ebola infection in vivo.

ICMT plays a major role in the correct function of K -Ras, a CaaX box protein. CaaX proteins require three post -translational modifications including isoprenylation of the cysteine residue, proteolysis of the -aaX motif, and methylation to be localized to the plasma me mbrane for proper function. ICMT carries out the final step of this process by methylating the carboxyl group of the C - terminus of K -Ras. This information is critical when K -Ras becomes mutated, causing an oncogenic signaling pathway. Mutated K -Ras is resp onsible for approximately 90% of pancreatic cancers and 30% of all cancers. The role of ICMT in K -Ras signaling makes it a viable target for chemotherapeutic drugs. Inhibition of ICMT can decrease the likelihood of K -Ras localization, effectively stopping K-Ras signaling. In our research, we perform various biochemical techniques, including site -directed mutagenesis, subcloning, immunoblotting, and radioactive activity assays to determine how individual residues within the binding site of the ICMT cofactor, S -Adenosyl methionine (SAM). The conformational dynamics of co -factor (SAM) and substrate binding (including K -ras) is currently unknown. Currently, we are working to amplify the expression of the yeast ICMT, Ste14, and Ste14 mutants through a ba culoviral expression system in Sf9 cells. Successful transformations will result in higher Ste14 yields that is necessary for activity assays and other biophysical assays.

The purpose of this experiment is to analyze mitochondrial DNA haplotype frequenc ies, using region 1751 - 3014 mitochondrial gene, to determine if Phormia regina interspecific variations exceed intraspecific variations present for this gene region. The analyzed haplotypes would come from 50 Phormia regina specimens from a popu lation in Knoxville, Tennessee and 50 Phormia regina specimens from a population in Dover, Delaware. Analyzing two distinct populations will allow for comparison of the haplotype frequencies from each populations' analyzed CO1 sequence to reveal any signif icant intraspecific variances. These identifying factors in the mitochondrial genome could be used to confidently classify Phormia regina specimens by region using means of genetic analysis. This would be an important advancement in forensic entomology as it could provide a means for genetic identification of morphologically similar specimens.

The pathogenesis of IPF is not completely understood w hich makes it difficult to find a cure for the disease. Nintedanib and Pirfenidone are two FDA approved drugs currently available for the treatment of IPF. These drugs show some positive effect on the treatment, but do not completely cure IPF. Macrophag es play an important role in fibrosis. It is commonly believed that the phenotype of profibrotic macrophages are like the M2 subtype, whereas the anti -fibrotic population are more like M1. Based on previously conducted in -vitro studies, the Toll like recep tor-7 agonist was successful in reprogramming the M2 macrophages to the M1 subtype. The in -vitro study results led to in -vivo studies being conducted using the TLR -7 agonist. This agonist targets the folate receptor beta + macrophage to slow down the progression of Pulmonary Fibrosis in a C576L6 mice model. Black male mice are injected intratracheally with a single dose of bleomycin, inducing lung fibrosis, and then treated with the TLR -7 agonist. The main end points include survival rate and progressi on of fibrosis. By comparing with the disease control and healthy control, our compound can increase the survival and decrease the progression of fibrosis determined by the hydroxyproline assay, H&E staining and trichrome staining. Ongoing in -vivo studies are experimenting on drug dosage and frequency, to receive the optimal regimen for the treatment of IPF. These further studies could lead to a potential treatment for IPF.

In 1927, the answer to this problem was invented: the artificial respirator, otherwise coined as \"the iron lung\" (The Iron). This machine was the s ole reason why many patients survived polio, due to Emerson refining the design to make it more affordable (The Iron). Instead of an iron lung costing the same price as a home, Emerson gave the device a makeover so the common American could afford this lif e saving device (The Iron). Without this device, the survival rate of Polio would be a fraction of what it was. The device worked by a motor hooked up to two vacuums - allowing for constriction and expansion of the patient's chest (The Iron). In my mind, n ot only did this help increase the survival rate, but possibly influenced the age of biomedical engineering and the invention of artificial organs that we implicate today.

Current treatment includes clinical management , but no drugs are being used to manage the pathophysiology of the disease. Our lab has discovered that inducing phosphorylation on a membrane protein called band 3 results in erythrocyte fragmentation triggering a release of free hemoglobin and erythrocyt e-derived microparticles into the bloodstream causing painful vaso -occlusion seen in patients. SYK inhibitors such as Imatinib prevent phosphorylation of band 3 and reduce the intensity of these events. Imatinib has already shown promising results through experimentation. Since Imatinib can inhibit multiple kinases, the purpose of our research is to test other SYK inhibitors to confirm that the success seen by Imatinib is truly the result of blocking the tyrosine phosphorylation. The SYK inhibitors to be te sted include R406, PRT062607, and S701 which all inhibit SYK more specifically to prevent microparticle release. The effect of the drugs can be measured by quantifying the phosphorylation of band 3 using western blot, microparticle release through flow cyt ometry, and release of free hemoglobin from sickled erythrocytes. The ultimate decrease in hemolysis as a result of treatment may introduce new perspectives to using drug therapy in order to control the side effects of SCD. Research M entor : Panae Noomuna, Chemistry, College of Science ; Poster Number: 195b :: Physical Sciences College of Science An Investigation of the Spatial Redistribution of Tornado Activity Versus Precipitation Patterns Author: Abby Sebol Abstract: A spatial red istribution of maximum annual tornado activity has been observed in the U.S. resulting in a decrease in the traditional tornado alley located in Texas/Oklahoma to an increasingly recognized area known as 'Dixie Alley' centered in Alabama/Tennessee. This sh ift has occurred between two defined time spans: Period I (1954 -1983) and Period II (1984 -2013). The cause of this change is not yet known, however precipitation could be a factor. With more tornadoes, there exists more convective available potential energ y (CAPE). More CAPE is accompanied with updrafts and clouds which would therefore lead to more rain. Precipitation reanalysis data obtained from the Climate Prediction Center are analyzed for the same periods and within the same domain to examine the patte rn and search for any correlation between precipitation and tornadoes. Both tornado days and events for (E)F1 - (E)F5 tornadoes are used as well as rain amounts and frequencies (days with rain greater than 1 mm). Based on these results, there appears to be no evidence of an annual increase (decrease) of precipitation where there is an increase (decrease) of tornadoes. In the Central Plains where there has been a reduction of tornadoes, there is a greater amount and frequency of precipitation. There is also a negative precipitation change in the Dixie Alley region of increased tornado activity. Seasonal changes were also investigated. Most of the annual tornado activity increase in Dixie Alley is found in the spring season (when there is the most decrease in p recipitation). Also, most of the annual increase in precipitation for the Central Plains is found in the summer season (which is accompanied by decreasing tornado events). The analysis suggests that a shift of precipitation patterns is not related to the spatial redistribution of tornado activity. Research into these changes continues and may be associated with a climate change phenomenon known as the 'warming hole'.

PFAS are an emerging contaminant of concern due to potential effects on the health of humans and wi ldlife via endocrine -disrupting effects. We have previously demonstrated that PFAS can reduce growth and delay development of larval amphibians. The goal of this study is to establish a relationship between PFAS exposure in northern leopard frogs and thyro id toxicity. We exposed frogs to different concentrations of four different PFAS (PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS and 6:2 FTS) for 31 days and collected their thyroid glands for histopathological examination. We examined a total of 26 thyroid specimens and assessed chan ges in follicular size, cell height and colloidal content. This method will assist in linking endocrine disruption of thyroid hormones to sublethal effects of PFAS observed in our previous experiments.

We use a combination of stochastic simulation and operational data a nalysis for estimating the arrival rate, assuming a nonhomogeneous Poisson process model of patient arrivals. We used a data -set containing the patient id (id), entry route (ED_Entry_Route), ambulance type (ED_Entry_Ambulance_Type), and exact arrival time (ED_Entry_Ambulance_Type). Using the arrival time feature, we estimate a piecewise constant and piecewise linear arrival rate function with varying interval aggregation. We compared the simulated queue length with the queue length generated from the actual dataset. Results show that aggregated data in intervals shorter than 60 minutes provide a consistent arrival rate function. However, the mean difference statistics favor data aggregated over longer intervals, but this risks losing resolution. We also ext ended this analysis to spatio -temporal arrival models. These types of models can be used in a larger model intended for the performance analysis of urban mobility systems, such as the Bird Scooter network. To include space into the rate function, we perfor m Poisson Random Field simulation, supposing that l(t, x, y) is a separable function, l(t, x, y) = f(x, y) l(t). We used Gibb's sampling to sample from the spatial nonhomogeneous Poisson process. In our simulations, we assume a fixed number of bird scooter s travel between two areas. Our research suggests further directions including adding travel time, more locations, and non-separable request rate functions. This research was conducted in collaboration with Anna Tatara (B.S. I.E., 2016), graduate student in the School of Industrial Engineering, and under the guidance of Prof. Harsha Honnappa, Assistant Professor, School of Industrial Engineering.

However, patients with PD also have problems with their speech, particularly with vocal intensity, although the reasons fo r these impairments are not entirely clear. A new device treatment on the market, SpeechVive, has been shown to increase vocal intensity. Current speech treatment paradigms require the patient to come into a clinic for treatment. Due to limitations in mobi lity and increased fatigue, traveling to speech treatment sessions can be difficult for patients. The purpose of this study is to examine the potential of using telemedicine to provide treatment with the SpeechVive device. Ten participants with PD were enr olled. Participants chose which modality they preferred (5 chose face -to-face and 5 chose telemedicine). Speech was measured before and after three months of treatment. The primary outcome measure was vocal intensity. Secondary outcome measures included a patient -report outcome measure and speech rate. Results will be discussed with respect to effectiveness of telemedicine treatment delivery.

One drawback to many of these biosensors made with fluorescent proteins is that the light required to excite the protein is often harmful to live cells or does not efficiently penetrate thick biological tissues. Chemiluminescent luciferases offer an alternative to fluorescent proteins because they do not require excitation light. Currently, a blue chemiluminescent protein, NanoLuciferase, engineere d from a deep -sea shrimp, has become the brightest chemiluminescent protein to date. However, its blue emission has such a short wavelength that the light is easily absorbed and scattered, making its detection through thick tissue samples inefficient. By c ombining NanoLuciferase with a long Stokes shift red fluorescent protein (RFP), GRvT, a new red luminescent protein is being developed which utilizes the phenomenon of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). Molecular biology techniques were used to clone the DNA for the two proteins into a plasmid. Next, the expression of the protein was optimized by growth in different cell and media types. Finally, the protein was purified and characterized to determine its capabilities as a biosensor for tissu e imaging. When the chemiluminescent protein reacts with its substrate, coelenterazine, it becomes excited and transfers its energy to the RFP, causing it to emit red light now detectable through thick tissue samples. By engineering a red light emitting ch emiluminescent protein, harmful side effects of excitation light required for fluorescent biosensors such as cytotoxicity can be avoided.

The event was caused by a high wind gust from an approaching severe thunderstorm. In light of this tragedy, Purdue established new wind speed limits of 30 mph (13 m s -1) for tents at outdoor events. During these events, volunteers stand outsid e with handheld anemometers, measuring and reporting when the wind speeds exceed the limit. The recent installation of the XTRRA near Purdue campus may allow these alerts to be automated. The XTRRA, which runs continuously, scans the atmosphere at low elev ations over campus every few minutes. Using the data collected during its first few months of operation, we developed an automated system that generates high wind alerts whenever observed winds at altitudes below 412 m (considered indicative of surface con ditions) exceed the threshold of 13 m s -1. A combination of median filtering, clutter filtering, and statistical outlier removal mitigated false alarms caused by noise and ground clutter. Further testing and modification of the alert parameters will minimi ze the overall occurrence of false alarms. The high wind alerts will then be distributed to interested parties such as campus event coordinators and safety officials. In the future, alerts will also be generated from the XTRRA data for other forms of sever e weather, such as hail and mesocyclones (a precursor to tornadoes).

This study tes ted the effects of blueberries added to a regular diet on bone mineral retention in postmenopausal women. The isotope 41Ca, a long -lived radio isotope of calcium, was used to label the skeleton and track bone resorption. A controlled randomized clinical tr ial was completed in 14 women at least 4 years past menopause. The treatment involved a 5 -mo equilibration period followed by a 6 -wk baseline and 3 alternating 6 -wk treatment and washout phases, each corresponding to a different dose of blueberries (low, m edium, and high). The participants recruited for this study were healthy, slightly overweight (average BMI: 26.2 kg/m2), and non -osteoporotic (average bone mineral density: 1.1 g/cm3, average t -score: - 1.33). This study will provide information on potentia l alternative therapies for osteoporosis and a better understanding of the impact of blueberries on bone health in humans.

Given their health promoting properties, they are increasingly marketed as dietary supplements. As the popularity of herbal and botanical dietary supplements grows, consumers are being exposed to far higher doses of polyphenols than found in nature. Although the health benefits of these compounds are well documented from dietary sources, little is known about the safety of high doses found in dietary supplements. This study explores the safety of high doses of blu eberry polyphenols by employing a 90 - day sub -chronic toxicology model to determine these effects. Methods: Following OECD standards for a 90 -day sub -chronic toxicology model, 5 -month -old, ovariectomized, Sprague -Dawley rats were randomized to treatment gr oups, with each given a different concentration of blueberry polyphenols (0, 50, 300, or 1000 mg/kg bw/d). To mimic dietary supplement consumption, animals are gavaged daily. Throughout the study, animals are monitored for changes in body weight and food consumption. Upon completion of the study, animals will be sacrificed and a complete necropsy performed to detect changes in tissue morphology. Major tissues will be excised and fixed in formalin, and blood collected for hematology and clinical biochemistry . Results: This study is currently ongoing, though no changes in overall health status, food intake, or body weight have been observed to date. Further results will be presented at the Undergraduate Research Poster Symposium. Conclusions: This study will p rovide insight into the effects of high doses of polyphenols, as may be found in dietary supplements. Results from this study will provide information about toxicity that will inform safety guidelines for polyphenols. Research Mentor : Dennis P.

Flaviviruses are enveloped icosahedral viruses with a single strand RNA genome. In the cell, the viral genome is tra nslated into a single polyprotein, which is subsequently processed into three structural proteins and seven nonstructural proteins. At the ER interface, the structural proteins C, prM, and E form the viral particle through an in -budding event involving bot h viral and host proteins as assembly machinery. Interestingly, the structural proteins alone are capable of forming membranous particles with characteristics similar to virions. These structures, termed subviral particles (SVPs) consist of only prM and E, and offer appealing advantages in therapeutic and experimental areas. SVPs present the viral proteins in a lipid membrane context, but distinct structural differences between SVPs and virions have been observed. Further study of SVP structure could provid e important insight on assembly dynamics, particle budding, and virion structural asymmetry. The efficient expression and secretion of SVPs is essential to accomplish this goal, but available procedures for the production of SVPs vary greatly. SVP construc ts containing the structural proteins from various flaviviruses were designed and then produced using PCR. Plasmid constructs were then transfected into mammalian cell lines. The relative expression levels of viral structural proteins were characterized us ing SDS -PAGE followed by western blotting. After sufficient SVP production is achieved, structural analysis can be accomplished.

Notably, GdMnAl has been found to display a h igh magnetic transition temperature (275 K) among the series, which is attributed to the decrease of the number of d -electrons at the Fermi level compared to the other compounds (Co -Cu). Thus, we have substituted other transition metals (Ti, Cr, Fe) for Mn in GdMnAl with the goal of improving its magnetic properties. The structural and physical properties of these new compounds will be highlighted. Research Mentor : George Agbeworvi ; Corey M.

Wilker Abstract: We are presenting a new general chemistry laboratory experiment based on a research paper published in Advanced Sustainable Systems, 2018, 2 (3), 1700159. The research paper is about making and evaluating mussel mimetic glue. Marine mussels are known for sticking to rocks but mussel glue is very expensive. The authors are using corn protein in stead of mussel protein and tannic acid for cross -linking. Tensile testing instruments and lap shear experiments are used to determine adhesive strength. The results are compared to commercial Elmer's Glue and Super Glue. The objectives of the chemistry la boratory experiment are as follows: i) Develop hands -on skills on how to formulate a mussel -mimetic polymer glue from corn protein, ethanol and tannic acid. ii) Measure and record data in simplified lap -shear testing experiments. iii) Analyze data, calcula te adhesion strength and generate evidence supported conclusions. For the new laboratory experiment a simplified tensile testing device (= hanging scale) is used and cotton ribbons for specimen. The cotton substrates with the applied adhesives are overlapp ed, pressed together, and then dried/cured. When the adhesive is cured, the hanging scale is used to pull the substrates in opposite directions until they separate. The adhesion strength is measured and divided by the surface area. The results are compared to literature values. Students learn about polymers, cross -linking, molecular interactions, and adhesion testing.

Schwenk.(2018)What is the Correct Way to Seed a Knockout Tournament? Retrieved from The American Mathematical Monthly' , Schwenk identified a surprising weakness in the standard method of seeding a single elimination (or knockout) tournament. In par ticular, he showed that for a certain probability model for the outcomes of games it can be the case that the top seeded team would be less likely to win the tournament than the second seeded team. This raises the possibility that in certain situations it might be advantageous for a team to intentionally lose a game in an attempt to get a more optimal (though possibly lower) seed in the tournament. We examine this question in the context of a four or eight team league which consists of a round robin ''reg ular season'' followed by a single elimination tournament with seedings determined by the results from the regular season. Using the same probability model as Schwenk we show that there are situations where it is indeed optimal for a team to intentionally lose. Moreover, we show how a team can make the decision as to whether or not it should intentionally lose. We did two detailed analysis. One is for the situation where other teams always try to win every game. The other is for the situation where other te ams are smart enough, namely they can also lose some games intentionally if necessary. The analysis involves computations in both probability and (multi -player) game theory.

The inflammation or obstruction is caused by environmental allergens such as dust, mold spores and mites. Sensible management practices do not allow for the practical avoidance of these allergens, the possible reduction of allergen exposure can improve clinical scores but clinical interven tion and drug therapy is required for the horses to become asymptomatic. Historically, intravenous corticosteroids like dexamethasone and prednisolone have been used because they are cheap and effective. However, overuse of intravenous corticosteroids ha s proven to have drastic negative side effects which can be potentially life -threatening. Inhaled corticosteroids decrease the systemic absorption and side effects but are more costly than intravenous corticosteroids. Bronchodilators have also been used t o treat equine asthma by means of allowing more air to flow through to the bronchioles. This study uses the results from past research that shows that nebulized dexamethasone is safe and effective in horses. The use of a bronchodilator immediately before the administration of the nebulized corticosteroid allows for better delivery of the drug into the bronchioles. The purpose of this study is to determine both the safety and efficacy of the combination of nebulized albuterol as well as nebulized dexameth asone. We the nebulized dexamethasone along with the nebulized albuterol will increase pulmonary function (as measured by amount of pressure difference required to move a volume of air) without the systemic absorption caused by intravenous administration.

Despite PTSD being a public health issue with a socioeconomic impact, non -scholarly debate is the primary source of information on the non-medical burden of PTSD. The majority of scholarly evidence focuses on PTSD primarily as a medical condition, including when addressing the problem from a socioeconomic standpoint. In fact, most of the recent scholarly evidence points to specific areas of PTSD, such as the psychiatric symptoms and their effect on behavior and interpersonal interactions, but fail to provide a comprehensive review of the condition and its overall impact in the life of the returning veterans. This research leverages references from a wider time range to present an overview of PTSD from doctors and researchers on ho w to best address this problem. Most of the authors agree that medical intervention is the most important approach to help veterans with PTSD regaining their role in society. There is ongoing debate on whether the medical treatment has to be paired to othe r social -based interventions.

Author: Matthew Campbell Abstract: While the insurance industry may not be able to solve the issue of climate change, as one of America's largest industries, using risk management methodologies and providing financial backing, the impact the industry can have may be surprising. Being uniquely positioned between both ends of the climat e change spectrum, the causes and the impacts, the industry has a pivotal role in using their methods and technologies to help create change. In this paper we will explore some of the current strategies the industry has in place, as well as some recommenda tions for future change. As technology evolves, firms are facing sets of data of unseen size and complexity. By using innovative solutions such as machine learning, data analytics, and statistics; data analysts are finding new ways to tap into this data to find faster and more optimal solutions for firms to implement. New companies focusing on cloud computing and machine learning are forming that allow managers to predict and manage the risk caused by severe weather and climate change. By being one of the largest institutional investors, we are also seeing insurance firms investing more capital into green investments. Offering premium discounts will incentivize homeowners to install durable improvements like hurricane - resistant doors and fire blocks, and the se measurers will help reduce the risk of filing a claim and prevent future property loss. Insurers could also offer a discount for installing ecofriendly products such as solar panels and power producing windmills. Some insurance firms are already offerin g discounts like these, and as more firms adopt new policies we can expect to see much greater popularity. After examining the nature of climate change and taking a broad look at the insurance industries operations we can see that there is quite a role tha t the industry can pl ay in fighting climate change.

Each party now has access to more information about the other than ever before; consequentially, changing the way companies market to their consumer base. The influx of data created by advancing technology has overwhelmed the corporate world leaving companies with more information than the y know what to do with. This data has been used to better services and experiences for customers and create new and innovative products, but it has also been used in ways that take advantage of a person's private and personal information. This paper will assess how companies use online consumer data and how the use of this data is essential to the online experience consumers have become accustomed to. These practices will also be looked at through an ethical and legal lens to evaluate whether or not consu mer data should be permitted to be used in such fashion, especially in regards to the rights consumers have to data privacy. Although the United States does not currently have legislation in place regulating the use of online consumer data, there is simila r legislation throughout the world that will be used to propose how the United States should address the issue of data privacy.

Existing li terature illustrates support for the retrieval hypothesis and the testing effect due to repetition and active learning, thus making SAFMEDS an effective studying strategy. Differing from traditional flashcards, SAFMEDS are based on the concept of saying th e vocabulary word aloud with an emphasis on speed. This study's purpose is to analyze how the repetitive use of SAFMEDS affect test scores. Examining SAFMEDS as instructional devices and assessment tools will give insight into the effects of fluency -based techniques on retention and accuracy. I predicted a positive relationship between SAFMEDS quiz scores and exam scores. There were 173 undergraduates from an Introduction to Cognitive Psychology class at a large midwestern public research university that pa rticipated in this study and the participants came from a variety of academic programs. During in -class SAFMEDS timings, students studied for 3 -5 minutes and were timed for one minute, attempting to achieve as many correct responses as possible. A partner held up the definition side of the SAFMEDS and the participants said aloud the vocabulary word. Cards were split up between correct, incorrect, and skip. For quizzes, participants were given five minutes to type the 40 vocabulary words next to the definiti on shown. These repeated SAFMEDS quizzes show the testing effect to varying degrees. As a retrieval practice and instructional tool, SAFMEDS are shown to be an effective study method. They lead to improved performance as compared to flashcards due to their emphasis on fluency rather than accuracy. In the future, I'd like to conduct more research into the impact of SAFMEDS on length of retention.

Since the 1990s, documented and estimated cases of Lyme Disease have been on the rise globally along with other diseases spread by human - animal contact. It has been well documented that urbanization \u2014\"[the] rapid intensification of agriculture, socioeconomic change, and ecological fragmentation\" \u2014is associated with an increas e in zoonotic disease rates (Hassell, Begon, Ward, & F\u00e8vre, 2017). Thus, the focus of the study was to break down urbanization in order to specifically examine the expansion of city boundaries and its relation to rates of Lyme Disease in the United States. The expected outcome was for the areas on the edge of expanding city boundaries to have increased risk of Lyme Disease due to the clash of a pre -existing natural ecosystem with the urban ecosystem moving in. Data from the CDC and US Census bureau were me rged including population density, the classification of county (urban, peri -urban, and rural), and rates of Lyme Disease. A generalized linear regression was used to examine the relation between rates of Lyme Disease, and the classification of each county controlling for population. Results indicated that there were greater instances per person of Lyme Disease in counties that were classified as urban.

A historical perspective is established through a literature review aimed at understanding trends in propaganda methods and their outcomes in particular political and cultural environments. A collection of written news articles, in both Chi nese and English, was collected from online Chinese state -sponsored media sources. The selected texts often reflected the particular agenda of the controlling party, the Chinese Communist Party. The perspective of the media varied between positive, neutral or negative, containing explicit messages and more sophisticated methods of implication and manipulation. Throughout the process of data collection and annotation, textual differences and similarities were recorded with their given technique and implied i ntent. The recorded results were compared with historical perspective with the goal of recognizing anomalies in the data. The texts are then processed by machine learning algorithms and results are analyzed. While the analysis is focused on Chinese media reports, the findings are expected to be applicable to a wider range of information materials and countries. Research Mentor : Julia Rayz, Computer and Information Technology, Purdue Polytechnic Institute ; Poster Number: 218b :: Innovative Technology/Entrepreneurship/Design Polytechnic Institute Applications of Mobile Robots in Construction Education Author: William Hubbard Abstract: Robots have been a new focus lately in the construction industry. While many projects have been successfully completed using stationary robots or even semi -stationary robots, this research project is focused on what mobile robots can achieve. Specifically, the attention for this project is given to a GoPiGo unit that utilizes a RasberryPi for compreh ending coded instruction and direction. The objective to be achieved with this robot is to have it follow given directions to a specific location on a jobsite, where it will take a picture and record simple measurements such as temperature and humidity and promptly return to its original location. To begin the project, I contributed to the assembly of the GoPiGo unit alongside two other researchers and manually tested its maneuverability and speed. Then, time was taken to understand its environment record ing capabilities, such as its distance and height sensor. After these were evaluated, I began to construct simple tasks for the robot to do, such as travel a distance down a hallway and return. These simple tasks were made more complex and had more tasks a dded to them, such as changes in direction and temperature readings. After its capabilities were fully understood, I made a final test that stayed well within the limits of the robot but also achieved a practical task on a jobsite. In practice, this task could be used for simple jobsite inspections that might otherwise be unsafe for human construction workers to conduct due to environmental hazards. The impact I hope this research has is to allow future unsafe tasks to be undertaken by robots and keep cons truction workers out of harms way.

It is forecasted that in the near future they will create thousands of jobs and billions in tax revenue due to their ability to execute difficult and hazardous tasks safely, efficiently, and cost effectively. However, one current issue with the proliferation of the technology is a shortag e of skilled employees due to a lack of education and common negative public misperceptions associated with them. To investigate this, responses from a mixed methods survey will be analyzed. Within the survey, questions such as the participants age, educat ion level, current knowledge of sUAS, and their interest in learning more about the technology were asked. The new knowledge we hope to create is a clearer understanding about the challenges and barriers regarding public perceptions on sUAS. The examinati on of data may reveal how stakeholders can better communicate to the public in hopes of building a skilled and educated work force. One approach to changing misperceptions about drones is through formal and informal educational initiatives, which can engag e the public. The research will propose opportunities for higher education to play a role in educating the public through (1) aviation focused after -school programs, (2) transdisciplinary/interdisciplinary courses and programs incorporating aviation, (3) t he establishment of aviation minors and aviation university - level electives, (4) the development of informal aviation programs working with museums, and (5) facilitating summer aviation camps for high school students, to name a few. Research Mentor : Lisa Bosman, Technology Leadership and Innovation, Purdue Polytechnic Institute ; Julius Keller, School of Aviation and TransportationTechnology, Purdue Polytechnic Institute Poster Number: 220b :: Innovative Technology/Entrepreneurship/Des ign Polytechnic Institute Applications for Robotics in Construction Author: Christopher Lacny Abstract: Over the past fifty years, the construction industry has lagged behind other non -farming industries in its adoption of robotics and other automation technologies. Given the present workforce shortage in the construction industry, technical solutions that increase construction labor productivity could bring significant value. This project attempts to identify the unique needs of the construction industr y by comparing it to the manufacturing sector and outlines a novel design for a general -purpose robotic system developed to automate several labor -intensive tasks related to the framing of residential homes. The task of framing homes was chosen for this re search because no robotic systems presently exist to automate this particular task, and it provides an effective test bed to develop solutions that could be applied to a broader range of construction operations. The system is designed to operate alongside human workers to enable increases in productivity and improvements in worker safety, leveraging computer vision and advanced control algorithms to respond to the dynamic environment of a construction site. A small -scale prototype of the device was construc ted, and data was collected on its performance. This data will be used in future research to advise the development and testing of a full -scale device.

Accessibility is an essential factor of consideration because it allows students with visual impairments and other disabil ities to be smoothly integrated into courses. Purdue is making efforts to mandate accessibility within all departments, but there is still a significant gap that needs to be filled. One method of combating a limited document layout, and normalizing acces sibility, is to format electronic course documents to be fully compatible with a screen reader. The focus of this research is answering the question, \"how can data visualization activity worksheets be designed and made accessible for the visually impaired ?\" In this study, we will examine scholarly works that provide data visualization worksheets designed to guide novices through the visualization design process. We anticipate design decisions, in previously published works, were made with a focus on the c ontent, not accessibility. In this work, we are developing data visualization activity worksheets to introduce the data visualization process with a focus on accessibility and understanding the intricate stages of the process. The activity worksheets, for this study, are being designed and formatted according to Purdue's public manual, Accessibility for Instructional Design. Outcomes from this work will support and enable access for all communities and empower all persons to actively engage in the data vis ualization design process while meeting the requirements for accessibility of electronic information, communication, and technology.

This research team includes faculty and colleagues from five universities. We are working with data that rendered 72 petabytes of data. The goal is to understand the underlying structure of the mathematics for a large game theory problem. We want to be able to pick any three points in the parameters space of the problem and have our visualization show us the structure of the game in that region. It should be able to tell us what kind of data is stored at those points. If we look at the visualization as a whole we want to be able to hover or mouse over any area of the visualization and have a pop up come up to tell us what type of data it is. I am working on a refined visualization system of the data. We are planning to use D3.js, a javascript library, to visualize the data. This is a foundational game theory problem that has been open since the 1960s. By solving this problem we will further the understanding of a foundational problem in this area.

The research question which we are addressing in this project is: Do therapies differ between male and female adolescents with early onset SLE? There are many symptoms of SLE and it manifes ts in many ways. SLE does not discriminate by gender, both males and females are susceptible to SLE; however, the disease is more common in women during their childbearing years. Research suggests adolescents who suffer from SLE have higher morbidity and m ortality compared to adults. The data was provided by collaborators at Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health. The data was collected from 69 children with early onset SLE from 14 different centers. This prospective observational study as sessed subjects every 3 months, with average individual participation of 2 -3 years. Males were 9 -14 years old and females were 8 -13 years old at enrollment. All participants were enrolled near the onset of puberty and many remained in the study until puber ty was complete. Some participants enrolled in the study shortly before the conclusion of the study and therefore registered only 3 -4 visits. The data is extensive and inherently heterogeneous, therefore applying data visualization tools should make it eas ier to understand. We plan to utilize Cytoscape to create ring graphs of this data. Our expected outcome is to visualize the data so that it provides insight as to what the data represents in the relationships that exist between the variables in the data s et.

But as our integration of technology moves forward, we begin to face issues. One of these issues is the limit of materials that we can use, and the devices that is needed with new characteristics. One of the major issues is flexibility. In this Research, we are attempting to fabricate organic transistors that could be potentially used in thin flexible sensors, thin flexible neuromorphic networks, etc. The current research focus is to be able to stably fabricate Organic Field Effect Transistors, and to ap ply them to simple circuits. The device is fabricated through the processes of spin coating polymers on a clean glass as an adhesive layer. Then with metal evaporation, the gate electrodes are evaporated onto the adhesive layer of PVP. Followed by the proc ess of another layer of spin coating, the base electrode is separated from the contact of air. The second layer of polymer also serves as a dielectric layer in the transistor. On top of that, a layer of semiconductor will be applied, followed by another la yer of metal evaporation for the source and drain electrodes. After the device is fabricated, it is tested for characteristics such as impedance, current leakage, conductivity etc. Upon success, the research moves on to stabilizing the characteristics of t he OFETs that were fabricated and also implementing them into simple circuits.

To elaborate on the role and the purpose of this project we first need to understand the larger project. \"eSkin\" is the intended artificial skin for prosthetics created from organic transistors and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) which possesses piezoelectric property. However, the conversion of mechanical signals to electric signals through piezoelectric materials like PVDF is unique and cannot be done with a normal amplifying circuit. Since the voltage across the gold -plated PVDF sheet depends on the charge, which is proportional to the force it experiences, on each side of the sheet, a special amplifying circuit called charge amplifier is required. In addition to the charge amplifier, low pass filter will be required to produce clean detectable electric signals. Thus, characterization of PVDF sheet with and without the charg e amplifier is carried out to understand the sheet properties. The results are output signals against time which are crucial in the process of creating charge amplifier designs. Since the project is not yet completed, the conclusion of the poster is limite d to a few unrefined charge amplifier designs without filters. Research Mentor : Robert Nawrocki, ECET, Polytechnic ; Poster Number: 226b :: Mathematical/Computational Sciences Polytechnic Institute Understanding Existing Bias in the Unsaid: Lessons Learned from Word Embeddings Author: John Phan Abstract: Recent research in natural language processing has shown that bias can be accidentally captured within some fundamental models used within the field. This work takes a closer look a t biases that may be present in word embedding technology, a set of popular techniques used to capture the meaning of words based on distributional hypothesis idea (Harris 1954, Firth 1957). In this project, we study the gender bias implicitly present with in three forms of popular pretrained word embeddings -- word2vec (Mikolov et al 2013), GloVE (Pennington et al 2014), and FastText (Bojanowski et al 2017). We attempt to approximate the amount of bias present within each model. We use a support vector mach ine classifier (SVM) trained on 300 dimensional vectors of strictly gendered nouns (e.g., man, woman, girl, boy), with each dimension being a feature within the classification algorithm. SVM is used to determine the two most salient features from the vecto r space for each set of pretrained word embeddings. The algorithm is then tasked to classify potential gender of neutral words -- e.g., homemaker, boss, programmer. Results of our methods are consistent with previous work in identifying gender bias within word embeddings using other means (i.e., Bolukbasi et al 2016), and shows bias in word representation. All three models are shown to perform differently, which likely to be due to differences in datasets used to train the models of these popular embeddings . It is possible that the models themselves contribute to slight differences, which is left for future work.

In fact, a survey conducted by ManpowerGroup heard back from engineering firms that stated 8 2% of hiring firms are having trouble filling vacancies and that 20% of those were not optimistic that they will have potential employees that have all the skills that are required for the position. In a study completed in the Spring of 2019 that introduce d new pedagogy utilizing interdisciplinary programs to mimic the engineering field will have high school engineering technology students working with data -visualization techniques to produce more meaningful work. By combining data-visualization techniques, a field that works to literally visualize data, within engineering technology classrooms at the high school and middle school level we will prepare students for when they are entering the field and their college classrooms. Currently in secondary educatio n facilities students embark on guess and check techniques that end up wasting time and other resources as they must change their project a multitude of times. With data -visualization techniques we can determine the most efficient methods and designs befor e the production steps to be more like the industry. Research Mentor : Scott R Bartholomew, Technology Leadership & Innovation, Purdue Polytechnic Institute ; Poster Number: 228b :: Social Sciences/Humanities Polytechnic Institute Influencing Student Perceptions of STEM and STEM Careers Through Children's Literature Author: Vanessa Santana Abstract: Encouraging individuals towards STEM career fields is of national and international importance. Research shows that many young students don't envision themselves working in STEM fields (Leak, 2017). There is no consensus as to what approaches might best fill this gap and encourage students to identify with and pursue STEM -related careers. In light of continued efforts related to i mproving STEM education and increasing the number of individuals entering the STEM workforce, we chose to study the students at a local rural elementary school and an inner -city elementary school, to explore their attitudes towards and perceptions of STEM -related careers. The aims of this study are to discover if young children are already influenced by common stereotypes that exist in relation to many STEM careers, and if, through the intervention of reading STEM -related literature, these perceptions can be changed towards a more inclusive vision of STEM. Specifically, we sought to understand how primary -aged children viewed their own, and their peers' abilities, opportunities, and aspirations towards STEM fields and careers. We also sought to better under stand the influence that exposure to NSTA Top STEM children's literature could have on these perceptions. Our present report details our efforts to understand the effect of an 8 -week reading intervention on four elementary school classes. Research Mentor : Dr. Scott R. Bartholomew Department of Technology Leadership and Innovation Polytechnic Institute ; Poster Number: 229b :: Innovative Technology/Entrepreneurship/Design Polytechnic Institute Unstable Underground Author: Michael Staats Maxwell Williams Abstract: This poster depicts the process for the design, production, and marketing of an original board game. This began in our ENGL 419 class as a group of four and is currently being continued during our free time as a group of two outside of the course. To begin, we researched multiple scholarly and industry articles to gain insights into modern hobbyist board game (HBG) design practices as well as playtesting a variety of HBGs to get a grasp on various styles and mechanics. We also studied crowdfunding trends and design; this research consisted of articles on practices when crowdfunding, as well as learning from successful and unsuccessful Kickstarter projects. We began the design process by designing the core mechanics of our H BG, and then building off of those core mechanics. Once we had an initial gameplay loop designed, we began conducting playtests internally to help balance mechanics, as well as externally to receive user feedback on the current state of the game. Using thi s feedback, we made several new iterations of our HBG in an iterative design process. After multiple weeks, we created a full paper prototype to test our HBG. This prototype included full card art and a written rulebook for players. Upon completion of this paper prototype, we created the first draft of our Kickstarter page which included a promotional video, images, game description, cost estimates, and a final goal. We also developed a social media plan for marketing purposes. After much playtesting, we de cided to take our findings and redesign the game, altering several core mechanics into a new version that we are currently working on. Once we finish the second version, we will redesign the Kickstarter page to reflect our new ideas.

These activities involve complex cognitive processes that require pilots to be at his or her most alert mental state. Pilots not only need to have adequate amounts of rest but also quality sleep. Just as important, pilots need to manage task -related fatigue. This is especially challenging for collegiate aviation pilots as this may be their first time away from home in a new environment. Additionally, collegiate aviation pilots face long days, part -time jobs, student organizations, social activi ties, and academic matters. Furthermore, college students are in the midst of learning how to manage stress, time, social and their finances. The examination of fatigue in aviation is more predominant in airlines and military operations. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the causes and effects of fatigue among collegiate aviation pilots at a Midwestern University. The data indicated the top three causes of fatigue were: not enough sleep, working a long day, and poor quality of sleep. Int erestingly, respondents who had more flight experience the higher frequency in accepting their fatigued state and continuing the flight. However, respondents also indicated a desire to reduce their workload, schedule breaks properly, and increase the hours of sleep overall.

A common concern among potential employers is that the underclassmen do not possess enough real - world project experience to consider those students for an internship. This is problematic because without internships there is very few options for students to gain real experience to be eligible for many internships. This study se eks to evaluate the effectiveness of employing virtual internships through the Virtual Student Federal Service (VSFS) in a group setting in order to provide students with experience solving real life engineering challenges. It also will provide insight int o the potential implementation of these internships into standard curriculum in universities. A group of six undergraduate students volunteered to participate in a VSFS internship project over the length of 15 weeks. The anticipated results from this resea rch will find that the students enjoyed the VSFS project overall and gained valuable real -life project experience during the period that the internship was conducted. The implementation of a virtual internship through VSFS into common curriculum would prov ide a way for undergraduate students to gain valuable project experience early in their careers that goes beyond the standard classroom coursework, and would allow for those students to be more attractive to potential employers seeking students for interns hips. Research Mentor : Lisa Bosman, Department of Technology Leadership and Innovation, Polytechnic Institute ; Poster Number: 233b :: Life Sciences Polytechnic Institute A interactive Approach to visualizing Diseases, their related symptoms, and medications prescribed for treatments Author: Qiuhan Zhang Abstract: The propose of this research is to develop a web -based visualization to assist with Lupus diagnoses and treatments. The research question being addressed is, \"Can a visual mapping of commonly reported symptoms shared by multiple diseases (including lupus) and medications used to treat those diseases, help to minimize the number of misdiagnosed cases of Lupus?\" The objectives of this research are to identify diseases that ar e commonly misdiagnosed as Lupus and identify what medications are often prescribed in misdiagnoses. The goal of this research is to create a visualization tool that will enable users of the tool to select clusters of symptoms and display the diseases comm only associated with those symptoms and visually identify diseases that have been misdiagnosed as lupus. I will begin by identifying two diseases (for example HIV/AIDS and diabetes), commonly reported symptoms and the medications used to treat them. An ini tial visualization will be created to assess the functionality of the proposed tool. In the visualization, there will be three categories of data that will be linked together - symptoms, medication, and Diseases. The visualization will be designed to allow users to select multiple symptoms at once. Based on the user's selection, the visualization will adjust to automatically connect medications commonly used to treat the symptoms. This process will help users to observe patterns from medical journals and me dical databases in order to eliminate misdiagnosis of Lupus. In the future, this system can be used for analysis of other diseases. The visualization diagram will be created in CytoScape, an open source visualization software for analyzing medical and soci al network data. The interactive framework will be created with CytoScape.js, a JavaScript library for enhancing any interactive abilities for a CytoScape visualization. Upon completion, the visualization tool will be examined for scalability. Additional d iseases, more complex symptoms, and medications will be added to the model. This visualization approach will develop an interactive solution to the research question. Results from this task will inform the next task of extending an existing JavaScript fra mework to visually show connections between diseases, symptoms and medications.
