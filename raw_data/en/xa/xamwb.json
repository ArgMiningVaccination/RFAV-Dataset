Strong increase in Q1 2021 business EPS(1) at CER. Q1 2021 sales increase of 2.4% at CER driven by growth drivers Dupixent\u00ae and Vaccines Specialty Care sales grew 15.3%, due to strong Dupixent\u00ae performance (+45.6% to \u20ac1,047 million) and oncology launches Vaccines up 5.3%, driven by PPH franchise and demand for influenza vaccines in southern hemisphere General Medicines core assets grew 4.4%, while GBU sales were do wn 3.8% CHC decreased 7.3% due to COVID related stocking in Q1 2020 and low demand for cough and cold brands in Europe Q1 2021 business EPS(1) growth at CER driven by efficiency and sales performance, supported by a one -time payment Business EPS(1) was \u20ac1.61 up 5.2% on a reported basis and up 15.0% at CER Business EPS(1) includes an incremental 8 cents due to a payment related to the termination of a collaboration in Japan IFRS EPS was \u20ac1.25 Progress on implementation of the Corporate Social Responsibili ty strategy Sanofi has become a member of the top five companies of the 2021 Access to Medicine index Sanofi announced Sanofi Global Health , a newly formed non -profit unit within the company, a new cornerstone of its CSR strategy Full-year 2021 business EP S guidance affirmed Sanofi expects 2021 business EPS(1) to grow high single digit(2) at CER, barring unforeseen major adverse events. Applying average April 2021 exchange rates, the currency impact on 2021 business EPS is estimated to be between -4% to -5%. Sanofi Chief Executive Officer, Paul Hudson, commented: \"Our strong first -quarter performance is the result of the continued execution of our Play to Win strategy to drive growth and bring innovative medicines to patients. Dupixent\u00ae continues its outstanding performance with impressive growth in the U.S. and strong uptake in global markets, including China. Vaccines delivered growth in its core segments. We initiated and completed enrollm ent of our Phase 2 study for our recombinant C OVID -19 vaccine candidate in the first quarter and results are expected next month. Following the communication of our ESG strategy at the end of 2020 and embedding it into our business priorities, we have recently crea ted the Sanofi Global Health Unit, de dicated to increasing access to 30 medicines considered essential by the WHO. Sanofi is uniquely positioned to make this difference to society, which can be scaled and sustained over time, given our portfolio of essential medicines and broad geographic pre sence.\" Q1 2021 Change Change at CER IFRS net +15.0% Changes in net sales are expressed at constant exchange rates (CER) unless otherwise indicated (definition in Appendix 7) (1) In order to facilitate an understanding of operational performance, Sanofi comments on the business net income statement. Business net income is a non -GAAP financial measure (definition in Appendix 7). The consolidated income statement for Q1 2021 is provided in Appendix 3 and a re conciliation of reported IFRS net income to business net income is set forth in Appendix 4; (2) 2020 restated business EPS was \u20ac5.86; (3) Free cash flow is a non -GAAP financial measure (definition in Appendix 7). 2021 first -quarter Sanofi sales ---------------------------- Unless otherwise indicated, all percentage changes in sales in this press release are stated at CER1 ---------------------------- In the first quarter of 2021, Sanofi sales were \u20ac8,591 million, down 4.3% on a reported basis. Exchange rate movements had a negative effect of 6.7 percentage points, mainly driven by the decrease of the U.S. dollar, Brazilian real, Russian ruble, Turkish lira, and Argentine peso and Japanese yen. At CER, Sanofi sales increased 2.4%. Global Busine ss Units First -quarter 2021 net sales by Global Business Unit (variation at CER; \u20ac million; % of total sales) First -quarter 2021 net sales by geographic region (variation at CER; \u20ac million; % of total sales) First -quarter 2021 operating income First-quarter business operating income (BOI) increased 4.0% to \u20ac2,638 million. At CER, BOI increased 13.3%. The ratio of BOI to net sales increased 2.4 percentage points to 30.7% versus the prior year . Pharmaceuticals First-quarter 2021 Pharmaceutical sales increased 3.8% to \u20ac6,563 million, with double -digit growth of the Specialty Care portfolio mainly driven by the strong performance of Dupixent\u00ae which largely offset lower sales in General Medicines in Europe and the U.S. 1 See Appendix 7 for definitions of financial indicators. Specialty Care Dupixent Net sales (\u20ac million) Q1 2021 Change at CER Total Dupixent\u00ae 1,047 +45.6 % In the first quarter, Dupixent\u00ae (collaboration with Regeneron) sales were strong despite the COVID -19 environment and increased 45.6% to \u20ac1,047 million. In the U.S., Dupixent\u00ae sales of \u20ac793 million (up 41.6%) were driven by continued strong demand in atopic dermatitis (AD) in adult, ado lescent patients, and children aged 6 to 11 years, continued uptake in asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). (NBRx) grew 16% despit e fewer in -person physician visits which remain below the pre -COVID level. In Europe, first -quarter Dupixent\u00ae sales grew 52.2% to \u20ac137 million reflecting continued growth in AD in key countries and additional launches in asthma in European markets. In Japa n, sales were \u20ac59 million (up 53.7%), where strong demand was moderated by the government price decrease implemented in April 2020. Dupixent\u00ae was approved in China for the treatment of adults with moderate -to-severe AD in June 2020 and is listed on the NRD L (National Reimbursement Drug List) as of March 2021. At the end of the first quarter, Dupixent\u00ae was launched in 49 countries with approximately 260 000 patients on therapy. Neurology and Immunology Net sales (\u20ac million) Q1 2021 Neurology Immunology -3.4 % In the first -quarter, Neurology and Immunology sales were down 3.4% to \u20ac581 million, impacted primarily by the decline of Lemtrada\u00ae sales. Aubagio\u00ae sales decreased 1.1% in the first quarter to \u20ac500 million, due to lower sales in the U.S. reflecting increased competition partially offset by demand growth partly related to clinical trial supply and price upside in Europe. First-quarter Lemtrada\u00ae sales decreased 44.9% to \u20ac24 million, primarily due to the COVID -19 pandemic, which has led to a decrease in infused immune reconstitution therapies such as Lemtrada\u00ae. First-quarter Kevzara\u00ae (collaboration with Regeneron) sales were u p 10.9% to \u20ac57 million driven by Europe and Rest of the World which largely offset lower U.S. sales reflecting the recent strategic decision to reduce promotional efforts. Rare Disease Net sales (\u20ac million) Q1 2021 Change at CER Myozyme\u00ae 66 +7.5 % Cerdelga\u00ae 62 +13.8 % Others Rare Disease 21 +10.0% Total Rare Disease 770 +4.4 % In the first quarter, Rare Disease sales increased 4.4% to \u20ac770 million, primarily driven by higher demand particularly in Rest of the World (up 10.2%). Sales in Europe increased 0.4% and compared to a high base in the first quarter of 2020 due to an inventory build related to the COVID -19 environment. First-quarter Cerezyme\u00ae sales increased 4.2% to \u20ac178 million, driven by strong growth in Rest of the World (up 18.4%). First-quarter Cerdelga\u00ae sales increased 13.8% to \u20ac62 million driven by new patient accruals in the three regions. Sales of the Gaucher franchise (Cerezyme\u00ae + Cerdelga\u00ae) increased 6.5% (to \u20ac240 million) in the first quarter. First-quarter Myozyme\u00ae/Lumizyme\u00ae sales increased 0.8% to \u20ac235 million supported by new patient accruals in the U.S. (up 11.5%) which offset lower sales in Europe and negative phasing effect in Rest of the World. First-quarter Fabrazyme\u00ae sales increased 4.7% to \u20ac208 million driven by higher sales in Rest of the World and Europe. In the U.S. sales decreased 2.9% reflecting lower treatment compliance during the COVID -19 pandemic. Oncology Net sales (\u20ac million) Q1 2021 % First-quarter Oncology sales increased 25.8% to by Sarclisa\u00ae and Libtayo\u00ae launches. First-quarter Jevtana\u00ae sales decreased 2.9% to \u20ac126 million following the entry of generic competition in Europe (down 11.8%) at the end of March. In the U.S., sales wer e up 5.0%. In the U.S., the Jevtana\u00ae composition of matter patent will expire in September 2021. From May to July 2020, Sanofi filed patent infringement suits against all generic filers on Jevtana\u00ae under Hatch -Waxman in the U.S. District Court for the Dist rict of Delaware asserting two method of use patents (US 10,583,110 and US 10, 716,777), both of which expire in October 2030. Sanofi has reached settlement agreements with some of the defendants and the suit against the remaining defendants currently stay ed. In Europe, generic competition has started in certain countries after the expiration of Jevtana\u00ae's market exclusivity in March 2021. Libtayo\u00ae (collaboration with Regeneron) sales were \u20ac26 million (up 125.0%) in the first quarter driven by increased demand in metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) as well as additional country launches. In February, Libtayo\u00ae was approved in two new indications in the U.S. as a monotherapy for patients with first -line advanced non - small cell lung cancer with PD-L1 expression of 50% and for patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma. Libtayo\u00ae sales in the U.S. are reported by Regeneron. Sarclisa\u00ae was approved in March 2020 in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (RRM M) who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and in June by the European Commission in certain adults with RRMM. First -quarter Sarclisa\u00ae sales were \u20ac34 million driven by additional country launches. Fi rst-quarter sales in the U.S. and in Europe were \u20ac12 million and \u20ac13 million, respectively. In Rest of the World sales (\u20ac9 million) were driven by a strong performance in Japan. At the end of March, the FDA approved Sarclisa\u00ae in combination with carfilzomi b and dexamethasone for patients with relapsed multiple myeloma. Rare Blood Disorder Net sales (\u20ac million) Q1 2021 Change at CER Eloctate\u00ae Alprolix\u00ae 100 -1.8 % Cablivi\u00ae 38 +66.7 % Total Rare Blood Disorder 272 -0.7 % In the first quarter, Rare Blood Disorder franchise sales were down 0.7% (\u20ac272 million). Excluding industrial sales to Sobi, first -quarter sales were up 5.1% driven by Alprolix\u00ae and Cablivi\u00ae performance which more than offset Eloctate\u00ae sales decrease in th e U.S. As already communicated, Alprolix\u00ae and Eloctate\u00ae industrial sales to Sobi are expected to be significantly lower in 2021 than in 2020. Eloctate\u00ae sales were \u20ac134 million in the first quarter, down 9.9%. Excluding industrial sales to Sobi, Eloctate s ales were down 3.4% mainly due to lower U.S. sales ( -5.0%) as a result of ongoing competitive pressure. Sales in the Rest of the World were down 23.8% reflecting lower industrial sales to Sobi. First-quarter Alprolix\u00ae sales were down 1.8% to \u20ac100 million. Excluding industrial sales to Sobi, Alprolix sales were up 3.0%, mainly driven by patient switches from standard half -life factors and prophylaxis conversion. Sales in the Rest of the World were down 19.2% reflecting lower industrial sales to Sobi. Cabli vi\u00ae for the treatment of adults with acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP), a rare and acute blood disorder, generated sales of \u20ac38 million (up 66.7%) in the first quarter of which \u20ac22 million from the U.S. (up 60%) driven by increase disease an d product awareness as well as adoption of new ISTH (International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis) TTP guidelines. In Europe, sales were \u20ac15 million (up 66.7%) driven by new country launches. Globally, diagnosis of the disease and product awareness remain impacted by the COVID -19 environment. General Medicines General Medicines sales were down 3.8% to \u20ac3,672 million in the first quarter. Sales of the core assets2 were 1,474 million up 4.4% (and up 6.3% excluding Praluent\u00ae U.S. sales3), driven by strong performance of Lovenox\u00ae. Non -core assets sales were \u20ac2,010 million, down 9.9% reflecting notably portfolio streamlining, lower Lantus\u00ae and Aprovel\u00ae/Avapro\u00ae sales a nd some negative COVID -19 impact. First -quarter industrial sales were \u20ac188 million up 8.8%. Diabetes Net sales (\u20ac million) % Soliqua\u00ae 44 +29.7 % Other diabetes 226 -7.3 % Total Diabetes 1,175 -1.7 % In the first quarter, global Diabetes sales decreased 1.7% to \u20ac1,175 million. The growth in the Rest of the World (up 5.3%) was driven by Lantus\u00ae, Toujeo\u00ae launch in China and Soliqua\u00ae performance. In the U.S., the Diabetes sales decrease 5.3%. In Europe, sales decreased 10.2% largely affected by patient stockpiling related to the COVID -19 environment in the first quarter of 2020. First-quarter Toujeo\u00ae sales increased 5.1% to \u20ac253 million driven by the launch in China. Lower sales in Europe reflected the high base in the first quarter 2020 due to patient stockpiling. In the U.S., Toujeo\u00ae sales were stable with volume growth offsetting average price decrease. Lantus\u00ae sales were \u20ac652 million, down 3.7% in the first quarter, mainly due to a continued decline in average U.S. net price, increasing usage of Toujeo\u00ae, biosimilar glargine competition and lower sales in Europe (patient stockpilling in the first quarter of 2020). In Rest of the World, sales increased 4.9%. First-quarter Soliqua\u00ae sales increased 29.7% to \u20ac44 million driven by growth in th e three regions and notably by launches in Rest of the World (up 44.4%) and performance in the U.S. (up 27.3%).

First-quarter Lovenox\u00ae sales increased 30.4% to \u20ac401 million, driven by Rest of the World (up 50.7%), and Europe (up 10.5%) reflecting demand increase driven by recent guidelines recommending the use of low molecular weight heparins in hospitalize d COVID -19 patients which more than offset b iosimilar competition and postponed procedures. Plavix\u00ae sales were down 4.0% in the first quarter to \u20ac251 million mainly reflecting lower sales in Europe (down 23.7%) and Japan. In China, first -quarter Plavix\u00ae sales were \u20ac117 million, up 0.8%. 2 Sanofi has prioritized core assets in its General Medicines portfolio with differentiated and/or established profiles that ha ve significant opportunity for growth in key markets. Core assets include Toujeo, Soliqua, Praluent, Multaq, Lovenox, Plavix and o thers for total sales of \u20ac5.6bn in 2020 3 in market U.S. sales in Q1 2020 and U.S. sales to Regeneron in Q1 2021 First-quarter Aprovel\u00ae/Avapro\u00ae sales were down 39.7%% to \u20ac101 million, primarily reflecting a short -term supply constraint. First-quarter Praluent\u00ae sales decreased 20.5% to \u20ac56 million, due to lower sales in the U.S. reflecting the restructuring of the collaboration with Regeneron which was effective on April 1, 2020. Sanofi has sole responsibility for Praluent\u00ae outside the U.S. while Regeneron has s ole responsibility for Praluent\u00ae in the U.S. Excluding U.S. sales3 , Praluent\u00ae sales grew 26.8% driven by a strong performance in Europe (up 20.0%) and Rest of the World (up 45.5%) driven by the launch in China. Praluent\u00ae was relaunched in Germany at the b eginning of April 2021. Multaq\u00ae sales were \u20ac72 million, down 3.7% in the first quarter due to lower sales in the U.S. impacted by the COVID -19 environment. Pharmaceuticals business operating income In the first quarter, business operating income (BOI) of P harmaceuticals decreased 4.6% to \u20ac2,515 million (up 2.9% at CER). The ratio of BOI to net sales decreased by 0.7 percentage points to 38.3%. At CER, the ratio decreased 0.4 percentage points reflecting higher SG&A spends as well as increased \"Other operati ng expenses\" mainly reflected Regeneron MAbs alliance despite an improvement of the gross margin. Vaccines Net sales (\u20ac million) Q1 2021 Change vaccines (incl. Adacel \u00ae) 100 -8.7 % Travel and other endemic vaccines 59 -37.4 % Other vaccines 18 +17.6 % Total Vaccines 915 +5.3 % First-quarter Vaccines sales increased 5.3% to \u20ac915 million reflecting higher PPH vaccines sales and strong flu vaccines demand partly offset by lower sales of travel vaccines and adult booster due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Influenza vaccines sales increased by 23.8% in the fi rst quarter to \u20ac77 million, reflecting strong demand in the southern hemisphere which were partly offset by the U.S. due to the earlier supply to the market as compared to the 2019/2020 flu season. In the first quarter, Polio/Pertussis/Hib (PPH) vaccines sales increased 14.9% to \u20ac533 million benefiting from the favorable phasing of shipments. In the U.S., PPH sales were up 40.4% driven by the timing of the CDC order for Pentacel\u00ae and in the rest of the World, strong polio vaccines sales reflected the favo rable phasing of public tenders. Supply for Vaxelis\u00ae in the US will be available in June 2021. Developed as part of a joint -partnership between Sanofi and Merck, Vaxelis\u00ae is the first and only hexavalent combination vaccine approved in the U.S. to help pro tect infants and children against six infectious diseases, including diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), poliomyelitis, hepatitis B and invasive disease due to Haemophilus influenzae type b. Vaxelis\u00ae in market sales will not be consolidated. First-quarter Menactra\u00ae sales were up 3.8% to \u20ac127 million. MenQuadfi\u00ae, which is the only U.S. FDA -approved quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine indicated for all patients above 2 years of age, was launched in the U.S. in March 2021. Adult Booster vaccines sales decreased 8.7% in the first quarter to \u20ac100 million, primarily reflecting the COVID -19 impact on Adacel\u00ae in the U.S. and Repevax\u00ae in Europe. First-quarter Travel and other endemic vaccines sales decreased 37.4%, due to extensive travel res trictions globally. Vaccines business operating income In the first quarter, business operating income (BOI) of Vaccines increased 43.2% to \u20ac371 million reflecting the payment from Daiichi Sankyo. At CER, BOI increased 48.6%. The ratio of BOI to net sales was 40.5% (and 27.5% excluding the payment from Daiichi Sankyo) .

First -quarter sales were also impacted by divestments of non -core products. In the U.S., first -quarter CHC sales increased 2.3% to \u20ac283 million, reflecting growth of Digestive and Mental Wellness categories as well as Allergy p artially offset by the decline of the Pain category. In Europe , first -quarter CHC sales decreased 19.3% (to \u20ac334 million) mainly reflecting lower incidence of colds due to social distancing measures and wearing of masks, as well as a high base for compari son in the first quarter of 2020 which benefited from pantry loading related to COVID environment. First quarter CHC sales were also impacted by divestments of non -core products. In the Rest of the World , first -quarter CHC sales decreased 3.6% to \u20ac496 mil lion, reflecting lower sales in Allergy, Cough and Cold and pain categories impacted by the COVID environment partially offset by the growth of the Digestive and Mental Wellness categories.

In Europe sales decreased 5.6% in the first quarter to \u20ac2,228 million reflecting lower sales of General Medicines, CHC and Vaccines partly offset by Dupixent\u00ae, Aubagio\u00ae and oncology sales growth. In the Rest of the World , sales increased 4.3% to \u20ac3,470 million in t he first quarter driven mainly by the strong performance of Lovenox\u00ae, Dupixent\u00ae, Vaccines, Diabetes, and Rare Disease which more than offset lower CHC and Rare Blood Disorders franchise sales. Sales in China increased 8.4% to \u20ac726 million, driven by Toujeo\u00ae and Dupixent\u00ae launches, as well as established Rx Products and CHC performance. In Japan, first-quarter sales decreased 8.7% to \u20ac434 million due to lower sales of Established Rx Products and CHC. R&D update at the end of the first quarter 2021 Regulatory update The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Sarclisa\u00ae in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy, and the Eu ropean Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion. Sarclisa\u00ae is already approved in the U.S and Europe for use combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. The FDA approved Libtayo\u00ae monotherapy for patients with first -line advanced non -small cell lung cancer with PD-L1 ex pression of >50%. These data were published in The Lancet demonstrating superiority in extending overall survival (OS) compared to chemotherapy even with a high crossover rate. The FDA also approved Libtayo\u00ae as the first immunotherapy indicated for patient s with advanced basal cell carcinoma. The European Commission approved Plavix\u00ae for use in combination with aspirin in adult patients with moderate to high -risk Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) (ABCD2 score 4) or minor Ischemic Stroke (IS) (NIHSS1 3) withi n 24 hours of either the TIA or IS event. Usage under this new indication can continue for 21 days, followed by long-term single anti -platelet therapy. The FDA accepted Dupixent\u00ae for review in children with moderate -to-severe asthma. The submission is supp orted by data demonstrating Dupixent\u00ae significantly reduced severe asthma attacks and is the only biologic to improve lung function in children aged 6 to 11 years in randomized Phase 3 trial, and further adds to the well - established safety profile of Dupixent\u00ae. The target action date for the FDA decision is October 21, 2021. Also, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has confirmed receipt of the submission for Dupixent\u00ae in children with moderate -to-severe asthma. Efanesoctocog alfa , formerly known as BIVV001, in collaboration with Sobi and in development for hemophilia A was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. SAR445136 , formerly known as BIVV003, an ex-vivo cell therapy developed in collaboration with Sangamo for the treatment of sickle cell disease, was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. Also, the EMA's Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) granted Orphan Drug Designation based on early data from three patients that had 52 weeks, 13 weeks, and 29 days of follow -up, respectively. Portfolio update Phase 3: The XTEND -Kids trial for efanesoctocog alfa (formerly known as BIVV001) in pediatric patients with hemophilia A enrolled its first patient. The second pivotal trial to study itepekimab in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (AERIFY -2) enrolled its first pat ient. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommended to stop a Libtayo\u00ae Phase 3 trial in advanced cervical cancer for positive results on OS. Patients with either squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma recurrent or metastatic cervical canc er were randomized to receive either Libtayo\u00ae monotherapy or an investigator's choice of commonly used chemotherapy. Final results of Part A of the sutimlimab pivotal Phase 3 CARDINAL open label, single -arm study evaluating the safety and efficacy of sutimlimab for 26 weeks in people with cold agglutinin disease were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Sutimlimab, a first -in-class investigational C1s inhibitor, met the primary and secondary endpoints in the study and demonstrated sustained inhibition of classical complement pathway mediated hemolysis with improvements in anemia within one week of treatment. The amended protocol for all ongoing adult and adolescent fitusiran clinical studies, aimed at further enhancing the benefit -risk profile, was presented at the 14th Annual Congress of the European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD). T he dose for adults and adolescents will be reduced to 50 mg every other month (six times a year), with the potential to adjust the dose and/or dose frequency based on an individual patient's anti-thrombin levels. A re -start of dosing and recruitment in the pediatric trial is expected later this year. Phase 2 CARMEN -LC05, a trial investigating tusamitamab ravtansine , an anti -CEACAM5 -drug conjugate (ADC), in combination with pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab alone in patients with first -line non -squamous NSCLC started. Inclusion criteria include expression of CEACAM5 as demonstrated prospectively by a centrally assessed Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay of 2+ in intensity involving at least 50% of the tumor cell population and PD -L1 positive tumo r (TPS 1%). mutation or BRAF mutation or ALK/ROS alterations are excluded. Development for Dupixent\u00ae for grass allergy has been discontinued. SAR445088 , a complement inhibitor formerly known as BIVV020, has entered a study in adults with persistent/chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). SAR441344 , a CD40L antibody, has entered a study for Sjogren's Syndrome, an autoimmune condition that is most common in older women and affects the tear and saliva glands. A new study to sel ect the most appropriate antigen dosage for Phase 3 evaluation of an adjuvanted recombinant protein COVID -19 vaccine candidate (SP0253) was initiated and already completed enrollment. In parallel, development work has commenced against emerging variants, w hich will be used to inform next stages of the program. Trials results and the start of a global Phase 3 study are expected in Q2 2021. The trial program is supported by the United States' Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). MRT 5500 (SP0254), an mRNA vaccine candidate against SARS -CoV-2, entered Phase 1/2 to assess safety, immune response and reactogenicity. Three different dose levels will be investigated. Interim results are expected in Q3 2021. In parallel, preclinical studies are underway to evaluate additional mRNA candidates against emerging SARS -CoV-2 variants SP0230 , a novel multicomponent meningococcal Group B Vaccine, in development for adults, adolescents, toddlers, and infants started Phase 1/2. Phase 1 SAR441566 , a first, next generation, oral small molecule TNF inhibitor that in contrast to anti -TNF biologics blocks specifically the TNFR1 pathway, started Phase I in inflammatory conditions. SAR444656 , an IRAK4 degrader being developed for atopic dematitis in collaboration with Kymera also known as KT474, started a Phase I trial in healthy volunteers. SAR444656 is the first IRAK4 degrader to be studied outside of oncology. Sanofi decided to not opt or has any non -compete obligations on refused candidates under the amended and restated IO Discovery and Development agreement, which terminated on March 16 2021. Development of SAR441169 , ROR gamma T antagonist in collaboration with Lead Pharma, was t erminated in psoriasis. SAR440234 , T cell engaging multi specific antibody, has been discontinued in leukemia. An update of the R&D pipeline at as of March 31, 2021, is available global licensing agreement with Biond Biolo gics for BND -22, a novel immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting the ILT2 receptor. On February 23, 2021 Sanofi entered into a collaboration with Sirion to innovate gene therapy treatment with improved adeno -associated virus capsids. Agreements related to COVID -19 vaccines Sanofi will support manufacturing and supply of BioNTech's mRNA COVID -19 vaccine, co -developed with Pfizer, providing fill and finish for over 125 million doses. Initial supplies will originate from Sanofi's production faciliti es in Frankfurt from summer of 2021. Sanofi will support manufacturing of Janssen\u00b4s COVID -19 vaccine and through its vaccine manufacturing plant in Marcy l'Etoile, France, formulate and fill vials at a rate of approximately 12 million doses per month. Expanding affordable access to those most in need Sanofi has become a member of the top five companies of the 2021 Access to Medicine index, recognizing its work to make medicines accessible and available in low - and middle -income countries. Sanofi has mo ved up two places in the overall company ranking compared to its position in 2018, performing particularly well in Research & Development (4th place) and Product Delivery (3rd place). This recognition resonates strongly with Sanofi's Corporate Social Respo nsibility strategy. Embedded in Sanofi's long -term strategy, the company's CSR commitment is based on four pillars in which Sanofi is uniquely positioned to make a difference: access to medicines, support for vulnerable communities, preservation of the env ironment, and inclusion and diversity of its employees. On April 7, 2021, Sanofi announced a new cornerstone of its CSR strategy, Sanofi Global Health , a newly formed nonprofit unit within the company, dedicated to increasing access to medicines considere d essential by the World Health Organization (WHO) for patients in the world's 40 poorest countries. Thirty of Sanofi's medicines will be provided across a wide range of therapeutic areas, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, tuberculosis, malaria, and cancer. Sanofi Global Health will also fund the training of healthcare professionals or the set up and development of sustainable care systems for those who suffer from chronic diseases and require complex care. Sanofi Global Health is the first global initiative to provide access to such a broad portfolio of medicines, in so many countries and across several therapeutic areas, while funding local support programs. Sanofi released its 2020 Integrated Report: click here to start the experienc e. 2021 first -quarter financial results Business Net Income4 In the first quarter of 2021, Sanofi generated net sales of \u20ac8,591 million, a decrease of 4.3% and an increase of 2.4% at CER. First-quarter other revenues decreased 14.0% (down 6.4% at CER) to \u20ac295 million, reflecting lower VaxServe sales of non-Sanofi products (\u20ac228 million, down 12.9% at CER). First-quarter Gross Profit decreased 4.1% to \u20ac6,202 million (up 2.6% at CER). The gross margin ratio increased 0.1 percentage points to 72.2% (72.3% at CER) versus the first quarter of 2020 . This increase mainly reflected the improvement of the Pharmaceuticals gross margin ratio (from 74.9% to 75.2%) driven by growing weight of Specialty Care as well as some efficiency gains in Industrial Affairs. Va ccines gross margin ratio decreased 2.9 percentage point to 62.0% due to product mix. C HC gross ma rgin ratio improved from 67.7% to 68.0%. Research and Development (R&D) expenses decreased 5.5% to \u20ac1,266 million in the first quarter. At CER, R&D expenses decreased 1.7% reflecting significant increase in key assets development offset by operational eff iciencies and lower costs on mature projects. In the first quarter, the ratio of R&D to sales decreased 0.2 percentage point to 14.7% compared to the prior year. First-quarter selling general and administrative expenses (SG&A) decreased 6.3% to \u20ac2,194 mil lion. At CER, SG&A expenses were down 0.7%, reflecting increased investments in Specialty Care and Vaccines which were more than offset by smart spending and operational excellence initiatives. In the first quarter , the ratio of SG&A to sales decreased 0.6 percentage point to 25.5% compared to the prior year. First-quarter operating expenses were \u20ac3,460 million, a decrease of 6.0% and 1.1% at CER. First-quarter other current operating income net of expenses was -\u20ac101 million versus -\u20ac247 million in the pri or year and included a \u20ac119 million payment from Daiichi Sankyo related to the termination of a vaccines collaboration in Japan. This line included an expense of \u20ac279 million (versus an expense of \u20ac243 million in the first quarter of 2020) corresponding to the share of profit to Regeneron of the monoclonal antibodies Alliance, reimbursement of development costs by Regeneron and the reimbursement of commercialization -related expenses incurred by Regeneron. The share of profit from associates was stable at \u20ac9 million. Following the sale of its Regeneron stake at the end of May 2020, Sanofi restated its previously reported non -GAAP indicator (Business Net Income) and excluded the effect of equity method of accounting for Regeneron investment in 2019, Q1 2020 and Q2 2020. First-quarter business operating income4 (BOI) 4.0% million. At CER, BOI 13.3% and 8.4% excluding the payment from Daiichi Sankyo. The ratio of BOI to net sales increased 2.4 percentage points to 30.7% (and to 29. 3% excluding the payment from Daiichi sankyo) versus the prior year. Net financial expenses were \u20ac85 million in the first quarter versus \u20ac75 million in the same period of 2020. First-quarter 2021 effective tax rate was 21.0% versus 22% in the first quart er of 2020. Sanofi expects its effective tax rate to be around 21% in 20 21, everything being equal in the U.S. First-quarter business net income4 increased 5.1% to \u20ac2,017 million and increased 14.7% at CER. The ratio of business net income to net sales increased 2.1 percentage points to 23.5% (and 1 percentage point excluding the payment from Daiichi Sankyo) versus the first quarter of 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, business earnings per share4 (EPS) was \u20ac1.61, up 5.2% on a reported basis and up 15.0% at CE R (up 9.8% at CE R excluding the payment from Daiichi Sankyo) . The average number of shares outstanding was 1,249.3 million versus 1,251.3 m illion in first quarter 2020. Reconciliation of IFRS net income reported to business net income (see Appendix 4) In the first quarter of 2021, the IFRS net income was \u20ac1,566 million . The main items excluded from the business net income were: An amortiza tion charge of \u20ac389 million related to fair value remeasurement on intangible assets of acquired companies (primarily Genzyme: \u20ac126 million, Bioverativ: \u20ac79 million and Ablynx: \u20ac42 million) and to acquired in tangible assets (licenses/products: \u20ac23 million). These items have no cash impact on the Company. Restructuring costs and similar items of \u20ac156 million related to streamlining initiatives. A \u20ac132 million tax effect arising from the items listed above, mainly comprising \u20ac89 million of deferred taxes generated by amortization and impairments of intangible assets and \u20ac42 million associated with restructuring costs and similar items (see Appendi x 4). 4 See Appendix 3 for 2021 first -quarter consolidated income statement; see Appendix 7 for definitions of financial indicators, and Appendix 4 for reconciliat ion of IFRS net income reported to business net income. Capital Allocation In the first quarter of 2021, free cash flow5 increased by 23.6% to \u20ac1,925 million, after net changes in working capital (+\u20ac422 million), capital expenditures ( -\u20ac378 million) and other asset acquisitions6 (-\u20ac277 million), proceeds from disposals4 (\u20ac82 million), and payments related to restructuring and similar items ( -\u20ac244 million). As a consequence, net debt decreased from \u20ac8,789 million at December 31, 2020 to \u20ac6,823 million at March 31, 2021 (amount net of \u20ac13,948 million cash and cash equivalents).
