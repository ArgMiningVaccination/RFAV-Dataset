Jean-Paul Sartre, French philosopher Foreword to the 2nd German edition \"T HIS BOOK IS an extraordinary book that people are already saying will turn the entire healthcare system upside down.\" That's what I've been told by various sources time and again. But, in reality, it's the other way around: it will instead restore the entire healthcare system ! Gentle Medicine is actually not the typical homeopathy book. Its key messages are far more extensive and comprehensive! The subtitle, The Healing Art in the Age of Aquarius, is no coincidence either. It's about very different dimensions, as opposed to just making the individual healthy. This will all make sense once you read through the entire book, word-by-word and case-by-case, from beginning to end. Only then will the true mission of this book become clear. The two final chapters Q.E.D. (quod erat demonstrandum - what had to be demonstrated) and Epilogue serve as a concluding call to action. Strictly speaking, this book has been written with a considerable urgency to change the world - yes, the entire world - for the better. And that is the true core and the central message of this book. I have listed the many modern diseases mainly to show readers the common thread that runs through all our (western) societies in a clear and traceable manner. This is found primarily in manipulation, the deliberate dumbing down of the people, as Otto Eichelberger, the internationally known homeopathic physician from Munich always called it. Unfortunately, today's healthcare system plays a significant role in this scenario because disenfranchised citizens - people who are too busy dealing with their own issues - are much easier to control (or maybe they're more easily fooled) and are generally more willing to put up with anything. If you want a tree to grow, it's not enough to just water the leaves. You have to water the root, as Thich Nhat Hanh, one of the most important Buddhist thinkers of the present, wrote in The Miracle of Mindfulness. That's why I'm describing all the correlations, just as they have presented themselves repeatedly to me during my many years of practicing homeopathy and as they continue to present themselves to this day. It's therefore not about the superficial healing of individual diseases, but rather, we're tackling things by the root cause. Causes and correlations (without any ifs, ands, or buts) are shown and viable solutions are developed that are then verified with numerous case studies from the real world. The gentle medicine approach promoted in this book is neither theory nor a claim. Instead, it is the result of decades of practical experience with the laws of nature, i.e. the universal laws. It can rightly be called the medicine of the future which can already become reality for everyone today! It won't be so easy to deceive people armed with this knowledge. Newspaper reports, such as More people with disabilities - an aging population as the main cause (Weilheimer Tagblatt, July 18, 2008), for example, will be quickly exposed as pure misinformation: Wiesbaden | Aging population increases the number of disabled people in Germany. As reported by the Federal Statistical Office, there were 6.9 million severely disabled people in Germany at the end of 2007. That's a 2.3% increase compared to two years earlier. The statisticians put the main cause for the increase in the aging population. Almost 25% of those who are severely disabled are older than 75; just under 50% are between the ages of 55 and 75. ... Or how about this one: Children used to be able to sit still. Time and again, people complain about the terrible upbringing of our children, suggesting that it's the root cause of all evil in terms of their behavior and education. Reading Gentle Medicine, you will learn that this simply is not true and can't be true and that it has nothing to do with today's parenting being worse than it was way back when... Or: There is no explanation: what psychiatrists have to say about why some people run amok. (News on the internet). Well-informed individuals that deal with the true cause-and-effect relationships of health and disease have completely different opinions, or, more likely, they know better. There is therefore a plausible explanation, an explanation that has never been considered anywhere in the world, namely vaccinations! Vaccinations have a miasmatic effect, meaning that they exacerbate the innate miasmatic predisposition and/or create new miasms and have a particular effect on our sensitive brain. This is the only way to explain the many psychological diseases of our time, including depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, psychosis, neurosis, borderline personality syndrome, etc. This also includes people going berserk, without control, and much, much more... It's frightening to see how vitality is decreasing from one generation to the next, observes Elisabeth H. from Austria, typical of many of her contemporaries. Thankfully, people are becoming increasingly aware that not everything is quite right in our modern world of medicine, but most don't quite know what to look for or what to change, so they feel lost. This book aims to close this gap and show unequivocally the real sickness of our western world and what can be done about it. All that's needed to understand and implement it is a healthy dose of common sense. A medical background or education is not required. On the contrary, it often makes it harder to deal with the correlations presented here in an unbiased way. In this spirit, I hope you enjoy reading this book. Hopefully, there won't be too many shocking surprises in what you find out. Maybe you'll feel just like the reader of this book who wrote to me: \"In the search for answers, I came across your book 'Gentle Medicine' and have been reading it for days, with excitement, fascination, and a bit of shock, but overall very much confirmed in how I've been feeling.\" Dr. Joachim-F. Gr\u00e4tz, Homeopath, Oberhausen, Germany, January 2015 Foreword to the 1st German edition \"G OD BLESS YOU for everything you have done for the children of this earth out of love, power, and wisdom. The world would look very different if there were a few more people like you. These were the kind words of Mrs. Adelheid Hild from E. at the beginning of a letter for the author, after reading the two-volume work Classical Homeopathy for the Young Family - Desire for Children, Pregnancy and Childbirth, Toddler Care, Developmental Disabilities and Impairments, Natural Development and the vaccination book Are Vaccinations Useful? - A Homeopathic Guide.\" The present book is similarly written and again seeks to provide objective information and create a comprehensive awareness of a new dimension in medicine, a medicine of the future, which can already become reality for everyone today. After reading it, you will see the world with different eyes! You will no longer see the correlations and the underlying laws the same and will have a different understanding of both health and disease because, by nature, humans are destined to stay mentally and physically fit (into old age)! The reason that this has changed in today's world is our healthcare system and the associated suppression of knowledge. In addition, you will be significantly more capable, not only in terms of your physical health, but also your mental freedom. You will never again believe that disease just happens by chance and that you can simply become ill because everything has its meaning, its causes, and its inner logic! Again, it's about correlations and natural laws regarding health, in terms of almost absolute health. Yes, you heard that correctly: almost absolute health because this is still largely possible today, as long as you know what's important. People are being diagnosed at increasingly younger ages with the many degenerative and chronic diseases that so many in our time are susceptible to: infections (e.g. bronchitis, middle ear infections, coughing, tonsillitis, sinusitis, pneumonia, etc.), eczema, psoriasis, Lyme disease, allergies, hay fever, asthma, pregnancy issues and complications, multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, renal failure, cardiovascular disease, acute hearing loss, polyarthritis, rheumatism, migraine, hyperactivity, herniated disc, parasite infestation, ADD, ADHD, epilepsy, developmental delays, disabilities, autism, depression, psychosis, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and many more. This book clearly and explicitly develops and verifies the possibilities not only of genuine healing (in the truest sense of the word), but also prevention with impressive and convincing real-life case studies of gentle medicine, a medicine of the future that is already reality for some. A positive book, whose cornerstones and content should be known by everyone, for themselves, their children, grandchildren, relatives, friends, and acquaintances. Almost a must in order to survive in today's stress-ridden, fast-moving time and society. And beyond that, the basic prerequisite to be able to exert a lasting positive influence on those around us and the entire planet. Dr. Joachim-F. Gr\u00e4tz, Homeopath, Oberhausen, Germany, May 2007 Introduction T HE TITLE OF this book Gentle Medicine - The Healing Art in the Age of Aquarius may sound a bit over the top at first and I willingly admit that. The healing art of an entire age ! That's at least 2,160 years! \u00b9 But let's leave that for the time being. In any case, you should read and study the entirety of this book keeping this in mind and only then form your own opinion. Maybe you'll arrive at a similar result and decide that the subtitle doesn't sound so outlandish anymore. Or maybe not. In my opinion, this title is in no way over-the-top; rather, it corresponds to the reality and experiences of a seasoned practitioner. I will go even one step further, claiming that the medicine presented in this book is so in tune with nature and its laws that it can hardly be surpassed or replaced by another. However, I'm not in a position to judge whether this is really the case. This will have to be done by future generations of medical historians when there are enough therapists practicing and implementing this gentle art of healing, i.e. when enough comprehensive practical experience has been gained in this area. This book is based on the practice of homeopathy, a practice that is primarily dedicated to the eradication of chronic conditions, and is intended for those who are interested in the basic correlations of health, disease, and treatment. It is designed to be easy to understand and written with captivating clarity. It is targeted both to young parents and to older generations, as well as medical laypersons, people with medical education, and practitioners. Everybody should read it once because it affects all of us, more than some people are inclined to believe! It is essentially about the common thread that permeates everything as mainly verified by a variety of chronic diseases in our day and age and the wealth of relevant, sometimes very detailed case studies from the practice of homeopathy. So I won't be presenting any theses and hypotheses nor evangelizing any articles of faith. Rather, this book is about natural laws and their application for the benefit of the individual, for the benefit of everyone. This book is about things that we really should have been aware of from an early age or which should have already been taught in school. If we are able to live healthily again, with health having a certain claim to being absolute, and live in harmony with nature, we will have a great opportunity to stay healthy for generations to come as well as to grow and mature spiritually. This also includes a clear expansion of our consciousness, which is especially to be expected as we enter the Age of Aquarius. We are thereby making a significant contribution to the survival of all humankind. Over the years, we will change our planet positively for the long term and learn to love, protect, and eventually make the blue planet entrusted to us habitable again. That means living in harmony with nature, as my two-volume standard work Classical Homeopathy for the Young Family already made clear. It's no longer just about the single individual on this planet: it's about all of humanity now... It's about physical and mental freedom and claiming our voices and power! And medicine is the central theme of all of it. Mens sana in corpore sano: a sound mind lives in a sound body or a sensible mind in a healthy body (Juvenal, Roman poet). Inspired by Helmut Pilhar from the internet, I would like to finally make the following, well-intentioned personal invitation: \"Study Gentle Medicine and the topics of health and disease as long as you are still reasonably healthy! Once you become chronically ill, you will no longer have the time because you'll be panicking and already caught in a vicious circle. A drowning person can hardly be taught how to swim.\" In this spirit, I would like to quote the Roman poet Horace who said sapere aude (dare to know).\u00b2 Ludwig Marcuse (1894-1971) translated this demand to use your own brain as follows: Have the courage to use your eyes and ears, your mind, your reason, your thinking, and all your other capabilities and experiences. This is what Samuel Hahnemann meant when he added aude sapere to the second edition of the so-called bible of homeopathy Organon of the Healing Art (1819), the main work to detail the laws of homeopathy and the resulting approach to treatment. Dare to be wise or dare to know or, as Hahnemann briefly and aptly translated it into German: 'Have the heart to have insight.' (Dr. Richard Haehl in his preface to the sixth edition of the Organon, 1921). I hope you enjoy reading this book and putting what you learn into practice. 1 Today's Healthcare System- A Critical Review B EFORE DEALING WITH the actual topic of this book in detail and outlining the laws and possibilities of Gentle Medicine rounded off with a wealth of case studies and aspects of both serious and milder illnesses, let's take a look at the existing state of affairs to gain a better general understanding. 1.1 Our connection to the healthcare system The civilized human experiences the very first contact with healthcare very early on: usually already at the tender age of only a few weeks, actually while still in the womb! The fetus is regularly examined, given ultrasounds, measured, and much more. Nowadays, pregnant women are repeatedly seen by their attending OB/GYNs so that they can closely monitor everything. Trust is good, but checking is better, as Lenin said long ago in a different context. Much of today's conventional medicine is practiced under the same motto. Pregnancy is regarded as a serious illness and cared for accordingly. If all ultrasound and lab results are in order, everything is fine, at least as far as the doctor is concerned. This is even the case when a patient expresses subtle complaints. However, when such conditions are not visible or measurable for doctors, they are most often treated as hysterical women, a statement that many patients have repeatedly reported to me. Or if certain examinations are rejected by mature, enlightened patients, they often hear how they are a difficult patient to manage. Whatever the case, in today's very technically oriented healthcare system, the focus from the very beginning is on routine and trusting what the equipment has to tell us. In addition, we are mostly guided by laboratory parameters and clinical data. There is little space for personal feelings or even the soul of an individual. This is no different during the process of giving birth! Nowadays, delivering a baby is considered relatively risky and dangerous, because so much can go wrong. We have become so far removed from Mother Nature that it is now considered a risk to give birth at home, surrounded by loving family, as was customary for millennia, and as it is still practiced by primitive peoples today. More and more doctors recommend C-sections without any medical indication because it ensures that everything is under control. Or a premature C-section or induced labor is scheduled to birth the child early because the holidays are imminent or the OB's going to be on vacation. In any case, these are situations that young mothers repeatedly complain about in their medical histories. A similar trend already existed in the 1960s, when breastfeeding was urgently discouraged based on \"scientific\u00b3 research\" because breast milk was allegedly contaminated and industrially produced baby formula was healthier. Once the little human being has been born, its integration into conventional medicine continues apace. There are preventive examinations that provide for newborns to see their doctors early on and regularly according to a predefined schedule, even if they aren't sick. The babies are expertly assessed by the pediatrician and examined whether everything is in order and whether they are developing appropriately within the guidelines of current scientific knowledge. At first glance, this seems very honorable and progressive, as everyone is concerned that the little ones are really doing well. The purpose of these check-ups is to identify all the children at risk of certain illnesses and subject them initially to intensive diagnostics and, if these confirm the suspected illness, give them the corresponding treatment. Disease also includes 'developmental disease', i.e. a developmental delay or developmental disorder., says Dr. Theodor Hellbr\u00fcgge, former Head of the Children's Center in Munich. However, in most cases, these examinations are also misused to vaccinate healthy children and to subject them to vitamin D and fluoride preventative treatment or, to put it a little more generally, to misuse them as a toolbox for monitoring the routine regulations of the vaccination calendar and to build patient loyalty (both according to Dr. Gerhard Buchwald and Dr. Friedrich P. Graf), a situation that I won't go into further at this point. Later on, there are examinations when starting kindergarten and a few years after that more examinations to determine school placement. Once they reach puberty, updates on the rubella vaccine (as part of the MMR cocktail) are required to prevent rubella embryopathy and related catastrophic consequences in case of pregnancy. This is done although conventional medicine clearly admits that the rubella immunization doesn't work all that well, according to the MSD, a German manual of diagnostics and therapy: The most successful method, however, has not yet been determined. As an adult, you can participate in additional preventive examinations for cancer (especially breast, cervical, and prostate cancer) and other serious diseases, if you can get your health insurance to pay for them. In the fall, flu vaccinations are regularly offered at drugstores across the country or at people's workplaces paired with major government-sponsored PR campaigns. The hope, ultimately, is to keep society productive in winter. And it's always the doctors who tell you whether you're healthy or not. After all, they ought to know since they went to medical school, which not a few doctors will say when confronted with a brazen patient who dares to think independently, asks critical questions, or questions the results of an examination or even the proposed treatment. Many doctors don't want patients who speak up for themselves, instead treating them as inconvenient troublemakers. It's obvious that people in the western world are used to going to the doctor regularly from a very young age, even earlier, actually. Even if they're not sick at all! According to the well-known principle: Every healthy person is a sick person who doesn't know it yet. Or, according to Moli\u00e8re: Anyone who is still healthy has not yet been examined closely enough. The medical check-ups of today reflect, in the truest sense of the word, the state of the art. It's exactly this what seems to fit so well into our times which, unfortunately, are so dominated by technology. 1.2 General decline in public health At first glance, all of this really sounds very plausible, promising, and good. Germany, for example, often claims to have the best healthcare system in the world. But is that really true? Are people really healthier and happier today than they were 50 years ago? Taking a closer look quickly reveals that the general state of public health isn't all that positive after all. And everyone's individual health isn't either! Despite regular general check-ups, we are anything but healthier! The trend is clearly towards illness, in fact chronic illness! For some time now, serious illnesses have been increasing progressively. People now have illnesses that were rarely seen, if at all, 50 years ago. Some examples from my homeopathic practice include: Neurodermatitis, allergies of all kinds (pollen, grass, food, dust, wool, sun, cold, etc.), hay fever, bronchial asthma, tendency to croup and pseudo-croup, tendency to bronchitis, often to spastic bronchitis, tendency to middle ear inflammation (otitis media) or suppuration, tendency to tonsillitis, difficulty falling and staying asleep, migraines, sinusitis and sinus infections, pneumonia, squinting, pronounced myopia even in early childhood, hyperactivity, ADD (attention deficit disorder), ADHD (attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity), BNS seizures and epilepsy in small children, tics and compulsions, raptus\u00b9 attacks, developmental delay, growth arrest, spinal muscle loss, joint and soft tissue rheumatism, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus even in infancy, tendency to urinary tract infections, menstrual problems of all kinds, endometriosis, infertility, childlessness, psychoses, neuroses, borderline syndrome, mild to severe autism, MS (multiple sclerosis), motor and/or mental retardation, and many more. Viewed a little differently - through a homeopathic lens in the context of conventional medicine: a neurodermatitis that occurs after a polyvalent vaccination. Bronchial asthma that develops after treating chronic eczema or neurodermatitis with cortisone. Allergic asthma that first appeared after desensitizing the patient to hay fever. The occurrence of the most severe polyarthritis of all large joints about three months after vaccination for a trip to South America. Epileptic seizures after suppressing persistent bronchitis with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. BNS seizures (a form of childhood epilepsy) a few weeks after the recommended infant vaccinations have been administered. Type I diabetes after a polyvalent vaccination; in another case after persistent suppression of a stubborn herpes infection on the face. Rheumatism after using medication to treat a dislocation due to heavy lifting of a suitcase onto a train luggage rack. Borderline syndrome after tetanus vaccination administered by the military. Severe performance drop of a high-performance athlete with accompanying severe depression and hallucinations after vaccinations. Anxiety and panic after surgical closure of an anal fistula. Acute kidney failure with dialysis after multiple antibiotic treatments of angina. Kidney abscess after treating a flu infection with an antipyretic. Lupus erythematosus and kidney failure with dialysis after treating a rash with cortisone. Chorea\u00b9\u00b9 after a polyvalent vaccination. Depression with suicidal tendencies after a travel vaccination. Crohn's disease\u00b9\u00b2 after malaria prophylaxis. Ulcerative colitis\u00b9\u00b3 after. ... The list goes on and on. All of these are examples from my own homeopathic practice. This list could be continued almost indefinitely! Nothing but coincidences? Certainly not! It's systematic, unfortunately! Admittedly, at first only the temporal connection matters, but as such connections keep coming up again and again, over time, we become unmistakably aware of the root causes. Due to today's specialization in modern conventional medicine, it has become more difficult to recognize such correlations. The highly technically oriented doctors of today only look at their specialty: a pulmonologist only worries about the lungs, while the cardiologist looks at the heart, the otorhinolaryngologist (ENT physician) deals with diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the ear, nose and throat, and an orthopedist only considers the musculoskeletal system. They have lost sight of the interconnectedness of the whole body. In addition, the patients' soul or state of mind including their fears, problems, dreams, etc. hardly seem to interest anyone. Today's doctors tend to see themselves more as mechanics tasked with fixing or even replacing any worn parts. This becomes particularly clear in the growing disciplines of genetic engineering\u00b9 and organ transplantation\u00b9, which from a holistic perspective - when including the etheric entities of the soul and spirit - hardly make any sense (or rather, no sense at all). For the most part, all of this is also becoming apparent to the doctors themselves. For example, the front page of a southern German daily newspaper read in April 2005: \"Doctors warn: hospital as a death trap - treatment errors in focus. Treatment errors in German hospitals kill more people than breast cancer, AIDS,\u00b9 or traffic accidents. The risk of a serious or even life-threatening complication in the hospital is one in 200, Professor Matthias Rothmund, President of the German Society for Surgery (DGCH), warned at the start of the annual Congress of Surgery in Munich. Both diagnostic and treatment errors occur across all medical disciplines, emphasized Rothmund. ... Avoidable treatment errors that patients suffer from for the rest of their lives or die from is rarely the result of one gross mistake, but mostly 'the consequence of many smaller inaccuracies that add up', says Rothmund.\" Looking at all these correlations, you really have to ask yourself: Has today's medicine missed its actual purpose? Hasn't it really become a seriously growing risk within our healthcare system? Below, we will examine some of the thought patterns and processes used in conventional medical treatments. 1.3 Fighting diseases The subject of all medicine today is the fight against and compliance with standard values. Instead of being considered as a whole with body, soul, and spirit, patients are literally being broken down into components: psyche, body, and organs. And the breakdown goes even much further, right down to the ultramicroscopic level. 1.3.1 Today's understanding of disease I caught a virus means that you have contracted diarrhea with vomiting that's currently going around in kindergarten and that your own child brought home. I suffer from a severe chronic illness, the 'hereditary antibody deficiency syndrome' with a decrease in IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies; there was nothing you could do about it, it was genetic. Plainly put, this patient has had repeated recurrences (relapses) of severe bronchitis and pneumonia after persistent flu, which were treated with antibiotics each time and first started about ten years ago (Aha! What were the genes doing 20 years before that?). The doctor diagnosed my child with strep and now wants to administer penicillin. What should I do? I was told by a young mother, who brought her actually healthy child to the pediatrician as a precautionary measure because individual cases of scarlet fever had occurred in kindergarten; and the result of the smear (quick test)\u00b9 is now positive. This is what's common today. The media, too, is full of such bad news. Killer viruses, Hong Kong flu wave, Influenza wave: 90,000 deaths expected in Germany, Ebola virus, a few years ago the reintroduction of diphtheria from the war zone of Chechnya with supposedly double-digit deaths in Germany\u00b9, SARS\u00b9, the Bird flu, Coronavirus disease, and many more. Bacteria and viruses here, there, and everywhere! Danger lurks around every corner: at work, on the subway, on the bus, when shaking hands, in public restrooms, while shopping, in the garden soil, when walking in nature. There's nowhere and no way you are safe. Things really go downhill especially during cold weather or also in summer with those who head off on tropical vacations. The idea is that there are microbes all over the world just waiting to harm us. They attack humans and try to defeat us with diseases. Hence the term infectious disease\u00b2. Derived from Latin, it means something like disease introduced from the outside. According to conventional medical opinion, what's introduced are microorganisms such as of all kinds, etc. The list goes on and on. This creates a hostile image of microorganisms as the cause of disease, which is perfect for fear-mongering and lucrative moneymaking. In addition, people that are unsure won't take responsibility for their illness, since they had nothing to do with it: after all, they were attacked (from the outside). It was their destiny! This means that we are giving up responsibility without being aware of it. 1.3.2 Infectious diseases - from a historic point of view Where did this kind of understanding of disease come from? Towards the end of the 19th century, some researchers succeeded in using the increased power of microscopes to display and photograph microorganisms found in pathological samples. Robert Koch, who gave up his medical practice and devoted himself exclusively to science and the expansion of his fame, striving for ever more recognition, and the French chemist Louis Pasteur\u00b2\u00b9, who remains famous to this day, simply declared the microbes they discovered were the cause of diseases. They did not consider what else was known from the centuries of healing practice, let alone the psyche and the course of diseases in detail. They also failed to consider the influence of such factors as hygiene, nutrition, and other correlations. Someone was sick and something was visible under the microscope that wasn't there otherwise. That had to be it! But just because there is something extra doesn't necessarily mean it's the cause! That's just pure speculation, interpretation, pure postulation, pure hypothesis. It still has to be proven! - See also color charts 30 - 37 at the end of the book (The microscope and the microbes). The flies, wasps, maggots, worms, and whatever else can be found on a rotten carcass in nature aren't the cause of the animal's death. They're there to convert the dead tissue back into its elementary biological components and process it for other purposes. They came or emerged much later, namely after the animal passed away; they were by no means already present in the living animal. It's the eternal cycle of nature. All you have to do is pay attention. Even the stump of a newly cut, healthy tree only becomes infected with moss and fungi over time, thereby rendering it rotten slowly but surely, so that it can be converted back to fertile forest soil over the years! The same applies to microbes when talking about diseases. Conventional medicine is simply confusing cause and effect! And thus a materialistic way of thinking increasingly gained momentum in medicine. The half-baked opinion of Koch and Pasteur eventually prevailed that the bacteria\u00b2\u00b2 they discovered must be the causes of disease. However, it wasn't possible to prove that such single-celled creatures were the cause of all disease. Finally, Pasteur concluded and postulated that there must be something else that could cause illness. This something else, which contained a special form of organic structures, which he could never see under a microscope, was what he referred to with the simple collective term viruses for the first time in 1881, a Latin word meaning something like mucus, poisonous mucus, or poison. Since differentiating bacteria and viruses based on their visibility under the microscope, all infectious diseases have been classified into two groups: viral and bacterial, exclusively based on which microbes could be detected. It wasn't until more than half a century later that scientists could use the high-resolution electron microscope to research previously unknown cell structures and elements and announce that they had finally found the viruses that Pasteur had previously postulated. This, however, remains quite dubious.\u00b2\u00b3 1.3.3 Microbe hunting Since then, conventional medicine has specialized in fighting microbes as far as infectious diseases are concerned. More and more substances have been discovered that inhibit the growth of bacteria or even eliminate them altogether, such as penicillin, sulfonamides, antibiotics, etc., which have become the central pillar of conventional medical treatment. The eradication of the microbes is, therefore, the number one goal in terms of existing infectious diseases, while vaccination is used to prevent viral diseases so that the body doesn't even allow certain microbes to enter and is made immune, quasi-artificially immune. All of this happens largely without consideration of how patients are doing during such therapy, whether they're comfortable, whether there are side effects\u00b2, etc. After all, lab results have become the sole (objective) standard of the measures to be taken. Today's microbe hunters are even convinced that they're acting for good reason. That's how far removed they've become from the global understanding of nature. An unprecedented fallacy! This is how modern medicine eventually degraded itself to become the peddler of the pharmaceuticals industry. There is certainly a lot to say about AIDS, but unfortunately, there is no room in this book. Please refer to the bibliography for details. I would, however, like to mention just one aspect regarding the pathogenic\u00b2 nature of viruses here, pointed out by the most well-known AIDS critic Professor Dr. Peter H. Duesberg, Department of Molecular Biology at the University of California, Berkeley in 1989.\u00b2 Among other things, he wrote the following about HIV: For example, the virus is typically described as 'deadly' by the press and as the 'No. 1 public enemy' by the Department of Health and Human Services. It is therefore surprising that the virus has not yet claimed a single case of AIDS among hundreds of unvaccinated AIDS researchers, even though they have been breeding the virus for five years by titration in concentrations that exceed the viral load in AIDS patients by millions of times while taking no more precautionary measures than for other, moderately pathogenic viruses. Very revealing, isn't it? Something's not right here. Do viruses really cause disease? 1.3.4 Contraria contrariis across the board However, the fighting of diseases today doesn't just refer to microbes alone. In principle, the basic idea of general medicine has always been to get rid of the symptoms and phenomena that occur with illness as quickly as possible, to fight the symptoms literally, without considering whether they might not be a sensible, natural phenomenon. In the past, and to this day in naturopathy, fever was suppressed using cold leg compresses because we didn't understand its purpose. Today, there are antipyretics, given to infants mostly in the form of suppositories. We're told to take expectorants and cough syrups for cough. There are painkillers for headaches and so on. Each symptom is removed from its overall context, considered separately, and treated accordingly. If new troublesome symptoms occur during treatment that the patient didn't have before, additional medications are, in many cases, administered without being aware that these are not actually independent symptoms, but instead side effects\u00b2 of the medication previously taken. Genital yeast infections (mycosis) nowadays are very typical in many women after antibiotic treatment for an infection in some other organ, for example, the sinuses. They're practically predictable. Many drugs are hard on the stomach or damage the intestines, often making a so-called intestinal cleansing necessary once treatment has been concluded. Such measures are sold to the patient as conditioning products without considering the fact that they've already shot themselves in the foot by using this term. Ultimately, all drugs are supposed to be conditioning the body and be good for patients, i.e. helping and healing them. - Primum nil nocere (Above all, no harm!) is one of the creeds of medicine! - What is the use of swapping one disease for another? And for a much more severe one! Reading the information leaflets for medications can be quite scary. Even with relatively harmless products such as nasal sprays, which can often be addictive. There should never be any side effects at all in any medication! Only then can we really talk about a cure. What side effects really are and how profound and dangerous they really are, becomes clear from the many instructions warning pregnant and breastfeeding women not to use these drugs. For example, there is talk of teratogenic potential, i.e. child malformations or an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, i.e. miscarriages have repeatedly occurred. Other leaflets warn of becoming pregnant within less than half a year after using the medication! And much more. By now, everyone's alarm bells should be ringing at that point, even if you're not pregnant or if you're male! In its early days, cortisone was one of the popular medications used in conventional medicine. Today, however, it has already been rejected by many because word of its devastating side effects has slowly gotten around. Sure, in case of emergencies, we are all happy to have such medicines at our disposal. But shooting cannons at sparrows and battling every minor illness with heavy guns doesn't make much sense. Removing growths or entire organs or parts thereof, such as the tonsils, appendix, \"polyps\u00b2\", ovaries, uterus, varicose veins\u00b2, etc., doesn't address the actual causes of the disease. It's just fighting local disease manifestations like a technician or car mechanic, without asking what will happen later due to the missing organs. God certainly didn't make mistakes by giving us organs that are either superfluous or not useful. Our body isn't a spare parts store where ailing parts can be constantly replaced or removed. Anything but! Every seven years, the entire body with all of its organs completely renews itself. - There has to be a higher authority that coordinates and directs everything! This is particularly evident in tumor treatment. Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy using cytostatics are the leading conventional therapeutic measures. - Local measures beyond comparison! - Removing the damaged tissue from the healthy is supposed to have the best chance of catching the aggressor from the outside, at least according to conventional medicine. Medical critic Hans Ruesch sees it quite differently in his work Die Pharma Story - Der gro\u00dfe Schwindel (Big Pharma, Big Scam): If someone intended to make a person cancerous, they would treat the victim as follows: 1) Major surgery. 2) Intense radiation. 3) Massive chemotherapy. All three procedures are used simultaneously in cancer patients who hope to be cured by conventional medicine with its 'recognized' methods. Sometimes it goes even further! Because there is no cure for the predicted diseases, the removal of any non-vital organs at risk is recommended. 'Preventive' removal of the healthy breast has become a medical routine just like the preventive removal of the prostate, colon or uterus, according to Langbein and Ehgartner. 1.3.5 Modern nomenclature Today's naming of diseases also leaves much to be desired. At least from the patient's perspective. Exaggerated or trivializing technical terms are used to distract from the root causes. For example, IgA deficiency (susceptibility to infections), thrombocytopenia or thrombopenic purpura (petechiae, a tendency to bleed, bruise, and bleeding from the mucous membrane), \"pubescent epilepsy\u00b3 (suggesting epilepsy while growing can be quite normal without any other causes), neonatal seizures (suggesting an everyday occurrence in infancy), growing pains (suggesting harmlessness and normality in growth), micturition syncope (i.e. brief fainting when urinating in the toilet; suggesting the doctor recognizes and diagnoses an illness and knows what to do; this is, however, only the Latin translation of what the patient previously reported), Tourette's syndrome , Lennox-Gastaut syndrome , Rett Syndrome (all three severe post-cephalopathic conditions, i.e. after previous brain disease, without having an explanation for why), etc. The correlations are only identified at the lowest level, which of course sounds very scientific, but can be fatal for the patient since it is no longer possible to identify the cause of the illness and relate it to the whole person or any treatments they may have received. And with that the patient is a lot further away from healing! Already in his day, Voltaire aptly summed this up: Even if doctors cannot cure an illness, at least they give it a nice name.\" 1.3.6 Occurrence of complications Relatively harmless diseases, such as the childhood disease of scarlet fever, are usually treated without considering potential damage. There is no official acknowledgment that this is an exanthematous disease, i.e. a disease that detoxifies through a rash. The only thing that matters to doctors are the bad streptococci and they need to be dealt with as quickly as possible, usually with antibiotics. However, there is a great risk that the excretion of toxins through the skin will be interrupted or will not take place at all because they are driven back inward when the skin valve is closed, clearing the way for other well-known typical and feared complications (such as internal poisoning that can show up over time - depending on each individual's weak point - on the heart, on the kidney or elsewhere). Quite the opposite of what conventional medicine preaches. The homeopathic doctor Dr. Manfred Freiherr von Ungern-Sternberg writes in his book Hom\u00f6opathisch behandelte Scharlachf\u00e4lle (Scarlet Fever Treated Homeopathically) that he and his colleagues, in 30 (!) years of practice had not seen a single serious complication of scarlet fever. And further: On a tour of a scarlet fever station in Leipzig, they were once shown the worst complications, which then triggered the following comment of a well-known homeopathic colleague: It's strange that we never get to see these sequelae in practice. Complications usually only arise when a rash doesn't get expelled properly due to weakness or is suppressed by antibiotics. Unfortunately, and to the disadvantage of patients, conventional medicine doesn't see it that way. 1.3.7 Antibody titers - central pillar of diagnostics Nowadays, it is common to determine the corresponding titer to clarify a diagnosis of scarlet fever, rubella or another infectious disease, or whether you have had it before and are now resistant to it, i.e. immune, and therefore have nothing to fear in terms of an infection. According to clinical dictionaries, in serology, this refers to the antigen or antibody amount that just shows a clear positive reaction with the reaction partner (e.g. precipitation, agglutination, neutralization, complement fixation, etc.). A positive antibody titer means that the illness was actively dealt with at an earlier time and consequently lifelong immunity was acquired, meaning that it cannot be contracted again, at least according to conventional medicine.\u00b3\u00b9 That's why, for example, the rubella titer is determined in every pregnant woman, to be able to convey certainty that there is no risk of rubella embryopathy developing in the unborn child if rubella is in the pregnant woman's body. But the antigen-antibody theory is far from conclusive! It can't be because it was based on a lie from the very beginning and embellished, as seen a few years ago when Pasteur's private laboratory records were published, clearly showing that he had committed scientific fraud multiple times. Regardless, the conventional medical doctrine contradicts itself because a positive antibody titer is considered good for all diseases, in the sense of existing immunity; only AIDS supposedly works differently! In this case, an HIV-antibody positive person is considered terminally ill. That doesn't add up and doesn't make any sense at all. Antibodies are abundant, but, this time, the patient is deemed to have contracted a fatal disease. Regarding the conventionally used anti-antibody theory, it should instead read: You have a positive antibody titer and therefore enough antibodies in your blood, meaning you are immune to this disease. Congratulations! A positive antibody test has so far always indicated that the organism has something on hand to counter the virus, namely antibodies, a central building block of the immune system. Therefore, it can't serve as proof of an illness. In addition, recent research results clearly put antibodies into the background. Antibodies are considered only a side effect of an extremely complex immunological reaction and are, at best, the last link in a long line of defense mechanisms and rarely produced by a healthy body. For example, there have always been people with natural immunity but who don't have positive antibody titers. This also applies to very infectious diseases (e.g. cholera\u00b3\u00b2) which can even lead to death. The contradiction regarding antibody titers culminates in the fact that people with very little or no antibodies resist extremely infectious diseases, whereas others who contract the disease have high antibody titers! Or, in the case of sick people or those who died as a result of an epidemic, not a single pathogen could be definitively isolated. On the other hand, it was repeatedly confirmed that many healthy people in the affected region were so-called carriers, meaning people who were expected to at least react and get sick in some way. For example, during infectious epidemics, there are 1,000 to 10,000 non-diseased carriers of the corresponding viruses or bacteria per patient with polio or dysentery, as Dr. Peter Smrz states. Today, a smear is often performed and a culture is grown for several days in order to make a careful diagnosis. Appropriate organ material in the form of exfoliated cells is removed in order to determine the pathogens using microbiological or cytological diagnostics. The final diagnosis is established if the results show tons of streptococci growing in the culture, for example. Therefore, conventional medicine says, an antibiotic is clearly needed to get things under control! However, the validity of such results seems very questionable. Apart from the fact that so-called quick tests already have an error rate of around 40%, the conclusions of the microbial analyses based on the culture are anything but clear. It has long been known among microbiologists that every pathogen needs a specific culture medium to grow. If this is not available, it will not flourish or it will change, which can be observed again and again., according to Dr. Veronika Carstens, wife of the past Federal President of Germany. It is therefore easy to convert a pneumococcus into a streptococcus or staphylococcus merely by changing the culture medium used in the laboratory. In other words: the results can be manipulated and are by no means clear. An example from literature helps to clarify this: \"Depending on the culture medium, different bacterial spectra were cultivated from a patient's cerebral-spinal fluid. While Neisseria meningitidis (the pneumonia, bronchitis, meningitis, otitis media, etc.) could be isolated most frequently, after a 'correction' of the culture medium, massive growth of haemophilus influenzae (the 'pathogen' for a form of the flu, meningitis, arthritis, pneumonia, etc.) was shown. This is crucial for identifying the value of HIB vaccination programs.\u00b3\u00b3 So decide what result you want and choose the appropriate culture medium!\" (Explanations by the author in parenthesis) In short: equating immunity with a positive antibody titer is pure speculation, arbitrary, or wishful thinking! 1.3.8 Costly diagnostic tools Even modern and extremely expensive diagnostic tools, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\u00b3, that allow you to examine a patient's body layer-by-layer with just the click of a mouse, can't reveal the cause. It is about the detection of the smallest tissue irregularities to identify cancerous sources or secondary tumors as early as possible and to be able to treat them. However, to treat them with organotropic therapy, which doesn't question the cause and only focuses on individual cells. Today's treatment goes even further: We already carry out preventive examinations for cardiovascular diseases, explains radiologist Dr. Harald Kramer. This allows vascular narrowing to be identified before a heart attack occurs. More proof of localized thinking, without being interested in the real (true) context! The energy element is missing, the etheric; the search for the prima causa morbi, the true cause of the disease. This becomes particularly clear with the following quote: ... There are two bright spots in the liver. Those are cancerous. But the patient is lucky. There are no spots anywhere else: the cancer hasn't metastasized. 'Now we know: There's a chance with a liver transplant', says Kramer. But organ transplants can't really work because the immune system of every living organism sooner or later rejects foreign tissue. It always does!\u00b3 1.3.9 Media support for very questionable medical advances Regardless of all this, the media are neck-deep in this as well! They manipulate their audiences without batting an eye, in a way that resembles mass brainwashing. Another perfect example is a newspaper article on the front page of the Weilheimer Tagblatt dated March 3, 2005: Good news: Schumacher in favor of organ donation. The seven-time Formula 1 world champion Michael Schumacher is the newest member of the Athletes for Organ Donation, an organization in which the German sports elite commit themselves to saving lives through organ donation. Nothing in sports works without team spirit, says Michael Schumacher about his commitment. In society, team spirit means helping others. As an organ donor, you can do this beyond your own death. Other prominent members include Steffi Graf, Franziska van Almsick, Franz Beckenbauer, Rosi Mittermaier, Boris Becker, and J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann.\u00b3 Subtle advertising or manipulation or even brainwashing public opinion, whatever you want to call it, by celebrities, especially by very popular and world-famous athletes! The celebrities have been hoodwinked, taking advantage of their general ignorance of the issues at hand. Basically, they cannot even know about such medical contexts and the scope of the statements that have been put in their mouths. They believe that they're making a positive contribution for the good of humankind. Unfortunately, the opposite is the case: they're clearly being used! It can be assumed with up to 100% probability that very few athletes have seriously dealt with such highly complex medical topics, and if they did, they would certainly come to a different conclusion and in no way support such campaigns, especially not publicly. Because transplantation only makes sense with the body's own tissue, as foreign tissue always gets rejected, making lifelong immunosuppressive\u00b3 therapy "}
