Particularly informative are studies that integrate both gene expression and proteomic data. Such multi-parameter data sets are beginning to reveal the perturbed regulator y networks which define the onset and progression of cancers (1-5). This new pi cture of cancer, and the emergence of promising new cancer drugs (6, 7) are placi ng new demands on clinic al pathology (8). For example, traditional pathology practices (i .e. microscopic analysis of tissues) do not distinguish potential responders from non -responders for the new cancer molecular therapeutics (9). Recent examples ex ist in which pauciparameter molecular measurements are being employed to iden tify potential responders to at least two 17 therapauetics (10-13). However, it is unlikely that single-parameter measurements will be the norm. Instead, the coupling of molecu lar diagnostics with molecular therapeutics will eventually require measurements of a multi-parameter (e.g. cells, mRNAs and proteins) biomarker panel that can be used to direct patients to appropriate therapies or combination therapies. Currently, the measurement of a multi-parameter panel of biomarkers from diseased tissues requires combinations of microscopic analysis, microarray data (14), immunohistochemical staining, west ern blots (8), and other me thods. The collected data is integrated together within some model fo r the disease, such as a cancer pathway model (15), to generate a diagnosis. Currently, performing these various measurements requires a surgically resected tissue sample. The he terogeneity of such biopsies can lead to significant sampling errors since various meas urements of cells, mRNAs, and proteins are each executed from different regions of the tissue. In this chapter, the DNA-encoded antibody library, or DEAL, approach ( Figure 2.1), is described as an important step towards executing a true multi-parameter analysis (cells, mRNAs and proteins) from the same mi croscopic region of ti ssue. We report on several key demonstrations for achieving this goal, including the rapid detection of proteins and protein panels over a broad dynamic range an d with a detection limit of <10 femtoM; the sorting of immortal and primary lymphocyte populations; the co-detection of cells, cDNAs, and proteins on the same platform, and the integration of our multi-parameter platform with microfluidic techniques. 18 Figure 2.1 Illustration of the DEAL method for cell sorting and co-detection of proteins and cDNAs (mRNAs). Unique DNA-Antibody conjugates are pr epared and then combined into a single solution where they recognize cognate antigens, including cell surface markers and proteins of interest. When introduced onto a conventional DNA microarray, parallel self assembly, according to Watson-Crick base pair ing, localizes the bound species to a specific spatial location allowing for highly multiplexed multi-parameter analysis. A key issue involved with a microfluidics- based multi-parameter assay is that the measurement of different classes of biomol ecules (or cells) typically requires different surface chemistries, and not all of them are co mpatible with each other or the fabrication steps associated with buildi ng the microfluidics circuitry. Conventional antibody arrays for protein detection or for panning cells (1 6) require immobilization of the antibody onto aldehyde, epoxy, maleimide, or hydrophobic solid supports (17-20). It is often difficult to preserve folded (active) antibody conf ormations due to surface induced denaturation which depends on many variab les including pH, ionic strength, temperature and concentration (21-23). This has spurred the development of alternative approaches to preserve the native confor mation of proteins including 3-dimensional matrixes 25), cuti nase-directed immobilization onto SAMs (26), and the coupling of biotinylated an tibodies onto streptavid in coated surfaces 19 (27). In addition, the arrays need to remain hydrated throughout the entire manufacturing process in order to prevent protein denatu ration (18). DNA microarrays, on the other hand, are typically electrostatic ally absorbed (via spottin g) unto amine surfaces. One option for detecting both DNA and proteins on the same slide would be to pattern both functional groups used to immobilize DNA and protein onto the same substrate, although this would significantly increase the comp lexity and engineering of the system. Alternatively, a compatible su rface may be an activated este r glass slide to which amine- DNA and proteins can both covalently attach. However, we have found that the loading capacity of these slides for DNA is diminish ed, resulting in poor signal intensity when compared with DNA printed on conventionally prepared amine slid es. In addition, unreacted esters are hydrolyzed b ack to carboxylic acids, whic h are negatively charged at normal hybridization buffers (pH 7), electrost atically reducing th e DNA interaction. Moreover, to interrogate cells and protei ns, the best surface to reduce non specific binding of cells while maintaining full antib ody functionality is acrylamide (28, 29), which is incompatible with DNA. By using DNA as a common assembly strate gy for cells, cDNAs, and proteins, we are able to optimize the s ubstrate conditions for high DN A loading onto the spotted substrates, and for complementary DNA loadi ng on the antibodies. This leads to highly sensitive sandwich assays for protein detecti on, as well as high efficiency cell sorting (compared with traditional panning). We also find that non-selective binding (biofouling) of proteins to DNA-coated su rfaces is reduced. Importantly, DNA coated surfaces can be dried out, stored or heated (overnight at 80o C), thus making them compatible with robust microfluidics fabrication. 20 DNA-labeled antibodies have been previous ly used to detect proteins (30-32), largely with the pendant oligomers serv ing as immuno-PCR tags (33, 34). DNA-tags have been used to direct the localization of proteins allowing assays to take advantage of spatial encoding, via several different read-o ut strategies (35-37). Conventional multi- well ELISA assays are capable of quantitatin g multiple proteins, but typically require separate sample volumes for each parameter. Optical multiplexing can expand this, but is limited by the number of non-spectrally overlapping chromophores. Spatial multiplexing, such as is used with DEAL, allows for the execution of many measurements on a small sample, since the num ber of different measurements is limited only by the patterning method utilized to prepare the cDNA array. Spotted antibody arrays (18), while potentially useful for pr otein detection and/or cell sorting, are not easily adaptable towards microfluidics-based assays, since the microfabrication process for preparing robust microfluidics devices of ten involves physical conditions that will damage the antibodies. Complementary DNA arrays are robust to such fabrication conditions. 2.2 Experimental Methods 2.2.1 DNA sequences for spatial encoding All DNA strands were purchased with a 5'-amino modification from the Midland Certified Reagent company. Sequences for sequences A1, B1, C1 and their respective complements A1', B1' and C1' are given in Table 2.1. sequences, designated as A3, B3, respective complements A3', B3' and C3' were designed following the paradigm outlined by Dirks et al. (38). Example input files 21 and output sequences can be found in the A ppendix A. The sequences are reported in Table 2.1. Table 2.1 DNA sequences for spatial encoding Name Sequence A3' CAG GAT B3 B3' 5'-NH 2-AAA CTA CTA C3 5'-NH 2-AAA AAA C3' 5'-NH 2-AAA mouse anti-Human Interleukin-2 and B33-2, respectively) were purchased from BD Biosciences. Prior to use, all antibodies were de salted, buffer exchanged to pH 7.4 PBS and concentrated to ~ 1mg/ml using 3000 MWCO spin filte rs (Millipore). acetone hydrazone in DM F (SANH, Solulink) was added to the antibodies at variable molar excess of (1000:1 to 5:1) of SANH to antibody. In this way the number of hydrazide groups introduced to the antibodies was varied. Separately, succinimidyl 4-formylbenzoate in DMF (SFB , Solulink) was 20-fold molar excess to 5'aminated 26mer oligomers in PBS. This ratio of SFB to DNA ensured complete reaction of the 5' amine groups to yield 5' aldehydes. No further improvement in yield was observed for either the antibody and oligonucleotide coup ling reactions after 4 hours at room temperature. Excess S ANH and SFB were removed and samples buffered exchanged to pH 6.0 citrate buffer usi ng protein desalting spin columns (Pierce). A 20-fold excess of derivatized DNA was then combined with th e antibody and allowed to react overnight at room temperature. Non-coupled DNA was removed with size exclusion spin columns (Bio-Gel P-30, Bio-Ra d) or purified using a Pharmacia Superdex 200 gel filtration column at 0.5 ml/min isocra tic flow of PBS. The synthesis of DNA- antibody conjugates was verified by non-reducing 7.5% Tris-HCl SDS-PAGE at relaxed denaturing conditions of 60 oC for 5 minutes, and visualized with a Molecular Imager FX gel scanner (Bio-Rad). Conjugation ns imaged similarly usin g appropriate excitation and emission filters. 23 2.2.3 Microarray Fabrication DNA microarrays were printed via standard methods by the microarray facility at the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB\u2014Seattl e, WA) onto amine-coated glass slides. Typical spot size and spacing were 150 and 500 m, respectively. Poly-lysine slides were made in house. Blank glass slides were cleaned with IPA and water in a sonication bath for 10 minutes each. They were then treated with oxygen plasma at 150 W for 60 sec., and then quickly dipped into DI wa ter to produce a silanol terminated, highly hydrophilic surface. After drying them with a nitrogen gun, poly-L-lysine solution (Sigma P8920, 0.1% w/v, without d ilution) was applied to the pl asma treated surfaces for 15 minutes, and then rinsed off with DI wate r for several seconds. Finally, these treated slides were baked at 60oC for 1hr. These slides were th en sent to ISB and printed as described above. 2.2.4 Fabrication of Microfluidic Devices Microfluidic channels were fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using conventional soft lithographic techniques. The goal was to fabricate robust microfluidics channels that could be disassembled after the surface assays were complete for optical analysis. Master molds were made phot olithographically from a high resolution transparency mask (CadArt) so that the resu lting fluidic network consisted of 20 parallel channels each having a cross-sectional profile of 10 x 600 m and were 2 cm long. This corresponds to channel volumes of 120 nl. A silicone elastomer (Dow Corning Sylgard 184) was mixed and poured on top of the mol d. After curing, the PDMS was removed from the mold and sample inlet and outle t ports punched with a 20 gauge steel pin 24 (Technical Innovations). The mi crofluidic channels were then aligned on top of the microarray and bonded to the substrate in an 80oC oven overnight. 2.2.5 1o Antibody Microarray Generation and DEAL-Based Immunoassays Antibody microarrays were generated by fi rst blocking the DNA slide with 0.1% BSA in 3x SSC for 30 minutes at 37oC. The slides were washed with dH 2O and blown dry. A 30 l solution onjugates (3x SSC, l of each conjugate) was sandwiched to the array with a microscope slide, and incubated at 37oC for 4 hours. Arrays were then washed first in 1x SSC, 0.05% SDS at 37oC with gentle agitation, then at 0.2x SSC, then finally at 0.05x SSC. The slides were blown dry and scanned with a Gene Pix 4200 A two-color array scanner (Axon Instruments). For immunoassays, the DNA-encoded 1o (15 ng/ antigen (3 ng/l) and fluorescent 2o antibody (0.5 ng/ l) were combined in a single tube. After 2 hour incubation at 37oC, the formed antibody-antigen-antibody complexes were introduced to the microarrays as described above. Subsequent wash steps and visualization were identical. 2.2.6 Microfluidic-based assay procedures Microfluidic devices were interfaced w ith 23 gauge steel pins and Tygon tubing to allow pneumatically controlled flow rates of ~0.5 l/min. The assays were performed in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS), which was found to be better than 1x SSC and PBS. Each channel was blocked with 1.0% BSA in TBS prior to exposure to DNA-antibody conjugates or immunoassay pairs for 10 minutes under flowing conditions. After a 10 minute exposure to conjugates or antigens under flowing c onditions, channels were 25 washed with buffer for 2 minutes and the micr ofluidics disassembled from the glass slide in order to be scanned. Immediately prior to imaging, the entire slide was briefly rinsed in TBS, blown dry and imaged on an array scanner as described above. For the human IL-2 concentration series, primary DNA-anti body conjugates were laid down first on the surface, before exposure to antigen and sec ondary antibody. This was necessary because at lower concentrations of antigen, the signals decrease, due to the high ratio of antigen- unbound primary antibody competing with anti gen-bound primary for hybridization to the DNA array. By first exposing the arra y to the primary DNA-antibody conjugate, excesses were washed away before subse quent exposure to an tigen and secondary antibody, increasing signal. 2.2.7 Microfluidic Au amp lification methods Microfluidics-based Au amplification e xperiments were performed in a similar manner, with the notable exception that a biotin-secondary antibody was used instead of a fluorescently labeled antibody. Subsequen tly, Au-streptavidin (Nanoprobes) was introduced into each channel (3ng/ l) for 10 minutes, after which the channels were thoroughly rinsed with buffer. After remova l of the PDMS, the entire slide was then amplified with gold enhancer kit (Nanoprobes) according to manufacturer's protocol. 2.2.8 Analysis of DNA-encoded anti bodies by flow cytometry VL3 and A-20 cells were incubated for 20 min. on ice with 0.5 g PBS-3% FCS. Cells were also incubated with equimolar amounts of -CD90.2/FITC-DNA conjugates characterized by various FITC-DNA loadings. Cells 26 were washed once with PBS-3% FCS and then were analyzed by flow cytometry on a BD FACSCantoTM instrument running the BD FACSDivaTM software. 2.2.9 Cell capture, separation, and sorting methods Two murine cell lines, VL-3 T cells (thym ic lymphoma line (39)) and A20 B cells (mouse B cell lymphoma (40), purchased from ATCC) were engineered to express mRFP and EGFP, respectively, using standard retroviral transduc tion protocols. Antibodies against surface markers for each of these cell lines, -CD90.2 for VL-3 and -B220 for A20 (eBioscience), were encoded as desc ribed above with DNA strands A1' and B1', respectively. For sorting experiments, cells were passaged to fresh culture media [RPMI 1640 (ATCC) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids and 0.05 mM -mercaptoethanol at a concentration of 106 cells/100 l media and incubated with DNA-antibody conjugate (0.5 g/100 l) for 30 minutes on ice. Excess conjugate was removed from the supernatant after centrifugation, after which cells were resuspended in fresh media. Prior to cell incubation the microarray slide was passivated, to reduce non-specific cell a dhesion, by reaction of the residual amine groups with methyl-PEO 12-NHS ester (Pierce) 10 mM in pH = 7.4 PBS for 4 hours at room temperature. Cells were spread evenly ac ross the microarray surface and allowed to localize for one hour on ice. After this pe riod, non-adherent cells were removed with gentle washing with room temperature Tris-buffered saline solution including 1 mM MgCl 2. Cell enrichment experiments were performed identically except that all incubation steps were performed in the presen ce of a 1:1 mixture of both T- and B-cells (each at 106/100 l). 27 Primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were pur ified from EGFP and dsRed transgenic mice (obtained from Jackson Laboratories), respectively, using sta ndard magnetic bead negative selection protocols and the BD IMag TM cell separation system. Prior to DEAL- based fractionation, the purity of these populat ions was analyzed by FACS and found to be greater than 80%. Simultaneous cell, gene and protein experiments were performed similarly to those as previously described on a PEGyla ted microarray substrate. Briefly, GFP- expressing B cells (106/100 l) were located on B1 spots after labeling with -B220-B1' (0.5 g/100 l). Following removal of non-adherent cells, a TNF- ELISA pair with C1'- encoded 1o and APC-labeled 2o antibodies were introduced along with 0.5 ng/ l FITC- labeled A1' and allowed to hybridize for a pe riod of 30 minutes at room temperature. The slide was then rinsed with TBS+MgCl 2 and visualized via brightfield and fluorescence microscopy. Homogeneous and panning cell experiments we re performed in parallel. For the homogenous cell capture process, 5x106 Jurkats (ATCC) suspended in 1 ml of RPMI media along with 5 g of -CD3/C3' conjugates and incu bated on ice for 1 hour. Excess conjugates were removed by centrifugation and the Jurkats were resuspended into 200 l of fresh media before exposur e to the DNA microarray. After 1 hour incubation on ice, the slides were rinsed gently with TBS. The cell panning experime nts were performed in parallel; 5 ug of -CD3/C3' conjugate in 1 ml RPMI media was incubated on a microarray for 1 hour on ice before rinsing in 0.5x PBS, then deionize d water. The slide was not blown dry, but gently tapped on the si de to remove the majority of the excess 28 solution, keeping the arra y hydrated. Jurkats (5x106/200 L) were immediately placed on the array for one hour on ice. Subsequent wash and visualization steps are identical. 2.3 Results and Discussion 2.3.1 In silico design of orthogonal DNA oligonucleotides The pendant DNA oligonucleotides were designed de novo in order to minimize inter- and intra-strand cross hybridization. We followed the paradigm outlined by Dirks et al. (38) to computationally derive a set of orthogonal 30mers. These sequences were designed with a polyA 10 sequence followed by a variable 20mer encoding region. The polyA 10 stretch was incorporated to provide mol ecular flexibility and to prevent steric hindrance between the 20mer encoding region and the antigen binding domains of the antibody after conjugation. Three sequences , designated A3-C3 were generated using this approach and were tested empirically. Identical cDNA arrays printed with A3, (green), A3'+B3' (red), and A3'+C3' (red). Minimal noise was obs erved between the probe sequences and noncomplementary spots ( Figure 2.2) . We performed initial DEAL experiments with sequences A1-C1 before determining that a rational design of the sequences was necessary to minimize noise. Therefore the ma jority of the experime nts outlined in this chapter are presented us ing sequences A1-C1. One advantage of using DNA oligonucle otides as molecular addresses is modularity. One working orthogonal set of sequences that has been experimentally validated can be used interchangeably with distinct sets of antibody libraries without modification of the underlying cDNA micr oarray. This feature allows 29 Figure 2.2 DNA sequences derived from computation minimize cross hybridization. (A) Fluorescent scans of three identical cDNA arrays probed with different combinations of fluorescent complementary strands. (B) Intensity profiles of the arrays 2.3.2 Generation of DNA-Antibody conjugates Chemically modified antibodies to aid in protein immobilizati on and/or detection are nearly universal for use in immunoassays . Such labeling introduces the risk of detrimentally affecting antibody function; ho wever, that risk can be reduced by minimizing the size, and thus the steric hindranc e, of the pendant moieties. With this in mind, we employed a covalent conjugation stra tegy in which 5'-aminated to antibodies via a hydrazone linkage (31), as shown in Scheme 2. Using commercially available reagents, an aldehyde functionality was introduced to the 5'-aminated oligonucleotide via succinimide chemistry. Similarly, a hydrazide moiety was introduced via reaction with the lysine side chains of the respective antibody. DNA-antibody conjugate formation was then facilitated vi a stoichiometric 30 hydrazone bond formation between the alde hyde and hydrazide f unctionalities. Conjugate formation and control over DNA- loading (41) was verified by PAGE electrophoresis, as shown in Figure 2.3. Figure 2.3 Illustration of the two step coupling strategy utilized to prepare DEAL antibodies. In parallel, hydrazide groups are introduced onto a monoclonal antibody and 5' When combined, hydrazone bonds are formed, linking the ssDNA to the antibody. At bottom right is a gel mobility shift assay showing varied oligomer (strand A1') loading unto -human IL-4. By varying the stoichiometric ratios of SANH to antibody (lanes I-IV corresponds to 300:1, 100:1, 50:1, 25:1 respectively), the average number of attached oligonucleotides can be controlled. Clearly the adverse steric effects of ta gging antibodies with oligonucleotides are of concern when performing various assa ys, such as the immunoassays and cell sorting/capture experiments described herein. For this reason, we investigated the ability of DNA-encoded antibodies to re tain recognition of cell surface markers, as visualized by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). By using a fluorophore covalently tagged to the DNA, but not the antibody, FACS was used to optimize DNA-loading for the DEAL conjugates. For the analysis, 5' aminated, 3' FITC-labeled DNA as tagged unto - CD90.2 antibodies at various stoi chiometric (5:1, 300:1). This produced, on average, c onjugates with 1, 2, 3, 4-5 and 6-7 strands of 31 FITC-DNA respectively, as measured by gel mobility shift assays ( Figure 2.3). These conjugates were tested for their ability to bind to the T cell line VL3 (CD90.2 expressing), by monitoring the FITC fluorescence with the flow cytometer. The B cell line A20 (CD90.2 negative) was used as a ne gative control. The performance of the conjugates was also compared with commercially available FITC -CD90.2. The results are shown in Figure 2.4 . The histogram of the mean fl uorescent intensities for various FITC-DNA loadings shows that fluoresce nce increases are roughly linear when the number of DNA strands is increased from 1 to 2 to 3, corresponding to 1, 2 and 3 chromophores (1 per strand). At higher load ings, the increase in fluorescence first plateaus (4-5 oligomers) and then decrease s up to the highest load ing (6-7 oligomers). Thus, excess DNA labels (4-7 oligomers) did ster ically reduce the abi lity of antibodies to recognize cell surface markers. Optimal lo ading for cell surface marker recognition was achieved with antibodies synthesized with the 50:1 SANH:antibody ratio, corresponding to approximately three DNA strands per antib ody. Subsequent cell sorting experiments were performed in consideration of this ob servation. When compared with the FITC - CD90.2 control, the DNA antibody conjugates had reduced fluorescence by a factor of 10 and slightly higher nonspecifi c binding to A20 cells. 32 Figure 2.4 Optimization of DNA loading of DEAL antibodies for cell surface marker recognition. (a) FACS plot comparing -CD90.2/FITC-DNA conjugates with the commercially available FITC -CD90.2 antibody (no DNA). The conjugates bind to VL3 cells (100%) with minimal non-specific interactions with A 20 (1.3%). When compared with FITC -CD90.2, the overall fluorescent intensities are lower by a factor of 10, with slightly higher non-specific binding to A20. (b) Histogram of the m ean fluorescent intensities for various FITC-DNA loadings. Fluorescence increases are roughly linear when the number of DNA strands is increased from 1 to 2 to 3, corresponding to the 1, 2 and 3 chromophores (1 per strand). For higher loadings, the fluorescence plateaus and then decreases. 33 This could be due to a couple of reasons. A likely factor is that the stoichiometric ratio of fluorophore to antibody for the DEAL conjugates versus the commercial antibody is different. For the DEAL conjugates, each strand of DNA is attached to one fluorophore only (i.e. conjugates with one DNA strand has a fluorophore to antibody ratio of 1:1) whereas the commercial an tibodies generally have more than one fluorophore per antibody (i.e. fl uorescent antibodies have a fluorophore to antibody ratio >1). Thus the factor of 10 less fluorescence should not be st rictly interpre ted as a 10x reduction in the binding affinity of the DEAL conjugates, although it is possible that the oligomer steric effects discussed earlier do account for some reduction in relative fluorescence intensity. Direct measurement of the affinity of the DEAL conjugate compared with the corresponding unmodifi ed antibody using methods like Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) will be more conclusive. 2.3.3 Multiplexed protein detection by DEAL We demonstrated the DEAL concept fo r spatially localizing antibodies using three identical goat anti-human IgGs, each bearing a different molecular fluorophore and each encoded with a unique DNA strand. A so lution containing all three antibodies was then introduced onto a microarray spotted with complementary oligonucleotides. After a two hour hybridization period and substrat e rinse, the antibodies self-assembled according to Watson-Crick base-pairing, conve rting the >900 DNA a multi-element antibody microarray ( Figure 2.5 ). This observation implied that quite large antibody arrays can be assembled in similar fashion. 34 Figure 2.5 Spatially encoded protein array. Three biochemically identical goat -human IgG (labeled with Alexa488, Alexa594, or Alexa 647 dy es) were tagged with oligos A1', B1' and C1' respectively. After a 2 hour incubation, antibod y/DNA conjugates were localized to specific sites dictated by the underlying DNA microarray. Scale bar corresponds to 1 mm. The ultimate size of any protein array, however, will likely be limited by interference from non-specific binding of pr oteins. In an effo rt to visualize the contributions of non-specific binding, three antibodies were simila rly introduced onto a microarray: two antibodies having co mplementary DNA-labeling spotted oligonucleotides and a th ird unmodified antibody ( Fig. 2.6). For demonstr ation purposes, the slide was not thoroughly rinsed follo wing hybridization a nd accordingly a high background signal due to non-specific adsorption of non-encoded fluorescently-labeled antibody was observed. The spotted nucleotide regions, to which no antibody was chemically encoded, displayed much less non-specifically attached protein, implying that 35 DNA greatly diminishes active area biofouli ng. Such retardation of biofouling is reminiscent of are functiona lized with polyethylen eglycol (PEG) (41-43). By analogy with postulated mechanisms associated with PEG (44-46), we hypothesize that the hydrophilic nature of the spotted olig onucleotides minimizes interactions with hydrophobic portions of proteins often exposed during non-specific adsorption. Conjugate hybridization experiments were al so carried out within 5 degrees of the calculated duplex melting temper atures, taking advantage of Watson-Crick stringencies and thus diminishing non-complementary DNA in teractions. In any case, this reduced biofouling means that the DEAL method can lik ely be harnessed to detect reasonably large panels of proteins with in a single environment. Figure 2.6 Illustration of the resistance of the DEAL approach towards non-specific protein absorption. A microarray was simult aneously conjugates and goat -human IgG-Alexa594 with no pendant DNA. When the arrays were not fully blocked and/or rinsed, non-specific binding was observed on the surface of the glass slide, but not on the non-complementary spots of printed DNA, i.e., spot B1 did not have fluorescence from non-complementary IgG conjugates nor did it exhibit fluorescence from proteins not encoded with DNA (goat -human IgG-Alexa594). Scale bar corresponds to 1mm. 36 2.3.4 Detection of multiple proteins wi thin a single microfluidic channel Microfluidic-based assays offer advantages such as reduced sample and reagent volumes, and shortened assay times (47). For example, under certain operational conditions, the surface binding assay kinetics are primarily determined by the analyte (protein) concentration and th e analyte/antigen binding affin ity, rather than by diffusion (48). We evaluated a microfluidic s-based DEAL approach by bonding a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microflu idic channel on top of a DNA (Figure 2.7A ). We initially performed a multip lexed antibody localization experiment, similar to that described above. The antibody conjugates self-assemble d at precis e spatial locations encoded by the pendant oligonucleotide in <10 minutes ( Figure 2.7B ), consistent with the time scales reported on DNA hybridization in mi crofluidics (49-51). Figure 2.7 Protein array assembled in microfluidics in 10 minutes. (A) Picture of PDMS microfluidic device encapsulated a DNA array (yellow box) (B) Two goat -human IgG (labeled with Alexa594 or Alexa 647) were tagged with oligos A1' and B1' respectively and introduced into a microfluidic device bonded on top of a DNA microarray with corresponding complementary strands A1 and B1 along with non-complementary strand C1. No DEAL conjugate encoded to spot C1 was added. After flowing at ~0.5 l/min for 10 minutes, the 37 microfluidic PDMS slab was removed and the glass slide imaged. The dashed lines delineate separate microfluidic channels of 600 m width. To validate the DEAL strategy for protein detection, we utilized encoded antibodies to detect cognate antigens in a variant of standard immunoassays. In a standard immunoassay (52), a primary an tibody is adsorbed onto a solid support, followed by the sequential introduction and incu bation of the antige n-containing sample and secondary labeled \"read-out \" antibody, with rinsing steps in between. In order to simplify this conventional five step imm unoassay, we reasoned that the encoding power of the DEAL antibodies could serve to position the entire sandwich complex to the appropriate location for multiplexed readout, redu cing the assay to a single step. To test this concept, in the same solutio n, a non-fluorescent, DNA-encoded 1o antibody was combined with antigen and a fluorescently-labeled (no DNA) 2o antibody. Under these conditions, a fluorescent signal will be spatially encoded only if an antibody-antigen- antibody sandwich is successfully formed in homogeneous solution and localized onto the microarray. Upon introduction of DNA-en coded antibodies against two IFN- and TNF- , cognate DEAL sandwich assays self-assembled to thei r specific spatial locations where they were detected, as shown in Figure 2.8 . This multi-protein immunoassay also took 10 minutes to complete. 38 Figure 2.8 DNA-templated protein immunoassays executed within microfluidic channels. The 600 m micrometer wide channels are delineated with white dashed lines. (a). Two parameter DEAL immunoassay showing the detection of IFN- at spot A1 with a PE labeled 2o antibody (green channel) and replicate detection of TNF- at spots B1 and C1 with an APC labeled 2o antibody (red channel). (b) Human IL-2 concentration series visualized using a fluorescent 2o antibody for detection. (c) Human IL-2 concentration series developed using Au electroless deposition as a visualization and amplification strategy. We explored the sensitivity limits of a microfluidics, DEAL-based sandwich immunoassay, using a third interl a fluore scent readout strategy, the assay peaked with a sensitivity limit of ar ound 1 nM on slides printed at saturating concentrations of 5 M of complementary DNA. Severa l strategies were employed to increase the sensitivity. First, we reasoned that increasing the loading capacity of the glass slide for DNA will increase the dens ity of DEAL conjuga tes localized and therefore, increase the number of capture events possible. Conventional DNA microarrays are printed on primary amine surfaces generated by reacting amine-silane 39 with glass (53). DNA strands are immobilized through electrostatic interactions between the negative charges on the phosphate backbone of DNA and the positive charges from the protonated amines at neutral pH conditions . To increase the loading capacity of the slide, we generated poly-lysine surfaces, incr easing both the charge density as well as the surface area of interaction with DNA. By adopting these changes, it became possible to print complementary DNA at saturating concentrations of 100 M on the glass slides. Correspondingly, the sensitivity of the fluores cent based assays increased to 10 pM (Figure 2.8b ). In addition, we chose to employ Au nanoparticle-labeled 2o antibodies, followed by electroless metal deposition (54), to further amplify the signal and transform a florescence based read out to an optical one. This is possible since spatial, rather than colorimetric multiplexing, is utilized. Adop ting these improvements, the presence of IL- 2 interleukin can be readily detected at a concentration limit less than 10 fM ( Figure 2.8c), representing at least a 1000-fold sensi tivity increase over the fluorescence based microfluidics immunoassay. In comparison, this method is 100-1000-fold more sensitive than conventional ELISA (55), and 150 time s more sensitive than the corresponding human IL-2 ELISA data from the manufacturer (56). In performing these experiments, the idea of a 1 step immunoassay was revised. The sensitivity of the assays was reduced when performing a 1 step immunoassay, especially at lower concentrations of antigen. This is most likely due to competitive binding between DEAL conjugates with and without cargo for hybridization unto the underlying DNA microarray. By sequentially exposing the array to DEAL conjugate, antigen, and then secondary antibody, the sensitiv ities were increased. This is a clear trade off between convenience and sensitivity. It should still be stressed however, that 40 maximum signal is still reached under microf luidic flowing conditions within 10 minutes for each step. Thus in a fully automated device, a complete microfluidic immunoassay with sensitivities down to 10 fM can be obtained in 1 hour (including a 30 minute step for Au amplification). In addition to the sample size and time-scale benefits that accompany this type of microfluidics immunoassay, there are other advantages. For exampl e, since the entire assay is performed in solution prior to re ad-out, protein denatu ration (a concern for spotted antibody microarrays) does not reduce bi nding efficiency. In addition, any assay that involves substrate-supporte d antibodies, would not have su rvived microfluidic chip assembly (which involved an extended bake at 80oC). That procedure was designed to yield robust PDMS microfluidics channels that could then be disassembled for the optical readout step. Another benefit of performing so lution phase assays is that the orientational freedom enjoyed by both the antigens and antib odies ensures that the solid suppo rt will not limit the access of analytes to the binding po cket of the capture agent. We explore this issue in further detail below in the section of cell sor ting. Other improvements, such as reducing the DNA spot size (57), and re moving spot redundancy are currently being investigated to further lower detection limits. 2.3.5 Multiplexed sorting of immortalized and primary immune cells We extended the DEAL technique for multiplexed cell sorting. The most common method for cell sorting is FACS, which is well-suited for many applications. Unfortunately, cells separated by conventiona l FACS are not immediately available for post-sorting analysis of gene and/or protein expression. In addition, FACS is also limited by the number of spectrally distinct fluorophores that can be utilized to label the cell 41 surface markers used for the sorting. FACS, however, is robust in sorting cells according to multiple cell surface markers. Amongst other alternative cell sorting strategies, the traditional panning method, in which cells in teract with surface marker-specific antibodies printed onto an underlying substrate ( 58), is particularly relevant. Panning is capable of separating multiple cell populations, but has the same limitations as conventional spotted protein microarrays, namely that antibodies are not always oriented appropriately on a surface, and they can also dry out and lose functionality. DEAL overcomes this limitation, by keeping all reagents in solution. We compared DEAL-based cell sorting with panning by evaluating homogeneous cell capture (solution phase cell capture) a nd heterogeneous capture of cells (surface confined cell capture). The homogeneous DEAL method exhibite d higher cell capture efficiency as shown in Figure 9a,b . The increase in capture efficiency can be attributed to several factors. In homogeneous cell capture, the DEAL conjugates are allowed to properly orient and bind to the cell surface mark ers in solution. Cell capture is not driven by antibody to cell surface marker interactions, but rather by the increased avidity of the multivalent DEAL conjugates for the comple mentary DNA strands on the microarray through cooperative binding, greatly increasing capture efficiency. Similar trends have been reported for nanoparticle, DNA hybridization schemes (59). With this process, it is typical to see a DNA spot entirely occupied by a confluent layer of cells. With panning methods, which are analogous to our (heteroge neous) DEAL defined arrays, the capture agents are restricted to adopt a random or ientation on the surface. The activity of the antibodies is reduced, simply because of improper orientation for interaction with the cell 42 surface markers, decreasing maximum avidity and cooperation with neighboring antibodies. Figure 2.9 Optimization and use of DEAL for multiplexed cell sorting. Panels a and b are brightfield images showing the efficiency of the homogeneous DEAL cell capture process. (a) DEAL labeled antibodies are first assembled onto a spotted DNA array, followed by introduction of the cells. This heterogeneous process is si milar to the traditional panning method of using surface bound antibodies to trap specific cells. (b) A homogeneous assay in which DEAL labeled antibodies are combined with the cells, and then the mixture is introduced onto the spotted DNA array microchip. This process is clearly much more efficient. Brightfield and fluorescence microscopy images of multiplexed cell sorting experiments where a 1:1 mixture of mRFP- expressing T cells (red channel) and EGFP-expres sing B cells (green channel) is spatially stratified onto spots A1 and B1, corresponding to the encoding of -CD90.2 and -B220 antibodies with A1' and B1', respectively. (c) Fluorescence micrograph of multiplexed sorting of primary cells harvested from mice. A 1:1 mixture of CD4+ cells from EGFP transgenic mice and CD8+ cells from dsRed transgenic mice are separated to spots A1 and C1 by utilizing DEAL conjugates -CD4-A1' and -CD8-C1', respectively. We also investigated the use of DEAL for multiplexed cell sorting. Two unique DNA strands were conjugated to antibodies raised against the T cell marker CD90.2 (Thy1.2) and the B cell marker CD45R (B220), respectively. Multiplexed DEAL-based cell sorting was demonstrated by spatially separating a 1:1 mixture of monomeric Red (VL-3, murine thymic lymphoma) and EGFP-expressing B cells (mouse B cell ly mphoma). This mixture was incubated 43 with uniquely encoded DNA-antibody conjugates against both T and B cell markers and introduced to an appropriately spotted microarray. Figure 2.9c shows both brightfield and false color fluorescence micrographs demo nstrating that the mRFP-expressing T cells are enriched at spots A1 and EGFP-expressing B-cells located at B1, consistent with the DNA-encoding of the respective antibodies. Primary cells are usually more fragile than established cell lines. This is due to the fact that they have to be ex tracted (usually by enzymatic di gestions) from the surrounding tissues, a process that can lead to decreased viability. Moreover, the culture process often selects for clones characterized by greatly increased viability as well as proliferation potential. A generalized cell sorting technology must ther efore also work on primary cells with minimal sample manipulation. To demonstrate the utility of DEAL for primary cell sorting, a synthetic mixture of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was isolated via magnetic negative depletion from EGFP- and dsRED- transgenic mice, respectively. The mixture was stratified using -CD4 and -CD8 DNA-antibody conjugates. As shown in Figure 2.9d, the two cell types were separated to diffe rent spatial locations according to the pendant DNA encoding. 2.3.6 Single environment detection of specific cDNAs, proteins and cells To highlight the universal diversity of th is platform, GFP-expressing B cells were tagged with B1' DNA-encoded antibody conjugates and spatially loca ted onto spots (B1) encoded with the complementary oligonucleotide. Post cell localiz ation, FITC-labeled A1' DNA and a C1'-encoded TNF- immunosandwich, were combined and introduced to the platform. The resu lting brightfield and fluorescence microscopy 44 images, shown in Figure 2.10 , demonstrate the validity of the DEAL platform for simultaneously extending across differen t levels of biological complexity. Figure 2.10 Microscopy images demonstrating si multaneous cell capture at spot B1 and multi-parameter detection of genes and proteins, at spots A1 and C1, respectively . The brightfield image shows EGFP-expressing B cells (green channel) located to spots B1, FITC- labeled (green) cDNA at A1, and an APC-labeled TNF- sandwich immunoassay (blue) encoded to C1. The scale bar corresponds to 300 m. 2.4 Conclusions By utilizing DNA as a universa l linkage we have demonstrated a platform capable of simultaneous cell sorting, ssDNA and protein detection. DEAL represents a promising approach for the large scale, multi-parameter analysis of biological samples. We are currently applying DEAL toward s the separation of highly co mplex primary cell mixtures such as whole mouse spleen and whole mouse thymus extracts. In addition, microfluidics-based DEAL immunoassays arra ys are currently being harnessed for the analysis of protein biomarke r panels from mouse whole- blood. We are particularly interested in integrating DEAL with advan ced, on chip tissue handling tasks followed by simultaneous quantitation of mRNAs and proteins, because this is where DEAL can 45 potentially assist in pathological analysis of cancerous tissu es. From a more fundamental cancer biology perspective, a near-term target ed application is the capture and functional evaluation of tumor-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (28, 61). Such an application requires both rare cell capture, cell activation, and the subs equent detection of secreted proteins. For such problems, DEAL has the po tential to eliminate any adverse effects of sample dilution and can thus greatly simplif y the analysis of the biological system. 46 2.5 References 1.

This approach to conjugate synthesis is expected to result in a distribution of DNA loadings for each antibody, however, we f eel as this effect is exaggerated in preparation for PAGE analysis. We obser ved that normal conditions for the heat- induced denaturation proceed ing gel electrophoresis (100o for 5 minutes) reduced the number of DNA-strands visualized, presumably by breaking the hydrazone 50 linkage between the DNA and the protei n. By relaxing the denaturing conditions, a sample heated at 60o for 5 minutes (minimum requi red for good gel) showed up to 7 discrete bands, whereas the same sample heated at 100o for 5 minutes showed no pendant oligonucleotides. 42.

Computational derivation of Orthogonal DNA oligomers There are several applications of the computational algorithm developed by Dirks et al. (38). First it can accept a list of sequences ( A, B, C, ... n ) and return with an exhaustive file listing the relative interac tion strengths between any two DNA sequences. This value, reported as n(s*), roughly represents the orthog onality of the two sequences that are being compared. As an example, sequences A1, B1 and C1 (inputs as A, B, and C respectively) were analyzed and the results are listed in Appendix 2.6.1 . Here, the interaction strength of sequence B with B, representing intra-strand interactions, has the lowest n(s*)value of 7.525723 , and thus is the most orth ogonal pair. In comparison, the interaction strength of An with An (n represents the complement operator) has the highest n(s*) value of 16.406083 and thus is the least orthogonal pair. A good measure of the global orthogonality of a set of sequences is determined by the set with the lowest n(s*). Besides analysis, a set of sequences can be generated by inputing a set of constraints (e.g. sequence length, defined se quences, etc.) and the program will return with a set of sequences ranked according to n(s*) adhering to the given constraints. An example of this is given by the input file shown in Appendix 2.6.2 , where the input code asks for 3 orthogonal sequences ( A, B, and C ) such that each sequences begins with a polyA 10 header before a variable 20mer region. The set of sequences (truncated to show only 3 sets of 10 total) with the lowest n(s*) value of 149.225 was taken and defined to be A3, B3 and C3, the sequences used in this chapter ( Appendix 2.6.3 ). This 53 process can be to in crease the ) is the computation of a fourth DNA sequence. 2.6.1 Computational analysis of sequence A1, B1, and C1 Results sorted by n(s*) sum A_A: Computing orthogonal sequences A, B, and C constrained by a polyA 10 header: input file R: 10, 20, 20, 20 %%Defining R to contain 10, or 20 bases R1: AAAAAAAAAA %%Defining the first 10 bases to be polyA 10 A_A: 1, 2, 1, 2 %%Sequence A is composed of R1 = polyA10, and R2 which is variable 20 mer ..............................+..............................
