Some people with vertigo claim that \"natural\" or home remedies can improve the spinning and dizzy sensations they feel. These remedies are often used along with standard medical care. You should only try home complementary and alternative therapies if your doctor gives you the go-ahead. Some are completely safe, but others can cause more harm than good if you have certain medical conditions. Repositioning Exercises You Can Do at Home If your doctor has diagnosed you as having the most common form of vertigo, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), some techniques that are used to reposition crystals in your inner ear can be done at home. Your healthcare provider will give you step-by-step instructions on how to effectively perform these evidence-supported exercises. Epley Maneuver The Epley maneuver, also called \"canalith repositioning,\" involves a series of head and body movements to move crystals out of the semicircular canals of your inner ear. It is generally considered safe and effective, according to [research](https://www.cochrane.org/CD003162/ENT_the-epley-manoeuvre-for-benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo-bppv). While the therapy is often performed by a professional at a doctor's office, you may be shown how to do modified exercises at home. The at-home Epley maneuver typically involves the following steps for the left ear: - Start by sitting upright on a bed with a pillow behind you. Turn your head 45 degrees to the right side. - Quickly lie down on your back with your head still turned. Hold this position for at least 30 seconds. - Slowly turn your head 90 degrees to the left side without lifting your neck and wait for 30 seconds. - Turn your whole body and head another 90 degrees to the left side and wait for 30 seconds. - Slowly sit up. - Repeat these steps if needed, up to three times on the problematic side. ( [1](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/home-epley-maneuver)) This technique can be performed on either side of your body. You might feel symptoms of vertigo during the treatment. The Semont Maneuver \u2014 Another Home Exercise to Try The Semont maneuver is similar to the Epley maneuver, but it doesn't require as much neck flexibility. Here's how it works for the left ear: - Start by sitting on the edge of your bed. - Turn your head 45 degrees to the right and quickly lie down on your left side. Hold this position for one minute. - Quickly reposition yourself to lie on your right side without changing the orientation of your head (so now you are looking diagonally downward toward the floor). Hold this position for one minute. - Slowly return to sitting at the edge of your bed and keep your head level for 10 minutes. You can perform this exercise to help either the left or right ear. ( [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKq8RL0mNUA)) Brandt-Daroff Technique \u2014 Moving Ear Crystals to a More Neutral Position The Brant-Daroff method is another way to reposition crystals in the inner ear. It involves the following steps: - Start by sitting upright on the edge of a bed. - Turn your head 45 degrees to the left, then lie down on your right side. Hold this position for 30 seconds or until dizziness goes away. - Sit up and turn your head back to the center. - Turn your head 45 degrees to the right side and then lie down on your left side. Hold this position for 30 seconds or until dizziness goes away. - Sit up and turn your head back to the center.

For instance, those with vertigo symptoms who were diagnosed as having M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease or migraine-associated vertigo may find that avoiding certain types of foods or substances can promote fluid balance in the ears and body. Common culprits that could aggravate vertigo in certain people with these diagnoses include: - Salty foods - Sugary foods - Alcohol [Caffeine](/drugs/caffeine) People with migraine-associated vertigo may also need to avoid trigger foods that contain the amino acid tyramine. These may include: - Smoked meats - Yogurt - Chocolate - Bananas - Ripened cheeses - Nuts - Citrus fruits - Chicken liver - Red wine ( [4](https://vestibular.org/understanding-vestibular-disorders/treatment/vestibular-diet)) Can Supplements and Essential Oils Help? Overall, the research on supplements and other herbal therapies is limited and variable depending on the specific [vertigo diagnosis](/neurology/what-tests-will-my-doctor-use-diagnose-vertigo/). So it's best to review with your medical team if and how best to incorporate any of these therapies into your treatment plan. For example, a 2014 Ukrainian study found [ginkgo biloba](/drugs/ginkgo-biloba) extract to be as effective as a prescription medicine for treating vertigo symptoms in patients without a specific vertigo diagnosis. ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4099171/)) Other studies have shown that a lack of [vitamin D](/drugs/vitamin-d) is associated with worsening vertigo symptoms in some people with BPPV. ( [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96445-x)) You can increase your levels of vitamin D by taking a supplement, getting more sunlight, or eating foods rich in the vitamin. However, there isn't strong evidence that treating [vitamin D deficiency](/vitamin-d/) will significantly improve symptoms. Some people claim that using essential oils, like peppermint, [lavender](/diet/what-are-possible-benefits-lavender-must-know-facts-about-therapeutic-plant/), lemon balm, ginger, and frankincense, helps improve symptoms of vertigo. While there's [some evidence](https://balanceanddizziness.org/diagnosis-and-treatment/cam-treatments/) that certain oils have medicinal benefits, the results are often mixed. Managing the Stress That Comes With the Condition Some conditions that cause vertigo symptoms can be worsened by stress. Managing your [stress levels](/stress/guide/causes/) is important for your overall health. Meditation, deep-breathing techniques, or exercise may help you feel more relaxed. Talk to your doctor for more tips on how to control your stress. ( [7](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menieres-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374916)) Yoga Can Help Improve Balance and Reduce Stress Yoga is a good way to [improve flexibility](/fitness/how-become-more-flexible-because-yes-its-important/) and balance, strengthen muscles, and reduce stress. Simple [yoga poses](/fitness-pictures/yoga-poses-for-beginners.aspx) may also help symptoms of vertigo. But you'll probably want to avoid any positions that require sudden forward bends, as these may worsen symptoms (and in rare cases, [trigger BPPV](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335944678_Benign_Paroxysmal_Positional_Vertigo_after_Yoga_Practice)). ( [8](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/yoga/benefits/yoga-for-vertigo)) RELATED: [Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Stress \u2014 Including How to Manage It](//www.everydayhealth.com/stress/guide/) Some Evidence Suggests That Acupuncture Helps Studies have shown [acupuncture](/alternative-health/what-is-acupuncture-a-beginners-guide-to-how-it-works-and-how-it-may-improve-your-health/) may be a safe and effective way to treat vertigo. ( [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4459064/)) Acupuncture involves inserting tiny needles into the skin to stimulate certain points on your body. Tending to Your Overall Wellness Is Important, Too Some simple wellness measures can help you avoid a vertigo episode and keep you feeling your best. These include: - Staying Hydrated Be sure to drink enough fluids throughout the day. Some causes of vertigo are linked to [dehydration](/news/unusual-signs-of-dehydration/). - Getting Enough Sleep Sleep deprivation can [trigger episodes of vertigo](/vertigo/causes-risk-factors/). Try to get at least seven to eight hours of sleep at night, and rest throughout the day if you need to. - Eating a Healthy Diet Consuming nutritious, whole foods can help you feel better and maintain a healthy weight. Try to include lots of veggies, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins in your diet. Also, avoid any trigger foods that might worsen your vertigo symptoms. - Exercising Exercise can make you feel better overall. It might be difficult to exercise if you feel dizzy, but start with simple activities, like walking. If your symptoms are severe, some exercises can be performed while sitting in a chair. Ask your doctor about a regimen that fits your needs. Also, be sure to drink plenty of water before, during, and after a workout.
