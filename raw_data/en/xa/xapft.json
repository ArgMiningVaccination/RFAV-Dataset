The committee was most strongly influenced by the prospective, randomised French cooperative study that compared melphalan 140 mg/m2 plus 8 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) vs. high dose melphalan 200 mg/m2 (HDM) in 282 newly diagnosed, previously untreated, symptomatic patients, less than 65 years of age. [r](#reference-b3ed528c-2227-4844-96dc-83072f113de9) The melphalan 200 mg/m2 regimen was better tolerated with less toxicities overall. The median duration of event-free survival (EFS) was similar in both arms (21 months), but survival at 45 months was significantly better in patients receiving melphalan 200 mg/m2 (65% vs. 45 %). [r](#reference-b3ed528c-2227-4844-96dc-83072f113de9) Similar results were seen for melphalan 200 mg/m2 conditioning pre-ASCT in the various studies that followed. Studies using higher doses of melphalan, the addition of alkylating agents or more intensive preparative regimens have not demonstrated significant improvements, either in terms of response rates or in has also been evaluated in the group of patients with myeloma and dialysis-dependent end-stage renal failure. A large retrospective analysis from the MD Anderson Cancer Center, of patients with renal failure, dialysis dependence and myeloma undergoing HDM and ASCT, found all-grade organ toxicities were higher in the melphalan 200 mg/m2 group compared to 140 mg/m2. Therefore, the lower melphalan dosing schedule may be preferred in this group [r](#reference-9fd08276-d948-422e-b6c1-f4ce0de8ed3c) Conditioning regimens in primary systemic amyloidosis (AL) are based on adaptations of HDM. The usual melphalan dose is 200 mg/m2, although a 'risk-adapted' approach, with dose reduction to 140 mg/m2 used in higher-risk patients in order to reduce transplant-related toxicity. [r](#reference-d8ae0f89-cc17-4772-b285-aa08f8bd2beb) Criteria for defining 'high-risk' patients are; age >60, increased creatinine level, performance status (PS) 2 or compensated cardiac failure. Reduced dose melphalan has been associated with a decreased response rate in some studies [r](#reference-a1a2219f-3a3e-40d4-a984-cd8b75247f61) but not in others. [r](#reference-b9e08f3d-1730-4dba-b5aa-7153b88e6fc8) Overall, HDM results in significant responses (VGPR and CR) in 50-60% of patients, with complete responses (defined by a negative immunofixation and normal free immunoglobulin light chain) in about one third of patients.
