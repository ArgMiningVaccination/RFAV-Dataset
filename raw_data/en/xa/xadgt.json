None of us wants to see our children get sick. If we could, we would protect them from any illness, no matter how Now suppose you could make your child safe from some of the most deadly diseases in history. Suppose that at the same time you could also help protect your neighbors' children and other children around the country from the same diseases. Finally, you could actually help to rid the world of some of these diseases that have been crippling and killing children for centuries. You can do all of these things with one of the easiest and yet most powerful health tools ever developed. You can make sure you immunize your children. How do vaccines work? When you receive a [vaccine](https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm), it helps your body to create antibodies. Antibodies are the body's defenses that fight off any foreign substances (germs). Although your body can create antibodies on its own, many of the vaccine-preventable diseases cause severe illness and even death before your body can produce enough antibodies. Immunization (vaccination) schedule [Vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm) work best when given at certain ages. For example, health care professionals do not usually administer the [measles](https://www.medicinenet.com/measles_rubeola/article.htm) vaccine until a child is at least 1 year old. If a child receives the [measles](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/measles_picture/picture.htm) vaccine earlier than that, it may not work as well. On the other hand, the DTaP vaccine should be given over a period of time in a series of properly spaced doses. More information about the specific diseases your child is vaccinated against is listed later in this article. Following is a description of the routine childhood immunization schedule. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and [Prevention](https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm) (CDC) publishes the schedule each year. What are the recommended childhood vaccines, and at what ages they should be given? Hepatitis B vaccine: - First dose at birth before discharge from the hospital - Second dose at 1 to 2 months - Third dose at 6 to 18 months Hib vaccine: - First dose at 2 months - Second dose at 4 months - Third dose at 6 months (depending upon type of Hib vaccine given) - Fourth dose at 12 to 15 months Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV): - First dose at 2 months - Second dose at 4 months - Third dose at 6 to 18 months - Fourth dose at 4 to 6 years DTaP vaccine: - First dose at 2 months - Second dose at 4 months - Third dose at 6 months - Fourth dose at 15 to 18 months - Fifth dose at 4 to 6 years - Health care professionals recommend that children receive the Tdap at 11 years of age. In certain U.S. states (for example, California), entry into seventh grade requires receipt of the Tdap vaccination. Pneumococcal vaccine: - First dose at 2 months - Second dose at 4 months - Third dose at 6 months - Fourth dose at 12 to 18 months Rotavirus vaccine: - First dose at 2 months - Second dose at 4 months - Third dose at 6 months (depending upon type of [rotavirus](https://www.medicinenet.com/rotavirus/article.htm)vaccine given) Hepatitis A vaccine: - First dose at 12 to 23 months - Second dose at 6 to 18 months after the first dose Influenza vaccine: - First dose at 6 months (requires a booster one month after initial vaccine if less than 9 years of age) - Annually after that MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine: - First dose at 12 to 15 months - Second dose at 4 to 6 years Varicella (chickenpox) vaccine: - First dose at 12 to 15 months - Second dose at 4 to 6 years Meningococcal vaccine (Men ACWY): - First dose at 11 years - Second dose at 16 years Meningococcal B vaccine: - First dose at 16-18 years - Second dose six months after the first dose Human papillomavirus vaccine (two schedules): If first dose given before 15 years: - First dose at 11 years - Second dose six months after first dose If first does given after 15 years: - Second dose two months after first dose - Third dose six months after first dose [](https://www.medicinenet.com/childrens_health_illnesses_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) SLIDESHOWSee Slideshow What should you do if your child misses a shot? For most [vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm), it is never too late to catch up on missed shots. Children who missed their first shots at 2 months of age can start later. Children who have received some of their shots and then fallen behind schedule can catch up without having to start over. If you have children who were not immunized when they were infants, or who have gotten behind schedule, contact your doctor or the health department clinic. They will help you get your children up to date on their immunizations. (NOTE: Don't postpone your child's immunizations just because you know he or she can catch up later. Every month a child goes without scheduled immunizations is a month that the child is unprotected from vaccine-preventable diseases.) Combination vaccines A combination vaccine is more than one vaccine contained in a single shot. Doctors and parents both like them because they allow a child to get several vaccines at once without having to get as many injections. Several combination vaccines are already in use (for example, MMR, MMRV, DTaP, Hib/HepB, DTaP/IPV/HepB, DtaP/IPV/Hib, and DtaP/IPV). More are under development. Vaccination checklist Rarely, a child should wait before getting certain vaccines or should not get them at all. Tell your doctor or nurse if any of these apply to your child on a day when an immunization visit is scheduled. - Is your child very sick today? (He or she has more than a [common cold](https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm), [earache](https://www.medicinenet.com/earache/symptoms.htm), etc.) - Does your child have any severe (life-threatening) [allergies](https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm)? - Has your child ever had a severe reaction after a vaccination? - Does your child have a weakened immune system (because of diseases such as [cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm)or medications such as steroids)? - Has your child received a transfusion or any other blood product recently? - Has your child ever had convulsions or any kind of nervous system problem? - Will your child be exposed to anyone with a compromised immune system (for example, receiving [cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm)chemotherapy)? What are the vaccine-preventable diseases? Hib vaccine - This vaccine protects against infection with the Haemophilus influenzae type b bacteria. - These bacteria cause [meningitis](https://www.medicinenet.com/meningitis/article.htm)(an inflammation of the covering membranes that surround the brain) and may cause brain damage. Also these bacteria can infect the blood, joints, bones, muscles, throat, and the cover surrounding the [heart](https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_how_the_heart_works/article.htm). This is especially dangerous for [babies](https://www.medicinenet.com/babies_quiz/quiz.htm). Before the vaccine era, this was an extremely common cause of acquired [brain injury](https://www.medicinenet.com/head_injury/article.htm)in children and infants. The Hib vaccine does not protect against the [influenza](https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm)virus and does not protect against the [flu](https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm). DTaP vaccine The D in DTaP stands for [diphtheria](https://www.medicinenet.com/diphtheria_facts/article.htm). - Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a bacterium that attacks the throat, mouth, and nose. This is a very [contagious](https://www.medicinenet.com/contagious_quiz/quiz.htm)disease (easy to get), but occurrences have been rare since the vaccine was created. [Diphtheria](https://www.medicinenet.com/diphtheria_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm)can form a gray web that may completely cover the windpipe and cause someone to stop [breathing](https://www.medicinenet.com/lungs_design_and_purpose/article.htm). - Also, if this disease is not treated right away, it could cause [pneumonia](https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm), [heart failure](https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_failure/article.htm), or [paralysis](https://www.medicinenet.com/paralysis/symptoms.htm). The T in DTaP stands for [tetanus](https://www.medicinenet.com/tetanus/article.htm). [Tetanus](https://www.medicinenet.com/tetanus_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm)is an infection caused by a type of bacteria found in dirt, gravel, and rusty metal. It usually enters the body through a cut. - Infection with tetanus bacteria causes the muscles to spasm (move suddenly). If tetanus attacks the jaw muscles, it causes [lockjaw](https://www.medicinenet.com/tetanus/article.htm), which is the inability to open and close your mouth. - Tetanus can also cause the breathing muscles to spasm, with potentially fatal consequences. The P in DTaP stands for [pertussis](https://www.medicinenet.com/pertussis/article.htm). - Bordetella [pertussis](https://www.medicinenet.com/whooping_cough_pertussis_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm)is the type of bacteria that causes [whooping cough](https://www.medicinenet.com/pertussis/article.htm). It infects the airways and destroys the cells responsible for clearing [mucus](https://www.medicinenet.com/treating_congestion/article.htm)and other debris. This results in an infection associated with a severe prolonged [cough](https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm)and typical \"whoop.\" The [cough](https://www.medicinenet.com/cough/symptoms.htm)can last for more than two months and typically causes severe illness in the very young and very old. Recently recommendations were added to administer boosters to adolescents. Infants who develop pertussis are at moderate risk for the development of [seizures](https://www.medicinenet.com/seizures_symptoms_and_types/article.htm). Polio vaccine - A virus causes [polio](https://www.medicinenet.com/polio_facts/article.htm). It can cause paralysis of the legs and chest, making [walking](https://www.medicinenet.com/walking/article.htm)and breathing difficult or impossible. - The first symptoms of [polio](https://www.medicinenet.com/polio_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm)are [fever](https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm), [sore throat](https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm), [headache](https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm), and a [stiff neck](https://www.medicinenet.com/stiff_neck/symptoms.htm). Polio is very rare in the United States since the vaccine became available; however, it is still somewhat common in other countries. MMR vaccine The first M in MMR stands for measles. - Measles is a highly contagious (easy to get) virus that causes a high [fever](https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm), cough, and a spotty [rash](https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/article.htm)all over the body. It may also cause [ear infections](https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_infection/article.htm)and [pneumonia](https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_quiz/quiz.htm). The second M in MMR stands for [mumps](https://www.medicinenet.com/mumps/article.htm). - Mumps is a virus which causes painful, swollen salivary glands, which are located in front of the ears (where sideburns are located), as well as a fever and a [headache](https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm). - Mumps also may cause serious problems, including [meningitis](https://www.medicinenet.com/meningitis_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm)or [hearing loss](https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm). It can cause inflammation of the testicles (orchitis) in males. The R in MMR stands for [rubella](https://www.medicinenet.com/rubella_german_measles_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm). - A virus causes [rubella](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/rubella_1_picture/picture.htm), also known as German measles. It is most dangerous for women who are [pregnant](https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm). [Rubella](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/rubella_2_picture/picture.htm)can cause a mother to have a [miscarriage](https://www.medicinenet.com/miscarriage_causes_and_symptoms/article.htm)or deliver a baby with [heart disease](https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_coronary_artery_disease/article.htm), [blindness](https://www.medicinenet.com/blindness/article.htm), [hearing loss](https://www.medicinenet.com/hearing_loss/symptoms.htm), or learning problems. - Rubella is a mild disease in children. Hepatitis B vaccine [Hepatitis B](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_b/article.htm)is a virus that causes inflammation of the [liver](https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm). Signs and symptoms are extreme [tiredness](https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm)and [jaundice](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/jaundice_picture/picture.htm)(moderate yellowing of the whites of the eyes and skin). It may cause the liver to stop working and has been associated with lifelong infection, liver failure, [liver cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_cancer_hepatocellular_carcinoma/article.htm), and even death. Varicella vaccine [Varicella](https://www.medicinenet.com/chickenpox_varicella/article.htm)is the virus that causes [chickenpox](https://www.medicinenet.com/chickenpox_varicella/article.htm). It causes an [itchy](https://www.medicinenet.com/itch/article.htm) [rash](https://www.medicinenet.com/rash/symptoms.htm)and a fever. You can catch it from someone who already has it if you touch an open [blister](https://www.medicinenet.com/blisters/symptoms.htm)on that person's skin or if that person sneezes or [coughs](https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm)around you. Varicella infection, though usually believed to be mild, also causes [pneumonia](https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm)(lung infections) and [encephalitis](https://www.medicinenet.com/encephalitis/article.htm)(brain infections). Pneumococcal vaccine [Streptococcus](https://www.medicinenet.com/streptococcal_infections/article.htm)pneumoniae is a bacterium which causes [ear infections](https://www.medicinenet.com/middle_ear_infection_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm), pneumonia (lung infection), [sepsis](https://www.medicinenet.com/sepsis/article.htm)(blood infection), and [meningitis](https://www.medicinenet.com/meningitis_quiz/quiz.htm). It is very dangerous to the very young and very old. Hepatitis A vaccine [Hepatitis A](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_a_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm)is a virus similar to [hepatitis B](https://www.medicinenet.com/hepatitis_b_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm). Transmission occurs by coming in contact with contaminated food or drink. Contamination of foods may occur from food handlers not following proper hygiene procedures. Early symptoms of the disease are nonspecific and may include fever, [diarrhea](https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/article.htm), and [abdominal pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/abdominal_pain_causes_remedies_treatment/article.htm). It causes acute [liver disease](https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease/article.htm). It can affect anyone at any age, and in the United States, it can occur as isolated cases or even in epidemics. Meningococcal vaccine - Neisseria meningitidis is a bacterium that causes meningitis (brain infection), [sepsis](https://www.medicinenet.com/sepsis_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm)(blood infection), and other infections. It is very dangerous infection and can cause [seizures](https://www.medicinenet.com/epilepsy_and_seizures_quiz/quiz.htm)and death. Often outbreaks occur in epidemics. Rotavirus vaccine - Rotavirus is a virus that causes severe [diarrhea](https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea_digestive_problem_food_pictures_slideshow/article.htm)in very young infants. It causes over 55,000 hospitalizations each year in the United States and over 400,000 deaths worldwide. Children with this virus develop [vomiting](https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm)and watery [diarrhea](https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea/symptoms.htm), which causes them to become dehydrated. Human papillomavirus vaccine [Human papillomaviruses](https://www.medicinenet.com/hpv_infection_human_papillomavirus/article.htm)cause [genital warts in men](https://www.medicinenet.com/genital_warts_in_men_hpv_virus/article.htm)and women and [cervical cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/cervical_cancer/article.htm)in women (the [cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_quiz/quiz.htm)diagnosed by regular Pap testing). Annually, over 11,000 women develop [invasive cervical cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/cervical_cancer_pictures_slideshow/article.htm). Influenza vaccine - Influenza is a virus that causes severe respiratory illness. There are two major types, influenza A and influenza B. Each year, a new influenza vaccine is required because of the virus' tendency to mutate (change). The flu, as the disease is called, causes the most severe illness in the very young and the very old.

[Complete List](https://www.medicinenet.com/childhood_vaccination_schedule/index.htm) Top Childhood Vaccination Schedule Related Articles FeverAlthough a fever technically is any body temperature above the normal of 98.6 F (37 C), in practice, a person is usually not considered to have a significant fever until the temperature is above 100.4 F (38 C). Fever is part of the body's own disease-fighting arsenal; rising body temperatures apparently are capable of killing off many disease-producing organisms. Clinical TrialsClinical trials are a form of clinical research that follow a defined protocol that has been carefully developed to evaluate a clinical question. Clinical research is a type of study of clinical or biomedical questions through the use of human subjects. Clinical trials are divided into five types: treatment trials, prevention trials, diagnostic trials, screening trials, and quality of life trial. Flu Vaccine (Flu Shot)Every year in the United States, on average, 5%-20% of the population gets the flu, more than 500,000 people are hospitalized from flu complications, and about 34,000 people die from flu. The flu is highly infectious and is a serious viral respiratory infection. Flu vaccine is an inactivated vaccine, meaning that it contains killed influenza virus. Anyone who wishes to reduce their risk of getting the flu can be vaccinated, however the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who are at risk for serious complications from the flu be vaccinated each year. LaryngitisLaryngitis is an inflammation of the voice box (vocal cords). The most common cause of acute laryngitis is an infection, which inflames the vocal cords. Symptoms may vary from the degree of laryngitis and age of the person (laryngitis in infants and children is more commonly caused by croup). Measles PictureMeasles. Measles is an extremely contagious illness caused by a virus that replicates in the nose and throat of those infected. Although typically considered a childhood disease, anyone who is not vaccinated can get it. Symptoms such as a red itchy rash, fever, cough and runny nose usually begin appearing a week after exposure and progress in stages over a period of 2-3 weeks. It's possible for you to be contagious to others for several days before you know you are sick and remain contagious even after the rash disappears. MeningitisMeningitis is inflammation of the membranes that cover the spinal cord and brain. Symptoms include fever, headache, and a stiff neck. Treatment of meningitis depends upon the cause of the infection and may include antibiotics or antiviral medications. Whooping Cough (Pertussis) Symptoms, Vaccine FactsWhooping cough (Bordetella pertussis) is a highly contagious bacterial infection. Vaccines and antibiotics could prevent whooping cough. Learn about the symptoms, causes, and treatment of whooping cough. Pneumococcal Vaccination (Pneumonia Vaccine)Pneumococcal vaccination prevents one of the most common and severe forms of pneumonia. It is usually given only once in a lifetime, usually after the age of 55, to someone with ongoing lung problems (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma) or other chronic diseases (including those involving the heart and kidneys). Testicular PainTesticular pain has many causes, including testicular torsion, cancer, injury and epididymitis. Treatment of pain in the testicles depends on the cause. TetanusTetanus is an often-fatal disease caused by nerve toxins produced by the common bacteria Clostridium tetani. In a 7-day period after infection, a person experiences muscle spasms, restlessness, headache, irritability, then lockjaw, and the lungs stop functioning. Tetanus is treatable with antibiotics and drainage. Sedation is often give to stop muscle spasms. Tuberculosis Skin Test (PPD Skin Test)The tuberculosis skin test is based on the fact that infection with M. tuberculosis produces a delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reaction to certain components of the bacterium. The standard recommended tuberculin test is administered by injecting 0.1mL of 5 TU (tuberculin units) PPD into the top layers of skin of the forearm. \"Reading\" the skin test means detecting a raised, thickened local area of skin reaction, referred to as induration. The area of induration (palpable, raised, hardened area) around the site of injection is the reaction to tuberculin. Vaccination FAQVaccinations increase our ability to fight diseases that may be contagious or even fatal. Immunity occurs by getting the disease or through the use of a vaccine. There are two types of vaccine: inactivated vaccines and vaccines made from live, weakened viruses. "}
