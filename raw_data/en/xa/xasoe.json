It's, by far, my favorite makeup product and it is the one makeup product I probably never leave the house without wearing. I do not wear a full face of makeup every day, but it is rare that I am not at least wearing mascara. As much as I love makeup, I am also really passionate about using safe, clean, organic, natural, and non-toxic makeup! Our skin is our largest organ and whatever we put on is absorbed into our bloodstream within about 20 seconds... so I have really been trying to make the switch to only using natural, safe, and clean beauty products. Since I love mascara so much, I thought it would be helpful to put a BUNCH of natural and organic mascaras to the test! There are a lot out there, but I wanted to do a sampling of organic mascaras with different price ranges, different claims (lengthening, curling, thickening, etc.). Here is what I did... I put some of the best natural and organic mascaras to the test! I have been using these for a few months now so I really got a good sense of how they wear. I will share with you what each mascara is, where you can get it, how much it is, and what the rating is on the Think Dirty app or on EWG Skin Deep. I have also shared with you a side by side comparison of my eye with no mascara and my eye with two coats of whatever mascara I am trying. YOU SHOULD KNOW... For all of these, I am wearing NO makeup other than mascara. I curled my eyelashes with an eyelash curler and I used a mascara / eyelash primer every time. In my opinion, these are necessary steps. Here is what I do with EVERY step! The first step is to curl your lashes! I love my eyelash curler from [Shiseido](http://amzn.to/2vDkR13)! is also grail eyelash curler! I usually hold for 5-10 seconds on each eye to get the maximum curl! Second step is to prime your lashes! $16.15 I use this as my mascara primer. This stuff is amazing! It is, by far, the best natural, cruelty free, clean mascara primer I have found. I apply it before I put on my mascara and it helps my mascara go on like a dream! [BeautyCounter [here](http://bit.ly/2tUY52B) Left is with no mascara - right is with two coats of BeautyCounter Lengthening Mascara. PROS: The formula is great and goes on smoothly. I also think it does lengthen well... CONS: Personally, I don't love a brush that small for upper lashes. I don't think it covers well enough. OVERALL THOUGHTS: Having used this for a few months, this is my go-to BOTTOM lash mascara. The brush is small enough that I think it is best for bottom lashes or those inner corner lashes that are hard to reach! +++ [Physician's Formula Organic Wear 100% Natural Origin Wear Mascara](http://amzn.to/2us6myQ) Price: $5.99 - $9.99 Think on [Amazon here](http://amzn.to/2us6myQ) or [Ulta Here](http://bit.ly/2tVuc2i) Left is with no mascara - right is with two coats of Physicians Formula Organic Wear Mascara PROS: I love the brush! It reminds me of the CoverGirl mascara that I used to love. I also think it goes on smoothly and doesn't clump! CONS: It's not as thickening as I'd normally like. OVERALL THOUGHTS: Honestly, having used this for a few months now, this is one of my FAVORITE non-toic mascaras and it is one of the most affordable! I highly recommend it! +++ [Naturally Rooted 100% Price: $14.99 Vegan, Free, Gluten Free Get it on [Amazon here](http://amzn.to/2eJgfTm) Left is with no mascara - right is with two coats of Naturally Rooted Premium Organic Mascara PROS: I like the brush a lot and I think it's a great \"natural\" looking mascara. Not bold at all. CONS: The formula is a little thick and honestly I don't feel like you get enough for what it is. It's just not my favorite formula. OVERALL THOUGHTS: Honestly, I think this may be my least favorite of all the mascaras I tried. If you like something that is \"better than your lashes\" mascara, but not crazy bold, this would be your choice. +++ [W3LL PEOPLE Expressionist Mascara](http://amzn.to/2uv9JDi) Price: $21.99-$23.99 Think Dirty Rating: it at [Target here](http://bit.ly/2tESfXY) or on [Amazon here](http://amzn.to/2uv9JDi) Left is with no mascara - right is with two coats of W3LL People Mascara PROS: I have used W3LL people mascara for a few years now and it is an old favorite. Honestly, this is one of my favorite clean mascaras and there's very little that I dislike about it. I love the brush, I love the formula, I love the consistency... it's a great mascara! I think a dupe would be the Physician's Formula I showed above. They are VERY similar! CONS: I'd like it to be a little thicker but other than that, I love this mascara. It layers really well! OVERALL THOUGHTS: It's one of my favorites! +++ RMS Beauty Defining Mascara Price: $28 Think Dirty Rating: 0 Get it on [Amazon here](http://amzn.to/2eJLbCZ) Left is with no mascara - right is with two coats of RMS Beauty Mascara PROS: The brush has a slight bend to it and that helps to get the product in there... but for me, that's about the only pro CONS: This is one of the most expensive mascaras in the bunch and it's probably my least favorite. The formula is clumpy, it doesn't go on very smooth, and it's just disappointing for what you pay for this mascara. OVERALL THOUGHTS: I love RMS Beauty as a brand, but this mascara is not my favorite. +++ 100% Pure Maracuja Oil Mascara Price: $25-$26 Think Dirty Rating: 0 Get it [from Be Pure Beauty here,](https://www.bepurebeauty.com/collections/lashes/products/fruit-pigmented-mascara?rfsn=299683.04930b) get it on [Amazon here](http://amzn.to/2vDY59q), or get it from the [100% Pure site here](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7649665/type/dlg/https://www.100percentpure.com/). Left is with no mascara - right is with two coats of 100% Pure Mascara PROS: I LOVE the formula of this mascara. I love the brush! I LOOOOOOOOOVE that it smells so amazing. Seriously. This mascara smells amazing. I don't think the picture does this mascara justice... but it is probably my favorite of the bunch. I've used it for awhile now and it's a go-to! CONS: Hard to think of any... I guess it *can* start to flake later in the day, but if I use a good mascara primer, I find that doesn't really happen. OVERALL THOUGHTS: One of my favorites!!! This is especially a great mascara for layering! +++ [Pacifica Stellar Gaze Mascara](http://bit.ly/2tVAe2K) Price: $13.99 Think it on [Amazon here](http://amzn.to/2eJ8AEu), or [Ulta here](http://bit.ly/2tVAe2K) Left is with no mascara - right is with two coats of PACIFICA Stellar Gaze Mascara PROS: This is another favorite of mine. I looooove the brush, love the formula, and it goes on very natural! CONS: It doesn't create a thickness I usually like. OVERALL THOUGHTS: This is one of my favorites and I travel with it a lot. It is also another great layering mascara! +++ [Chic Republic 100% Natural Mascara](http://amzn.to/2tV8CuI) Price: $13.99 Vegan, Free, Gluten Free Get it on [Amazon here](http://amzn.to/2tV8CuI) Left is with no mascara - right is with two coats of Chic Republic 100% Natural Mascara PROS: It doesn't clump on the lashes! CONS: The formula is so so so clumpy and barely goes on! OVERALL THOUGHTS: This is my least favorite of them all +++ [jane iredale thickening mascara](http://amzn.to/2eJH9u4) Price: $33 Think Dirty Rating: 3 Get it on [Amazon here](http://amzn.to/2eJH9u4) Left is with no mascara - right is with two coats of jane iredale Mascara PROS: This mascara has my favorite brush, by far!!! The brush is sooooooooo thick and I love it. CONS: This takes more work to apply. The formula is good, but you really have to work it to get it on smooth and get a good covering. OVERALL THOUGHTS: This is the most expensive and I think there are better options for less... but I do love the jane iredale brand! +++ Honestly, because when it comes to lashes, the bigger, the better for me. I looooooooove big and thick lashes. So I typically layer my mascaras. I use the 100% Pure Maracuja Oil mascara first, then usually top it with the Pacifica or the Physician's formula. I always do a few coats... I want big, bold lashes! I will continue to try any natural or organic mascara that comes out! Also, don't forget, I [make my own Lash Boost serum that you can see the recipe for here](http://www.stillbeingmolly.com/2017/05/16/natural-lash-boosting-serum-essential-oils/)! +++ So there you have it!
