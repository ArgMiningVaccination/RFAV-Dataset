That is my story and to overcome it I went out and become certified instructor, athlete, certified clinical therapist, teacher, and I founded National Integrative Wellness and Resource Center ( [www.niwcr.org](http://www.niwcr.org/)) that is an inclusive, judgment-free environment where your goals are heard and supported. As a living proof that nothing should stop someone from reaching their goals in life, I developed a motivation to look beyond limitations. I spent 10 years just like that to show people that they can with mind-body practices to improve their well-being. Our classes and therapies are helping people to overcome those obstacles that they face in their lives by giving them tools, motivation to show that they can be successful and live the life at the fullest.
