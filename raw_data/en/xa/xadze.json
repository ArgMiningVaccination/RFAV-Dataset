Our new curriculum, now entering its sixth year, is similarly rooted in research and iteration. We set ourselves apart from many medical schools by employing simulation- based Mastery Learning because our research shows that this approach improves providers' skills and patient care, while reducing patient complications and health- care costs. In fact, simulation-based curricula developed at Northwestern Simulation for both adult and pediatric surgery have been disseminated throughout Chicago and the United States. Additionally, we offer students hands-on programs such as the Area of Scholarly Concentration (introducing students to scholarly research) and Education-Centered Medical Home (a unique longitudinal clinical experience). What's most noticeable, however, is that no one at Northwestern Medicine seems to be standing still. Our faculty, trainees and medical Becoming a Learning Organization N HIS 1990 BOOK \"THE FIFTH DISCIPLINE: THE ART AND PRACTICE of the Learning Organization,\" Peter Senge, PhD, a systems scientist and lecturer at MIT Sloan School of Management, describes a \"learning organization\" as a place \"where people continually expand their capacity to create the results they truly desire, where new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, where collective aspiration is set free, and where people are continually learning how to learn together.\" I was recently reminded of this notion during one of the most thought-provoking days of the year here on campus: our annual Lewis Landsberg Research Day, during which students, staff, faculty and trainees share the fruits of their labor throughout our research enterprise. Implicit in every poster on display is the goal of creating new knowledge, and using that knowledge to grow and develop \u2014 not just in individual careers, but within departments and centers, the institution overall, and across a variety of investigative interests. Aptly, one of the recent additions to Research Day is a special category and award for medical edu- cation research, which highlights evaluations of Istudents are all about creating new ideas. The lessons learned from these projects eventually feed back into our curriculum and the delivery of patient care, and help us engage in a process of continuous improvement and transformation \u2014 a mindset we believe will ultimately lead to improved health outcomes. In this issue of Northwestern Medicine, one story in particular speaks directly to the importance of building upon earlier research. In the late 1990s, Jaime Garc\u00eda-A\u00f1overos, PhD, professor of Anesthesiology, Neurology and Physiology, and Anne Duggan, PhD, were doctoral candidates studying nerve cells in worms. Some 20 years later, the ndings from that research led to new discoveries regarding the role of INSM1 in outer hair cell development in the ear, published in Nature in late 2018, pro- viding new hope for the elusive goal of restoring hearing for the more than 36 million Americans suffering from varying degrees of deafness. This fascinating journey is explained in detail, starting on page 22. It reminds me of something that's at the heart of what we believe at Feinberg: What you discover today \u2014 even if you set it aside to address other pursuits for a while \u2014 may fuel future understanding and accomplishment. As Peter Senge writes in his book, a true learning organization continually searches for a better way. This shared spirit is on display every year at Research Day \u2014 and every day across our institution. With warm regards, Eric G. Neilson, MD Vice President for Medical Affairs Lewis Landsberg Dean We engage in a process of continuous improvement and transformation \u2014 a mindset we believe will ultimately lead to improved health outcomes.3 MAGAZINE.NM.ORGPULSE Scientists predominantly use male cells and animals when investigating diseases (even those prevalent in women), sometimes resulting in the development of drugs with serious side effects in women. To change this, and help investigators uncover why diseases affect women differ - ently than men, in 2009, the Women's Health Research Institute at Northwestern University developed the Illinois Women's Health Registry (WHRI), linking women to studies throughout the state. A recent upgrade makes the registry mobile- and tablet-friendly, allowing users to easily ll out an annual survey about their health in about 30 minutes. \"Information will now be available to investigators at no cost so they can do major epidemiological and demo-graphic studies of women,\" said Marla Mendelson, MD, '87 GME, co-director of the WHRI and associate professor of Medicine in the Division of Cardiology and of Pediatrics. ON CAMPUS Earlier this year, about 65 high school students \u2014 participants in the Northwestern Medicine Discovery program \u2014 watched Feinberg medical students dissect human cadavers and then asked questions about what it's like to study medicine. \"I enjoyed how the medical students were blunt, yet nice, when talking to us,\" said Melissa Bueno, a student at Waukegan High School. During future weekend visits to Chicagoland hospitals, she and other teens will explore such specialties as pediatrics, emergency medicine and neurology. The two-year program was designed to encourage students' interest in the medical /f_ield. Relying on physicians, residents and medical students to volun- teer their time, it began at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and is now growing steadily, expanding across Northwestern Medicine's extensive network of hospitals in the Chicagoland area. orthwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine was recognized as one of the best research-oriented medical schools in the nation, rising one spot to rank 19th, accord- ing to the latest U.S. News & World Report rankings. This is the 12th year in a row Feinberg has placed in the top 20 of research-oriented medical schools, and this year, six of Feinberg's specialty programs were recognized among the best in the nation \u2014 an all-time high for nationally ranked specialties.

She is now headed to Brown University for a triple board program in pediatrics, psychiatry, and child and adoles- cent psychiatry. Liz Nguyen and Alex Rodriguez entered the match as a couple. The two students, who met during their /f_irst year of medical school, are now headed to Stanford University Medical Center together. The NRMP allows students who choose to match as a couple to link their rank lists together, in order for the two to obtain residen- cies in the same geographic location. \"We both ended up matching at our number one choice, so we're very excited,\" said Rodriguez, who is entering a combined program in internal medicine and anesthesiol- ogy. \"We've worked for this moment for most of our lives and now all the hard work is paying o.

The room /f_illed with cheers as the Class of 2019 learned where they will spend the next phase of their medical careers. \"I've never experienced anything like this. The energy is indescribable,\" said Fahey, who matched at Stanford University Medical Center in internal medicine. \"This day is a culmination of four years of hard work, and everyone I've talked to is just so thrilled and happy.\" On Match Day, the third Friday of March, all fourth-year students across the country learn \u2014 at exactly the same time \u2014 where they will train as residents for the next three to seven years. At Northwestern's Match Day, the class of 2019 high-/f_ived and hugged each other, posed for pictures with their match letters, and raced to call family members and friends with the good news. \"I truly couldn't have ever expected to be this happy,\" said Roshni Bhatnagar, who learned she matched at UCLA Medical Center in internal medicine. \"I couldn't imagine receiving this incredible news with anyone besides the people who got me here \u2014 my classmates, best friends and all the deans who have supported us.\" Residency matches are made by the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP), which uses a computerized algorithm to pair graduating medical students with available training positions at U.S. teaching hospitals.

Using a prospective cohort of more than 3,000 participants, Pierce found that people exposed to the highest levels of childhood family environment adversity were more than 50 percent more likely to have a cardiovascu- lar disease event over a 30-year follow-up, even a/f_ter controlling for other risk factors. Pierce, who conducted the research under mentor Joseph Feinglass, PhD, research professor of Medicine in the Division of General Internal Medicine and Geriatrics and of Preventive Medicine, recently presented his /f_indings at the annual American Heart Association Scienti/f_ic Sessions in Chicago. One of the big questions Pierce's research project has prompted is, \"Okay, so now what?\" he said. \"We know that childhood trauma is associated with increased risk for cardiovascu- lar disease \u2014 so now what can we do to prevent heart attacks and strokes from occurring? Childhood Trauma's Effect on Cardiovascular Risk Childhood Trauma's Effect on Cardiovascular Risk E ACardiovascular disease is still the number one cause of mortality in the United States.

She found that middle-aged people with a 10 percent increase in the number of convenience stores in their neighborhoods were more than 30 percent more likely to develop CAC over a 10-year follow-up \u2014 even a/f_ter controlling for a variety of health behaviors, including smoking, alcohol use and fast food consumption, as well as personal health characteristics such as blood pressure and diabetes. \"While a number of studies have linked neighborhood characteristics to the devel- opment of subclinical atherosclerosis, we are one of the /f_irst to investigate longitudinal associations of fast food chain restaurants and convenience stores with the development of CAC,\" said Kelman, adding, \"This research is s an under - graduate student at Northwestern, third- year medical student Julie Kelman spent time in France learn- ing about public health as part of her minor in global health.

Now, another of its roles has been uncovered by a team including Kelly Wun, a fourth-year medical student (who, at press time, found out he will complete his residency in orthopaedic surgery at Northwestern). He was the /f_irst author of a study (published in the journal PLOS ONE) demonstrating the role the microbiome plays in the development of restenosis, in which arteries re-close a/f_ter a previous intervention to clear blockage.

Fourth-year medical student Jourdan Rook, along with fellow medical students, Jacob Pierce and Antoinette Oot, and a team of students and faculty at six other medical schools, set out to get those voices heard, and the results of the study were published in Academic Medicine. According to Rook, the study shows that medical students want an active and vocal role in the formation of health policy. \"Nearly nine in 10 students indicated that addressing health policy is a professional responsibility,\" he said. \"This is a 30-percentage point increase from only three years prior.\" Conducted under the mentorship of Bruce Henschen, '12 MD, MPH, '15 GME, assistant professor of Medicine in the Division of General Internal Medicine and Geriatrics, this was the largest study of medical student opinions regard- ing the ACA since the 2016 election. In total, 1,660 medical students from seven medical schools across the country responded to the survey. Results indicated that nine in 10 support the ACA and eight in 10 support the individual mandate. \"While the goal of research is to improve the world in which we live, it is a pleasant side eect that it improves us as investigators and physicians,\" said Rook.Largest Study of Medical Students' Views on ACA Mmice with a group of conventional mice.

Scientists pro/f_iled 66 patients with glioblastoma, tracking their response to PD-/one.lf immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy over time. Genomic analysis revealed that many of the patients who did not respond to therapy had tumors with mutations in a gene called PTEN. These PTEN-rich tumors had gene expression that suggested a high number of regulatory T-cells. However, when the investi- gators examined the tumors, they didn't /f_ind a high concentration of immunosuppressive T-cells in non-responder \"We were scratching our heads,\" said Adam Sonabend Worthalter, MD, assistant professor of Neurological Surgery and co-senior author of the study. \"How could some tumors have higher levels of activation for the genes for the T-cells, but not have more of these cells?\" They used RNA sequencing to look at the gene expression of individual tumor cells, /f_inding that the tumor cells themselves were expressing the regula- tory T-cell genes, potentially mimicking their function \u2014 a possible reason why immunother - apy would be less eective. Patient tumors with mutations in the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway responded better to immunotherapy. \"Whereas careful validation of these /f_indings is necessary, we have little to oer glioblastoma patients. So for the time being, if a patient of mine had these mutations, I would oer immunotherapy,\" said Sonabend. TUMOR MUTATIONS PREDICT RESPONSE TO IMMUNOTHERAPYAdvances in the Study of Glioblastoma Scientists in the laboratory of Atique Ahmed, PhD, assistant professor of Neurological Surgery, investigated how activation of dopamine receptors plays a role in glioblastoma growth. The team demonstrated that dopamine signaling drives speci/f_ic changes in glioblas- toma cells, shi/f_ting them to become both more aggressive and resistant to therapy \u2014 even acquiring the ability to produce their own dopamine.

A drug that targets this gene could be a new therapy, said Alexander Stegh, PhD, associate professor in the Ken & Ruth Davee Department of Neurology in the Division of Neuro-oncology, and senior author of the study. Jasmine May, a seventh-year student in the Medical Scientist Training Program, was the /f_irst author. Stegh and his collaborators examined IDH3A levels in a large database of genetic data from glioblastoma tumors, and in tumors resected from Northwestern patients. The scientists found IDH3A was expressed at much higher levels in patient tumors than in normal brain tissue. They then tested its function in mice and found that elevated levels of IDH3A promoted tumor progression. A/f_ter further study, they found IDH3A allows rapidly dividing tumor cells to increase DNA synthesis, supporting cell division and unabated growth. A therapeutic approach targeting IDH3A could reduce the ability of tumor cells to synthesize DNA, according to Stegh. \"Inhibition of DNA synthesis in turn is expected to reduce the growth of highly proliferative cancer cells,\" he said.

NEW GENE ASSOCIATED WITH GLIOBLASTOMA DISCOVEREDThe mass of wires that surround new - borns in the NICU are often bigger than the babies themselves. Typically, ve or six wires connect electrodes on each baby to monitors for breathing, blood pres- sure, heartbeat and more. Although these wires are crucial to the baby's well-being, they constrain movement and pose a major barrier to physical bonding during a critical period of development. An interdisciplinary Northwestern team has found a way to replace that tangle of wires, developing a pair of soft, flexible wireless sensors that monitor babies without compromising parent- baby cuddling and physical bonding. \"We wanted to eliminate the rat's nest of wires and aggressive adhesives associ-ated with existing hardware systems and replace them with something safer, more patient-centric and more compatible with parent-child interaction,\" said John Rogers, PhD, a bio-electronics pioneer and a pro-fessor of Neurological Surgery. He co-led the study with Amy Paller, MD, chair and Walter J. Hamlin Professor of Dermatology and a professor of Pediatrics, and Shuai (Steve) Xu, MD, MSc, an instructor of Dermatology and a Northwestern Medicine dermatologist. The team completed a series of rst human studies on premature babies at Prentice Women's Hospital and Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. The study was published in the journal Science. Going Beyond Current Possibilities The benets of the new technology reach beyond its lack of wires. The dual wireless sensors monitor babies' vital signs from opposite ends of the body, allowing physicians to gather an infant's core temperature as well as body temperature from a peripheral region. The wireless patches are also gentler on a newborn's fragile skin. Existing sensors are attached with adhesives that can blister and scar.

With support from two major nonprot organizations, Rogers' team expects to send sensors to tens of thousands of families in developing countries over the next year as part of an international effort.Delivery Time10 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE /bullet.case SPRING 2019PULSE Research Briefs Subcutaneous fat tissue expanded while insulin sensitivity improved a/f_ter a gene transcription factor was deleted, according to a new study published in Cell Reports. This newfound function of the transcription factor, called BCL6, could have implications for obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus, according to Grant Barish, MD, assistant professor of Medicine in the Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Molecular Medicine and senior author of the study. Recent work by Barish's laboratory revealed that BCL6 is highly expressed in adipocytes, or fat cells. To investigate its function, the team deleted BCL6 from the fat cells of developing mice. These mice selectively developed expanded subcutane- ous fat tissue, but not intra-abdominal fat tissue \u2014 a rare example of a spontaneous phenotype impacting only certain body fat deposits. Later, genome-wide DNA binding and RNA analysis revealed that BCL6 works to repress genes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids and growth. Once BCL6 was deleted, the expression of those genes was increased, leading to the related changes of fat tissue expansion in mice. The same regulatory eects could be shared in humans, as well, according to the scientists. In addition, while BCL6 deletion pro- duced fatter mice, the animals developed improved insulin sensitivity \u2014 the opposite of what is typically observed with obesity. \"Normally, the more obese someone is, the more insulin resistant they become,\" Barish said. \"In contrast, mice lacking BCL6 in their fat are the opposite. They are more obese, yet less prone to diabetes.\" Understanding the basis by which obesity can be rendered more metabolically healthy could point to new strategies to treat diabetes as well as help scientists understand a curious sub-pop- ulation of patients who retain insulin sensitivity despite being obese.

GENE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR CONTROLS FAT TISSUE EXPANSIONSCIENTIFIC ADVANCES A large new study published in JAMA reports adults who ate more eggs and dietary cholesterol had a signicantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease and death from any cause. \"The take-home message is really about cholesterol, which happens to be high in eggs and specically yolks,\" said co-corresponding study author Norrina Allen, PhD, associate professor of Preventive Medicine in the Division of Epidemiology. Previous studies found eating eggs did not raise the risk of cardiovascular disease. But those studies generally had a less diverse sample, shorter follow-up time and limited ability to adjust for other parts of the diet, Allen said. \"Our study showed if two people had the exact same diet and the only differ - ence in diet was the eggs, then you could directly measure the effect of the egg consumption on heart disease,\" said Allen. \"We found cholesterol, regardless of the source, was associated with an increased risk of heart disease.\" Exercise, overall diet quality and the amount and type of fat in the diet didn't change the association between the dietary cholesterol and cardiovascular disease and death risk. The new study looked at pooled data on 29,615 U.S. racially and ethni- cally diverse adults from six prospective cohort studies for up to 31 years of follow- up and found eating 300 mg of dietary cholesterol per day was associated with 17 percent higher risk of incident cardio- vascular disease and 18 percent higher risk of all-cause deaths. The cholesterol was the driving factor independent of saturated fat consumption and other dietary fat. The study also found that eating three to four eggs per week was associated with 6 percent higher risk of cardiovascular disease and 8 percent higher risk of any cause of death.Eating Eggs and Cholesterol Linked to Heart Disease and Death RiskCLINICAL B/R.ss02EAKTH/R.ss02OUGHS \" THE TAKE/hyphen.caseHOME MESSAGE IS REALLY ABOUT CHOLESTEROL, WHICH HAPPENS TO BE HIGH IN EGGS AND SPECIFICALLY YOLKS.\" of Health grants DK057978, HL105278, R01DK108987, P30DK020595, and K08HL092298.

In North America, diabetic kidney disease is the most common cause of kidney failure, and rates of disease are expected to only continue to grow. Scientists have identied a new therapeutic target that may help protect kidney function in patients with diabetes. The study, published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, demon - strated in a preclinical model that inhibiting a protein called VE-PTP preserves microvas-cular and kidney function in diabetic mice. Susan Quaggin, MD, chief of Nephrology and Hypertension in the Department of Medicine and director of the Feinberg Cardiovascular and Renal Research Institute, was the principal investigator of the study. Previously, research in Quaggin's laboratory and others had suggested that the dysregulation of an important vascular signaling pathway called Angiopoietin-TIE2 (known as TEK in humans) plays a key role in the progression of diabetic kidney disease. In the current study, Quaggin and an international team of collaborators investi- gated approaches to restoring the pathway. \"We thought that activating TIE2 \u2014 flipping on that switch \u2014 would be good because in other organs and diseases, it appears to make blood vessels happier and healthier,\" explained Quaggin. In the study, the scientists discovered that a protein called VE-PTP is highly expressed in the kidney blood vessels of diabetic mice, and that the protein appears to be a marker of injured blood vessels. Inhibiting VE-PTP restored TIE2 activity in mice, and protected the kidneys from damage due to diabetes. Beyond furthering understanding of the fundamental biology underlying diabetic kidney disease, the ndings also have important thera- peutic implications. \"There are already preclinical molecules and drugs in the market that target VE-PTP and the TIE2/TEK pathway to treat eye disease. Our study suggests they might be valuable for kidney disease, too,\" Quaggin explained.In a new study published in Cell Metabolism, investigators discovered a method to modulate levels of a protein that drives in/f_lammation by manipulating levels of the amino acid serine. In/f_lammation has long been identi/f_ied as a possible driver of many diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's. One cause of in/f_lammation is the cytokine IL-1\u00df, a protein produced by macrophage cells. In a series of experiments, scientists deprived macrophage cells of serine and then activated them with lipopolysaccharide, a mole- cule that normally causes high in/f_lammation. Without serine, which controls the syn- thesis of glutathione (an antioxidant), the cell's glutathione levels decreased. Since glutathi- one is necessary to support IL-1\u00df production, the experiment also caused levels of IL-1\u00df to decrease, which meant the cell had less in/f_lammation. When the investigators then used a small molecule to inhibit that serine metabolism pathway in a mouse model, they found that it signi/f_icantly decreased in/f_lammation and improved survival in mice with sepsis. The next step is to examine whether other metabolic inputs can aect in/f_lammation. \"This is just the tip of the iceberg,\" said Navdeep Chandel, PhD, the David W . Cugell Professor of Medicine in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care and of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, who led the research. Chandel is also the leader of the Membranes, Organelles & Metabolism Research Program at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. \"We're interested in understanding these pathways and whether drugs that aect the serine metabolism pathway could someday have value in dampening diseases that cause high in/f_lammation.\"USING SERINE TO CONTROL INFLAMMATION SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES Scientists Identify Therapeutic Target in Diabetic Kidney DiseaseDISEASE DISCOVE/R.ss02IESThis work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants 5P01AG049665, 5P01HL071643, and 5T32HL076139-15, and 5DP1DK113643-03, with support from the Ford Foundation.

Some autoimmune diseases are life-threatening; most require a lifetime of treatment. Some, such as Type /one.lf dia- betes, multiple sclerosis, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, are well known; others are rare and dicult to diagnose. Understanding and treating these diseases requires new ways of thinking about the immune system, at the cellular, molecular and genetic levels, as well as at the organ and body-wide levels. Northwestern physicians and scientists are collaborating to examine just how this system functions \u2014 and how they can use that informa- tion to both /f_ind innovative therapies and stimulate it to work even better. Inner Workings of Cells While T-cells help provide immunity to the body, a subset of those cells, regulatory T-cells (Treg cells), modulate the immune system and suppress aberrant immune responses against self-antigens. They also maintain helpful bacteria in the gut (even in fetuses in utero), thus ensuring the body does not become inappropriately in/f_lamed. Now, Northwestern scientists have discovered that a speci/f_ic mitochondrial protein complex is essential to this immunosuppressive activity. The study was published in Nature. It started /f_ive years ago, with what seemed like a simple question, posed by Navdeep Chandel, PhD, the David W .

Understanding the cellular metabolic mechanisms that cause autoimmunity could also provide a new way for the body to harness autoimmunity in situations where it is preferable \u2014 in /f_ighting tumors, for example. \"The real dream would be to uncover a causal mechanism that leads to medication or cell-based therapies,\" Singer adds. From Laboratory Mistake to Discovery Sometimes, a new way of thinking about the immune system comes from an honest research mistake. That's what Melissa Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics: What do mitochondria do in a Treg cell? When investigators in Chandel's lab removed mitochondrial function from Treg cells in mice, the mice rapidly developed autoimmune diseases. The Treg cells were alive and functioning without mitochondria, but they weren't doing their job keeping in/f_lammation in check. Investigators found that by removing a speci/f_ic protein within mitochondrial complex III, the cell suered a buildup of the metabolite L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2HG) that diminished the function of DNA demethylases enzymes. This action, in turn, altered DNA methylation marks that suppressed the ability of Treg cells to function as an immune system referee.Brown, PhD, professor of Microbiology-Immunology, discovered several years ago. Brown studies how the immune system's lymphocyte cells are aected by the body's innate cells. Innate cells provide the body with general immunity by acting as barriers and recruiting immune cells to sites of infection. One type of these innate cells is mast cells, which are found in most tissues of the body, including the brain and spinal cord. They work as a /f_irst defense to protect the body against pathogens. They also play a role in allergic reactions. Because more than 75 percent of those diagnosed with an autoimmune disease are women, when immunologists like Brown study the diseases in mice they usually use only females. While studying female mice with multiple sclerosis (MS), Brown found that the disease was reduced signi/f_i- cantly in those mice that had been genetically engineered to lack mast cells. But the research was /f_lipped on its head when a new graduate student conducted the same study using male mice. The experiment was an accident \u2014 the student did not know the lab only used female mice in its experiments. The results were striking. \"We got the exact opposite response,\" Brown says. \"While females without mast cells had disease reduction, males without mast cells got very sick.\" That /f_inding led comple x L-2HG buildup17 MAGAZINE.NM.ORG Cells Found in Lungs of Critically Ill Patients with Pneumonia Immune cells FungiBacteria Viruses Where Immunity Goes Right \u2014 and Wrong Proteins offer clues to how our immune system responds: - In studying lupus, investigators found that the loss of a protein called Bim in immune cells called macrophages led to the development of a lupus-like disease in mice. The research, conducted by Harris Perlman, PhD, the Mabel Greene Myers Professor of Medicine and chief of Rheumatology in the Department of Medicine, shows that the protein may help control macrophage function and could be a target for lupus treatment. - When a patient has a heart attack, key heart cells called cardiomyocytes die and need to be cleared away for the heart to heal. Research led by Edward Thorp, PhD, associate professor of Pathology and Pediatrics, identied a protein called MerTK that enables macrophages to engulf the dying cells and promoted anti-inflammatory proteins that encourage healing. His team also found that a protein called CD47 prevented this clearing, and by blocking the protein, they could enhance healing. - Scientists have discovered that three proteins \u2014 POP1, POP2 and POP3 \u2014 play a role in controlling inflammatory processes and preventing systemic inflammation. Most recently, Christian Stehlik, PhD, adjunct professor of Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology, found that POP2 inhibited a key inflammatory pathway. \"We need to find a way to modulate that interaction between bacteria and the human immune system. We are trying to put the whole picture together.\" RICHARD WUNDERINK, MD Brown to ask a dierent question. Instead of focusing on what caused MS in female mice, she began to search for what conferred protection in male mice. It turned out that testosterone primes male mast cells to make a guardian molecule called IL-33, which protects against autoimmunity. When Brown gave female mice IL-33, she found that not only did it prevent MS from developing, but it also reversed established disease. The /f_indings were published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS). \"That's the holy grail in MS,\" she says. \"Not only do you want to stop pro- gression, but you also want to reverse the damage already done.\" Her lab is now studying whether IL-33 treatment in mice is safe and free from possible damaging side eects with hopes of ultimately using this mol- ecule to treat human patients. Though human trials are further down the road, Brown's research has been rejuvenated by the /f_inding. \"We really have in sight the possibility that there is a therapy that can reverse MS,\" she says. Whole System Approach Understanding what happens within a cell's mitochondria or how a disease reacts to a molecule is just one part of understanding how immunity and autoimmunity work throughout the body's complex network. That's why Singer and his colleague, Richard Wunderink, MD, professor of Medicine in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, are conducting a multi-year investigation that examines all the cells \u2014 bacteria and immune cells \u2014 within the lungs of patients with pneu- monia so severe that they are on ventila- tors in the ICU. Using bioinformatics, the investigators hope to put together all the pieces of the puzzle that determines why some patients with pneumonia respond to antibiotics, while others don't. \"To do that, we are taking a systems biology approach,\" Wunderink says. A routine clinical procedure called non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage allows access to these patients' lungs. It involves squirting saline solu- tion deep within the lungs and then sucking it back out to obtain a rich collection of cells, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and immune system cells. The investigators then separate out those cells, measure them and sequence them to get a systems-level understand- ing of the immune response. \"Our hypothesis is that an interac- tion among all these cells is allowing bacteria to survive, aecting immu- nity,\" Wunderink says. \"We don't just need to kill bacteria better. We need to /f_ind a way to modulate that interac-tion between bacteria and the human immune system. We are trying to put the whole picture together.\" NM18 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE /bullet.case SPRING 2019Two years ago, Cynthia Reid had just done a load of laundry in her Glen Ellyn, Illinois, home, when she walked into her kitchen and suddenly collapsed to the /f_loor. Her young stepson found her moments later and frantically went for help. \"My husband came into the room and said, 'Give me your hand,'\" she recalls. \"But I couldn't move my le/f_t side or hand.\" Reid had suered an acute ischemic stroke: A clot was blocking blood /f_low to her brain. It was 10:30 on a Saturday morning, and with each passing minute, 1.9 million of her neurons were dying from lack of oxygen. She faced the risk of lifelong disability or death. For many individuals experiencing stroke symptoms, a prompt 911 call and ambulance dispatched by local emergency medicine services (EMS) oers the best route to care at a hospital. For those in Chicago's western suburbs, though, Northwestern Medicine has gone one step further to reduce time to treatment by bringing a \"mini-ER\" to the patient's location. In January 2017, Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital (CDH) unveiled the /f_irst Mobile Stroke Unit in Illinois. In its /f_irst year of operation, the specially out/f_itted ambulance bested traditional transport and treatment in a stroke center by delivering lifesaving clot-busting medica- tion between 30 and 40 minutes faster. \"l am very happy with how far I have come since my stroke,\" says Reid, now 49, who today has regained most of the mobility on the le/f_t side of her body except for her hand. \"I am more than grateful for them saving my life.\" A state-of-the-art vehicle more than double the length and weight of an average ambulance, Northwestern Medicine's Mobile Stroke Unit features a 16-slice CT scanner that provides detailed brain imaging, telemedicine capa- bilities linked to stroke radiologists and neurologists at CDH and the clot-buster drug known as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).

If tPA is given within the /f_irst 60 minutes following the onset of symptoms, 50 percent of patients return to baseline within days. If given a/f_ter that critical time, only 25 percent may avoid permanent neurological disability. A powerful blood thinner, tPA can lead to deadly consequences if used on patients with hem- orrhagic stroke caused by a burst blood vessel or other head trauma involving potential bleeding in the brain. Diagnostic imaging via a brain CT scan is essential to correctly identifying the cause of a patient's stroke before the administration of the drug. While tPA has always been portable, large bulky CT scanners require sensitive calibration to produce accurate images. Only in the past decade have new advances allowed for mobile CT devices that can withstand bumpy roads and still function, with the /f_irst mobile stroke units appearing in Europe. Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital soon saw an opportunity to acquire a Mobile Stroke Unit \u2014 one of only a dozen or so in the nation \u2014 to positively in/f_luence stroke outcomes and ultimately reduce the need for further rehabilitative or nursing home care. >>20 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE /bullet.case SPRING 2019 PHOTOGRAPHY BY Teresa CrawfordMobile Stroke Unit Ambulance MSU 36 feetAverage Ambulance 22 feetLIFESAVING ON THE GO Critical Supplies The unit is outfitted with advanced airway management equipment and portable lab equipment that allows for immediate blood-sample analysis.Equipped with state-of-the-art technology, the mobile unit allows a specially trained crew to rapidly diagnose and treat stroke patients outside the hospital setting.

He serves as medical director of the mobile unit as well as the Stroke and Neurointerventional Surgery Programs at CDH. \"The greatest impact is when a 911 call comes, we can be dispatched to a patient's location and provide diagnosis and treatment within the critical 'golden hour.' No time is wasted picking up the patient and bringing them to the hospital before treatment can begin.\" In its /f_irst year, the Mobile Stroke Unit team treated 27 percent of eligible patients with tPA within one hour of the onset of symptoms. That percentage has now gone up to 34 percent. The ultimate goal is 50 percent, which Shownkeen acknowledges is in/f_luenced by factors beyond their control. \"Nothing happens until someone calls 911,\" he explains. \"The challenge is that less than 30 percent of people can name two signs of stroke. Only some 45 percent of patients call 911. Others don't call at all and drive themselves to the hospital.\" Promoting stroke public awareness oers an avenue for speeding up diagnosis and treatment. To that end, Shownkeen recently secured a $300,000 grant to launch a community education program in the CDH service area. FULLY EQUIPPED Compared to the average 22-foot-long ambulance, the 36-foot Mobile Stroke Unit occupies the largest ambulance bay at Central DuPage Hospital. Its hours of operation run from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., seven days a week. \"We developed the schedule to correlate with the peak times when stroke patients come into the hospital,\" says Mehr Mohajer-Esfahani, MSN, RN, program manager of the Mobile Stroke Unit. \"People o/f_ten don't wake up in the middle of the night because of a stroke.\" The Mobile Stroke Unit provides coverage to the hospital's Emergency Medical Services area, which includes Carol Stream, Glen Ellyn, Roselle, West Chicago, Wheaton and Win/f_ield, and is dis- patched by 911 at the same time as local EMS. Expanding its reach even further, a secondary part- nership allows /f_ire department and other ambulance services outside the service area to request the Mobile Stroke Unit. The location of the patient will dictate where the unit goes \u2014 directly to the individual or somewhere along the local EMS' route to a stroke center. Despite its mobility, the vehicle's CT scanner can only be operated while the vehicle is motionless and on level ground. \"While we are on our way, local paramedics scan the scene and look for a place where we can park, which could be on the street in front of a patient's house or a couple of blocks away,\" Mohajer- Esfahani says. \"The ambulance has hydraulic jacks that help level it out on uneven surfaces.\" During a typical 12-hour shi/f_t, the Mobile Stroke Unit team includes a driver who can safely navigate the 33,000-pound vehicle with sirens and lights blaring; a critical care paramedic; a critical care nurse and a CT scanner technologist. The team then uses a direct telemedicine connection to consult with a radiologist and a stroke neurologist at the hospital, who can \"set eyes\" on and assess the patient in the ambulance. Once it is determined that tPA treatment is needed, the team starts both the infusion process and the ambulance, which will then begin transporting the patient to the hospital. At CDH, the team hands o the patient for additional care and evaluation.

Named for the hair-like tu/f_ts that protrude o their tops, these cells are critical to converting sound waves into neural messages. But unlike skin or other cell types, human hair cells do not regenerate on their own. And once the cells are injured \u2014 whether due to loud noises, toxins or normal aging \u2014 the damage can lead to lasting hearing loss. Today more than 36 million Americans suer from hearing loss to some degree. There has been signi/f_icant interest in arti/f_icially regenerating new hair cells as a treatment for hearing loss. However, the research has long been thwarted by a funda-mental roadblock: There are two types of hair cells, inner and outer hair cells, which play complementary roles in hearing and are both essential. Yet the genetic factors required to make one cell type versus the other were completely unknown. Now, a landmark genetic discovery in the laboratory of Jaime Garc\u00eda-A\u00f1overos, PhD, professor of Anesthesiology, Neurology and Physiology, may have /f_inally cleared a path toward novel regenerative treatments. The /f_indings, published in Nature in late 2018, demonstrated that a gene called INSM/one.lf is essential for the development of outer hair cells. The death of these cells is the most common cause of deafness. \"This discovery is a milestone toward hearing restoration,\" says Teerawat Wiwatpanit, '18 PhD, /f_irst author of the paper and a recent alumnus of Feinberg's Driskill Graduate Program in Life Sciences (DGP). \"With the mechanisms we identi/f_ied, we've advanced the knowledge for the develop- ment of regenerative approaches to reverse hearing loss.\" The discovery is the result of years of dedicated investigation in the Garc\u00eda- A\u00f1overos laboratory and strong collaborations in auditory research across Northwestern. It's also one with deep scienti/f_ic roots that stem back to an obscure discovery made in worms more than two decades ago. Model Science In the late 1990s, Garc\u00eda-A\u00f1overos and Anne Duggan, PhD, were doctoral candidates study - ing nerve cells in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans. While working in the laboratory of Nobel Laureate Martin Chal/f_ie, Duggan molecularly identi/f_ied for the /f_irst time a tran- scription factor in the worm that is required to make two types of mechanosensory cells (cells that respond to mechanical stimuli, such as touch or vibration) dierent from each other. Curiously, when the gene was removed, cells of the /f_irst type appeared to be trans- formed into cells of the second type. While the /f_indings, published in Genes & Development, were intriguing, Garc\u00eda- A\u00f1overos and Duggan put the project aside as they went on to complete postdoctoral fellowships at Harvard Medical School and later establish a lab at Northwestern in 2002. Initially, Garc\u00eda-A\u00f1overos and Duggan, now a research assistant professor of Anesthesiology, focused their research on pain neurons.

The scientists had pinpointed a novel mechanism for how two cells born seemingly identical become two very dierent cell types. \"This has opened up an entirely new area of research. Until now, no one had a clue of how to make an outer hair cell as opposed to an inner hair cell,\" says Garc\u00eda- A\u00f1overos, also a member of Northwestern's Knowles Hearing Center and of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. \"This opens the way to try generating outer hair cells in adults and to developing treatments for most cases of deafness.\" Moving Forward Garc\u00eda-A\u00f1overos notes that it was the scien- ti/f_ic environment at Northwestern that helped make the discovery possible. \"Collaboration removed the INSM/one.lf gene from the mice, they had a form of hearing loss characteristic of outer hair cell impairment. And then when we looked into the morphology of the ear, it was absolutely gorgeous. You see a complete transformation of many outer hair cells into inner hair cells.\"When the scientists mutated INSM/one.lf in the mouse cochlea, they discovered that cells born embryonically as outer hair cells trans- formed into mature inner hair cells, according to Garc\u00eda-A\u00f1overos. \"This is remarkable because nematodes [roundworms] have mechanosensory cells but nothing like outer hair cells, which are unique to mammals.\" The team demonstrated that in outer hair cells, INSM/one.lf blocks the expression of a key set of genes speci/f_ic to inner hair cells. In other words: in order to make an outer hair cell and prevent conversion to an inner hair cell, the INSM /one.lf gene is critical. \"The data was very clear. There was little ambiguity, which rarely happens in science,\" explains Wiwatpanit, who recently accepted a faculty position at Thailand's equivalent of the National Institutes of Health. \"When we \"THERE WAS LITTLE AMBIGUITY, WHICH RARELY HAPPENS IN SCIENCE.

For example, in a recent international collaboration co-led by Nancy Young, MD, '87 GME, professor of Otolaryngology \u2014 Head and Neck Surgery and medical director of Audiology and Cochlear Implant Programs at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, scientists developed a machine learning algorithm that uses brain scans to predict language ability in deaf children after they receive a cochlear implant. The ndings were published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in early 2018. \"Our study is the rst to provide clinicians and caregivers with concrete information about how much language improvement can be expected given the child's brain development immediately before surgery,\" Young says. \"The ability to forecast children at risk is the critical rst step to improving their outcomes.\" A child can actively participate in sports with a cochlear implant.is critical,\" he says. \"When we /f_irst moved here, we had very little work on hearing. What allowed us to excel was the ability to team up and learn from investigators here. Northwestern has been a powerhouse in hearing for decades.\" For example, the team has worked closely with collaborator Mary Ann Cheatham, PhD, research professor in the Auditory Physiology Laboratory at Northwestern's School of Communication, who led the testing of mouse hearing. Throughout the years, the investigators have also provided important insights in other aspects of hearing. In 2008, Garc\u00eda- A\u00f1overos, in collaboration with James Bartles, PhD, professor of Cell and Molecular Biology, published a study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences identifying a novel mechanism of hearing loss. In 2015, the research team discovered a pain pathway in the inner ear that warns of dangerously loud noise, /f_indings spotlighted in Nature Reviews Neuroscience and published in Current Biology . Additionally, in early 2018, Wiwatpanit was the /f_irst author of a paper published in The Journal of Neuroscience that found the loss of two lysosomal calcium chan- nels leads to early-onset hearing loss. This discovery suggested the importance of lysosomes in the survival of hair cells. Now, on the heels of the Nature paper, the scientists are forging ahead to deepen understanding of INSM/one.lf to strengthen the potential for translation to treatment. \"A lot more basic research will have to be done, but we're already providing tools for people who are trying to develop these \"WHEN WE FIRST MOVED HERE, WE HAD VERY LITTLE WORK ON HEARING.

My goal is to, in the next decade, crack in detail how the two cells become dierent because that will be an essential tool for regeneration attempts.\" For Garc\u00eda-A\u00f1overos and Duggan, the Nature study also underscores an important tenet of biomedical research: Basic science will build the path toward discoveries that eventually improve human health. \"If you focus on some- thing that is a fundamental problem, it's likely to have repercussions.

Like Father , Like Son Throughout their four-year education, medical students ponder their future sub-specialty. Their top choice may change once, twice or a dozen times, re/f_lect- ing experiences in the classroom and on clin- ical rotations. However, for one student at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin, Ireland, there was a single thought on his mind. \"Because my father was a radiologist, I thought I was going to stay well clear of radiology,\" says James Carr, MD, '00 '01 GME, chair and the Drs. Frederick John Bradd and William Kennedy Memorial Professor of Radiology. The young physician very nearly chose cardiology, but in the end, he followed in his father's footsteps. Carr completed a radiology residency program at Saint Vincent's Hospital, also in Dublin. He never le/f_t his interest in the heart behind, though, focusing on the bur - geoning /f_ield of cardiac imaging. This decision would lead him to Chicago for a fellowship in radiology, to a professorship at Northwestern and as of November 2018, to the chairmanship of the department. Radiology holds a unique position within medicine. Radiologists primarily serve other physicians in the care of patients. This indi- rect clinical care approach puts a particular onus on collaboration, a philosophy that was instilled in Carr both through his training and through his father's advice. \"One of the things I've learned is that we must work together, across specialties, to provide information that will help other physicians manage their patients better,\" says Carr, who is also a professor of Medicine in the Division of General Internal Medicine and Geriatrics, and a professor of Biomedical Engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering. Spending much of his career improving cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to inform patient manage-ment, Carr knows that collaboration is essen- tial in the areas of research and education as well clinical care. \"If you don't have the interdisciplinary framework, the enterprise falls apart pretty quickly,\" Carr says. FRUITS OF LABOR In 2003, then-assistant professor Carr became director of Cardiovascular Imaging at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Carr was tasked with building a clinical cardiac MRI program, which, up until this point, existed mostly within the realm of research. Cardiac MRI, which has its experimental roots at Northwestern, could detect scarring on the heart. This sophisticated imaging technology allowed clinicians to predict how patients might respond to bypass surgery without resorting to invasive tests. There was just one problem\u2014nobody knew about it. \"We didn't have a lot of patients, as not many referring physicians knew about this new modality,\" Carr says. To get the word out, he helped build a program to instruct residents and physi- cians in this unfamiliar procedure. Training physicians in cardiac MRI both created and met demand, as did a symbiotic expansion of Northwestern's cardiac surgery program. The largest bene/f_it, though, came from the proliferation of Feinberg-trained cardiac radiologists and cardiologists. \"We sent these ambassadors out into the community, and they became sources of knowledge,\" Carr explains. \"It was an unin- tended objective, initially, but my cardiology colleagues and I realized we could actually set the standard for how you use cardiac MRI.\" The modality is no longer used only for projecting recovery from bypass surgery. Today clinicians also employ it for evalu- ating heart failure and helping determine the eectiveness of drug therapies in other cardiac diseases. The majority of referrals at Northwestern still come from Feinberg- trained physicians \u2014 a testament to the reciprocal relationship between education and clinical care.

In 2014, Carr, along with co-primary investigator Michael Markl, PhD, the Lester B. and Frances T. Knight Professor of Cardiac Imaging in the Department of Radiology, received a $3 million National Institutes of Health grant to develop an MRI test to detect complications in patients a/f_ter heart transplant. The current method to diagnose transplant complications is with a biopsy. This new MRI protocol measures in/f_lammation of the heart, providing a quanti/f_iable metric that can inform clinicians if the patient is rejecting their new heart. The investigators recruited patients who underwent heart transplants at Northwestern Memorial. While early work in the project focused on developing new MRI techniques, more recent publications have demonstrated its clinical eectiveness to the extent that it has already become standard practice at Northwestern Medicine. \"For example, just the other day I evaluated two heart transplant patients using MRI,\" Carr says. \"It's becoming quite integrated into the clinical algorithm here.\" This discipline-spanning project includes Feinberg radiologists and cardiologists, McCormick medical physicists and engineers, and even industry partners at Siemens. It aptly re/f_lects how the research enterprise operates in the department, according to Carr. \"One of the reason Northwestern attracts world-class investigators is its collaborative spirit,\" he says. \"That's how we've structured our research program.\" LOOKING FORWARD These experiences feed into Carr's governing philosophy as chair. Above all, he knows radiol- ogy can't go it alone. Dimly-lit reading rooms can sometimes isolate radiologists from their clinical colleagues. They also tend to experi-ence fewer face-to-face interactions with other physicians. However, Carr believes that tight- knit relationships between radiology and other Feinberg departments, Northwestern schools and among the entire Northwestern Medicine hospital system, are the key to breakthroughs in the laboratory and in the clinic. Since his appointment as chair late last year, he's initiated a new focus on informatics and data sharing. Carr has been working closely with Senta Berggruen, MD, '04 GME, associate professor of Radiology and residency program director, to begin overhauling trainee education to get students out of the back rooms and onto the clinic /f_loor. Establishing this foundation is important, as radiology, still reeling from the shi/f_t from /f_ilm to digital images, has more major changes on the horizon. As a primarily physician-service subspe- cialty, radiology depends on sharing images and patient data from physician to physician and from hospital to hospital. There is a dizzying array of moving parts: picture archiving and communications systems (PACS), electronic medical records and dictation so/f_tware used by radiologists to record diagnoses. All of these pieces must be compliant with patient privacy laws. A robust information technology infra- structure is required to quickly share these images and clinical information. \"We need to develop processes so the services we provide can occur in a seamless manner,\" says Carr, who plans to establish a dedicated informatics program within radiology. Medical education is rapidly transforming, moving away from didactic lectures and toward interactive learning. In this area, Carr is helping tweak the Diagnostic Radiology Residency Program to follow that trend. For example, putting radiology trainees on clinical rotations makes them immediately available to read images on the hospital /f_loor where they can be in direct contact with physicians and patients. \"This is just one of the ways that we're trying to pull radiolo- gists out of those back rooms,\" Carr says. Additionally, the radiology residency pro- grams now feature a wide variety of educational tracks, including courses in business, research or global health. Trainees, for example, have traveled to South America as part of an inter - national aid organization to perform diagnostic ultrasounds in underprivileged communities. These foundations put the department on strong footing for the future, which promises even more technological change and subse-quent adaption. Much has been made about the possibility of arti/f_icial intelligence (AI) replacing or crowding out the radiologist. In the near term, though, Carr sees AI as a way of augmenting physicians \u2014 rather than an existential threat \u2014 to handle the massive amounts of information that newer modalities can generate. For example, a cardiac MRI study can easily produce 4,000 images in a single patient's study. \"It's just not possible for a single human being to comprehend and understand all of that,\" Carr says. \"We need AI to help the radiologists do their job.\" Launching new AI research initiatives will pull from every discipline and challenge scientists, but Feinberg is uniquely positioned to be a leader in the budding science. \"Developing algorithms and partnering with our colleagues in Evanston and the larger industry will allow us to build a robust research program,\" Carr says. \"Because of our clinical volume and our digital infrastructure, we are poised to drive this whole area forward from a research perspective.\" NMAdvanced MRI techniques at Northwestern Radiology allow for detailed insights into cardiovas-cular diseases.

Kuehn ILLUSTRATION BY Jacqui Oakley disease-related deaths, a public health aim that Stamler championed. \"Cardiology oers much to patients, but almost no heart disease is curable,\" explains Gillum, who earned a master's degree in epide- miology at Harvard University a/f_ter completing his cardiology training at Brigham. \"Prevention based on evidence from epidemiology oered me an opportunity for greater impact than clinical medicine.\" SOCIAL DETERMINANTS Researching cardiovascular epidemiology, /f_irst at the National Institutes of Health, then at the University of Minnesota, and later the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Health Statistics, put Gillum at the forefront of discoveries about disparities in heart health. He has authored more than 300 publica- tions on how factors such as socioeconomic status, racial and ethnic disparities, and leisure time activity modulate heart risks. \"The research process has been a gratifying endeavor as each discovery led to new questions and opportunities to /f_ind answers,\" he says. Gillum served as a consultant on the ground-breaking Meharry Cohort Study launched in the early 1980s at Meharry Medical College, a historically black university in Nashville. The study followed more than 300 black physicians and some 600 white physi- cians for decades and yielded insights on the incidence and risk factors for cardiovascular disease in black individuals of higher socio- economic status. Many other longitudinal studies at the time enrolled only white patients or only black patients who were of lower socio- economic status. \"Dr. Gillum in/f_luenced [research on disparities in health] way before it was popular,\" notes John Fontaine, MD, MBA, president of the Association of Black Cardiologists (ABC). Gillum and Fontaine serve together on the editorial board of the Journal of the National Medical Association, a peer-reviewed publication dedicated to reducing health inequity especially among African Americans and other minority groups. \"Dr. Gillum has covered the spectrum of educational activities and services that really goes well beyond what most physicians have done in their careers,\" Fontaine says. TACKLING DISPARITIES In addition to a proli/f_ic research career, Gillum, who studied writing during his medical training, has been an outspoken advocate against discrimination in medicine. He believes that \"physicians and poets have a social responsibility to comment on their times.\" In 1974, Gillum joined 16 other likeminded physicians to found the Association of Black Cardiologists (ABC). They launched the organi- zation \u2014 now with 1,800 members \u2014 to tackle cardiovascular disease in minority patients and boost diversity in the /f_ield of cardiology with mentoring and support for subspecialty training. \"Even with the civil rights movement well under way at that time, it was clear that remov - ing legal barriers to advancement of minorities was insucient to eliminate racial inequity in health and access to care,\" Gillum says. \"Those of us who were privileged to obtain training in cardiology needed to assertively seek to expose to full view disparities that were not widely acknowledged and to open doors to training closed by custom, if not law.\" Gillum has been grati/f_ied to see growing numbers of black cardiologists. He acknowl- edges, though, there remains much more to do to eliminate disparities in healthcare. Political and global economic trends along with a history of discrimination in the United States continue to stymie progress in his opinion. \"Without continued advocacy, farsighted leadership and political will another 40 years will pass without meaningful change toward equalizing educa- tional and economic opportunities and access to care,\" Gillum says. In the meantime, there is much individual physicians can do to help their patients be as healthy as possible. \"I urge physicians to resist being so enthralled by technology that they devote insuf - /f_icient priority to prevention,\" he says. Active in his Methodist church, Gillum also encourages health providers to \"not ignore the spiritual aspects of health and well-being important to many, if not most, patients.\" Those of us who were privileged to obtain train- ing in cardiology needed to assertively seek to expose to full view disparities that were not widely acknowledged and to open doors to training closed by custom, if not law.\"\"32 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE /bullet.case SPRING 2019ALUMNI 1950s Jerrold J.

The school's longest-serving faculty member, with a tenure of 58 years, Cugell was founding chair of the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Feinberg. During their lifetimes, the Cugells included the university in their estate plans, designating commitments to multiple areas. Upon their passing in 2016, Northwestern received planned gi/f_ts from the Cugells totaling $9.39 million. More than $4.39 million will support candidates and fellows at Feinberg studying lung disease. \"Dave Cugell was strongly committed to the training of young physicians and scien-tists in the area of lung disease,\" says Scott Budinger, MD, chief of Pulmonary and Critical Care in the Department of Medicine and the Ernest S. Bazley Professor of Airway Diseases at Feinberg, who worked closely with Cugell on several projects toward the end of his career. \"He would be pleased to know that the fellowships he has provided will help to bring a new generation to this area and will further knowledge to improve the lives of patients with lung disease.\" Serving on the faculty for 31 years, Enroth- Cugell was one of the /f_irst female professors to teach at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering and chaired the Department of Neurobiology within the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.

The event raised $617,000 to support the Foundation's mission to provide the best quality of care, local community support and hope through scientic research to everyone affected by this disease. \"We are all here because we are part of the Les Turner ALS family: those of us with ALS, those of us who love or care for someone with ALS, those of us who advocate for people with ALS, those of us who provide clinical care and those of us who search for a cure for ALS,\" said Andrea Pauls Backman, chief executive ofcer of the Les Turner ALS Foundation. This year, the Foundation honored Mindy Evans-Williams, a patient and donor diagnosed with ALS in 1992, with its Hope Through Caring Award, and Robert L. Sut, MD, professor of Neurology and Surgery at Feinberg, with the inaugural Harvey and Bonny Gaffen Advancements in ALS Award. A neurologist at the Les Turner ALS Center at Northwestern Medicine, Sut has helped thousands of families affected by ALS through his clinical care and research since joining Northwestern in 1992. In fact, he designed and participated in some of the earliest and ongoing clinical drug trials in ALS and has published numerous papers on the natural history of ALS, end of life care for ALS patients, as well as the speech, swallowing and electrophysiology of the disease. \"The real heroes are the people with ALS and their families, who live with ALS and volunteer in our clinical trials. All of our work depends upon them,\" he said, to cheers from the audience \u2014 including whistles from one of his patients. In 2014, the Les Turner ALS Foundation made a leadership commitment of $10 million to help establish the Les Turner ALS Center at Northwestern Medicine.

Nupur was raised as a faculty brat in an enriched academic environment where her parents were supportive of her development as an academic neurologist. Even so, she rapidly encountered challenges and hurdles as a woman in her ascent within academic medicine. Though Kavitha was raised by a physician father and NCI scientist mother, who were supportive of her career as a clinical dermatologist, she, like many women physicians, has sought support from close friends and colleagues when navigating implicit bias as a female physician over the years. The two, both members of Northwestern's Medical Alumni Association National Board, have partnered to advance the Board's Women in Medicine (WIM) strategic initiative and join other eorts at Northwestern to provide a larger support system for future alumni. They have been busy spreading the word. Here, Ghoshal and Gandhi talk to Northwestern Medicine magazine about their nascent eorts to promote the WIM initiative.WHY TALK ABOUT WOMEN IN MEDICINE NOW? Although women made up about half of each of our medical school classes, the time is ripe, espe-cially in the #MeToo era, to provide forums for discussion about how to help /f_ill the gender gap in leadership. One forum we turn to o/f_ten is social media (for us, the Women Neurologists Group and Physician Moms Group on Facebook have been great resources). But nothing beats real-life connections. We want to promote and connect alumni to conferences, symposia, and informal networking events, which allow women to gain skills for career and personal development in all stages of their careers, whatever (or however untraditional) those paths may be. WHAT ROLE DOES NETWORKING PLAY IN A FEMALE PHYSICIAN'S CAREER? Networking with other female physicians and learning how to cultivate mentoring relation- ships with allies of WIM is a powerful tool women need to succeed. We want to help bridge opportunities for alumni to engage in this important discussion locally and nationally, with thought leaders in the /f_ield who are doing valuable research and changing the landscape at institutions across the country. HOW HAS NORTHWESTERN PROMOTED THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION? We believe that Northwestern has welcomed ini- tiatives to promote a platform for discussion. In October of last year, the Departments of Medicine and Surgery hosted the inaugu- ral WIM Symposium, which was attended by my more than 200, including Dean Eric G. Neilson. Nationally recognized speakers and Feinberg faculty delivered evidence-based presentations on topics including the current barriers for women physicians, physician wellness, negotiation skills, mentoring and coaching. The event was very well-received. We have rallied the Board to support the second (and hopefully annual) WIM Symposium, which will be held this October. HOW ELSE CAN ALUMNI ENGAGE IN THIS EFFORT? One way to participate is by attending the annual WIM tea at The Drake during alumni weekend. This past April, we had our third, which we organized and Nupur moderated \u2014 if you weren't able to make it, we hope to see you next year. In June, the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) Chicago will host the second Women Physicians Networking Event. And soon, we will be launching a closed Facebook page for female alumni \u2014 called Women in Medicine: Northwestern University Medical Alumni Association Group \u2014 providing a digital platform for exchanging ideas year-round. We invite you to join us in this conversation!LET'S TALK ABOUT WOMEN IN MEDICINE The American College of Physicians (ACP) has published a position paper on women in medicine, covering equity in physician compensation, career advancement, and bias.

Case, MD, was appointed the medical school's rst professor and chair of the department, serving for more than 35 years (today, it is led by James Carr, MD, featured on page 26). Widely recognized as one of the leading radiologists of the early 20th century, Case published more than 100 papers in medical journals and made signicant contributions to the eld, particularly in diagnostic radiology of the gastrointestinal tract. Many noted that Case's insistence that radiology departments be a separate and distinct entity set a precedent, with many medical schools nationwide later following suit.N NONPROFIT ORG.
