The safety of the Australian population has always been the Australian Government's highest priority and we strongly support immunisation as a safe and effective public-health measure. The COVID-19 vaccine program's primary goal is to minimise the risk of severe disease, including hospitalisation and death. For this reason, decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccines are based on the expert medical advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) and from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), the national medicines regulator. I can assure you that the COVID-19 vaccines available in Australia have received the same high level of scrutiny as other prescription medicines and vaccines. The TGA, part of the Department of Health and Aged Care, has comprehensively evaluated each of the COVID-19 vaccines to ensure that they meet Australia's high standards of safety, 'quality and efficacy prior to their approval for use and inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). Once included on the ARTG, the TGA continues to closely monitor the safety of these vaccines to ensure the benefits outweigh the risks. Alongside the TGA, experts in ATAGI closely monitor all current and emerging evidence on COVID-19 vaccines to make recommendations to the Government on whether to include a provisionally approved COVID-19 vaccine in the national vaccine rollout program. This includes safety, efficacy and effectiveness data from clinical trials, data on waning of immunity and local and international epidemiology. A body of evidence from clinical trials and extensive real-world evidence supports the efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines and has resulted in ATAGI preferencing the use of mRNA vaccines in the COVID-19 vaccination program. ATAGI will continue to review and update recommendations when required due to a variety of factors, including the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, changing local and international epidemiology, emergence of real-world safety and efficacy data, and the addition of new vaccine formulations to the program. ATAGI statements on COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, including their rationale for decision making and relevant references, are available at www.health.gov.au using the search term 'ATAGI'. Provisional registration process Due to the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, all COVID-19 vaccines were initially approved via the provisional approval pathway. A vaccine is provisionally approved by the TGA after a rigorous evaluation process is completed, and the benefits of the vaccine are considered to be much greater than any potential risks. Since provisional approval was granted, more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered worldwide and over 51.5 million mRNA vaccine doses have been administered in Australia. The safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines demonstrated in clinical trials has been thoroughly substantiated by real-world use, providing reassurance about the safety of these vaccines. This includes that vaccination is highly effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalisation, and death from COVID-19. Continued approval is dependent upon the evidence of longer-term efficacy and safety from ongoing clinical trials and post-market assessment. As part of the provisional approval, sponsors are required to continue to submit longer-term evidence to the TGA. As this implies, these studies are continuing to gather data on longer-term safety and effectiveness to complement post-market monitoring and spontaneous adverse event data. The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine SPIKEVAX recently received approval from the TGA for full registration. In making this decision, the TGA carefully considered long-term follow-up data from a number of studies that confirmed the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Safety monitoring process The TGA works closely with other regulators around the world to monitor and analyse COVID-19 vaccine safety data covering hundreds of millions of people, and reviews the latest evidence from clinical trials and peer-reviewed medical literature. This information continues to overwhelmingly support the safe and effective use of COVID-19 vaccines. It remains the consensus view of international regulators and health departments that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination continue to far outweigh the risks. To support the robust safety monitoring system, the TGA strongly encourages consumers and health professionals to report suspected adverse events, even if there is only a very small likelihood a vaccine was the cause. The easiest way to do this is to submit a report online at www.tga.gov.au and click on 'Report a problem' at the top right of the page, or call the Adverse Medicine Events line on 1300 633 424 to submit a report with the help of a pharmacist. With large scale COVID-19 vaccination across the Australian population, it is possible that new symptoms or illnesses may coincidentally occur in the days or weeks after vaccination. This does not, however, automatically mean that these have been caused by the vaccine. In many cases, a definite causal relationship is not certain. The adverse event could be coincidental, related to an underlying illness, or due to other factors. Unfortunately, false and misleading information has been circulating regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. We urge everyone to consider whether their sources of information are credible and trustworthy. The following resources may be helpful: Comprehensive information on how COVID-19 vaccines are regulated in Australia at www.tga.gov.au/products/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines.

Comprehensive responses by the department, including the TGA, to the Senate Estimates Community Affairs Legislation Committee (transcripts and written answers to Questions on Notice at www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary Business/Senate estimates/ca. Australia's response to COVID-19 has been effective, with treatments and vaccines being critical components of Australia's national response and ongoing management strategy to ensure our health system can effectively support COVID-19 patients and continue to provide the necessary population health care. Thank you for writing on this matter. Yours sincerely from the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Mr Butler "}
