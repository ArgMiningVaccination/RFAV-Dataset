UMB is a leading U.S. institution for graduate and professional education and a thriving academic health center combining cutting-edge biomedical research and exceptional clinical care. The University enrolls 6,329 students in six nationally ranked professional schools and an interdisciplinary Graduate School. UMB offers 40 doctoral, master's, and bachelor's degree programs and 10 certificate programs. All of UMB's professional schools are accredited, most rank nationally, and its students are successful in gaining employment, postgraduate admission to residency, funding of research, and publication of scholarly work. In addition to Middle States accreditation, most programs at UMB participate in their own self-study processes as part of their national professional organizations; this is a distinctive feature of the University that has resulted in a regular and rich culture of self-appraisal across the institution. It is for that reason the University has chosen the Comprehensive Report Reordering the Standards to Reflect an Institution model for its self-study design. This model complements UMB's robust culture of planning and accreditation and is a model through which the University could focus intensely on its strategic priorities. UMB prides itself on the success of its graduates and alumni. In each program and school, the institutional mission and vision is reflected. The University articulates its mission-driven definitions of success for learners by publishing learner outcomes that are measured by a variety of assessments, each designed to evaluate 1 The University System of Maryland (USM) was established by the Maryland General Assembly in 1988 from the merger of the five University of Maryland institutions and the six members of the State University and College System of Maryland. Today, the University System of Maryland comprises a system office led by the chancellor, two regional higher education centers, and 12 institutions, including the University of Maryland, Baltimore.professionalism, knowledge, skill acquisition, and the achievement of expectations. The institution supports an innovative culture of assessment; in graduate level education UMB has moved away from memorization and simple \"drill and grill\" assessment methodology. Instead, it has developed a robust culture of formative and summative assessment embracing the use of rubrics to evaluate writing, projects, and presentations. UMB uses portfolios to examine advancement toward publication, research grant acquisition, and scholarly contribution. Simulation and standardized patient resources are used to create environments for rich authentic assessments where UMB can teach and test its students' preparedness to work in teams, meet the challenges of a complex health care environment, while protecting individual safety and the well-being of the patients they will serve. As a public state institution, UMB's institutional assessment philosophy and program is significantly influenced and shaped by drivers at the state, University system, 1 and University levels. To be sure, much of the assessment that UMB engages in is mandated, particularly at the state level. However, instead of approaching its assessment and reporting under these programs as simply a compliance activity, UMB has adopted a holistic institutional assessment model that (a) is responsive and accountable to its stakeholders, (b) advances the University's mission and vision, and (c) utilizes the assessment data and information to evaluate the effectiveness of its programs, both at the macro and micro levels, and to improve the effectiveness of its programs while meeting its reporting obligations to its stakeholders.ExECUTIVE S UMMARYExECUTIVE SUMMARYUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore7 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 This multi-level assessment program allows UMB to create clear goals and set a course for the future as the University nurtures a culture of quality and maintains a commitment to excellence in education. Trends over a five-year period are analyzed and revisited to measure progress toward achieving the state's and University's goals. To assure all stakeholders of UMB's proper stewardship of funds and investments, shortcomings or concerns found during trend analysis are addressed with the relevant constituents through the University's established accountability and planning activities \u2014 e.g., the annual budgeting process, enrollment planning with the deans, strategic planning review with the Executive Implementation Committee, joint meetings with the shared governance senates, etc. \u2014 and plans are developed to realize more favorable outcomes. seLf-stUdy Pro Cess The major outcomes expected from the Middle States Self-Study were as follows: 1. To engage in an inclusive and transparent self- appraisal process that actively and deliberately seeks to involve members of the University community from every corner of the campus. 2. To produce a Self-Study report that demonstrates compliance with the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) accreditation standards. 3. To develop forward-looking recommendations to move the institution further along its quest for excellence in graduate and professional education, research, clinical activities, and service for the public good. UMB began preparations for the Self-Study on Oct. 22, 2013, when Accreditation Liaison Officer Roger J. Ward, EdD, JD, MPA, formed the Self-Study Logistics Team (SSLT). On Jan. 30, 2014, President Jay A. Perman, MD, appointed members to the Middle States 2016 Accreditation Self-Study Steering Committee. He also appointed Natalie D. Eddington, PhD, dean of the School of Pharmacy, and Dr. Ward as co-chairs of the Steering Committee. On Feb. 12, 2014, the Steering Committee met for the first time. At this meeting, the co-chairs welcomed the committee and introductions were offered by the members. President Perman was present and formally charged the Steering Committee with its work. Dr. Ward provided an orientation to Middle States accreditation and described the Self-Study process. Dean Eddington outlined the next steps including the formation of a small task force to choose a Self-Study design. This task force also was charged with finalizing Self-Study themes and nominating co-chairs for each working group. The Steering Committee agreed on five themes for the Self-Study and elected to establish the working groups around these themes. The working groups were each assigned specific questions to study, and each were directed to study the questions in the context of specific Middle States standards. On Feb. 20, 2014, the Office of the President released the monthly President's Message newsletter. This newsletter focused on informing the members of UMB's community about the Middle States accreditation process and notified them that the Self-Study was about to commence. ExECUTIVE SUMMARYUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore8 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 seLf-stUdy o rganization The standards in the Self-Study are grouped around the two foundational pillars that frame the 14 standards 2 in MSCHE's Characteristics of Excellence i.e., Institutional Context and Assessment and Educational Effectiveness and Assessment .

The process has brought together members of the community and raised important discussions about the future of UMB, its role in the world, the state, and in the greater Baltimore community. After reviewing and analyzing the reports of each working group, the Steering Committee determined that UMB is in compliance with all MSCHE standards. In addition, the Steering Committee proposed that the following be considered as priorities under the University's next strategic plan: Establish a Universitywide \"Center for Faculty Excellence and Innovation in Teaching, Learning, and Instructional Design\" whose mission includes enhancing the information technology infrastructure to more fully integrate student learning and faculty development across all schools. Establish \"affordability metrics\" that form the basis of a financial aid program that ensures UMB's academic offerings remain affordable and accessible to Maryland residents from a diverse range of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Assess and revise, as appropriate, the \"Appointment, Promotion, and Tenure Policies and Procedures\" at the University and in each of the schools to advance a culture that values and promotes both conventional and non-traditional sources of research funding; inter- and intra-school collaborations in research, teaching, and scholarship; and ethics and integrity in research, scholarship, and clinical activities. Establish a University \"Career and Professional Development Program\" that enhances the employment prospects of students by offering learning modules to provide early career entrants and aspiring entrepreneurs with a diverse array of career pathways. Enhance the University's culture of assessment by adopting a management and leadership framework that defines a set of \"Critical Institutional Metrics\" to assess each administrative and academic unit's progress in key strategic areas, including student learning outcomes, affordability, alumni career outcomes, community engagement, shared governance, diversity and inclusion, fundraising, and facilities utilization. Institutionalize the University's community engagement strategy by pursuing the standards in the \"Community Engagement Carnegie Classification Documentation Framework,\" with the goal of applying for this prestigious elective classification in 2018. Linking the s eLf-stUdy to strategi C PLanning In 2011, the University engaged in a strategic planning process, which was characterized by an unprecedented level of Universitywide engagement, contribution, and transparency. What resulted was a comprehensive strategic plan that has been instrumental in guiding UMB's priorities over the past five years. Even as UMB celebrates its accomplishments under the current strategic plan, the University has launched the planning process for its next five- year strategic plan, which, under University System of Maryland policy, must be in place by July 1, 2016. To link the important work of the Self-Study process to the planning process for UMB's next strategic plan, President Perman made the strategic decision to appoint one of the Self-Study co-chairs, Dr. Roger Ward, as a co-chair of the 2017-2021 strategic planning process. 3 UMB is committed, through all of its self-appraisal and planning processes, to ensuring that it remains a responsible steward of the public's trust and state's resources as it resolves to improve the human condition and serve the public good of Maryland and society at-large through education, research, clinical care, and service.ExECUTIVE SUMMARY 3 Claire M.

UMB LE aDERSHIP a ND a FFILI atIONSINTRODUCTIONUniversity of Maryland, Accreditation ReportFebruary 19, 2016 infor Mation a BoUt the sC hoo Ls The University is uniquely organized as a collection of six professional schools and a Graduate School, each with a rich legacy of innovation and service. Degrees granted include the MD, PhD, DNP, DPT, PharmD, JD, DDS, LLM, MS, and BS. In 2015, 86 percent of students were enrolled in graduate/professional-level programs. Students enrolled in BS programs enter at the upper level; all general education coursework is completed prior to acceptance. The following is a brief history of each of the schools in the order in which they were founded. School of Medicine Established in 1807, the School of Medicine is the first public and the fifth oldest medical school in the United States, and it was also the first to institute a residency training program. The School of Medicine was the founding school of the University System of Maryland. Today, the School of Medicine serves as the anchor for a large academic health center, which aims to provide the best medical education, conduct the most innovative biomedical research, and provide the best patient care and community service to Maryland and beyond. Together with its clinical partner, the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC), the School of Medicine educates and trains many of the state of Maryland's medical professionals, and its continuing education programs serve more than 5,000 physicians and other health professionals annually. While its tradition of excellence remains constant, the School of Medicine and its reputation for academic achievement continue to grow. The research productivity of the faculty is among the highest in the country, and the School of Medicine remains among the fastest growing research enterprises in the country. With 43 academic departments, centers, and institutes and a faculty of more than 3,000 physicians and research scientists, combined with more than $400 million in extramural funding, the school is regarded as one of the nation's leading biomedical research institutions. The school has research and treatment facilities in more than 35 countries around the world. Francis King Carey School of Law The Francis King Carey School of Law was established in 1816 and began regular instruction in 1824. It is the third oldest law school in the nation, but its innovative programs make it one of the liveliest and most dynamic today. The Carey School of Law seeks to promote a more just society by educating outstanding lawyers, by advancing understanding of law and legal institutions, and by enhancing access to justice. Through excellence in teaching, the school seeks to prepare students for productive leadership and professional success in a wide range of careers and to promote in both students and faculty the highest standards of public and professional service. The school's experiential programs are among the most extensive in the country. Through a nationally recognized Clinical Law Program, students can enroll in an array of courses to represent criminal defendants, emerging business owners, persons with HIV/AIDS, an environmental group, persons with a disability, or scientists seeking to patent new drugs. Students meet regularly with their professors to review the professional, ethical, and practical issues raised by their work. They also explore the connections between what is taught in the classroom and the practice of law as they are experiencing it.INTRODUCTIONUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore19 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 The school also offers specialty certificates in Environmental Law and Law and Health Care, the latter of which was ranked No. 1 and No. 2 nationally by U.S. News & World Report the past two years. Other programs include Advocacy, Alternative Dispute Resolution, Business Law, Clinical Law, Intellectual Property Law, and International and Comparative Law. Because these programs are interdisciplinary, students can work with lawyers and professionals in related fields to resolve problems that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries. For example, a student in the Law and Health Care Program could supplement a diverse curriculum of classroom courses with clinical opportunities, internships with organizations such as the National Institutes of Health, and an editorial position on the school's Journal of Health Care Law and Policy . School of Dentistry The School of Dentistry, the world's first dental college, celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2015. In addition to the doctor of dental surgery degree, which the school originated, it offers advanced training programs in six specialties; Maryland's only baccalaureate dental hygiene program; graduate programs in oral and craniofacial biological sciences and experimental pathology; and combined DDS/MPH and accelerated RDH-to-MPH programs. Students, faculty, and staff provide care for nearly 30,000 patients annually at clinics in Baltimore City and underserved areas such as Perryville, Frederick, Carroll, and Rockville, Md. An international research hub, the school is ranked fifth in National Institutes of Health funding for public dental schools. Its class of 2016 performed nearly 6,000 hours of community service outside of their daily clinical responsibilities in 2015. The school's academic externships span the globe, touching 20 countries on six continents. Its Department of Neural and Pain Sciences has gained a national reputation, leading to the creation of UMB's interdisciplinary Center for the Advancement of Chronic Pain Research. School of Pharmacy The School of Pharmacy has a rich and distinguished heritage. First incorporated as the Maryland College of Pharmacy in 1841, it is one of the oldest pharmacy schools in the country. Primarily an independent institution until 1904, the Maryland College of Pharmacy then became the Department of Pharmacy of the University of Maryland. Throughout this history, the School of Pharmacy has been a local and national leader in the profession. It was a founding member of the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, the national organization of schools and colleges of pharmacy and their faculty. The school also was instrumental in the formation of the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education, the national accreditation organization for educational programs in pharmacy. In 1970, through the efforts of the school and the Maryland Board of Pharmacy, Maryland became the first state to replace unstructured internships with a professional-experience program incorporated in a school's curriculum, setting a national standard for professional pharmacy education. In 1993, the school again set the pace for curriculum reform by adopting a four-year Doctor of Pharmacy program as its sole professional educational program. The PharmD is now the required program in all schools and colleges of pharmacy nationwide.INTRODUCTIONUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore20 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 Today, the School of Pharmacy continues to lead pharmacy education, scientific discovery, patient care, and community engagement in Maryland and beyond. The school is a comprehensive institution, offering not only the Doctor of Pharmacy degree but also post-PharmD residency and fellowship opportunities, two Doctor of Philosophy programs training independent scientists, and a variety of dual-degree programs with law, business, public health, and the pharmaceutical sciences. The school's research program in pharmaceutical health services and pharmaceutical sciences is at the cutting edge of scholarly advances. A wide range of clinical service programs provides excellent pharmaceutical care to patients. Community outreach programs touch thousands of individuals through the Maryland Poison Center, the Peter Lamy Center for Drug Therapy and Aging, and the Maryland P 3 (Patients, Pharmacists, Partnerships) Program. School of Nursing In 1889, Louisa Parsons, a colleague of Florence Nightingale, established the School of Nursing, one of the nation's oldest formal nursing training programs, at the University of Maryland. The School of Nursing has pioneered a variety of innovative educational programs, including the world's first nursing informatics graduate program. The school offers two entry-level options for students interested in a professional nursing career, the Baccalaureate of Science degree and a master's entry clinical nurse leader option (ranked No. 1 in the country by U.S.News & World Report ). It also offers a range of specialties at the master's level, including informatics, community/public health, and health services leadership and management. Nurse practitioner options, such as pediatrics, family, and adult/gerontology, and a nurse anesthesia option, also are offered through the school's Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program. The School of Nursing is affiliated with more than 300 hospitals and health care entities throughout Maryland and operates a mobile health clinic for people who are uninsured. In addition, the 154,000-square-foot building in Baltimore as well as the site at the Universities at Shady Grove in Rockville, Md., house state- of-the-art clinical simulation and standardized patient laboratories, giving students extensive hands-on training in a real-life setting. This approach to clinical instruction enhances students' learning experiences while providing vital health care services to Maryland residents. The School of Nursing is ranked sixth among graduate nursing programs by U.S.News & World Report and is ranked 11th in receipt of research funding by the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Nursing Research, with extramural research funding of $3.2 million and total extramural funding of $7.6 million in fiscal year 2015. Nursing students in the PhD program directly benefit from the school's research-intensive environment. In addition, the School of Nursing receives substantial funding from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and other sources.INTRODUCTIONUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore21 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 Graduate School Since 1917, the Graduate School has offered graduate education and training in biomedical, health, and human service sciences. The school currently offers 24 Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degree programs, along with three post-baccalaureate certificate programs. The Graduate School also offers dual degrees with the University's professional schools, including PhD/MD, PhD/PharmD, and PhD/DDS degree programs. The school also participates in inter-institutional studies in biochemistry, gerontology, and toxicology with other University System of Maryland campuses. All doctoral students are actively engaged in research with faculty members to address some of society's most pressing problems and biomedical research's most challenging questions. These innovative efforts, supported by research grants and contracts, are undertaken collaboratively with the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the University of Maryland Medical Center, the Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Institute of Human Virology, the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute, and others. The Graduate Program in Life Sciences (GPILS) offers cutting-edge research training in basic, biomedical, clinical, and population sciences. Graduate programs cover the entire range of biomedical research, from the basics of protein structure and molecular biology, through integrative systems physiology, virology, and vaccine development up to behavior, cognition, population-based genetics, and the impact of the environment on human health. The programs place a special emphasis on the importance of translational research. Graduate programs are independent from departments and consist of faculty in the basic science and clinical departments of the School of Medicine, School of Dentistry, School of Nursing, a wide array of Internationally recognized Organized Research Centers and institutes on campus in addition to collaborations with other University System of Maryland campuses. School of Social Work In response to growing social and cultural needs, the School of Social Work opened in 1961 with a mission to develop practitioners, leaders, and scholars to advance the well-being of populations and communities and to promote social justice. As national leaders, the school creates and uses knowledge for education, service innovation, and policy development. Currently, the School of Social Work is educating the vast majority of social workers throughout Maryland. Students come to the School of Social Work from more than 20 states, the District of Columbia, and several foreign countries. In a short period of time, the School of Social Work has become the leader in social work education in the state, while becoming known to a national and international audience. Among the top 20 graduate-level social work programs in the nation, the School of Social Work produces outstanding social workers whose practice advances the well-being of all the people they serve, especially members of populations at risk. The school also focuses on services through Social Work Community Outreach Service (SWCOS). Much of the school's research supports SWCOS's work. The School of Social Work provides 500,000 hours of social work services per year within the state of Maryland and surrounding communities and the school's faculty ranks among the nation's best for the number of research articles published in scholarly social work journals.INTRODUCTIONUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore22 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 Professiona L and grad Uate e dUCation As the state of Maryland's academic health, law, and human services institution, the University includes a unique configuration of schools and educational programs with extensive responsibilities for clinical care and legal and social services. UMB's student mix differs markedly from other University System of Maryland institutions. Only 14 percent of UMB's students are enrolled in its three baccalaureate degree programs; namely, nursing, dental hygiene, and medical and research technology. The remaining 86 percent of students are in post-baccalaureate programs leading to licensure, including medicine (MD), law (JD), dentistry (DDS), nursing (clinical masters, DNP), pharmacy (PharmD), social work (MSW), public health (MPH), physical therapy (DPT), genetic counseling, preventive medicine, toxicology, and pathology among others. The campus also offers the traditional research- based Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and Master of Science (MS) degree programs in nursing, social work, pharmaceutical science, pharmaceutical health services research, oral pathology, and various biomedical science disciplines and interdisciplinary programs such as neuroscience. UMB's hands-on approach, with experiential training at the School of Medicine, School of Pharmacy, School of Social Work, and Carey School of Law, among others, simulation labs at the School of Nursing, a lab with over 200 mannequin heads at the School of Dentistry and more, allow students to learn by doing. Community outreach also adds to their skill set in a real-life setting. Team exercises, such as those on IPE Day, allow students to appreciate and trust their colleagues in other disciplines. CLiniCa L Care and s erviC e Because of its health schools' clinical departments and programs and its affiliated practice plans and hospitals, UMB is uniquely qualified within the public higher education sector in Maryland to offer students clinical richness and to transfer results from basic laboratory research to the patients' arena by developing new treatments for disease, and establishing best practices for clinical care. Moreover, the presence and active involvement of the Carey School of Law and the School of Social Work enable UMB faculty and students to investigate the interaction of health sciences with the law and human services, thereby advancing public policy and improving the health and welfare of the community and its members. BioMediCa L resear Ch UMB builds upon its excellence in basic science and biomedical/biohealth research to develop large, interprofessional projects of national and global stature. An illustrative, but not exhaustive list includes: neuroscience psychiatric disease obesity diabetes family welfare stem cell and regenerative medicine HIV/AIDS celiac and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases global health cardiology and cardiovascular disease nanomedicine and cellular delivery infectious diseases cancer vaccinology genomics proteomics, and personalized medicine. INTRODUCTION DISTIN gUISHIN of Maryland, Baltimore23 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 UMB combines cutting-edge biomedical research and exceptional clinical care. Each year, UMB's faculty and students make several hundred trips to 100+ countries, where they teach, study, conduct research with their collaborators, and provide clinical care in underserved communities. For instance, UMB's medical school has research and treatment facilities in more than 35 countries and carried out the very first clinical trials for an Ebola vaccine in the U.S. and co-led the first Ebola vaccine trials in West Africa in 2014-2015. Universities at s hady g rove UMB is one of nine University System of Maryland institutions that offer programs at the Universities at Shady Grove (USG) in Rockville, Md., a convenient location in the high-tech corridor of Baltimore and Washington, D.C. More than 400 UMB students attend USG, where they are taught by 15 full-time faculty in residence and numerous others from the Baltimore campus through asynchronous distance learning. Nursing students in UMB's BSN and RN-to-BSN programs have the ability to attend courses and complete their entire program at USG as do students in the PharmD (Doctor of Pharmacy) program at the School of Pharmacy. Most recently, in 2015, the School of Social Work was approved by the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) to offer a program at USG where students could satisfy all credit requirements for the Master of Social Work (MSW) degree. (Prior to obtaining MHEC full program approval, a limited number of MSW students took courses at USG.) This expansion of the MSW program at USG has resulted in an increase in courses offered at USG, an increase in the number of students taking classes at USG, and an increase in services for MSW students at USG. The first cohort of approximately 50 MSW students completing their degree requirements at USG was admitted in the fall semester of 2015 and it is expected that a second cohort of 50 students will be admitted in fall 2016.USG, as a UMB additional location, provides a full complement of centralized on-site student, academic, and administrative services.

The mission of the BioPark is to support UMB's efforts to commercialize breakthrough therapies, diagnostics, and devices and to bring community-friendly economic development to the Westside of Baltimore. Eleven years ago, the site of the BioPark was vacant land and dilapidated buildings in one of the poorest communities of Baltimore City. Today, the BioPark is the largest biotech cluster in Baltimore City, with three dozen tenants, including early-stage bioscience companies based on technologies developed at UMB and other universities; research and development facilities of international pharmaceutical companies and clinical research organizations; translational research and clinical centers of UMB; and degree programs for bioscience (AA) and business (MBA). More than 700 workers are employed at the BioPark and over 800 community residents receive training for entry-level jobs in biomedical laboratories throughout the region. Currently, the BioPark consists of four buildings, totaling 595,000 square feet, and $400 million in capital investment. When the BioPark is complete, it will grow to 2 million square feet, over $1 billion in capital investment, and more than 2,500 jobs. The BioPark has been developed in full consultation and with the full support of the community. INTRODUCTIONUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore24 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 In addition to creating jobs and improving public safety, the BioPark has invested over $2 million in community priorities, including local organizations, training programs, public schools, community parks, and streetscape. cURREN t BIOP aRK S tatIStIcS Jobs: Square BIOP aRK S Jobs: Square Feet: 2,500 2 million Capital Investment: $1 billion Carnegie C LassifiCation UMB is one of 27 U.S. public institutions whose official Carnegie Classification is \"Special Focus Institution \u2014 Medical Schools and Medical Centers.\" This classification is used for institutions that include a medical school and other health-related professional schools, and do not have large comprehensive undergraduate programs. Other examples include the University of California, San Francisco; Oregon Health Sciences University; University of Massachusetts, Worcester; and University of Texas Health Sciences Center, San Antonio. Within the Middle States region, only three other schools, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, SUNY Upstate Medical University, and the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) Medical Sciences Campus, share this designation (see table below).

However, the University, like all institutions of higher education, finds itself in challenging times. Yet these challenges also provide great opportunities. The University's strategic plan is designed to take advantage of these opportunities. UMB created its strategic plan in careful alignment with the USM Board of Regents' strategic plan. The plan was created from the work of more than 140 faculty, staff, students, partners, and friends who dedicated tremendous time and energy to its completion. Hundreds more participated in town halls, interactive feedback sessions, focus groups, surveys, and online feedback. The participation was exceptional, but perhaps more impressive is the genuine enthusiasm at all levels for moving the University forward. Eight themes were identified as major areas of focus for the strategic plan. Work groups consisting of faculty, staff, and students from across the University, with input from town halls, online surveys, and community focus groups, developed the goals and tactics for each theme. The themes are as follows: Achieve Pre-Eminence as an Innovator Promote Diversity and a Culture of Inclusion Foster a Culture of Accountability and Transparency Excel at Interdisciplinary Research and Interprofessional Education, Clinical Care and Practice, and Public Service Develop Local and Global Initiatives that Address Critical Issues Create an Enduring and Responsible Financial Model for the University Drive Economic Development Create a Vibrant, Dynamic University Community The implementation of the strategic plan is guided by the following core values, as defined during the planning process: Accountability: The University is committed to being responsible and transparent. Civility: The University expects interactions to be professional, ethical, respectful, and courteous. Collaboration: The University promotes teamwork that fosters insightful and excellent solutions and advancement. Diversity: The University is committed to a culture that is enriched by diversity and inclusion, in the broadest sense, in its thoughts, actions, and leadership. Excellence: The University is guided by a constant pursuit of excellence. Knowledge: The University's industry is to create, disseminate, and apply knowledge. Leadership: The University continuously strives to be a leader and to develop leaders. In January 2016, the president named the co-chairs for the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan and launched the formal planning process. The planning process will occur over six months, and the strategic plan will be adopted by the Executive Cabinet in June 2016. MPowering the State University of Maryland: MPowering the State is a special working relationship between the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) that promotes innovation and impact through collaboration. Launched in 2012, it leverages the sizable strengths of both universities to advance interdisciplinary research, create new opportunities for students, and solve important problems for the people of Maryland and the nation. INTRODUCTION NOTABLE D EVELOPMENTS S INCE 2006 S ITE V ISITUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore26 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 In 2011, the Maryland General Assembly charged the University System of Maryland Board of Regents and thus both its founding campus and its flagship institution \u2014 UMB and UMCP, respectively \u2014 with developing a plan to have an even greater impact on the state, its economy, the job market, and the next generation of innovators. The universities are committed to this charge, and work together to craft a plan, implement it, and assess its effectiveness. The new working relationship demands teamwork and collaboration; joint efforts are championed and supported at the highest levels of the academic structure. In fewer than four years, MPowering the State has transformed the way UMB and UMCP approach research, education, and service in the state. It is the vehicle that joins the complementary resources of two great universities \u2014 their leadership, faculty, researchers, and students \u2014 to boost joint research, inspire education programs that enrich, challenge, and attract the best and the brightest, spur technology transfer, and drive economic development. MPower is a model of what committed collaboration can achieve. With its shared vision, MPowering the State is advancing Maryland's competitiveness and reputation as a national leader. Among MPowering the State's initiatives are: a Center for Health-Related Informatics and Bioimaging (CHIB), which joins researchers in computer science and engineering at UMCP with experts in genomics and clinical medicine at UMB an Agriculture Law Education Initiative (ALEI), which gives state farmers expanded access to resources from UMB, UMCP, and University of Maryland, Eastern Shore the SAFE (Support, Advocacy, Freedom and Empowerment ) Center for Human Trafficking Survivors, which draws on the combined resources and disciplines of both universities to address human trafficking the Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research (IBBR), which helps cross-disciplinary team approaches to scientific challenges, tech development, and education flourish by leveraging the research strengths in biological and quantitative sciences, medicine, and engineering at both universities new courses and programs for students such as MLAW, which offers joint undergraduate courses and experiential opportunities that are unique in the U.S. seed grants (26 thus far) that promote cross-university research by creative teams of investigators extending boundaries UM Ventures, the joint technology transfer operation of UMB and UMCP that has catalyzed commercialization of university inventions the Maryland Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (M-CERSI), an initiative funded by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that joins UMB and UMCP researchers with FDA staff to improve the ways drugs and medical devices are evaluated The oversight of MPowering the State is vested in a joint Steering Committee, whose members have been appointed by the presidents of UMCP and UMB. The Steering Committee reports to the two presidents, who report to the chancellor and the Board of Regents. inter Professiona L edUCation Interprofessional education (IPE), a priority at UMB since the arrival of Dr. Perman as president, reached new heights in 2013 with the formation of the Center for Interprofessional Education. The center, which serves as a resource and as a connector for IPE initiatives across UMB, is headed by Jane M. Kirschling, PhD, RN, FAAN, who, in addition to being the center's director and University director of IPE, is dean of the School of Nursing. The center advances President Perman's vision for preparing all UMB students to provide high-quality, affordable health care and human services within a team-based model. Formation of the center was announced at IPE INTRODUCTIONUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore27 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 Day in April 2013. During this event, 309 health and human services students and 114 faculty gathered to form multidisciplinary teams to tackle complex scenarios such as \"Crossing the Line,\" a case staged at the School of Dentistry in which a child's broken teeth may be a clue to child abuse. Since then, health fairs and Interprofessional Critical Care Simulation exercises have emerged, as well as an enhanced annual Interprofessional Patient Management Competition, where teams of students representing UMB's schools pool their knowledge to devise a treatment strategy for a hypothetical patient whose case presents complex medical as well as legal issues. A national leader in interprofessional education, UMB teaches future physicians, lawyers, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, and biomedical scientists to work together for optimal patient and client care. President Perman more than theorizes on the importance of IPE. He demonstrates it with a weekly President's Clinic where Dr. Perman, a pediatric gastroenterologist, joins rotating groups of students selected to represent all the schools in treating young University of Maryland Medical Center patients. IPE also has been emphasized to the UMB students studying at the Universities at Shady Grove (USG) in Rockville, Md. During the 2015-2016 academic year, USG's Committee for Interprofessional and Interdisciplinary Education Strategies (CIPES) held interprofessional courses and events involving nearly 300 students. UMB's nursing, pharmacy, and social work students participated in \"Preparing for Tomorrow: Healthcare Workforce Pipeline Project,\" \"Interprofessional Clinical/Rotation Experience Mercy Heather Congdon, PharmD, BCPS, CDE, the School of Pharmacy's assistant dean at Shady Grove and an original co-director of UMB's Center for Interprofessional Education, gave a presentation on \"Development & Implementation of an Interprofessional SOAP Note Grading Tool.\" aCade MiC transfor Mation In fiscal year 2014, the General Assembly approved UMB's plan to invest $1.8 million from the fund balance in new funding for academic enhancements. That funding is already paying dividends by transforming UMB's academic programs, supporting student success, and expanding the health care workforce. For example, a new program has been added to respond to the need for more primary care clinicians, a need well- documented both nationally and in Maryland. Physician assistants are trained to work with a physician to deliver team-based care, which can extend the reach and productivity of physician providers. In December 2010, Anne Arundel Community College (AACC) approached UMB about developing a Master of Science in Health Sciences (MSHS) degree program. This was the result of changes in the credential recognized for entry into the Physician Assistant profession and health policy changes occurring at the state and national levels. In collaboration with faculty from AACC, UMB faculty from multiple disciplines designed the framework for the MSHS, which is delivered completely online. In addition, course redesign initiatives that incorporate technology to enhance teaching and learning are underway in the Graduate School as well as in the schools of Nursing, Pharmacy, and Social Work. CoMMU nity e ngage Ment The University has a long and distinguished history of engagement spanning several decades, particularly in the West Baltimore communities. During the past five years the University has moved to bring about better cohesion and coordination of its many disparate initiatives to maximize their collective impact. In 2013, President Perman created the Center for Community-Based Engagement and Learning to better coordinate faculty scholarship and service learning that improves the health and welfare of UMB's neighbors. The center has undertaken such initiatives as mapping UMB's INTRODUCTIONUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore28 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 extensive service-learning activities to enhance collaboration; coordinating violence prevention initiatives with the Baltimore City Health Department; and mentoring student groups involved in community engagement. Each year, the center supplies grants for community-engaged faculty projects, and its Faculty Fellows Program has developed a network of faculty, staff, and students committed to advancing social justice by sustaining close working partnerships with West Baltimore residents and organizations. In 2014, President Perman established the Office of Community Engagement to coordinate UMB's abundant school-led, student-led, and employee-led outreach; to more aggressively move the needle on community health, wealth, and social indicators; and to hold the University accountable for doing so. The office introduced a \"place-based\" community engagement strategy to bring more robust and better aligned services to UMB's neighbors, and to more clearly articulate to students, faculty, and staff where community-based service and scholarship might have the greatest impact. The University has identified 1 square mile surrounding the campus as the focus of its activities, where neighborhood performance in every critical domain \u2014 health, education, employment, income, and safety \u2014 lags far behind the citywide average. This focus resulted in the fall 2015 opening of the UMB Community Engagement Center in West Baltimore, a space where the University provides services to nearby residents and works with them to strengthen schools, create jobs, and drive neighborhood development. Changes in r esear Ch fU nding The University's entrepreneurial revenues are derived from federal and state research grants and contracts, awards from foundations and corporations, and patient care. Leading up to FY10, UMB saw tremendous growth with double digit yearly increases. Beginning in FY10, revenue from contract and grant awards declined from previous years, particularly in National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding.INTRODUCTION UMB OVER aLL RESE Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 Since these declines affected both direct and indirect cost recoveries, they put substantial pressure on the University's budget to fund the largely fixed expenses related to facilities and infrastructure for research. Multiple approaches were taken to counteract these effects, including decreases in costs, prioritized reallocation of internal resources, and diversification of funding sources. Additional efforts were placed on attracting corporate sources of basic science funding, including the establishment of several major corporate relationships, such as a new MedImmune partnership. Efforts were made to streamline the clinical research process at all steps, including corporate contracting and Institutional Review Board review, while maintaining quality and compliance. The faculty was urged to increase the number of research grant submissions. Emphasis was placed on identifying and competing for larger grants such as program projects and \"U\" awards from the NIH. The MPowering the State initiative also has yielded new funding opportunities and awards (see tables below). Through MPowering the State, UMB has established a joint research and innovation seed grant program to promote research and collaboration across disciplinary boundaries with UMCP. To date, 26 joint research and innovation seed grants have been awarded to more than 50 researchers. There has been significant recovery of extramural funding, but UMB still remains highly focused on these additional efforts. This current level of stabilization is encouraging although there is clearly a need to strengthen UMB's current programs and further diversify its revenue funding streams.INTRODUCTION MPowering the State RESUL tS IN RESE Total FY13 Total FY14 Total FY15 Total FY12-15 Joint Proposals Submitted 4 68 114 112 298 Joint Proposals Awarded 1 18 26 36 81 $ Awarded $2,949,998 $14,552,295 RESE aRcH 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Invention Disclosures 206 265 264 366 306 Startups 5 7 11 8 10 Licenses 28 34 41 51 56 University of Maryland, Baltimore30 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 Law sC hoo L enro LLMent The national trend in declining enrollments facing law schools also has impacted the Francis King Carey School of Law at UMB. The collapse of the job market for law school graduates has persuaded many potential students not to apply for law school. The University has created a multi-year plan to rebalance and revitalize this important school. UMB is funding this transformation by utilizing its existing resources, increasing efficiency, and by supporting the diversification of the school's revenue streams. The Carey School of Law has pursued diversification of its revenue streams by attracting new segments of the population with initiatives such as a Master of Science in Law (MSL) program providing new skills for experienced professionals, a renewed commitment to public service, empowering women in law, a business law program focusing on fundamentals, and other current topics such as cybersecurity, intellectual property, environmental law, and the school's Center for Health and Homeland Security. The inaugural entering class of 29 MSL students began their coursework in fall 2015. Projected enrollment for the program is an entering class of 50 each year for a total enrollment of 100 students at any given time. The law school expects to return to stability, albeit with smaller class sizes in the JD program and expansion of new master's level programs, by the beginning of the 2017-2018 academic year.INTRODUCTION Law sC hoo L aPPL iCations in 50000 1500 40000 1000 2010 2010 2011 2011 2012 2012 2013 2013 2014 2014 2015 2015 MaRyLaND LaW aDMISSIONS PIctURE Entering Class 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 Applications 1,958 2,288 2,770 Admitted 36.5% Admitted Class Size 204 202 206 264 294 175 Day/29 Night 176 Day/26 Night 173 Day/33 Night 219 ReportFebruary 19, 2016 the d eath of f reddie g ray and the aP riL 2015 Ba LtiMore Protests On April 19, 2015, a 25-year-old man from West Baltimore named Freddie Gray died from injuries sustained in police custody. In the days following Gray's death and funeral, Baltimore saw a wave of both peaceful demonstrations and violent unrest. The protests provided added urgency to the University's community engagement efforts. An initiative, UMB Responds, was formed shortly after the violence to coordinate Universitywide activities ranging from collecting goods, recruiting volunteers, to joining broad engagement efforts such as #OneBaltimore. As part of UMB Responds, the School of Nursing deployed one of the Governor's Wellmobiles, a mobile health clinic, to an area where the local pharmacy had been destroyed. Residents were encouraged to get referrals to needed health services by entering the van. Additionally, the Rite Aid Corp. made a $10,000 gift, upon reopening a store that had been destroyed, to a Baltimore public school. The grant application was co-authored by the program director of the School of Social Work's Promise Heights program, which works to improve the lives of Baltimore children. On campus, the University created a space for its members to openly discuss the events. At a forum in May, students, faculty, and staff spoke candidly about their experiences with race on and off campus and called for action on the part of the UMB administration to explore and address issues of career advancement among employees of color; cultural competency among students, faculty, and staff; and the University's engagement with the community. In July, a second forum shared specific recommendations made by the Diversity Advisory Council (DAC) in these three areas. President Perman supplied further updates in his December newsletter and a spring 2016 update is planned. Also, an ad-hoc committee of UMB staff and faculty got together to publicize, campuswide, their personal availability to discuss the campus climate after the protests with a particular emphasis on supporting students of color. During this time, admissions officers also worked to assure prospective students of their safety on campus. Campus police and public safety conducted an \"after action\" review and have used the results to bolster their planning for the upcoming trials of the police officers charged in Mr. Gray's death. Additionally, more than a dozen Carey School of Law faculty designed an eight-week course \u2014 Freddie Gray's Baltimore: Past, Present and Moving Forward \u2014 that explored the causes of, and possible solutions for, the unrest and ways in which students could become engaged. The commitment to this course and the speed with which it came together was exemplary, attracting 70 law students, 15 social work students, and several community members in fall 2015. The course is again offered this spring at UMB and the University of Maryland, College Park. Also offered for the first time this spring is a tuition-free, 1-credit Social Justice in Our Community course available to all students. Students will receive hands-on, professional experience with community health programs by working with partner organizations in the community surrounding UMB. Through service learning, students will learn how community health programs are developed, organized, implemented, and evaluated as well as how interprofessional teams successfully function, how to interact with individuals and groups living in UMB's community, and how to report on their observations to peers and supervisors.INTRODUCTIONUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore32 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 faCUL ty aC tivities The new UMB Center to Advance Chronic Pain Research is directed by Susan Dorsey, PhD, RN, FAAN, in the School of Nursing and Joel Greenspan, PhD, in the School of Dentistry. The center brings together pain experts and research from different disciplines so that UMB might fulfill the most basic promise of clinical care \u2014 to relieve patients' pain and unburden them of suffering. The School of Social Work is a leader in the Community Schools movement, fast becoming the standard model for urban schools, which must address complex community trauma like regular exposure to violence and loss. Community Schools wrap their students and families in a safety net of services that ultimately enables success. Robert Ernst, PhD, in the School of Dentistry and David Goodlett, PhD, in the School of Pharmacy are using mass spectrometry to create a bacterial library so that physicians can more quickly and accurately diagnose a patient's infection. Fast and accurate pathogen identification is sorely needed in hospitals and clinics with patients who have potentially deadly infections. A library of chemically bar-coded bacteria will make diagnosis quicker, cheaper, and better. Sunjay Kaushal, PhD, MD, in the School of Medicine discovered robust regenerative capacity in the cardiac stem cells of infants with congenital heart disease. In rodent models, the cells sped recovery and strengthened heart function. Now Dr. Kaushal's team has gotten FDA approval to transplant the cells he harvests back into the hearts of his young patients, the first clinical trial with children. Ultimately, Dr. Kaushal hopes the procedure will delay the need for more surgeries.The Carey School of Law is teaming up with the School of Social Work to tackle long- standing issues of social justice in our homes, our communities, our schools, our prisons. By combining social work and legal expertise, the schools aim to dramatically improve the delivery of services to those suffering injustice and to effectuate groundbreaking policy reforms at the state and national levels. Eleanor Perfetto, PhD, MS, in the School of Pharmacy has joined a national project focused on improving patient value in the delivery of health care.

The institution's stated goals, consistent with the aspirations and expectations of higher education, clearly specify how the institution will fulfill its mission. The mission and goals are developed and recognized by the institution with the participation of its members and its governing body and are utilized to develop and shape its programs and practices and to evaluate its effectiveness. deCLaration of CoMPL ianCe The University has a clear mission that articulates the University's purpose and values and identifies whom the institution serves. Companion documents, such as the 2011-2016 UMB Strategic Plan , which was developed in conjunction with campus community members, articulate the specific goals through which the University achieves its mission. Mission The University's Mission The University recently revised its mission statement to produce a concise overview of its purpose as an institution: To improve the human condition and serve the public good of Maryland and society at-large through education, research, clinical care, and service. This mission statement is closely related to other key UMB documents, namely its vision and strategic plan. The Mission Review Process The University System of Maryland (USM) and Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) require UMB to review its mission statement every four years. Although the mission statement had been reviewed and discussed as part of the strategic planning process that began in 2010 the University did not generate a new statement at that time. However, in 2015 UMB published a revised, more succinct mission statement. Leadership felt that the old mission was more of a descriptive paragraph about UMB's identity. It was too long to be a meaningful guide to faculty, staff, and students, and to those the University serves. UMB wanted to create a dynamic, meaningful, one-sentence mission statement that provided the perspective and action suited to the University. With that in mind, UMB established a draft process that included meeting with stakeholders to discuss the current mission, vision, and core values. These stakeholders included deans and vice presidents; members of the Faculty Senate , Staff Senate , and University Student Government Association ; adjunct faculty; and members of the Middle States Self-Study Committee . UMB also reviewed MHEC's Post-secondary Plan for Higher Education as well as mission statements from several peer institutions. After initial meetings to discuss the drafting process and how a one-sentence mission statement would be received by the University community, potential mission statements were proposed, and feedback was gathered. The group then selected and finalized the statement.STANDARD 1: M ISSION AND gOALSSTANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 1 - Integrity, Mission and GoalsUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore38 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 other Missions Because of how UMB is organized, other mission statements inform the University's goals. First, as a member of USM, UMB's mission relates to the missions of USM and MHEC. University System of Maryland The mission of the University System of Maryland is to improve the quality of life for the people of Maryland by providing a comprehensive range of high- quality, accessible, and affordable educational opportunities that recognize and address the need for lifelong learning and global and environmental awareness. engaging in research and creative scholarship that solve today's problems, expand the boundaries of current knowledge, and promote an appreciation of learning in all areas: the arts, humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and professions. preparing graduates with the knowledge, skills, and integrity necessary to be successful leaders and engaged citizens, while providing knowledge-based programs and services that are responsive to the needs of the state and the nation. Maryland Higher Education Commission The mission of the Maryland Higher Education Commission is to ensure that the people of Maryland have access to a high-quality, diverse, adequately funded, effectively managed, and capably led system of postsecondary education. It accomplishes this mission through the provision of statewide planning, leadership, coordination, and advocacy for the state's postsecondary educational institutions and through the administration of state financial aid programs. Second, as an institution composed of graduate and professional schools, the UMB mission statement frames and guides those of each individual school. Graduate School The mission of the Graduate School is to support, promote, and facilitate excellence in graduate education at the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB). We fulfill this mission in concert with UMB's schools of dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and social work by development and application of Universitywide standards and policies for graduate programs, faculty, and students. School of Dentistry The University of Maryland School of Dentistry, Baltimore College of Dental Surgery seeks to graduate exceptional oral health care professionals, contribute to the scientific basis of treatments for diseases of the orofacial complex, and deliver comprehensive dental care.

UMB leadership expectations of civility and high ethical standards are expressed in required adherence to written policies and procedures and providing education, training, services and support for the UMB community. Integrity, accountability, and transparency in research, scholarship, and clinical activities are clearly delineated throughout UMB's new mission statement that was approved in 2015, written policies and procedures, core values, and commitment to academic freedom. The UMB mission is \"to improve the human condition and serve the public good of Maryland and society at-large through education, research, clinical care, and service.\" This statement provides a concise measure by which individuals, schools, and programs can measure the ethical intent of their actions and initiatives. Moreover, the UMB Code of Ethics and Conduct expects and requires all UMB personnel to: A. Uphold the highest standards of intellectual honesty and integrity in teaching, research, service, and administrative activity, and seek guidance, as needed, concerning the application of ethical standards to their UMB activities.B. Act as good stewards of the resources entrusted to UMB's care, and comply with financial requirements and internal controls applicable to funds and property managed by them and under their oversight. C. Comply with all laws, rules, regulations, policies, procedures, and professional standards, including the Maryland Public Ethics Law, applicable to their employment and their UMB responsibilities, and cooperate with training and continuing education initiatives of UMB to make them aware of their responsibilities.

Allegations of faculty/or and staff misconduct may be reported anonymously (or with attribution) via UMB's Whistleblower Hotline/EthicsPoint , through online forms, or by calling the Office of Accountability and Compliance (OAC) . UMB also strives to create a culture of integrity through its core values , which define the ethical standards that are disseminated throughout UMB programs and activities: Accountability: The University is committed to being responsible and transparent. Civility: The University expects interactions to be professional, ethical, respectful, and courteous. Collaboration: The University promotes teamwork that fosters insightful and excellent solutions and advancement. Diversity: The University is committed to a culture that is enriched by diversity and inclusion, in the broadest sense, in its thoughts, actions, and leadership. Excellence: The University is guided by a constant pursuit of excellence. Knowledge: The University's industry is to create, disseminate, and apply knowledge. Leadership: The University continuously strives to be a leader and to develop leaders. In addition, UMB has well-established and well-publicized appointment, promotion and tenure polices . The University also conducts routine and recurring training relating to topics such as Title IX, conflict of interest, cultural sensitivity, HIPAA, ethics, and human research protection. Additionally, financial disclosure and ethics training are required by the state of Maryland for positions that have direct impact on the formation of contracts, budgets, procurement. Lastly, eligible nonexempt employees are represented for collective bargaining purposes by AFSCME MD and uniformed police officers may also be represented by the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 141. Data from the Middle States Self-Study Campus Survey show that faculty, staff, and student respondents feel that UMB promotes the core values. Finally, in order to protect academic freedom at UMB, the Faculty Senate ratified an academic freedom resolution in order to protect academic freedoms at UMB. It includes: freedom of research and publication; freedom to determine standards; freedom of teaching; freedom of internal criticism; and freedom of participation in public debate. stUdent i ntegrity Integrity is a key component of UMB's professional and graduate programs. As part of accreditation through their respective professional affiliations, each UMB school provides specific training on ethics and integrity within the profession. This training often includes information such as UMB's Code of Ethics and Conduct and access to policies and procedures on ethics and integrity. Each school also informs students of their standards and expectations for academic performance, integrity, and accountability.

Under his guidance, the Office of Accountability and Compliance (OAC) promotes compliance and transparency through the offices of research integrity, conflict of interest, human research protections, and education and equal access. OAC has a staff of trained professionals who conduct internal audits and investigations of research, scholarly, and clinical activities to ensure compliance with ethical, legal, and regulatory requirements, as well as institutional policies. Additionally, research conducted on campus is audited by the Office of Environmental Health and Safety and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee among others. OAC also holds UMB's students, faculty, and staff accountable in adhering to ethical guidelines. Ongoing training and education routinely occurs under the CAO's guidance that serves to inform the UMB community of its changes that impact the University community including changes to applicable policies and procedures. Upon hire, new faculty and staff participate in an onboarding process through UMB's Human Resource Services . During onboarding, all new hires are provided coordinated, standardized processes regarding UMB's procedures and expectations. New hires are required to complete a session on Title IX for Higher Education and Employee Sexual Harassment Awareness within 30 days. Moreover, employees are expected to keep current with annual and biennial training requirements regarding this topic and, as appropriate, others including responsible conduct of research, human and animal subject research regulations, conflict of interest disclosure requirements, use of biological materials and radioactive materials in research, HIPAA and FERPA , among others. Completion of initial and refresher training requirements is monitored by the appropriate campus or University offices. Furthermore, an integral part of UMB's culture of accountability and transparency includes well- publicized opportunities for reporting suspected discrimination, malfeasance, or misconduct. These include an anonymous mechanism for UMB faculty, staff, students, patients, clients, and others to report departures via the UMB Whistleblower Hotline/EthicsPoint , which is available through a link on the home page of the UMB website. UMB's policies also include protection for reporters against reprisal actions. With regard to course and catalog availability, the chief academic and research officer (provost), who oversees the Office of the Registrar , ensures that the schools maintain a slate of required and elective courses sufficient to allow students to complete them within the published program length. In addition all schools have either paper or electronic catalogs/handbooks with appropriately timely information and processes for retaining and updating them as necessary. Assessment data are available to prospective and current students concerning graduation/retention rates, licensure pass rates, and other outcomes via the Student Right to Know page on UMB's website. sUMMary UMB has a stated commitment to integrity and sufficient policies and programs in place to ensure ongoing ethical behavior. Therefore, the University is in compliance with Standard 6: Integrity.STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 1 - Integrity, Mission and GoalsUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore44 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016CHAPTER 2 LEADERSHIP , gOVERNANCE AND ADMINISTRATION STANDARD 4 - L EADERSHIP AND gOVERNANCE STANDARD 5 - ADMINISTRATIONSTANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENTUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore45 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 state Ment of the s tandard The institution's system of governance clearly defines the roles of institutional constituencies in policy development and decision-making. The governance structure includes an active governing body with sufficient autonomy to assure institutional integrity and to fulfill its responsibilities of policy and resource development, consistent with the mission of the institution. deCLaration of CoMPL ianCe UMB has a dynamic system of leadership and governance that enables the institution to fully realize its mission and goals. UMB is a constituent institution of the University System of Maryland (USM) , which is governed by a Board of Regents . The Board of Regents, in consultation with the USM chancellor, appoints the president of UMB, who serves as the chief executive officer. The president of UMB appoints the deans of the professional schools and the Graduate School, who report directly to the president. The president of UMB also appoints administrative officers of the University, including a chief academic and research officer (provost) and a chief accountability officer. University s yste M of Mary Land (U sM) The USM, an independent unit of state government, is Maryland's public higher education system. It comprises 12 institutions and two regional higher education centers, offering over 1,000 undergraduate and graduate/professional degree programs to 168,126 students at 200 sites worldwide. USM is the 12th-largest university system in the nation. Pursuant to Maryland law, USM is governed by a 17-member Board of Regents (BOR) appointed by the governor of Maryland with the advice and consent of the Senate. Fifteen of the members serve staggered five-year terms; the 16th member, by statute, is the Secretary of Agriculture, who serves ex officio as long as he or she continues in that position; and the 17th member is a USM student who serves a one-year term. The BOR is responsible for the governance and management of USM and its constituent institutions, centers, and institutes. It appoints the USM chancellor, who serves as its chief executive officer. The BOR has expressly delegated certain authority to the chancellor and the presidents of the constituent institutions. Approximately every two years, the Chancellor's Office conducts a survey of the BOR members to assess their views on various aspects of their work. The Chancellor's Office then does a summary for the BOR and discusses the results and any changes or suggestions that may have been generated by those results. Maryland law requires that the BOR approve and adopt a systemwide plan of higher education, developed by the chancellor on the basis of plans developed by the constituent institutions. The law sets forth certain priorities that the chancellor is required to include in the plan. It includes a priority directed at UMB: Maintain and enhance an academic health center and a coordinated Higher Education Center for Research and Graduate and Professional Study in the Baltimore area, comprised of the University of Maryland, Baltimore and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, with a focus on science and technology.STANDARD 4: L EADERSHIP AND gOVERNANCESTANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 2 - Leadership, Governance and AdministrationUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore46 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 Actions taken by USM to enhance UMB's professional schools and its joint Graduate School programs with UMBC are designed to fulfill this requirement. Pursuant to Maryland law , the University must update its mission every four years and submit the mission statement to USM. The purpose of this review is to assure that the mission of USM's constituent institutions are consistent with the USM Charter and systemwide plan, and that they promote the efficient and effective use of the institutions' and system's resources. The results of the USM review are then reported to the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) for review. The BOR recognizes the distinct mission of UMB and historically has been very supportive of UMB's special needs. For example, the BOR authorized establishment of independent faculty practice plans for the School of Medicine and the School of Dentistry that modified the systemwide faculty appointment procedure. One modification allows the School of Medicine faculty to attain tenure, acknowledging their academic accomplishments, yet receive salary support from the practice plans and clinical units of the academic health center in addition to state budget support. Similarly, Maryland law requires the development of an annual Performance Accountability Plan . The BOR reviews and approves the Performance Accountability Plan for each constituent institution and annually reviews a written report from each president on the attainment by the institution of the objectives in the Performance Accountability Plan of the institution. This report also is submitted to the MHEC. Each president is held accountable for meeting the objectives of the Performance Accountability Plan and other key goals, through their individual performance review plans. In consultation with the institutions and the chancellor, the BOR establishes standards for funding based on differences in the size and mission of the constituent institutions and approves consolidated budget requests for appropriations for USM with respect to the operating and capital budgets. The BOR follows the conflict of interest policies outlined in the Maryland Public Ethics Law. However, the BOR has adopted a Policy on Conflicts of Interest in Research and Development in response to the enactment of the Maryland Public-Private Partnership Act in 1996. This act amended the Maryland Public Ethics Law to exempt USM personnel from some of the law's conflict of interest provisions. The policy specifies that UMB and other USM institutions shall adopt procedures to implement the conflict of interest policy. Accordingly, the University has developed its own procedures for implementation of the BOR policy and they are housed on the University's Accountability and Compliance Conflict of Interest page. The page includes links to relevant policies and also has a frequently asked questions section that is provided to assist the community in assessing next steps. UMB a dMinistration The BOR, in consultation with the USM chancellor , appoints the president of each system institution as the chief executive officer. Presidents, all of whom serve at the pleasure of the BOR, are evaluated annually by the chancellor, who discusses the results of that evaluation and consequent recommendations for compensation actions with the designated select committee of the BOR. Additionally, presidents undergo a five-year review. This review is conducted by a committee comprised of knowledgeable and experienced leaders, such as presidents of institutions with missions similar to that of the president under review. STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 2 - Leadership, Governance and AdministrationUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore47 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 The current USM chancellor, Robert L. Caret, PhD, announced the results of President Perman's five-year evaluation to the UMB community on Sept. 22, 2015. In his letter to the UMB community, the chancellor reported that the evaluation team praised President Perman's \"steady, no panic\" leadership and the University's progress toward its goals. Additionally, the chancellor said: The team was extremely complimentary of President Perman's ability to balance the complexities of management, especially with the University of Maryland Medical System, and his commitment to inter-professional collaborations. The report noted the collaboration in research activities among the schools. It also noted his ability to draw a balance between decentralized operations at the schools and appropriate central oversight. Several of the areas the report highlighted over the past five years under President Perman's leadership included UMB's steady progress toward academic excellence; the increased stability in financial management; the consistent strength in external research support and the enhancement of economic development initiatives; the success of MPowering the State , the collaborative initiative with the University of Maryland, College Park; and UMB's significant impact on the Baltimore community because of President Perman's support and engagement in community efforts. One community leader commented that \"he is everywhere\" in the community. In his self-evaluation report presented in advance to the team, President Perman wrote: \"more than anything else in these initial five years, I have wanted to set a tone and an expectation of collaboration and partnership within the university and with external partners.\" It was clear to the team and likewise to the regents and me that he has succeeded. The president has the responsibility of taking initiatives to implement the policies of the BOR and the constituent institution and to promote the institution's development and efficiency. The president's major responsibilities, for which the BOR has delegated authority, include developing a plan of institutional mission, goals, priorities, and a set of peer institutions responsibility for all academic matters, including developing new academic programs and curtailing or eliminating existing programs formulating operating and capital budget requests appointing, promoting, fixing salaries, granting tenure, assigning duties, and terminating personnel creating any position within existing funds available to the University establishing admission standards; setting tuition and fees; administering financial aid entering into contracts and cooperative agreements accepting gifts and grants and maintaining and managing endowment income overseeing affirmative action and equal employment opportunities in compliance with state, federal, and BOR mandates and policies. The president of UMB appoints the deans of the professional schools and the Graduate School, as well as all vice presidents. The deans report directly to the president and have responsibility for academic affairs, administration, research, development, information technology, and communications within the schools. It is the role of the central administration to address enterprise- wide issues; ensure that auditing, planning, reporting, and other accountability processes STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 2 - Leadership, Governance and AdministrationUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore48 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 are adhered to; coordinate liaison with external shareholders; and support the deans and faculty of the schools in their academic enterprises. The administration is led by a chief academic and research officer and senior vice president who reports to the president. The other members of the executive leadership include : University counsel vice president for medical affairs chief communications officer chief development officer chief administrative and financial officer chief enterprise and economic development officer chief information officer chief accountability officer chief government affairs officer Just as the president is responsible to the chancellor and the BOR, the deans and vice presidents are responsible to the president and undergo decanal and administrative review. President Perman, consistent with UMB's Policy on Review of Chief Academic/Administrative Officers of the University, engages in both formative and summative reviews of the chief academic and administrative officers to enhance leadership effectiveness and provide accountability in ensuring fidelity to the University's vision, mission, and values. Additionally, these individuals also are subject to review under UMB's Performance Development Program . Universitywide s hared g overnan Ce Elected UMB faculty, students, and staff participate in the USM shared governance structures \u2014 the Council of University System Faculty (CUSF) , the USM Student Council (USMSC) , and the Council of University System Staff (CUSS) . In addition, UMB adheres to the USM system of shared governance, in which faculty, staff, and students discuss and provide input on major issues affecting UMB, through UMB governance structures and school-based committees. The USM Policy on Shared Governance in the University System of Maryland rests final authority and responsibility for the welfare of USM institutions with the chancellor and presidents, but requires informed participation at every institutional level by faculty, students, staff, and administrators. The policy specifies that faculty, students, and staff shall have opportunities to participate in decisions that relate to mission and budget priorities; curriculum, course content, and instruction; research; appointment, promotion, and tenure of faculty; human resources policies; selection and appointment of administrators; issues that affect the ability of students to complete their education; and other issues that affect the overall welfare of the institution. The faculty, staff, and student governance bodies at UMB adhere to this principle. As mandated by USM policy, UMB has a Faculty Senate , Staff Senate , and University Student Government Association that serve as the elected shared governance body for its constituency. These bodies adhere to the USM requirements that \"[a]t least 75% of the voting members shall be elected by their constituencies\" and \"[s]uch bodies should elect their own presiding officers.\" The UMB president and other senior administrators meet monthly with these elected representative bodies or their executive councils and regularly generate action items. In 2014, these groups also met collectively in a \"Shared Government Summit\" with senior leadership.

Examples of such bodies include the Strategic Planning Committee , which led the development of Redefining Collaboration: Strategic Plan 2011-2016 ; the Executive Implementation Committee , which has guided the implementation of the strategic plan; the Diversity Advisory Council , which makes recommendations to the president to promote UMB's culture of diversity and inclusion; the Enterprise Risk Management Steering Committee, which identifies, prioritizes, and plans responses to institutional risks; and the Middle States Self-Study Steering Committee , which has prepared this Self-Study Report. UMB f aCULty s enate The UMB Faculty Senate is an elected body whose members are chosen by faculty from the University's six professional schools and the Graduate School. The Faculty Senate makes recommendations to the president on issues of policy that affect faculty across the various UMB schools. The president reports regularly in person to the Faculty Senate and seeks its advice and feedback. The chief academic and research officer (provost) and the chief accountability officer also regularly attend Faculty Senate meetings. Other UMB and school administrators may appear, as requested, to report and provide input. Representation on the Faculty Senate is proportional to the number of full-time faculty in each school. In addition, there are seats for representatives from part-time faculty, adjunct faculty, library faculty, and the Staff Senate . All full-time faculty are eligible to serve on the Faculty Senate. Senators serve staggered three-year terms. Annual elections are held to fill vacancies that occur upon expiration of members' terms.

The Faculty Senate also has advised the president and senior administrators on a wide range of issues from safety to UMB's sexual misconduct policy. As mentioned previously, faculty also are involved at the USM level through their participation in CUSF . This group advises the chancellor and reports regularly to the BOR . It considers and makes recommendations on matters of systemwide professional and educational concern to the faculty and matters to which faculty bring special expertise.

The Staff Senate advises the president on items such as policies, procedures, and rules affecting employees, the work environment, issues impacting wages and benefits, and staff morale. Representation is by school. Staff Senate representatives serve also on the CUSS , thereby providing input to USM on staff issues. The Faculty Senate and the Staff Senate often work cooperatively. For example, the Faculty Senate includes a Staff Senate representative and the two Senates have jointly addressed issues of mutual concern, such as affordable child care, safety, and parking. University s tUdent govern Ment a ssoCiation The University Student Government Association (USGA) is a student senate elected by students in the major programs and schools on campus. It is led by an executive board of six. The USGA is dedicated to improving life at the University through cultural and social programming and to improving student communication at institutional levels. Through the USGA, students have a voice in University governance. The USGA appoints student representatives to the USM Student Council and to the state's Student Advisory Council of the Maryland Higher Education Commission . A weekly email sent to all students, Campus Life Weekly with USGA , contains University-related announcements and information about events of interest to students.

They exercise responsibilities for academic programs and standards; make recommendations about faculty appointments, promotion, and tenure; and provide advice to the dean on a range of issues. Each of the University's schools operates pursuant to a shared governance model that is distinct to the discipline. Regardless of the model, however, faculty in each school exercise responsibilities for academic programs and standards; make recommendations about faculty appointments, promotion, and tenure; and provide advice to the dean on a range of issues. The degree to which the faculty members are engaged and provide input directly to the dean and the administration varies amongst the schools and is a function of the size of the STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 2 - Leadership, Governance and AdministrationUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore51 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 faculty and the complexity of the organizational structure. For example, one end of the shared governance spectrum is the Carey School of Law, whose faculty is intimately involved, and in some instances exclusively responsible, for governance decisions (e.g., faculty hiring). On the other end of the spectrum is the School of Medicine in which the shared governance structure is much more hierarchical and is based on a robust departmental model that includes teaching, research, and clinical faculty. The School of Medicine Council is the shared governance vehicle and approving body for the School of Medicine. The council membership is constituted of elected representatives from each academic department. The council (and its standing committees) has authority over the educational policy of the school and over policies related to student conduct, academic rank, and appointments. Each school's shared governance model also provides for student input through its own student governance model, which in turn is strongly associated with the University Student Government Association.shared governanC e in sC hoo Ls School of Dentistry Faculty AssemblyFaculty CouncilStudent Dental AssociationCarey School of LawFaculty CouncilStudent Bar AssociationSchool of MedicineMedical School Medical Executive Student CouncilSchool NursingFaculty CouncilExecutive Nursing AssociationSchool of Social WorkFaculty OrganizationStudent Government Association Graduate SchoolGraduate Council (joint with the University of Maryland, Baltimore County) Graduate Student Association sUMMary The University has an administrative structure that encourages accountability and shared governance.

Each executive leader has an extensive combination of academic credentials and professional training, among other qualities appropriate to serving at an institution of higher education. The University also is equipped with adequate information, technical resources, and decision-making systems to support the work of its administrative leaders. adMinistrative s trUCtUre Chief Executive Officer The president of the University, Jay A. Perman, MD, is the institution's chief executive officer and has the primary responsibility for leading the University to achieve its institutional goals. President Perman is a pediatric gastroenterologist and continues to practice medicine through his weekly President's Clinic, where he teaches team-based health care to students of medicine, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, law, and social work. President Perman received a Doctor of Medicine degree with Distinction in 1972 from Northwestern University. Following his residency in pediatrics at Northwestern University Children's Memorial Hospital, he completed a fellowship in pediatric gastroenterology at Harvard Medical School and at the Children's Hospital Medical Center in Boston. From 1977 to 1984, President Perman was an assistant professor and associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. He first came to Baltimore in 1984 to work at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, serving as a professor of pediatrics and head of several divisions. President Perman then was named the Jessie Ball duPont Professor and chair in the Department of Pediatrics at the Virginia Commonwealth University's Medical College of Virginia from 1996 to 1999. President Perman's leadership at UMB marks a return to the campus; he chaired the Department of Pediatrics in the School of Medicine from 1999 to 2004 before leaving to serve as dean and vice president for clinical affairs at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine. He became the president of UMB in July 2010. Named one of Maryland's Most Admired CEOs in 2013 by The Daily Record , President Perman is focused on creating a dynamic University culture. He began this effort by establishing a consistent identity for UMB, its seven schools, and its close clinical partner, the University of Maryland Medical System. He has since inaugurated a number of cross-University groups to build and nurture a cohesive community of students, faculty, and staff, and he has ushered in a series of UMBwide events to spur dialogue on issues of institutional significance. For instance, a yearlong Symposium and White Paper Project has tackled such topics as health care reform, civility, community engagement, interprofessionalism, and cultural competence. He also implemented a Core Values Speaker Series that brings renowned leaders to campus for a conversation on the values that guide UMB's work. President Perman's commitment to community engagement and urban renewal is manifest in his prolific civic service. With Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, President Perman co-chairs the UniverCity Partnership, an effort to redevelop and revitalize Baltimore City's Westside. He chairs the board of directors of the Downtown Partnership, dedicated to creating a vibrant city center. Moreover, he serves on the boards of the Greater Baltimore STANDARD 5: ADMINISTRATIONSTANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 2 - Leadership, Governance and AdministrationUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore53 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 Committee, the Hippodrome Foundation, and Baltimore's Promise, a group committed to advancing the health, safety, and success of the city's youth.

Leadershi P sUPP ort The central administrative units are supported by experienced higher education professional managers. Within their units, these managers account for the key services necessary to support and facilitate the University's complex education, research, and clinical programs. They work with University- and school-based Human Resource Services to ensure that staffing levels are adequate to fulfill UMB's mission. Human Resource Services has policies in place on the recruitment and selection of staff, and UMB strives to hire the best qualified candidates based on an assessment of their education and work experience against available positions and organizational requirements.

The in-person discussions can be wide-ranging and include matters such as efficiency and effectiveness, budgeting, tuition setting, as well as areas for professional growth of the individual and the school/unit managed. In-depth summative reviews also are conducted at appropriate intervals under the University's performance evaluation program policy. The major purposes of the review of chief academic and administrative officers (CAAO) are to enhance leadership effectiveness and provide accountability in ensuring fidelity to the University's vision, mission, and values. Other purposes of the review are to promote a climate of cooperation among faculty and staff and their respective CAAOs; maximize effectiveness of the school/unit's execution of its responsibilities; and provide feedback for performance assessment, continuous improvement, and for making compensation and employment decisions. All other employees are reviewed under the University's annual Performance Development Program (PDP) , in which operational (and if appropriate supervisory) goals are set out and measured as well as competencies such as quality and quantity of work and interpersonal relations. Employees and their supervisors are asked to work together to identify learning goals and appropriate developmental plans. The narrative and ratings of a PDP must be reviewed with each employee and signed by both. Employees who receive a rating of below standard or unsatisfactory are placed on performance improvement plans. The administrative structures and services of the University are formally reviewed each year as part of the annual budgeting process. Each dean and vice president is asked to share information on how his/her unit is organized and ways in which costs are being managed or can be streamlined in light of declining state support. Units also are asked about ways in which they might evolve to create new revenue streams. In addition to reporting to the president about their schools, deans also receive information from the president regarding the costs of the services specific to each school. As a result of feedback and resulting assessment, central administrative budget presentations, beginning with FY16, are open to school leadership and are structured to present services and cost from a customer point of view. The goal is to increase transparency. In addition to the annual budget review process, ongoing efficiency and effectiveness initiatives periodically solicit input from service providers and customers and improvement projects are defined and implemented. The administrative structure of the University continues to evolve in response to assessment and review. For example, the University established, at the vice president level, a chief accountability officer and tasked him with creating a program to ensure that UMB met all federal, state, and USM compliance obligations. In addition, the enterprise risk management and strategic planning processes were elevated to the vice president level. President Perman also created the position of senior vice president/chief academic and research officer (provost) and altered the existing reporting structure of some of the vice presidents so that they are no longer direct reports. The changes allow the president to spend more time on advocacy with the legislature, philanthropy, and working with the chancellor of the University System of Maryland. STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 2 - Leadership, Governance and AdministrationUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore56 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 With regard to administrative services, one example of how feedback has been sought, considered, and changes made in response concerns the creation and function of the Policy Oversight Workgroup (POW) . POW was formed in 2010 to facilitate and support policy development, review, monitoring, approval, and communication, and to develop a new policy website. Prior to POW, campus feedback indicated UMB policies could be difficult to find and were not always up-to-date. It was difficult for the campus community to stay informed about new policies. Relevant experts and stakeholders did not always have a chance to provide policy input. When a policy was broadly applicable, it was difficult for UMB to decide who should be responsible for drafting the policy, or to pinpoint all the affected operational areas, relevant subject matter experts, and stakeholders. POW does not write policy. POW ensures the right representatives and stakeholders write, review, and approve policy; policy work is done in a timely fashion; policy conflicts are resolved expeditiously; and the campus community knows about new policy, and knows how to find policy when it's needed.The balance of POW's work was, and continues to be, policy organization and policy process improvement. POW has developed and published several iterations of the Policy Hierarchy Guide, Policy Number Key, \"POW Workflow\" color-coded flowchart, \"Template for Policy Writing,\" and \"How to Write a Policy - The Quick Narrative.\" sUMMary The University has a fully developed administrative and leadership structure.

Implementation and subsequent evaluation of the success of the strategic plan and resource allocation support the development and change necessary to improve and to maintain institutional quality. deCLaration of CoMPL ianCe To achieve its goals, UMB and its schools engage continuously in strategic planning. The University's strategic planning process is a rigorous and coordinated effort that emphasizes implementation, improvement, and assessment. The specifics of the planning process and associated strategic initiatives, such as resource allocation and institutional renewal, are described below. PLanning UMB's strategic planning takes into account three different contexts. First, UMB engages in strategic planning within the framework of the strategic plans for the entire University System of Maryland (USM) as well as the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) . Both of these comprehensive plans outline broad goals that inform UMB priorities. Second, because of UMB's nature as a collection of graduate and professional schools, the University's strategic plan builds upon the mission, goals, and planning efforts of each school \u2014 which, in turn, are based on many factors including trends in the professions and professional accreditation criteria. Third, each of the professional schools at UMB engages in planning on an ongoing basis, as required by each discipline's professional accrediting agency. Thus, planning at UMB is both a top-down and a bottom-up process.Shortly after the start of his tenure in July 2010, President Perman launched the first comprehensive, widely participatory strategic planning process in UMB's history. Led by the chair of the Department of Surgery in the School of Medicine, and UMB's chief operating officer and vice president, a broadly representative committee of 24 faculty, administrators, and students engaged in a yearlong process of identifying goals and priorities to advance the University's mission. The result, Redefining Collaboration: University of Maryland Strategic Plan 2011-2016 , reflects input from hundreds of faculty, students, staff, and community partners who participated in focus group meetings, town halls, feedback sessions, and surveys. The UMB strategic plan is anchored in broad themes, identified at the outset of the process by deans and University executive leadership. These themes were then further refined by the Strategic Planning Committee . The themes are: 1. Achieve pre-eminence as an innovator 2. Promote diversity and a culture of inclusion3. Foster a culture of accountability and transparency 4. Excel at interdisciplinary research 5. Excel at interprofessional education, clinical care and practice, and public service 6. Develop local and global initiatives that address critical issues 7. Drive economic development 8. Create an enduring and responsible financial model for the University 9. Create a vibrant, dynamic University communitySTANDARD 2: PLANNIN g, R ESOURCE ALLOCATION , AND INSTITUTIONAL RENEWALSTANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 3 - Planning, Resources and AssessmentUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore59 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 Working groups were developed around each theme. These groups conducted research, engaged in focus groups, held town hall meetings, visited other institutions, and conducted surveys \u2014 all to inform the development of the plan. Then, each working group developed goals and tactics related to the plan themes. Deans and executive leadership were kept abreast of the work through regular updates. After goals, tactics, and metrics were developed by the working groups, they were brought to the entire Strategic Planning Committee for ratification. A draft of the plan was shared with the broader UMB community for input and, after adoption by the Strategic Planning Committee, presented to the deans, executive leadership, and ultimately the president for review and approval. Many of UMB's schools also have school- specific strategic plans that are complementary to the UMB strategic plan and reflect the school's mission, strengths, and goals. For the two schools that do not have current strategic plans, the budget, planning, and renewal processes are purposeful, intentional, and timely. As an illustration, within the Graduate School, curriculum review and enrollment planning are done annually at the program level, and major changes to curriculum are approved by the Graduate Council, which is comprised of graduate faculty from both UMB and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). Fiscal planning, including tuition and fees, takes place with participation of the school's leadership in conjunction with the Graduate School dean. Moreover, since the Graduate School does not have a physical plant, and it has no faculty of its own, considerations of physical plant and faculty are not relevant. In addition, the School of Dentistry is firmly engaged in a Strategic Planning Process that will guide the school in accordance with the University's plan for the years ahead. Initially, the dean's leadership team established the school's long-term Vision, Purpose Statement and Values by which it operates. A Core Strategic Planning Group has been established to facilitate the process and the dean's leadership team meets regularly to review progress. A communications plan is in place to keep employees informed of progress with the planning process. Closing the loop In 2013, after completion of the strategic plan, President Perman appointed a Strategic Plan Executive Implementation Committee (EIC) consisting of the deans and a broad representation of other leaders across campus. Members of the EIC were assigned responsibility for tracking implementation of goals through the cited metrics. A \"dashboard\" contains data on the progress toward goals, shared with members of the committee and shared publicly on the Strategic Plan website . The president communicates updates on the strategic plan implementation and data on progress toward goals in the dashboard. In addition, he provides success stories about specific initiatives through the University website and his monthly President's Message newsletter to the University community. Strategic plan success stories provide a forum for the University community and the public to better understand the progress the University is making toward achieving performance measures and goals. Accountability and transparency are priorities of the University leadership, and through open communication, students, faculty, and staff can be involved and informed in the University challenges and success. (A discussion of the strategic plan process is also in Standard 14: Assessment of Student Learning.)STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 3 - Planning, Resources and AssessmentUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore60 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 In January 2016, the strategic process was launched for the 2017-2021 strategic plan . The objective is to produce a plan that will guide the University for the next five fiscal and academic years. In January to mid-March, the University developed new strategic plan themes and high-level goals based on the mission, vision, and core values. Recommendations from the Middle States Self-Study process also were embraced. This stage included deans, vice presidents, and the shared governance councils. From mid-March to mid-May, these themes and goals will be presented in Universitywide feedback sessions. Tactics and plans for achieving these goals also will be drafted during this time. Finally, from mid-May to June, the new strategic plan will be finalized and adopted. resoUrCe aLL oCation As a major research university, the budgeting and financial planning for UMB is complex, involving multiple revenue sources and a wide range of entities with diverse operations and needs. (For a detailed breakdown of revenue sources, see the Financial Resources section in Standard 3: Institutional Resources.) The process of setting UMB's budget involves many layers with the Maryland governor and state government on one end and the schools at the other end. The budgeting process typically extends over several months. It starts each year when the governor submits the state budget to the Maryland General Assembly. Between January and April the budget is debated, testimony is presented, and amendments are made until a balanced budget is adopted by the legislature, typically at the end of the session in April. The governor then allocates to each state agency, including the University System of Maryland (USM) , its budget for the fiscal year. The USM budget office applies an allocation formula and distributes a pro rata share of the budget to each institution, including UMB.UMB's president then has responsibility for determining the allocation of these resources to the central administrative units and the schools. The president makes these determinations through a participatory process involving the deans and senior leadership, who in turn seek advice and counsel from the faculty, staff, and administrators in their respective units. Annually the dean of each school makes a presentation to the president and senior leadership outlining the school's strategic priorities, progress on key metrics, new initiatives and needs, and their alignment with the University's strategic priorities. Similarly, the vice presidents responsible for each major administrative unit present their plans to the president. The allocation of most of UMB's revenue is not discretionary. For example, external support for research must be spent as contracted whereas state appropriations and tuition support existing academic programs. Lastly, mandatory increases in expenditures such as health care costs account for a significant percent of annual budgetary increases. STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 3 - Planning, Resources and Assessment BUDGE t aLLO cat ION FLOW Governor Maryland General Assembly USM UMB SchoolsUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore61 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 The University's working budget for FY 2016 is roughly $1.1 billion. More than half of this is dedicated to research, and another quarter is directed toward instruction and academic support (see chart above). Closing the loop After the initial allocation of funds, the president continues to meet with senior leadership. He meets individually with each dean, with the deans collectively, and with a larger group consisting of both deans and vice presidents. These meetings all occur on a monthly basis. These standing meetings, combined with the initial allocation process, create an environment in which information is freely shared and decisions made with broad input and the development of shared consensus whenever possible. In addition to what might be considered broad, operational base budget allocations, implementation of the strategic plan has resulted in targeted resource allocation closely tied to strategic goals and progress along key metrics. The EIC holds an annual review of each area and theme. Through this review, it determines the allocation of funds in a special projects strategic plan account to help advance key goals in the plan. The funded areas cover a broad cross-section of the strategic plan. As noted above, assessment of implementation of these funds and priorities is done by the EIC. Institutional RenewalUMB's planning and resource allocation demonstrate a commitment to institutional renewal. At the University level, institutional renewal occurs in a broad-based way through the EIC. In this manner, UMB is able to utilize the results of its assessment activities to develop and, where appropriate, make changes to improve and maintain institutional quality. STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 3 - Planning, Resources and Assessment Fy16 - U SES OF FUNDS MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 One illustration of UMB's real-time, real-world application of institutional renewal concerns the strategic plan. In the summer of 2014, midway through the time frame of the plan and in response to increasing constraints on state-level funding for the University, the EIC engaged in a process of reviewing progress on the plan's goals and tactics. A review of the plan's environmental scan was conducted. The plan's goals and tactics were reviewed and it was determined that many of the initiatives and strategies in the plan had begun to be operationalized and should be assigned to specific administrative units to become embedded as ongoing facets of University operations. Though the EIC would continue to monitor and track process on these operational objectives, it would focus its attention on prioritizing and advancing the remaining strategic goals and tactics. Through several rounds of meetings in the late fall of 2014 and early winter of 2015, the EIC prioritized strategic plan goals and tactics and heard reports on process from assigned goal and tactic leaders. This process resulted in recommendations on which among these goals and tactics should be highest priority \u2014 both protected from likely University budget reductions in FY15 and FY16, and supported through reallocation of existing resources where possible. Another instance of the way UMB's strategic planning, resource allocation, and institutional renewal are intertwined is the revitalization of the University's legacy of community engagement. Since the adoption of the strategic plan, UMB has brought about better cohesion and coordination of its many disparate community engagement initiatives to maximize their collective impact. In 2013, President Perman created the Center for Community-Based Engagement and Learning to better coordinate faculty scholarship and service learning that improves the health and welfare of UMB's neighbors. The center has undertaken such initiatives as mapping UMB's extensive service-learning activities to enhance collaboration; coordinating violence prevention initiatives with the Baltimore City Health Department; and mentoring student groups involved in community engagement. Each year, the center supplies grants for community engaged faculty projects, and its Faculty Fellows Program has developed a network of faculty, staff, and students committed to advancing social justice by sustaining close working partnerships with West Baltimore residents and organizations. In 2014, President Perman established the Office of Community Engagement to coordinate UMB's abundant school-led, student-led, and employee-led outreach; to more aggressively move the needle on community health, wealth, and social indicators; and to hold the University accountable for doing so. sUMMary The University engages in strategic planning that is anchored in broad themes and builds upon its mission and goals, and the planning efforts of its constituent schools. Its resource allocation process is complex but fair, and its planning and resource allocation demonstrate a commitment to institutional renewal. Therefore, the University is in compliance with Standard 2: Planning, Resource Allocation, and Institutional Renewal.STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 3 - Planning, Resources and AssessmentUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore63 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 Stat EMEN t OF t HE Sta NDaRD The human, financial, technical, physical facilities, and other resources necessary to achieve an institution's mission and goals are available and accessible. In the context of the institution's mission, the effective and efficient uses of the institution's resources are analyzed as part of ongoing outcomes assessment. DEcL aRatION OF cOMPLI aNcE UMB has sufficient human, financial, technical, and physical facilities to support its mission to improve the human condition and serve the public good of Maryland and society at-large through education, research, clinical care, and service. The adequacy and effectiveness of these resources are assessed through the University's comprehensive and integrated strategic planning process. To effectively support the University's operations, the University employs staff in a variety of categories. The majority of staff (76 percent), however, are employed by the HUM aN RESOUR cES There are sufficient faculty, staff, and administration to support the University's institutional mission and goals. As of fall 2015, UMB employed 3,945 staff and 2,721 faculty (for a detailed analysis of faculty, please see Standard 10: Faculty). The School of Medicine and central administration employ the largest percentage of staff members (47 percent and 29 percent of all staff members, respectively), while the Carey School of Law employs the least (3 percent of all staff members) (see table below). Due to the nature of the Graduate School, its employees are counted either within the other schools or within central administration.

One of the fundamental planning concepts UMB utilizes is a broad and inclusive approach that is representative of the thoughts and input of the entire University community. The whole University benefits from working in an environment that brings together people from diverse backgrounds, and equal employment opportunity is essential to achieving that diversity. Each year, UMB prepares an Affirmative Action Plan that assists it in developing a representative workforce. The plan focuses on UMB's effectiveness to achieve a workforce that is more diverse, and highlights areas where it needs to increase its emphasis. According to UMB's most recent (2014-2015) Affirmative Action Plan, the University employment of under-represented minorities (including women) in each of the federally defined categories was higher than the regional availability of minorities in those categories, with the exception of Hispanics, which was 2.2 percent below the regional availability.

In the FY 2016 working budget, these sources provided the University with roughly $1.1 billion of support. Grants and contracts were the largest single source of funding, accounting for more than a third of the University's funds (see chart below). Fy16 - S OUR cES OF FUNDS Total: $1,084,530,4863.6% Auxiliary and INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 3 - Planning, Resources and AssessmentUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore66 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 The University's faculty generated almost $393 million in external grants and contracts revenue in FY 2016. The value of these funds extends beyond the financial because they also represent the primary mechanism by which new knowledge is generated. However, unlike other sources of funding, grants and contracts are restricted in nature and cannot be used to address the basic funding needs of campus. State-appropriated funds, or general funds, are important \u2014 not only to the University's continued growth and development, but also to the state's economic and social health and development. In FY 2016, the University's state appropriation of $215 million provided roughly 20 percent of its financial support. The support from clinical services is reflected under physician and dental service plans and contracts. The hospital contract includes the annual contract with the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC). UMB and UMMC cooperate in the planning and administration of health professions academic programs at UMB and UMMC, including both clinical education and clinical research, and the graduate medical education programs sponsored by UMMC including University of Maryland Medical Center Midtown Health. Both of these funding sources are important to the clinical education and research missions of the University. Tuition and fees are also a key source of funding. Due to the fact that the majority of its students are graduate and professional students, UMB did not benefit from the prior governor's \"enrollment initiative\" that provided state support in lieu of tuition increases for undergraduate in-state students over a number of successive years. Nonetheless, the University works diligently during each year's budgeting cycle to diminish, where possible, the need to increase tuition and fees as a way to supplement shortfalls. A student fee committee exists to give advice and counsel with regard to fee increases and each dean is called upon to explain the need for any proposed tuition increase. Decisions regarding increases also are made with an eye toward ways to supplement available financial aid. University and school-level financial resources are assessed and allocated as part of the annual budgeting process, which also includes three- year financial projections. The University's financial statements are audited as part of the consolidated statements for the University System of Maryland (USM). In addition to the annual financial statement audit, USM internal auditors review specific financial and operational compliance areas each year . Any issues identified are remedied, and a review audit is usually conducted within six months. Finally, on a periodic basis, the University undergoes a comprehensive audit from the Maryland Office of Legislative Audits . teChni CaL resoUrCes The Center for Information Technology Services (CITS) is the central information technology organization for the University, and it develops and maintains mission-critical enterprise systems and technologies including those that support human resources, payroll, finance, students, email, research, teaching/learning management, as well as the network infrastructure, web, and telecommunications. CITS is led by the chief information officer and vice president for information technology, who reports directly to President Perman.

These policies have been developed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of University data. PhysiCa L faCiLities The University has almost 7.5 million gross square feet of space in 67 facilities located on its downtown campus, and it occupies an additional 468,000 gross square feet in non-University facilities near the campus. The University's Facilities Master Plan ensures that the University possesses and maintains the physical facilities necessary for institutional excellence. Within the past 10 years, the University has constructed new buildings for the School of Pharmacy, School of Dentistry, and School of Medicine as well as a new Campus Center and student housing. The largest current construction project is the Health Sciences Facility III, a 428,970-square- foot research facility that will be completed in September 2017.

This process considers campus infrastructure, impact of the University on neighboring communities, needs of adjacent partner institutions, streetscaping, open space, pedestrian and vehicular movement through the campus, historic resources, facilities renewal, and sustainability. Also considered are the development needs of UMB's affiliated institution, the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC). Additionally, campus spaces are reviewed each year with respect to state guidelines for academic facilities. The review is based on enrollment, weekly student contact hours in classrooms and teaching laboratories, the number of faculty and staff, number of library volumes, and other relevant space data. This review looks not only at current space allocation but also at future space needs. The next Facilities Master Plan process has just begun and the names of the co-chairs were recently released. The next plan will guide the physical development of the University for the next 10 years. resear Ch faCiLities The University maintains a robust system of research-oriented resources and facilities. UMB has 33 interdisciplinary research centers and institutes, including the Institute for Human Virology , Institute for Genome Sciences, Center for Pain Studies , Center on Drugs and Drug Policy and more. The Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute provides an infrastructure to facilitate the translation of fundamental science to patient care and to the community. Additionally, the Office of Research and Development furthers research and economic development by providing high-quality service to investigators, fostering new research and clinical initiatives with industry, and promoting translational discoveries into public benefit. Most recently, the Office of Technology Transfer , through its UM Ventures Team, launched a program to help accelerate promising, but early stage UMB technologies through the commercialization process. UMB has already doubled the number of startups launched in FY16 than were launched, annually, in the prior five years. All UMB research is conducted under the watchful eye of UMB's Office of Accountability and Compliance , which contains both the Conflict of Interest and the Research Integrity units. (See Standard 6: Integrity.) The Health Sciences and Human Services Library (HS/HSL) and the Thurgood Marshall Law Library provide the expertise, resources, services, and facilities that are essential to achieve UMB's strategic priorities. The Priddy Library at the Universities at Shady Grove also serves UMB students. The libraries advance faculty success throughout the research life cycle, from idea exploration through dissemination of results. Space for collaborative work, interdisciplinary teaching and learning, and scholarship are provided at the libraries. Through the support of the MPower initiative, the libraries at UMB and University of Maryland, College Park are expanding shared knowledge resources to encourage collaborative learning and discovery between the campuses. sUMMary The University maintains the institutional resources necessary to achieve its mission and goals.

These measures are updated and augmented as needed based on assessment data. drivers for i nstitUtionaL assessM ent As a public state institution, UMB's institutional assessment philosophy and program is significantly influenced and shaped by drivers at the state, University system, and University levels. To be sure, much of the assessment that UMB engages in is mandated, particularly at the state level. However, instead of approaching its assessment and reporting under these programs as simply a compliance activity, UMB has adopted a holistic institutional assessment model that (a) is responsive and accountable to its stakeholders, (b) advances the University's mission and vision, and (c) utilizes the assessment data and information to evaluate the effectiveness of its programs, both at the macro and micro levels, and to improve the effectiveness of its programs while meeting its reporting obligations to its stakeholders. state i nfLU enCed a ssess Ment As a public institution, UMB's ability to meet the needs of the state, region, and nation are dependent upon alignment of its institutional goals with that of the state. The University's measure of how well it is supporting and assisting Maryland in achieving the state's priorities, as well as how effectively and responsibly it is administering the state's investment in UMB, is captured in three major assessment programs: Managing for Results, Performance Accountability Reports, and its Peer-Based Assessment program. Managing for r esULts Managing for Results (MFR) is a statewide strategic planning process in which state agencies craft mission and vision statements and identify key goals supported by measurable objectives. It is a tool for state agency strategic planning, performance measurement, and budgeting that emphasizes the use of resources to achieve measurable results, accountability, efficiency, and continuous improvement in state government programs. The standards for the assessment plan are established by state law and administered by the state of Maryland's Department of Budget and Management (DBM). DBM has established the format for agency submissions and has general authority to review and approve the components of the plan. Each year, UMB submits its MFR plan to DBM together with its budget request. The Maryland General Assembly also monitors the development of the plan during the legislative session, and legislators and staff provide additional suggestions. In 2015, UMB's MFR was revised from the ground up. Objectives were recast in the time frame of five years, through FY 2019. Attainment of the objectives is evaluated through the annual reporting of performance measures, which are the data elements specified in the MFR plan. Each goal in the MFR is defined by two or three objectives. Progress toward attaining these objectives is measured by one or more indicators. The following table details each of the goals in UMB's Managing for Results program along with the objectives and performance measures associated with each goal.STANDARD 7: INSTITUTIONAL ASSESSMENTSTANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 3 - Planning, Resources and AssessmentUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore71 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 MFR PROGR aM 1.STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 3 - Planning, Resources and Assessment Goal 1.

PerforM anCe aCC oUntaBiLity re Port The University submits to the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) a Performance Accountability Report (PAR) . The purpose of the PAR is to provide an opportunity for the state, the commission, the Board of Regents, and other stakeholders to review and evaluate UMB's efforts in fulfilling its missions and advancing the goals of the state. The commitment of Maryland's public colleges and universities to this process is demonstrated by their ongoing efforts to provide detailed and high-quality reports to the commission each year. The 2014 PAR is the 19th accountability report submitted to the commission. It includes the following: 1) an overview of the accountability process; 2) observations about institutional performance on key statistical indicators, such as affordability, achievement gaps, and degree progression and completion; 3) an analysis of key issues not currently being addressed by the accountability process; and 4) institutional responses to the commission's questions about indicators submitted in the 2013 PAR. MHEC has responsibility for approving the plan and presenting recommendations to the governor and the state legislature. The MHEC process looks at performance retrospectively rather than prospectively, to assess progress toward a benchmark. University of Maryland, Baltimore75 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 3 - Planning, Resources and Assessment MHEC examines four years of trend data and benchmarks on each indicator. Its analyses employ data for the four most recently completed years, while the MFR analyses uses the two previous years and projections of two future years. Institutions are expected to make progress toward achieving their accountability benchmarks. In 2014, for example, UMB was asked to comment on the University's progress toward Objective 1.1 - By fiscal year 2012 demonstrate the quality and pre-eminence of all UMB professional schools by achieving Top 10 status among public schools. Specifically MHEC noted: In the most recent rankings in 2012, the School of Pharmacy saw its rank decline from a tie for 9th place to 17th place. The School of Social Work saw its rank improve from 18th to 16th, and while any improvement is commendable, the school's rank is still below the benchmark established by the University. Please discuss the University's strategies for improving performance for Pharmacy and Social Work on this indicator. The University replied as follows: Rankings reported by U.S. News & World Report for schools of pharmacy and social work are based solely on the results of peer assessment surveys sent to deans, other administrators, and/or faculty at schools in each of these disciplines. Respondents rate their own perceptions of the academic quality of programs on a five-point scale. Schools are ranked on the basis of the highest average scores. As such, there is no direct relationship between specific data points involving research awards, admission profiles, or licensing exam pass rates to these rankings, unlike the methodology U.S. News & World Report applies for medical and law school rankings. The above example illustrates that UMB is indeed held accountable by MHEC if the commission perceives that the University's performance is below its benchmarks. In such an instance, the institution must submit a report to MHEC identifying actions that it will take to improve performance. As with the MFR assessment program discussed above, UMB utilizes its established accountability and planning activities to close the loop on the PAR assessment program to assure that it is achieving its benchmarks and when necessary to address any concerns raised by MHEC. Peer-Based a ssessM ents Although the University's mix of professional schools makes it unique among public academic health centers, in 2014 MHEC designated 21 public institutions as peers for the purpose of performing competitor state funding calculations, as recommended by the 2008 Commission to Develop the Maryland Model for Funding Higher Education . In 2015, UMB selected 10 institutions from within this group as its performance peers, pending approval by MHEC: The Ohio State University University at Buffalo, SUNY University of California, Los Angeles University of California, San Francisco University of Cincinnati University of Minnesota, Twin Cities University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill University of Pittsburgh University of Virginia University of Washington, Seattle The 10 institutions selected as performance peers represent a diverse mix of institutions across eight of the competitor states identified by the commission. All have a school of medicine and at least two additional professional schools corresponding to similar schools at UMB. In addition, to recognize UMB's emphasis on research, comparable peer institutions have a significant level of expenditures in the medical sciences. In the peer assessment process, UMB performance and state funding are compared with the performance and state funding of these peer institutions. It should be noted, however, University of Maryland, Baltimore76 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 3 - Planning, Resources and Assessment that comparing individual professional schools presents difficulties because the sources of revenue are very different. There is a significant data collection problem as well because professional schools are reluctant to share such data as passing rates on licensure examinations. UsM inf LUenCed assessM ent The mission of the University System of Maryland (USM) is to improve the quality of life for the people of Maryland by providing a comprehensive range of high-quality, accessible, and affordable educational opportunities; engaging in research and scholarship that expand the boundaries of current knowledge; and providing knowledge-based programs and services that are responsive to the needs of the citizens of the state and the nation.

The regents oversee the system's academic, administrative, and financial operations; formulate policy; and appoint the USM chancellor and the presidents at each of the system's institutions. USM's programs and activities have a significant impact on the quality of life in Maryland, creating social and economic benefits for people throughout the state and beyond. To assure that it fulfills its mission, USM has adopted a number of assessment programs against which the effective and efficient management of the resources allocated to each of its component institutions are assessed. These USM-influenced assessment programs are the USM Dashboard Indicators, Faculty Workload Assessment, and the Presidential Assessment programs. UsM dash Board i ndiCators The USM Board of Regents maintains a uniform set of \" dashboards \" or key indicators to highlight specific trends and identify challenges faced by each USM institution. The Dashboard Indicators (DBIs) provide a \"snapshot\" overview of the USM and its institutions. It brings together data from many USM reports and data sets, and is primarily used by the Board of Regents to identify areas for additional scrutiny by the board. As such, the DBIs provide a gateway to most of the areas of University operation and \"red\" lights will result in board follow-up and, on occasion, requests for plans for corrective action. Additionally, designation of new Dashboard Indicators is used by the regents as a method of focusing institutional leadership on areas for additional focus. Overall, there are 29 universal indicators in the areas of student access, affordability and attainment, faculty, economic and workforce development, stewardship, and effectiveness and efficiency. Due to the differing mission of USM institutions, not all universal dashboard indicators are reported for each institution. The universal dashboards (see following page) reported for UMB are primarily in the areas of economic and workforce development and stewardship. In the most recent report presented to the Board of Regents, performance improved on nine out of 10 universal dashboard indicators. Each benchmark, or basis of comparison, is derived from peers, Board of Regents policy, national standards, state policy, or an institutional goal established in the corresponding Managing for Results document. The 10 universal dashboards reported by UMB are supplemented by 16 additional institution- specific indicators that relate to performance in areas more closely representing UMB's mission. These indicators include passing rates on various professional licensing exams, graduate student diversity, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding awards, U.S. News & World Report rankings, research expenditures in medicine, and the number of professional practice degrees awarded in several disciplines. In the most recent report presented to the Board of Regents, UMB's performance improved on nine out of 16 institution-specific indicators.

During these presentations progress and deficiencies are highlighted and strategies are developed to both bolster performance and address concerns. The operationalization of these strategies occurs within the appropriate units at the University. The leaders of these units (i.e., deans and vice presidents) are ultimately accountable to the president for executing the plans. This process is yet another manifestation of UMB's ongoing commitment to closing the loop on its assessment programs \u2014 i.e., using information and data to routinely evaluate its performance against stated goals and objectives, while providing feedback and direction to internal constituents on areas in which improvement in performance is required.faCULty w ork Load a ssessM ent The workload of faculty within University System of Maryland institutions is governed by a series of policies overseen by the USM Board of Regents and designed to ensure maximum accountability while providing individual institutions high levels of flexibility to deploy faculty in the most effective and efficient way possible. Within this policy framework UMB applies a set of standards appropriate for its professional schools. In the aggregate, 95 percent of UMB faculty met or exceeded these standard teaching loads for the 2014-2015 academic year, consistent with attainment for previous years. More than half of faculty exempted from teaching the standard load did so to pursue opportunities for externally funded or department-supported research and service. The following table summarizes UMB's assessment of the workload of its faculty for the most current reporting period.University of Maryland, Baltimore78 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 3 - Planning, Resources and Assessment FaLL 2014 - S PRING 2015 R EPOR t ON Fac ULty tE acHING W ORKLO aD Type of Faculty Headcount Faculty FTEF (line 2 < line 1)State-Supported FTEF (Optional) (line 3 < line 2) Number of Faculty who taught standard load Number of Faculty who taught more than standard load Number of Faculty exempted from teaching standard load by type of exception: Instruction- related Departmental administration Externally funded research and service Department- supported research Department- supported service - profession Department- supported service - internal Department- supported service - public Sabbatical Contractual / Illness / Other Faculty in line 17 who did not engage in credit activity Line 1 2 3 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Full-Time Non-Ten/ Non-Track Research Faculty 326 326 306 0 20 0 0 18 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 Other Faculty 1,189 n/a Teaching Assist. 33 n/a School Total (excl.

Information derived from these non-instructional productivity data are used by state agencies to hold the University accountable through both the Managing for Results process, coordinated by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) , and the Performance Accountability process, coordinated by the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC). The volume of scholarly works contributed by full-time UMB faculty, consisting of books, refereed and non-refereed works, papers and creative activities, is slightly above the level reported last year. The number of days each faculty member spends in public service continues to be more than 10 days per faculty member. Based on $499.6 million of grant and contract awards, the average grant and contract amount received by each full-time equivalent faculty member was $276,196 for fiscal year 2015, on par with the average amount for the previous year.

Presidentia L assessM ent The chancellor evaluates the president at each USM institution on an annual basis. As part of the evaluation process, each president works with his or her leadership team to develop a set of goals that are congruent with those of the state, the University system, and his or her institution. Once developed, these goals are presented to the chancellor, discussed, revised as necessary, and then adopted. UMB's presidential goals for the 2015-2016 academic year are organized around the following priorities: Collaboration People of Baltimore/Anchor Institution People of the State UMB Students Strategic Planning and Institutional Leadership Effectiveness and Efficiency UMB Fundraising Each priority has one or more clearly articulated goals. Associated with each goal are a set of strategies and success measures against which the president is assessed and evaluated. The following table summarizes the priorities, goals, and strategies for which the president is accountable. PRESIDEN tIaL GOaLS SUMM aRy Priority Goal Strategy \"Collaboration\" \"People of Baltimore/ Anchor Institution\" 1. Expand and strengthen MPowering the State (MTS). UMB's highest priority \"collaboration\" goal is to expand our MTS initiative with the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). Because educational and research programs at UMB and UMCP are highly complementary, this creates opportunities for new funding sources where neither university is competitive alone but together are highly competitive. 2. Strengthen and enhance UMB's collaboration with UMBC. 3. Strengthen UMB's collaboration with other Maryland institutions to expand health care and social justice-related educational programs. 1. Enhance the capacity of the newly formed Office of Community Engagement in the Office of the President to build a comprehensive and coordinated community engagement strategy for the University. 2.

Continue to develop a culture of giving at UMB that supports the strategic needs of the University and its schools.STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 3 - Planning, Resources and Assessment The assessment process for assuring that the president in on track for achieving each goal is overseen by UMB's chief accountability officer (CAO). The CAO meets with the president and the chief academic and research officer (provost) as soon as the goals are approved by the chancellor to determine which member of the executive leadership will be responsible for stewarding each goal over the course of the evaluation period. Once those determinations have been made, the CAO communicates that information to the leadership team and implements a quarterly reporting framework to monitor and evaluate progress toward achieving each goal. As with the other dimensions of UMB's institutional assessment program, where concerns are noted during the reporting period discussion with the key stakeholders are conducted and corrective strategies are developed and approved by the president. The following table summarizes the midyear progress report submitted to the chancellor in January 2016. statistiCa L sUMM ary of Midyear Progress r ePort Total Number of Priorities 7 Total Number of Goals 10 Total Number of Strategies 16 Total Number of Success Measures 60 Completed 14 (23%) Substantially Completed 11 (18%) Partially Completed 33 (55%) No Progress 2 (4%)University of Maryland, Baltimore83 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 3 - Planning, Resources and Assessment In addition to the annual assessment of the president, a five-year evaluation review as required by the USM Board of Regents also is conducted. The most recent review was held on campus on June 10 and 11, 2015. The evaluation team consisted of three other leaders in higher education: Stephen Klasko, president and CEO of Thomas Jefferson University and Jefferson Health; Joseph Steinmetz, executive vice president and provost at the Ohio State University; and Lorris Betz, former senior vice president for health at the University of Utah and CEO of the University of Utah Health System. The team was extremely complimentary of President Perman's ability to balance the complexities of management, especially with the University of Maryland Medical System, and his commitment to interprofessional collaborations. The report noted the collaboration in research activities among the schools. It also noted his ability to draw a balance between decentralized operations at the schools and appropriate central oversight. (See Standard 4: Leadership and Governance.) In the course of assuring that UMB's president is effective and excelling as a leader, the assessment of the president's performance affords the University another essential opportunity to evaluate institutional effectiveness, albeit in the context of the president's performance. The fact is, however, the president's goals are UMB's goals and as such the University has deliberately adopted the presidential assessment program as another important dimension in its multi-pronged approach to evaluating institutional effectiveness. UMB infLU enCed assess Ment The University recognizes the need to assure all stakeholders that as an institution of higher learning UMB is committed to student success. We also recognize that student success cannot be realized without deliberate and sustained commitment to institutional effectiveness. Accordingly, UMB has in place a robust internal assessment program that evaluates and supports the implementation of its strategic plan; its budgeting, capital planning, and facilities renewal processes; identifies and manages institutional risks, monitors each of its schools' accreditation processes; and evaluates the effectiveness of the University's executive leaders. strategi C PLan iMPL eMentation a ssessM ent The University engaged in a comprehensive strategic planning process that led to the development of specific goals and tactics to be implemented to advance its mission. Each tactic identified was subject to measure by specific metrics and milestones. These metrics and milestones are tracked by the Strategic Plan Executive Implementation Committee (EIC) , which is a broadly representative committee of deans and other faculty and staff. Goals and tactics are revised \u2014 both augmented and, where appropriate, abandoned \u2014 through annual reporting processes, followed by analysis, review, and recommendation by the EIC. President Perman regularly reports progress on the strategic plan through his President's Message newsletter \u2014 indeed, the existence of the newsletter is a direct result of the strategic planning process as is the President's State of the University Address . Another success, thanks to the work group overseeing the theme \"create an enduring and responsible financial model for the University,\" is the creation of a \" Procedure Library \" to simplify the search for routine business processes. This initiative has far more impact than just making information available online. It serves to ensure uniformity across the University, address compliance issues, and increase UMB's institutional effectiveness and efficiencies. It also will serve to foster UMB's core values of accountability, civility, collaboration, diversity, excellence, knowledge, and leadership. University of Maryland, Baltimore84 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 3 - Planning, Resources and Assessment Given that Redefining Collaboration: University of Maryland Strategic Plan 2011-2016 was the first comprehensive, broadly participatory strategic plan in UMB's history, it has served UMB well as a framework around which other state-mandated and internal assessment processes can be aligned. In January 2016, the strategic process was launched for the 2017-2021 strategic plan . The objective is to produce a plan that will guide the University for the next five fiscal and academic years. In January to mid-March, the University developed new strategic plan themes and high-level goals based on the mission, vision, and core values. Recommendations from the Middle States Self-Study process also were embraced. This stage included deans, vice presidents, and the shared governance councils. From mid-March to mid-May, these themes and goals will be presented in Universitywide feedback sessions. Tactics and plans for achieving these goals also will be drafted during this time. Finally, from mid-May to June, the new strategic plan will be finalized and adopted. Adopting the new strategic plan is just the first step in a larger cycle of implementation. The next step involves action planning, in which unit leaders develop milestones and success measures related to University strategic priorities and vision. These plans will be approved by the deans and vice presidents. Next, administrative academic units will implement the plan. The final step is accountability, which will be accomplished through annual and quarterly reports to the vice presidents and deans throughout the life cycle of the strategic plan. This reporting will close the loop, ensuring that the themes and goals developed by the University are carried to completion. The following is the proposed implementation and accountability framework of the next strategic plan currently under consideration by UMB's leadership team. 12ACTION PLANNING Unit Leaders Develop Milestones and Success Measures Related to University Strategic Priorities and Vision Vice Presidents and Deans Approve Action Plans 4ACCOUNTABILITYSTRATEGIC PLANNING IMPLEMENTATION FY 2017 - 2021Vice Presidents and Deans Refine and Approve Strategic Themes and GoalsADOPTION 3IMPLEMENTATION Administrative and Academic Units Complete the Work of the PlanAnnual and Quarterly Reports are Presented to Vice Presidents and Deans Between FY 2017 and FY 2021University Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 3 - Planning, Resources and Assessment BUsiness and f aCiLities oPerations a ssessM ent While institutional assessment is conducted at all levels, three offices - the Office of Institutional Research and Accountability , the Office of Budget and Financial Analysis , and the Office of Capital Budget and Planning - provide information and analysis to inform ongoing University decision-making. The Office of Institutional Research and Accountability (OIRA) supports individuals and groups who make policies and decisions affecting UMB by collecting and supplying verifiable data and information, conducting policy analysis, coordinating campus assessment and evaluation activities, and facilitating planning efforts. Because of the diverse nature of programs at UMB, the primary responsibility for assessment belongs to each individual school. The OIRA provides support for the assessment function by collecting and maintaining and verifying the accuracy of institutional data and disseminating this information as needed. Additionally, each year OIRA performs extensive analyses of the data collected on performance and reports the results to USM. These analyses are then used within UMB to identify problems or areas of weakness, and strategies are developed to improve performance (for example, see \" Enterprise Risk Management \" below). The data generated are reported as part of the MFR and in other reports submitted to USM after review by the appropriate leadership constituent within UMB. The OIRA also supplies data to regulatory agencies, such as IPEDS, and various publications, such as U.S. News & World Report . Participation in the data collections and surveys administered by the various publications allows UMB to compare itself to other participating institutions based on the included measures. Many of the reports produced by the OIRA may be found on its website. The Office of Budget and Financial Analysis supports academic and other University units in achieving their business goals by maintaining and providing financial information and services. The office develops the University's budget plans and submissions to USM, provides accurate and timely financial information to the state, is a source of financial expertise for internal offices, and adheres to the highest standards of financial accountability. In addition, the Office of Capital Budget and Planning is responsible for the preparation of the capital budget and its management as well as for the USM-funded construction and capital facilities renewal programs. This office also provides planning support to the campus community on matters related to space, facilities, and historic preservation; the development, updating, and implementation of the Facilities Master Plan ; design guidelines; the historic preservation plan; and other planning documents. The University routinely performs a detailed assessment of the condition of the campus buildings as well as the campuswide infrastructure. The most recent assessment was completed in 2015. The total estimated deferred maintenance/facilities renewal backlog was estimated to be more than $300 million. A separate independent assessment by an outside consultant, VFA, estimated the backlog at $400 million. From the assessments, an Infrastructure Investment Plan was developed with a planning horizon of 10 years. The plan details the condition of the various central campuswide infrastructure and specific building components such as electrical systems, mechanical systems, structure, and elevators, estimates a current day cost for repair or replacement for each item, establishes priorities by building component, and proposes a strategy for funding the needed work over a 10-year period. The funding strategy recommends addressing the deferred maintenance backlog using a variety of sources including the State's Capital Improvement Program , UMB operating funds, and philanthropy. A summary of the facilities renewal plan that was developed on account of the assessment is provided below.University of Maryland, Baltimore86 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 FacILItIES RENEW aL PL aN Priority Goal Strategy Total Investment $309m$6.7m $2.7m $10m$67m $27m in FY 2015 for facilities maintenance projects was $6.7m. This level of funding must be maintained, or enhanced, in the future. Maintain or increase campus access to capital facilities renewal funds through the Capital Improvement Program (CIP). Add a recurring capital appropriation to the 10-year CIP for deferred maintenance. Seek funding for infrastructure improvements as part of the School of Social Work and School of Nursing projects included in the 10-year CIP request. Secure State Capital Funding for campuswide electrical infrastructure upgrade and new substation. Seek donor funds for Davidge Hall and other historic structures projects.STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 3 - Planning, Resources and Assessment Implementation of this funding strategy has begun. The UMB leadership has endorsed the need to invest in the University's existing built environment by making funding for deferred maintenance projects a high priority. State capital funding for a new electric substation and upgrading of the electrical infrastructure was requested in the FY 2017 budget. The governor included this request in the state's Capital Improvement Program with first-year funding anticipated in July 2016. Further, the Office of Facilities Management maintains an ongoing five-year Deferred Maintenance (DM) Funding Plan using operating and capital facilities renewal funds to complete priorities identified in the Infrastructure Investment Plan . As an example, the FY 2017 DM includes the following projects: Medical School Teaching Facility Animal Facility HVAC system design - $192,000 108 N. Greene Building chillers and towers replacement - $1,800,000 Health Sciences Facility I generator enclosure replacement - $240,000 Bressler Building roof replacement - $600,000 Howard Hall roof replacement and shed removal design - $100,000 Bressler Building exterior fa\u00e7ade upgrades, phase 1 - $840,000 Health Sciences and Human Services Library cooling tower replacement - $1,440,000 School of Pharmacy piping riser replacement design - $360,000 School of Pharmacy south roof replacement - $600,000 737 W.

This includes ensuring that the University understands and manages the risks inherent in its activities and that it includes a balanced risk-reward analysis in evaluating potential opportunities available to it. It is with this attention to risk mitigation that President Perman launched the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) initiative. ERM is a holistic approach to risk management that provides a framework for entitywide risk identification, for prioritization of key exposures, development of operational responses to potentially adverse events and outcomes based on a foundation of accountability and transparency. The University believes that understanding and effectively managing risks that impact its operations is critical to continued success. The ERM initiative is led by the chief accountability officer, who, working with other key individuals, has developed the structure and process of the program, which the University is currently in the process of implementing. The ERM structure includes a representative 16-person Enterprise Risk Management Steering Committee and 12 Subject Area Workgroups (SAW ) . These 12 SAWs are: Academic Affairs Campus Security and Public Safety Clinical Practice External and Internal Relations Facilities, EHS, and Campus Operations Finance and Internal Controls Global Activities Government Regulatory/Compliance Human Resources IT Systems and Communication Research Risk Management and Insurance. Through ERM, the University has been able to identify potential problem areas through the inquiry and assessment process; and prioritize and work to avert them. For example, ERM determined that the University would be at risk in the case of a riot or civil disturbance. As a result, a mitigation plan was enacted, including purchasing protective gear and incorporating crowd control training into the UMB police annual training schedule. Given the events of April 2015, this action was quite prudent. Another example concerned the need to preserve the student records that were stored, somewhat precariously, on a single server dating from the time of the first, homegrown, campuswide electronic student database. Now all the records from that time period have been preserved and adequately stored. sChooL -Based aCC reditation, assessM ent, and r eview In addition to the accountability, planning, and risk management processes discussed above, the president, the deans, and other senior leadership continue to rely on the assessments and recommendations made in professional accreditation reports to stimulate improvements in all aspects of the schools' operations and to measure progress. In assessing institutional effectiveness as it relates to student learning, UMB ensures that it has clearly articulated learning outcomes to guide its programs. UMB is uniquely positioned as an institution with a primary focus on professional and graduate education. Thus, in terms of \"institutional effectiveness\" as it relates to Standard 7: Institutional Assessment, there is a broad focus on achieving and maintaining accreditation for each of the professional degree programs. Each professional school at UMB is currently accredited by its professional licensing University of Maryland, Baltimore88 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS INSTITUTIONAL CONTE xT AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 3 - Planning, Resources and Assessment and review agency as noted in the chart in Standard 11: Educational Offerings. This process ensures that each school maintains standards requisite for its graduates to gain admission to other reputable institutions of higher learning or to achieve credentials for professional practice. The goal is to certify that the education provided meets acceptable levels of quality. Each accrediting organization establishes operating standards for professional institutions and programs and determines the extent to which the standards are met. The University's president as well as its chief academic and research officer (provost) meet with members of each school's accreditation team during the site visit, and receive and review the teams' final reports with the respective dean to address areas for improvement. The Graduate School does not have an associated accrediting body. Instead, its programs undergo a process of program review. (See Standard 11: Educational Offerings.) For example, UMB's programs in biomedical, health, and human service sciences are scrutinized in accordance with the USM Guidelines for External Review of Existing Academic Programs . The purpose of external review is to garner additional perspectives on program strengths and weaknesses from academics and professionals in the field or a closely related field who are affiliated with other institutions. A key deliverable from each external review is a report that explicitly identifies program strengths and suggests improvements. Some of the additional ways UMB's assessment of its academic units and programs is operationalized at the institutional level include the review and approval by senior central administrators of key academic processes: faculty appointment, promotion, and tenure; human subjects research protocols and projects; sabbatical leave requests; minority recruitment; faculty recruitment plans; and central oversight of research compliance and management of conflict of interest.exeCUtive Leadershi P assess Ment Just as the president is responsible to the chancellor and the Board of Regents, the deans and vice presidents are responsible to the president and undergo decanal and vice presidential review. President Perman, consistent with UMB's Policy on Review of Chief Academic/Administrative Officers of the University , reviews the chief academic and administrative officers to enhance leadership effectiveness and provide accountability in ensuring fidelity to the University's vision, mission, and values. For example, over the past 12 months, President Perman has evaluated James L. Hughes, MBA, chief enterprise and economic development officer; Peter Murray, PhD, chief information technology officer; and Richard P. Barth, PhD, MSW, dean of the School of Social Work. In each case the review consisted of a self-assessment and confidential evaluations by each executive's direct reports and others with whom the person works closely. In the case of Dean Barth, this was a cross-section of faculty, staff, peers, students, and members of the school's board of advisors. The IDEA Center, a nonprofit organization that provides online assessment and feedback tools for higher education institutions, administered the evaluation. President Perman reported Dean Barth's results to the School of Social Work community, noting that an overwhelming majority of evaluators believe that Dean Barth has provided excellent leadership for the school. A similar level of transparent disclosure was instituted for vice presidents, beginning with Dr. Murray's review. sUMMary The University has extensive and comprehensive systems in place to assess its institutional effectiveness and to use assessment data to improve its operations. Therefore, the University is in compliance with Standard 7: Institutional Assessment.University of Maryland, Baltimore89 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 CHAPTER 4 Student Admissions and Support Standard 8 - Student Admissions and Retention Standard 9 - Student Support Services CHAPTER 5 Faculty Standard 10 - Faculty CHAPTER 6 Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment Standard 11 - Educational Offerings Standard 12 - General Education (Not applicable) Standard 13 - Related Educational ActivitiesStandard 14 - Assessment of Student LearningEDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENTSTANDARDSUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore90 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016CHAPTER 4 STUDENT ADMISSIONS AND SUPPORT STANDARD 8 - S TUDENT A DMISSIONS AND R ETENTION STANDARD 9 - S TUDENT S UPPORT S ERVICESSTANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENTUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore91 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 Stat EMEN t OF t HE Sta NDaRD The institution seeks to admit students whose interests, goals, and abilities are congruent with its mission and seeks to retain them through the pursuit of the students' educational goals.

Admissions policies are readily available to prospective students through the University's website. aDMISSIONS The admissions policies of UMB's schools and programs reflect the University's mission to improve the human condition and serve the public good of Maryland and society at-large through education, research, clinical care, and service. Each degree program has separate, independent admissions policies, processes, and standards that are derived from their professional accreditation requirements. Admissions standards common to most programs include: Undergraduate GPAs and transcripts Letters of recommendation Test scores from admissions exams, such as - Dental Admission Test (DAT) - Graduate Record Examination (GRE) - Law School Admission Test (LSAT) - Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) - Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT). Some schools also have technical standards, which are non-academic criteria for admission. These include specific communication, behavioral, and motor skills required of the discipline. For instance, applicants to the schools of Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, and Pharmacy must be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide care and treatment to patients. Since instruction is provided in English, all schools and programs also require applicants who are non-native speakers of English to take STANDARD 8: STUDENT ADMISSIONS AND RETENTION either the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) examination. To assist prospective students in making informed decisions, the University has links to each school's admissions page from its central admissions home page . These pages contain more detailed information about admissions criteria and program requirements. On these school sites, students also can find documents containing program goals and learning outcomes. Each school or program has learning outcomes derived from the standards of its accrediting organization. A complete list of these goals can be found in Standard 11: Educational Offerings. aDMISSIONS Data As of fall 2015, UMB had 6,329 students enrolled in its seven schools (see table below).

The Office of Student Financial Assistance and Education (SFAE) provides many resources to help prospective, current, and graduating students manage the costs of their education. The ultimate goal of SFAE is to seat and retain the best applicants to the University. Approximately 80 percent of UMB students receive assistance through SFAE. Roughly $150 million in financial assistance is processed annually for eligible students from a variety of sources, including institutional grants and scholarships, loans, and federal student aid programs. SFAE provides prospective students with detailed cost of attendance information for the programs on campus. Prospective students also can easily find information about applying for financial aid and a detailed explanation about how financial need is determined, including information on budgets and expected family contributions on the SFAE website. The assistant vice president in charge of SFAE also is available to answer questions as are trained counselors specifically dedicated by school/program. Current students also utilize the wide range of financial aid information available on the SFAE website. For example, for students who qualify for Federal Work Study, there is an online listing of available positions. SFAE awards more than $1 million in non-repayable funds each year through the federal work study program. School-specific counselors also offer individual consultations. Additionally, SFAE has a director of financial wellness who offers an extensive variety of financial literacy workshops on topics like maintaining good credit, preparing taxes, and investing. Finally, SFAE provides graduating students with exit counseling and with information on loan consolidation, public service loan forgiveness, and the federal \"Pay As You Earn\" loan repayment plan. retention UMB succeeds in retaining the students it admits. In some measure this is attributable to the fact that as a graduate and professional University with nationally ranked schools, programs, and specialties UMB's students are highly qualified upon admission, and are highly driven and motivated to succeed. These attributes in the students, coupled with a robust array of curricular and co-curricular support services, create an environment within which students accepted into a program of study at the University are very likely to persist, flourish, and graduate. This is not only clear from the University's high retention rates 4 across programs year over year but also from its high graduation rates (see tables on next page).STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 4 - Student Admission and Support 4 The retention rates presented include students who have graduated within three years or less.University of Maryland, Baltimore95 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 REtENtION Rat ES By Sc HOOL PROgRAM ENTERIN g YEAR ONE Y EAR TWO Y EARS THREE Y EARS School of Dentistry DDS 2008 99.2% 98.5% 97.7% EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 4 - Student Admission and SupportUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore96 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 GRaDUatION Rat ES By Sc HOOL PROgRAM ENTERIN g YEAR 150% T IME TO D EgREE School of Dentistry DDS 2005 92.9% DDS 2006 91.9% DDS 2007 96.9% DDS 2008 86.2% DDS 2009 92.2% School MD 2006 95.0% MD 2007 95.0% MD 2008 96.3% MD 2009 91.9% School of NursingBSN 2005 89.9% BSN 2006 89.4% BSN 2007 96.5% BSN 2008 94.8% BSN 2009 2009 91.1%STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 4 - Student Admission and SupportUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore97 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 ongoing a ssessing of s tUdent sUCC ess Because of its focus on graduate and professional education and its highly competitive admissions process, UMB does not admit students who do not meet or marginally meet institutional qualifications. However, the University does have resources to retain students who struggle. Many resources are located centrally, such as Academic Coaching and the Writing Center , with additional services housed in specific schools, such as the Student Success Center in the School of Nursing. (See Standard 9: Student Support Services for a full listing of services.) UMB's individual schools assess student success and identify students in need of support. For example, the School of Dentistry has Student Progression Committees that review the performance of each student at the end of each semester. Depending on performance, students are categorized as eligible for unconditional advancement, summer remediation, conditional advancement, probationary advancement, or dismissal. In the School of Nursing, students who exhibit performance deficiencies in a didactic or clinical course at midterm receive a midterm warning letter. These letters include the student's current grade, and a request to meet with the course director. Copies of the letter are provided to the student, the academic advisor, and the associate dean for the program. (For a full discussion of assessment of student success as it relates to learning, see Standard 14: Assessment of Student Learning.) sUMMary UMB has clear and readily available admissions policies at the University and school level as well as central and individual school-based services in place to serve struggling students.

Educational curricula are designed, maintained, and updated by faculty and other professionals who are academically prepared and qualified. For example, the School of Nursing faculty oversee robust standards-based bachelors, master's, and doctoral programs. The faculty meet regularly to evaluate and revise courses, review evaluation data, analyze progress toward meeting strategic plan goals, and share insights gained from attendance at national conferences. Program advisory groups comprised of nursing alumni, employers, and other key stakeholders meet once or twice a year to discuss expected student outcomes and current trends in the health care setting relevant to each program and make appropriate recommendations for improvement. Similarly, in the School of Dentistry, each course is reviewed on a periodic basis. Each course review takes into consideration a range of inputs including student evaluations, course director reflections, advances in science, advances in educational technologies, and/or peer review. After the departmental review, if revisions are proposed, course directors consult with the associate dean of academic affairs, the director of instructional evaluation, and the Predoctoral Curriculum Committee regarding the need to eliminate, reduce, add, or re-sequence curriculum content.

All degree programs are constructed so that students learn essential knowledge and skills, assume increasing levels of professionalism and responsibility, and prepare for lifelong learning and service. The schools' program goals implement their respective accreditation standards to form a rigorous and coherent course of study. For example, the program goals for the School of Social Work's MSW program reflect the nine social work competencies outlined in the Council on Social Work Education's (CSWE) 2015 Educational Policy and Accreditation School of Dentistry Students will: Evaluate and assess emerging trends, technologies, and products in health care; and integrate best research outcomes with clinical expertise and patient values for evidence-based practice. Utilize critical thinking and scientific knowledge in decision-making processes involved in patient care. Utilize and apply ethical and legal reasoning in the provision of dental care. Carey School of Law Students will: Understand basic concepts of civil procedure, including the rules for processing disputes in federal courts, the relationship between state and federal courts, and the roles of judges, attorneys, and parties in the adversary system. Understand basic concepts of the U.S. constitutional system, including separation of powers, federalism, and judicial review. Understand basic concepts of contracts, including contract formation, enforceability, conditions, defenses, and remedies. saMPLe Progra M goaLsStandards (EPAS). Additionally, these competencies are listed in the syllabi of each course within the MSW program, along with details on practice behaviors associated with each competency and information about corresponding assignments and assessments. Thus, a student in the School of Social Work can see how each assignment corresponds to a practice behavior of a particular core competency, which in turn corresponds to a program goal. The following chart provides a sample of program goals from each of the schools. Full listing of program goals. School of Medicine The program will: Provide a safe, welcoming, and respectful learning environment for all persons regardless of race, gender, creed, national origin, age, disability, or sexual orientation. Educate students intensively and broadly in the cultural, clinical, and scientific aspects of medicine. Prepare students to engage in a lifetime of learning in order that they may successfully adapt to a changing world. School of Nursing Students will: Combine theoretical knowledge from the sciences, humanities, and nursing as a foundation to professional nursing practice that focuses on health promotion and prevention of disease for individuals, families, communities, and populations. Use the nursing process to manage care for individuals, families, communities, and populations integrating physical, psychological, social, cultural, spiritual, and environmental considerations. Integrate competencies in leadership, quality improvement, and patient safety to improve health and promote interdisciplinary care. Use the research process through translation of evidence-based findings to advance professional nursing and the delivery of health care.

In FY15, 116 databases, 17,200 e-books, over 4,900 electronic journals, and more than 48 online tutorials prepared by faculty librarians were accessible through the HS/HSL website, resulting in more than 1.2 million hits to the site. Within HS/HSL's physical setting, users have space, tools, and technology support to study, discover, and collaborate. The library offers 106 individual study carrels, 45 group study rooms (11 of which are technology enhanced), and 56 computer workstations. There are three computer-equipped teaching labs where hundreds of classes are taught each year. A state-of-the-art presentation practice studio providing recording and editing equipment is available by reservation. Expert assistance is offered if necessary.

To encourage informal group study, there are flexible learning pods and rolling whiteboards throughout the library. To meet the needs of its users, the HS/HSL is open approximately 90 hours per week (hours vary during exams and holidays). Students attending the Universities at Shady Grove (USG) in Rockville, Md., have access to both the HS/HSL and to the Shannon and Michael Priddy Library , located at USG. The Priddy Library offers, among other things, eight group study rooms, individual study carrels, a reading room, and a study lounge. Students can borrow USG's One Button Studio, a simplified and portable video production studio that allows them to record high-quality presentations, lectures, and videos without needing to know how to use the lights, projector, and camera. The Priddy Library also has two mobile Media:Scapes. These are large monitors on wheels that allow students to connect up to four different devices, increasing the number of ways to collaborate and share more information when studying or working on group projects. The Equil Smartmarker is another popular technology item available for checkout at the Priddy Library. It works with any whiteboard and allows users to save their notes and doodles onto their phone, tablet, or laptop, and then share it as a PDF file for others to see. It is also possible to stream it live. The library also has 50 iPads, six laptops, and five digital audio recorders available for checkout in addition to 44 desktop computers throughout the library. Other Universitywide learning resources include the Writing Center, which provides one-on-one consultations at any stage of the writing process and academic coaching, which provides students the opportunity to work with a professional coach regarding academic-related goals, concerns, and stressors. (For a full list of Universitywide services, please see Standard 9: Student Support Services.) Each school also provides learning resources for its students (see table below). For example, the schools of Medicine and Nursing jointly operate a patient simulation facility. Standardized patients are used in all four years of the medicine curriculum, including interviewing in Year I, support for physical diagnosis in Year II, teaching on required clerkships in Year III, and the required multi-station Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCE) in the fall of Year IV, which is a requirement for successful completion of medical school. Physical therapy students also use the standardized patient facility. Similarly, the Clinical Simulation Labs in the School of Nursing provide more than 134 beds in 24 contemporary clinical simulation settings, in which undergraduate and graduate students learn and enhance their skills using intelligent mannequins and clinical simulators. sChoo L-Based Learning r esoU rCes School of Dentistry Mannequins Clinical Simulation Laboratory Dental chairs Carey School of Law Thurgood Marshall Law Library Computer labs School of Medicine Medscope Multidisciplinary labs Patient Simulation Facility School of Nursing Clinical Simulation Labs Clinical Education and Evaluation Laboratory Computer labs Media Center School of Pharmacy Basic science lab Compounding lab Pharmacy practice lab Distance Learning Center Computer lab School of Social Work Computer lab Media CenterUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore117 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 6 - Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment transfer Po LiCies Policies on transfer credit are established in the schools in accordance with UMB's central policy. Please see the discussion of transfer credit in Standard 8: Student Admissions and Retention for more detail. assessM ent of Progra M oUtCoMes The chief indicator that program outcomes are being met is each degree program's continuing accreditation. To maintain accreditation, programs must demonstrate to their respective accrediting bodies that they are achieving their goals. All of the University's professional programs have full accreditation status, and all of its graduate programs have passed MHEC's initial program review process and undergo periodic internal and external review in accordance with USM policy . None of the University's programs are on probation. Another important source of assessment information comes from the individual courses within the programs. This course-level information, which includes grades and course evaluations, directly informs how programs' curricula are maintained and revised. Course-level assessment data is discussed in more detail in Standard 14: Assessment of Student Learning. Apart from accreditation and course-level information, the University also uses other measures to assess program outcomes, including employment rates, licensure exam passing rates, and exit surveys. The schools and the University monitor post- graduation employment rates to ensure that their programs adequately prepare students for success in their chosen fields. For example, the School of Medicine reported a 94 percent match rate for its 2015 graduates. In the School of Nursing, employment rates were self-reported as 93 percent for the BSN and 100 percent for the DNP. In the School of Dentistry, graduates reported at near 100 percent for DDS and at 100 percent for dental hygiene. This data is used cautiously, since many who are un- or under-employed are less likely to respond to the surveys that collect this data. For example, of the 156 graduates from the School of Pharmacy in 2014, only 72 completed the survey. Of these respondents, 100 percent were either employed or in a residency. Many programs at UMB require students to pass licensure examinations. Student success rates in licensure examinations are monitored and are critically examined in relation to the demands of the curriculum and the clinical experiences available to every student. Passing rates are provided in the table on the next page. Graduation and exit surveys also provide the schools with rich assessment information. For instance, upon completing a program in the School of Nursing, graduates fill out a 56-item Program Assessment Questionnaire (PAQ), which assesses five aspects of program satisfaction: 1. program utility and efficacy 2. learning resources3. time efficiency and student demands 4. faculty-student relationships 5. curricular options and utility Two global questions assess overall satisfaction with the program and willingness to recommend it to other potential students. University of Maryland, Baltimore118 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 6 - Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment CLosing the Loo P The schools assess whether their programs are achieving their stated goals by reviewing accreditation standards, course evaluations, post-graduation employment rates, licensure exam scores, exit surveys, and other data, such as workforce evaluations, alumni surveys, and focus group responses. In each school, this work is accomplished by a faculty-led curriculum committee, under the direction of the deans of academic affairs. If program goals are not being met, these committees alter the curriculum based on the assessment data. Since most of these changes occur at the course level, curriculum committees review courses either annually or biennially. For examples of course-level changes, please see Standard 14: Assessment of Student Learning. sUMMary Consistent with its mission, the University maintains an extensive portfolio of rigorous academic programs.

Due to its nature as a graduate and professional institution, UMB offers no precollege-level basic skills or developmental courses as part of its educational offerings. UMB does not admit unprepared students; however, it does have systems in place to ensure the success of struggling students. UMB does not offer non-credit courses, and it does not give credit for experiential learning/skills obtained outside of a higher education setting. The University does not contract out any aspect of its educational experience to affiliated providers. CertifiCate Progra Ms UMB currently has 10 certificate programs open to admission. All certificate programs are developed and approved within each school's rigorous curriculum approval processes to ensure that they have appropriate curricular sequencing with clear requirements, objectives and expectations. Once approved by the schools, proposed certificate programs then are vetted and approved by the University to ensure they meet the mission of the institution. An additional layer of scrutiny is conducted by the state of Maryland's Higher Education Commission (MHEC) for all certificate programs that require 12 or more semester hours at the master's level. Students in the certificate programs have access to all school and campus support services. The certificate programs are not applicable to a degree program whereby students who have completed the certificate would then apply with an eye toward transferring in credits. Bran Ch CaMPU ses, additionaL LoCations, and o ther instrUC tiona L sites UMB has no branch campuses. The University has two additional locations. The Universities at Shady Grove (USG) is a USM regional higher education center in Rockville, Md., and it provides instructional space for courses and programs from nine USM institutions. Our schools of pharmacy, social work, and nursing offer full degree programs at USG. The University also offers a master's program in law at the additional location of the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) . The University also has two instructional sites: the Laurel College Center and the College of Southern Maryland La Plata campus. The School of Nursing offers RN to BSN in the standard classroom format at these two sites. The existence of the two additional locations and the two other instructional sites factor in to each year's budgeting process at UMB and undergo periodic assessment to ensure that their continuation is consistent with UMB's institutional mission and goals. The additional location programs in pharmacy and nursing meet the same standards for admission, progression, curricula, and faculty as programs delivered on UMB's campus. UMB's two libraries, the Health Sciences/Human Services Library (HS/HSL) and the Thurgood Marshall Law Library , support students at both additional locations. Additionally, USG has the Shannon and Michael Priddy Library , the Center for Academic Success , the Center for Counseling and Consultation , the Office of Student Services , as well as a variety of community service opportunities. The Masters in Law students have access to all of the services at UMCP as that program arose out of the UMB/UMCP MPower initiative.

(UMB does not offer Distributed Learning or Correspondence Education.) Programmatic distance education at UMB originated at the School of Nursing (SON), to improve educational access while maintaining high academic standards and rigor. Delivering graduate professional instruction online requires comprehensive planning; including instructional design support, faculty training, student readiness assessment and mentoring, attention to academic policy and procedure to achieve parity between face to face and online instruction. The SON initially received grant funds to build such an infrastructure, and UMB has since expanded its number of online and distance education programs due to the success of that model. The Quality Matters (QM) framework was chosen as a course design methodology due to its grounding in pedagogical research. All courses of the Doctorate of Nursing Program achieved QM distinction. Currently all online or web enhanced instruction at the SON, School of Pharmacy, and Graduate School is supported by the QM design process. To support growth in distance education, UMB provides central institutional support to all schools through membership with the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB), provides a centralized state authorization process to ensure conformance with legal requirements, maintains robust digital resources through HS/ HSL, and established a Center for Academic Innovation and Distance Education (AIDE) to foster student and faculty preparedness for distance education. The AIDE Center offers individual consultations, mentoring for new faculty, and workshops to inform about current research on teaching and learning. UMB uses Blackboard as its learning management system and the University has a single sign-on authentication to access the Blackboard learning management system, UMB's online portal for grades, financial aid and billing (SURFS) and other campus technologies. Students utilizing online systems must use their secure UMID and UM Password each time they log in and all email communications are sent to the UMB student email account. Additionally, UMB has adopted and implemented an Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy that applies to all students and in all programs of study and covers students who attend in-class instruction as well as those who take distance education and hybrid classes. Students taking classes online are asked to complete an online orientation and strategies to maintain academic integrity in the academic environment are included in faculty training.

These outcomes are assessed at multiple levels, and the University uses this data to ensure continuing student success. CULtUre of a ssess Ment and iMP rove Ment UMB prides itself on the success of its graduates and alumni. In each program and school the institutional mission and vision is reflected. The University articulates its mission-driven definitions of success for learners by publishing learner outcomes that are measured by a variety of assessments, each designed to evaluate professionalism, knowledge, skill acquisition, and the achievement of expectations. The institution supports an innovative culture of assessment; in graduate level education UMB has moved away from memorization and simple \"drill and grill\" assessment methodology. Instead, it has developed a robust culture of formative and summative assessment embracing the use of rubrics to evaluate writing, projects, and presentations. UMB uses portfolios to examine advancement toward publication, research grant acquisition, and scholarly contribution. Simulation and Standardized Patient resources are used to create environments for rich authentic assessments where UMB can teach and test its students' preparedness to work in teams, meet the challenges of a complex health care environment, while protecting individual safety and the well-being of the patients they will serve. All of UMB's professional schools are accredited , most rank nationally, and its students are successful in gaining employment, postgraduate admission to residency, funding of research, and publication of scholarly work. In addition to Middle States accreditation, most programs at UMB participate in their own self-study processes as part of their national professional organizations. Each school develops outcomes assessment measures and collects information and feedback relevant to their specialty accrediting body. This process assures that UMB's graduates in professional programs are imparted with the knowledge, skills, and competencies necessary for the next stage of their training and/or employment. President Perman has regular performance meetings with the deans of each school in which they discuss student performance. Additionally, the Office of Institutional Research and Accountability (OIRA) reports student performance to USM in its Managing for Results report. (See Standard 7: Institutional Assessment.) The University also produces specialized reports, such as the UMB Achievement Gap Report , which examines the difference in graduation rates in the BSN program between minority and white students and between African-American and white students. overview of the a ssess Ment of s tUdent Learning UMB and its schools engage in continuous outcomes assessment and analyses. These efforts are accomplished at multiple levels including at the course, program, school, and institutional level. As seen in previous chapters, UMB is a learning organization with structures, policies, and procedures in place to create a culture of quality improvement to foster student success. The feedback and data used by the University to meet the requirements of multiple accrediting bodies is used to improve existing programs University of Maryland, Baltimore125 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 6 - Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment and inform robust multi-year strategic planning and implementation efforts. The institution stays engaged and informed of the progress of all schools, programs, and credentials through a robust assessment and central reporting structure. This reporting structure facilitates compliance with required state and USM system reporting while informing the leadership of the state of the institution. ORIA reports annually on student applications, degrees and financial aid awards, and faculty and staff employment and demographics. The office also reports each term on credits earned, cumulative GPAs, course section information, student registration, enrollment, and course outcome information. This information is reviewed, analyzed, and used to determine if there are educational areas of risk or in need of additional resources or support. Programs showing delays in graduation, increased attrition, or poor certification-licensing performance issues are prioritized to receive additional resources and attention. Information collected and synthesized by the University is often reported out through the University's Managing for Results and Performance Accountability Reports . Student learning outcomes on campus often emerge from professional competencies. These learning outcomes include specific knowledge, skills, and attitudes UMB graduates must demonstrate as they progress through professional programs and degrees. Curriculum committees map desired competencies, skills, and knowledge to course curricula. Mapping ensures effectively sequenced instruction and links assessment to student learning outcomes. Progression committees evaluate student advancement and use knowledge, skill, and 360-degree professional observational assessments to assure learning outcomes are met at the acceptable criterion. In addition to using knowledge, skills, and professional observation to inform student progression this information also is critically appraised to inform curricular changes to achieve the University's institutional mission of excellence in education. Each individual health professional school on campus defines course-level and program-level student learning outcomes. These measurable learning outcomes are framed by each discipline's professional education association and are affirmed by each professional accreditation body. UMB recognizes that professional school accreditation is an ongoing and continuous process rather than a periodic event. To support its schools in successful professional accreditation the institution provides extensive resources for faculty instructional support and development. Many schools have an Office of Instructional Support that assists faculty with learning outcome assessment design, implementation, and analysis. Methods of a ssessing stUdent Learning The University's programs use a variety of methods to assess student learning outcomes including examinations, clinical assessments, self-evaluations, and alumni data. Additionally, faculty members also evaluate progress to identify and help struggling students. Examinations Programs use examinations to assess student knowledge as it pertains to course-level and program-level student learning outcomes. Some of these exams are created by faculty, and others are national normed standardized products. Within the School of Medicine, the MD program uses multiple-choice exams to provide immediate feedback to students. The Carey School of Law relies heavily on exams with open-ended questions for almost all of its didactic courses. Schools also use oral exams to evaluate analytical skills of students. Narrative assessment, peer assessment, and research assessment are commonly used tools for evaluating student knowledge and learning University of Maryland, Baltimore126 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 6 - Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment outcomes among all of UMB's schools. Licensing examinations are also often used to assess the overall effectiveness of curricula in professional programs. Clinical Assessments Given the nature of UMB's programs, a considerable portion of student learning takes place in clinical settings, and this learning also is assessed. In many schools, students are evaluated along attitudinal and professionalism lines within both classroom and clinical activities. Various degree programs also use clinical performance ratings, narrative assessment, oral patient presentation, peer assessment, and research experiences. Programs are devised to assure educational equivalency with virtual patients provided to meet these needs. Faculty development includes instruction on the development of assessment tools. Self-Evaluation UMB also requires students to evaluate their own learning. Graduating DDS students self-evaluate their preparedness for practice in relation to the Maryland Dental Competency Statements through the mandatory senior exit survey. The results of this survey are reviewed by administrators and members of the Predoctoral Directors Committee and analyses become a formal part of the curriculum evaluation feedback loop. In alternating years, surveys are sent to dental and dental hygiene program alumni who graduated in the previous year and to directors of educational programs in which Maryland dental graduates have enrolled. Survey items are structured to assess the level of knowledge, skills, and competencies developed during the educational program. Data from these questionnaires are supplemented by surveys administered one year after graduation to School of Dentistry graduates, who self-appraise their knowledge, skills, and level of competence, once they have begun clinical practice. The results of these supplemental surveys also provide additional information for ongoing programmatic review. Alumni Data Alumni survey data also are used to inform student outcomes, and includes information about how well the graduates, as well as the employers of graduates, evaluate the preparation of students for the performance/practice expectations for the respective degree. In the School of Nursing, these surveys are administered every three years and longitudinal summary data are used to track trends and make recommendations on program content, structure, and learning activities. At the School of Nursing, major stakeholder data also are collected through annual meetings that include nursing leaders across practice settings where students have completed clinical learning and also those who hire new graduates. Faculty Evaluation of Student Progression Faculty in each of UMB's schools review assessment data to identify struggling students. For instance, School of Dentistry faculty members carefully monitor the performance of dental and dental hygiene students in the didactic, laboratory, and clinical components of the educational program at Student Progression Committee meetings. Members of the Preclinical Progression Committee and the Clinical Progression Committee review overall dental student performance during Years I and II, and Years III and IV, respectively. Members of the Dental Hygiene Progression Committee review all dental hygiene student performance. The committees meet six times annually to assess student performance in courses (internal assessments), as well as performance against standardized tests, such as the National Board Dental Hygiene Examination Parts I and II (external assessments).

Taken together, the Maryland Competencies reflect the desired synthesis of student learning outcomes of the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical curriculum of the School of Dentistry. Prior to graduation, predoctoral dental students are expected to demonstrate that they have attained the required knowledge, skills, and values by passing each of the 55 standardized Maryland Competency Exams. These exams may be case- based reports, demonstrations, oral or written exams, or presentations, and are formal didactic and practical examinations administered as part of the curriculum. Performance on the Maryland Competency Exams is tracked to monitor student readiness and to evaluate the effectiveness of the curriculum in preparing students for independent practice.University of Maryland, Baltimore129 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 6 - Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment Processes and Methods for Student Learning Outcome Assessment The School of Dentistry has robust student learning outcome assessment that leads to course and curriculum improvement. Every course in the dental curriculum is reviewed in alternate years. Departments assume primary responsibility for these reviews. Each course review takes into consideration student evaluations, course director reflections, advances in science, advances in educational technologies, and peer review. Course reviews also consider the number of hours devoted to standardized topics compared with national averages for those topics (reported in the annual ADA Survey of Dental Education Group IV-Curriculum). After departmental review, and if revisions are proposed, course directors consult with the associate dean of academic affairs, the director of instructional evaluation, and the Predoctoral Curriculum Committee regarding the need for proposals to eliminate, reduce, add, or re-sequence curriculum content; to familiarize students with new technologies; and/or to add evidence-based treatment modalities. Requests for new courses, changes to hours/credits, modifications to scheduling, and/or changes to the overall curriculum are reviewed by the Predoctoral Curriculum Committee and subsequently reviewed and approved by the Faculty Assembly. Moreover, School of Dentistry faculty have a central role in the assessment of student learning outcomes. The faculty carefully monitor the performance of dental and dental hygiene students in the didactic, laboratory, and clinical components of the educational program at Student Progression Committee meetings. Members of the Preclinical Progression Committee and the Clinical Progression Committee review overall dental student performance during Years I and II, and Years III and IV, respectively. Members of the Dental Hygiene Progression Committee review all dental hygiene student performance. The committees meet six times annually to assess student performance in courses (internal assessments), as well as performance against standardized tests, such as the National Dental Board Examinations Parts I and II (external assessments). To supplement this review process during the clinical years, course directors and clinical directors use information from the Clinical Dashboard to assess clinical competence, patient management, and attendance during required block rotations. Students must pass national standardized licensure exams as a condition for graduation and licensure, and regional standardized licensure examinations as a condition of licensure (see below). Student success rates in licensure examinations are monitored over time and are critically examined in relation to the demands of the curriculum and the clinical experiences available to every student. Illustrations of Course-Level Assessment and Improvement Examples of how student learning outcome assessment has resulted in course-level improvement are plentiful in the School of Dentistry. For instance, the course Principles and Practice of Clinical Endodontics (ENDO 521) was reviewed by the Department of Endodontics, Prosthodontics and Operative Dentistry and needed improvements were identified. The primary student learning objectives of the course are to develop competency in performing endodontic therapy and diagnosis and management of the endodontic patient.

This finding led to an intra-departmental formation of a committee charged with re-sequencing learning outcomes. The committee In addition to student learning outcomes assessment the School of Dentistry closely monitors licensure examination passing rates. In order to practice dentistry, dental students must successfully complete a licensure examination. The licensure examination administered at the School of Dentistry is the ADEX (American Board of Dental Examiners) examination administered by the Northeast Regional Board (NERB). This examination consists of five sections that include a Computer-Based Diagnostic Skills Examination (DSE), an Endodontic Clinical Examination, elected to move the Principles and Practice of Clinical Endodontics so that it would precede a course focused on Fixed Prosthodontics beginning in the fall semester of 2015. The re-sequencing of this course resulted in improved student feedback in the course illustrated in the following table: a Fixed Prosthodontic Clinical Examination, a Periodontal/Scaling Clinical Examination, and a Restorative Clinical Examination. At graduation, May 2014, the UMB students at the School of Dentistry achieved a pass rate in each examination section as listed in the table below: sod e xaMination P ass rates Examination Passing Rate diagnostic skills 98.4% Periodontal/Scaling clinical resULts of P re- and P ost-intervention st Udent s Urveys ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS (ENDO 521) RESULTS Pre-Intervention Spring 2015 Very good = 38.5% Good = 56.4% Very good = 43.6% Good = 41.0% Very good = 43.6% Good = 51.3% Very good = 58.9% Good = 41.3% Very good = 41.0% Good = 58.9%Post-Intervention Fall 2015 Very good = 64.3% Good = 30.9% Very good = 80.9% Good = 19.1% Very good = 66.7% Good = 26.2% Very good = 73.8% Good = 26.2% Very good = 61.9% Good = 33.3%University of Maryland, Baltimore131 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 6 - Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment Carey sC hoo L of Law stUdent Learning a ssessM ent Degree Programs and Student Learning Outcomes The Francis King Carey School of Law offers three degree programs: Juris Doctor (JD), Master of Laws (LLM), and Master of Science in Law (MSL). In 2010, the JD program was reaccredited until 2017 by the American Bar Association. The American Bar Association has also granted acquiescence status to the LLM and the MSL programs. The curricula in the Carey School of Law are designed to meet the competencies and learning outcomes set by these accrediting bodies. Samples of these learning outcomes are presented below: Juris Doctor Understand the basic concepts of constitutional law that govern the relationship between individuals and the state, including limits on government action, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the 14th Amendment, and the power of the court to remedy constitutional violations Master legal research skills, methodologies and strategies to ensure performance of thorough legal research, including federal and state law, legislation, regulations, agency decisions, electronic databases, and other primary and secondary materials Have produced a substantial piece of written work that shows awareness of pertinent primary and secondary authority, and demonstrates original thoughtful analysis through completion of the Advanced Writing Requirement Understand how the law operates in practice through a clinical law course including having direct professional contact with or substantial responsibility for providing legal assistance to those who otherwise lack access to justice in the legal system or to organizations acting on behalf of such persons Have developed \"skills for the admission to the bar and for effective, ethical, and responsible participation as members of the legal profession\" as required by the American Bar Association Standard 301(a) The Carey School of Law does not currently have a list of student outcomes posted on its website.

Students are required to specialize in an area of established expertise at the Carey School of Law, ensuring they will develop expertise in their field of choice, including: Business Law, Clinical Law, Constitutional Law, Crisis Management, Cybersecurity, Environmental Law, Health Law, Intellectual Property Law, and International and Comparative Law.University of Maryland, Baltimore132 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 6 - Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment Processes and Methods for Student Learning Outcome Assessment Curricular review and assessment of student learning outcomes is managed by a number of entities within the Carey School of Law. The school's Office of Registration and Enrollment reviews student records on a regular basis to track student completion of graduation requirements. The Administrative Committee establishes academic support policies that apply to students who fall below certain grade point averages after their first year. Additionally, each year the dean of the law school appoints a Curriculum Committee and its chair. Then the dean, with the advice of the chair, provides the committee with its charge for the year. Included in that charge is always an instruction to evaluate and accept or deny new/proposed courses for the degree programs. The committee also evaluates initiatives to enhance or alter the existing curriculum for the degree programs and brings them to the Faculty Council for approval. Faculty in the Carey School of Law also have a significant role in the assessment of student learning outcomes. The faculty review GPAs to identify struggling students in first and second years. First-year students who complete the first semester and are ranked in the bottom 20 percent of the class are strongly encouraged to take the spring elective Legal Profession/Reasoning and Rhetoric, a course that uses substantive learning as foundation for working on academic skills like reading and briefing cases, time management, class participation, outlining, and exam skills. A special emphasis is placed on developing and reinforcing the ability to apply substantive law effectively in a time examination setting. First semester first-year students who have a GPA below 2.0 are required to take the spring elective Legal Profession/Reasoning and Rhetoric. Additionally, students who finish their first semester of law school with a GPA below 1.5 are placed on academic probation and must meet with the associate dean for students and student services for academic and other counseling immediately upon receiving first semester grades. Students who, upon completion of their entire first year have performed in the lowest 20 percent - based on cumulative grade point averages - are strongly encouraged to take Commercial Law/Reasoning & Rhetoric II or its equivalent. In addition, a student will be required to take Commercial Law/Reasoning & Rhetoric II or its equivalent if the student (i) was ranked in the lowest 20 percent of the class at the conclusion of the fall semester of the first year, (ii) did not take Legal Profession/Reasoning & Rhetoric or its equivalent during the spring semester of the first year, and (iii) is ranked in the lowest 10 percent of the class at the conclusion of the spring semester of the first year. Illustrations of Course-Level Assessment and Improvement The Carey School of Law routinely makes course-level improvements based on student learning outcome assessment. For example, the course Bar Essay Writing, which focuses on the skill of writing bar examination essays including standard essays and performance tests, was recently reviewed. Student evaluations revealed that the course did not include sufficient substantive reinforcement. In other words, the course lacked an underpinning in the law, which made writing the standard essay difficult, since writing good answers depends on mastery of substantive law. Additionally, it was determined that the absence of work on multiple choice testing, a significant component of the bar exam, further limited the students' ability to learn and master substantive law. Based on these assessment findings, changes were made to the course. First, content was added to the course in two areas: 1) Contracts and torts in order to impart skills of memorization and substantive mastery to aid in the writing of essays; and 2) Students must now learn the law, memorize and master it, and apply the law they have mastered on subject-relevant essay questions. In addition to these changes to improve substantive mastery University of Maryland, Baltimore133 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 6 - Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment and bar exam preparation, multiple-choice questioning has been added to the course. The multiple-choice questioning was designed to give students opportunities to practice identifying subtle nuances of the law, a needed skill for the bar examination. Teaching now focuses on the process of reading through questions, identification of nuances, and application of the law to correctly answer questions. The course is currently being reviewed to measure the impact of these changes on student learning. As a result of robust student learning outcomes assessment, UMB graduates of the Carey School of Law have consistently had higher pass rates on the Maryland Bar Examination than other first-time takers. Over the period of 2011-2013, the pass rates on the Maryland exam for first-time takers averaged 80 percent. For the same period, the pass rate for UMB graduates taking the exam for the first time was just over 84 percent. sChoo L of Medi Cine s tUdent Learning a ssessM ent Degree Programs and Student Learning Outcomes The School of Medicine offers a Doctor of Medicine, a Master of Genetic Counseling, a Master of Public Health, a Master of Pathology Assistance, and a Doctor of Physical Therapy.

Clinical experiences are part of all professional degrees throughout the curriculum. In addition to lecture and small group activities, students utilize standardized patients. Similarly, the Doctor of Physical Therapy program uses a combination of didactic instruction and clinical placements with close faculty supervision. Simulation, online learning (synchronous and asynchronous), and clinical instruction is a part of all programs. In addition to didactic instruction, the Medical and Research Technology program emphasizes clinical skill acquisition while the other graduate programs are lecture-, seminar-, and laboratory-based throughout. Students across all programs have robust opportunities for research. Assessment of course-level student learning outcomes is managed by pertinent faculty committees. Each program is periodically reviewed internally as well as prepared for external accreditation processes. Measures such as performance compared to past group of students and performance on external national examinations is common to all of the professional degree offerings. There is an extensive system of soliciting, analyzing, and utilizing student feedback for program and course improvement. This feedback includes formal anonymous evaluations of each course and clerkship that are required of students and submitted electronically at the end of each educational unit. Formal assessment is supplemented with focus groups of students from individual sections and courses, meetings of class officers with the dean, and active student representation on all education committees. The Office of Medical Education collects, analyzes, and prepares reports on student feedback and provides this information to course and clinical clerkship directors. Student feedback is an extremely important tool for assessing student learning outcomes in courses and clerkships. When courses demonstrate a need for improvement the School of Medicine has the expectation that corrections be made quickly and that such improvements are iterative over time. Aside from changes within the curricula and courses being initiated by direct student feedback, faculty and national educational groups associated with the individual degree programs also drive student learning outcomes improvement. For instance, the Curriculum Coordinating Committee of the Doctor of Medicine degree program reviews accreditation standards to make sure the curriculum is in compliance. Clinical faculty provides feedback through their academic department related to the educational program and coursework. Curriculum and student learning outcomes within other School of Medicine degree programs is evaluated using performance on national examinations, placement into post-degree training, and career outcomes as guideposts. Importantly, faculty have a rich menu of development programs including opportunities to improve teaching and assessment skills. Illustrations of Course-Level Assessment and Improvement The School of Medicine routinely makes course- level improvements based on student learning outcome assessment. For example, as a result of assessment, student learning outcomes have become largely competency based, spanning knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Knowledge is assessed by the use of examinations developed by faculty as well as national normed standardized products. In the Doctor of Medicine program, for instance, these are primarily multiple-choice format with immediate feedback to students. Other programs rely more heavily on problem solving and open-ended format examinations. University of Maryland, Baltimore136 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 6 - Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment Oral assessment is used throughout all programs to evaluate analytical skills of students. Students in all professional programs promptly receive examination results to allow maximal improvement of performance. Where applicable, narrative assessment, peer assessment, and research assessment are used. Additionally, assessments have resulting in the monitoring of student attitudes from the onset of program throughout to completion. Students are evaluated along attitudinal and professionalism lines within both classroom and clinical activities. Various degree programs also use clinical performance ratings, narrative assessment, oral patient presentation, peer assessment, and research experiences. Programs are devised to assure educational equivalency with virtual patients provided to meet these needs. In the Medical Research and Technology degree program, the department annually reviews Board of Certification scores, both students overall pass rate and the mean of student content sub-scores. If sub-scores fall below the national mean, the content area is given to Advisory Board members for review and recommendation for change. For example, the sub-score for \"Proteins and Other Nitrogen Containing Compounds\" was slightly below the national average. This content is addressed in Clinical Chemistry (MEDT 452), which is a senior-level course that presents in-depth information relating to the pathophysiology of commonly measured analytes in the clinical chemistry laboratory. Recommendations for improvements were made and the modified content was delivered in MEDT 452 Clinical Chemistry in fall 2014. Six examples of content change include: 1. CK-MB, Total CK and myoglobin should be mentioned in context of medical lab science for historical reasons and to give a full picture of cardiac markers - perhaps a timeline addressing cardiac marker advances2. As an MI marker, LDH has replaced CK-MB, which has been replaced by cTnT 3. Content in the BNP/NT-pro BNP section should be expanded and supplemented with additional detail and application 4. Add free light chain as endpoint for Amyloidosis 5. Add a section on Qualitative IgG, IgM, IgA measurement such as nephelometry and free (serum & urine) light chain measurements 6. Add limitations of eGFR The 2014 sub-score in \"Proteins and Other Nitrogen Containing Compounds\" before the content changes were 424 and the national mean was 511. After the improvements to the course were made, the 2015 sub-score was 514 and the national mean was 512. Clearly, the course improvements lead to quantifiable improvement in student learning and performance. A final illustration of course-level improvement based on student learning outcome assessment can be found in the Master of Genetic Counseling program. The research component of the program is a robust learning experience for the students. Historically, the final project for the research component, students were required to submit a traditional bound thesis project. The program had a high level of thesis abstracts accepted for poster presentation at national meetings, and one student went on to modify and publish data from her thesis in manuscript format in a medical journal. Course evaluations from students, alumni surveys, and curriculum review with faculty concluded that the research course and final project needed to be updated to align with other genetic counseling program research outcomes. In 2014, the course Research for Genetic Counselors (HGEN 703) was reorganized and the final project was modified to be a publication ready manuscript in journal format. Since these modifications occurred three students (out of seven eligible) have published journal articles, and course evaluation feedback suggests that students see the utility and relevance of the new format. University of Maryland, Baltimore137 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 6 - Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment Due to the School of Medicine's diligence in the assessment of student learning outcomes, UMB's students perform at or above national benchmarks. For instance, in the Bachelor of Science in Medical and Research Technology UMB's students have passed the national certification exam at the rate of 95.8 percent, 94.1 percent, and 100 percent for 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively (compared to national rates of 84.5 percent, 83.8 percent, and 80.3 percent over the same time period). Likewise, the Doctor of Physical Therapy program achieves extraordinarily high outcomes with graduation rates of 96.5 percent, 96.5 percent, and 95.3 percent for 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. Additionally, physical therapy licensure rates were 100 percent in 2013 and 2014, and 98.4 percent in 2015 with 100 percent of graduates employed within six months of passing their licensure examination. Finally, in the Doctor of Medicine program, UMB medical students had USMLE Step 2 CK passing rates of 99 percent for both 2013 and 2014 and 97 percent for 2015. sChoo L of nU rsing s tUdent Learning a ssessM ent Degree Programs and Student Learning Outcomes The School of Nursing offers two entry programs into professional practice; a traditional Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program and the Clinical Nurse Leader (CNL) program, which is an entry-level master's option. There is a Registered Nurse to Bachelors of Science in Nursing option that allows nurses prepared in associate degree or diploma programs to pursue the bachelor's. Both the traditional bachelor's and Registered Nurse to Bachelor options are offered at the Universities at Shady Grove location, with the faculty collaborating to provide comparable quality and rigor across the courses. In addition to the Clinical Nurse Leader entry option, there are three other master's options (Health Services Leadership and Management, Informatics, and Community Public Health Nursing). The school offers two doctoral programs, the Doctor of Philosophy and the Doctor of Nursing Practice. The program outcomes for each program are based upon the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education essentials for the respective programs, as well as other professional nursing and higher education standards. Samples of student learning outcomes are presented below for selected degree programs in the School of Nursing: Bachelor of Science in Nursing Combine theoretical knowledge from the sciences, humanities, and nursing as a foundation to professional nursing practice that focuses on health promotion and prevention of disease for individuals, families, communities, and populations Use the nursing process to manage care for individuals, families, communities, and populations integrating physical, psychological, social, cultural, spiritual, and environmental considerations Use the research process through translation of evidence-based findings to advance professional nursing and the delivery of health care Incorporate information management and patient care technology in the delivery of quality patient-centered care Integrate knowledge of health care policy from social, economic, political, legislative, and professional perspectives to influence the delivery of care to individuals, families, communities, and populations Employ interprofessional communication and collaboration to ensure safe, quality care across the life span Use principles of ethics, legal responsibility, and accountability to guide professional nursing practices across the life span and across the health care continuum Accept personal accountability for lifelong learning, professional growth, and commitment to the advancement of the profession A full list of student learning outcome is available at: http://www.nursing.umaryland. edu/academics/undergrad/bsn/University of Maryland, Baltimore138 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 6 - Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment Master of Science in Nursing Incorporate scientific inquiry and theoretical concepts into efforts to improve the care to individuals and communities Lead evidence-based and interprofessional approaches for the design and delivery of comprehensive, culturally competent care to individuals, families, communities, and populations Participate in the design, implementation, and evaluation of health care systems to foster safety and excellence in health care delivery Engage in ethically sound, culturally sensitive, and evidence-based practices to promote the health of individuals and communities Commit to lifelong learning for self and promote lifelong learning to consumers Practice advanced nursing roles in collaborative relationships across disciplines and in partnership with communities A full list of learning outcomes is available at: http://www.nursing.umaryland.edu/academics/ grad/ms/ Doctor of Nursing Practice Initiate, facilitate, and participate in collaborative efforts that influence health care outcomes with scholars, practitioners, clinicians, and policymakers from other disciplines Lead at the highest educational, clinical, and executive ranks Evaluate and apply ethically sound, culturally sensitive, evidence-based practice for the improvement of education, clinical practice, systems management, and nursing leadership Analyze and apply scientific knowledge and related skills for the highest level of nursing practice Design, implement, manage, and evaluate patient care and organizational systems A full list of learning outcomes is available at: http://www.nursing.umaryland.edu/academics/doctoral/dnp/Processes and Methods for Student Learning Outcome Assessment In September 2014, the school underwent a successful site visit by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education. Entry-level courses are reviewed annually by the curriculum committee and course directors. Graduate-level courses are conducted every three years. PhD courses are reviewed periodically. Students complete online end of semester Course Evaluation Questionnaire and Faculty Evaluation Questionnaire for each course taken. These data are reviewed by course faculty and under the direction of the course director, course revisions are made as needed. Course directors and program directors review Course Evaluation Questionnaire data each semester and modifications to courses are made as needed. The School of Nursing has a Master Evaluation Plan (available in the School of Nursing Self-Study) that provides the overarching process for program evaluation, and collects data from students and faculty including Course Evaluation Questionnaires, Faculty Evaluation Questionnaires, Peer and Supervisor evaluation, and Program Assessment Questionnaire (completed upon program completion). Additionally, in both the BSN and CNL options, standardized testing across the curriculum was implemented in 2000 to benchmark to students in similar programs. In summer of 2014, this integrated testing process was started with Kaplan, Inc. Administered at the end of specific clinical courses, and based upon individual student performance, a remediation plan is developed to support student performance. Aggregate data from these tests also are used to evaluate and inform curricular changes. University of Maryland, Baltimore139 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 6 - Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment Illustrations of Course-Level Assessment and Improvement The School of Nursing routinely makes course- level improvements based on student learning outcome assessment. For example, a Bachelor of Science course titled Fundamentals of Nursing in the Context of Older Adults (NURS 317) was recently reviewed. The course introduces students to the application of clinical practice in the development of cognitive, psychomotor, communication, and therapeutic skills necessary to address common needs and responses of older adults across the health care continuum. In the course, students have the opportunity to practice their psychomotor, assessment, and therapeutic communication skills in the simulation laboratory as well as in a variety of clinical environments with older adults. In fall 2014 students noted on the Course Evaluation Questionnaires that they felt there was a \"disconnect\" between the simulation laboratory and didactic portions of the course. During the winter break of 2015, revisions were made to better align and sequence didactic material with skills practices in the laboratory. The course director also increased direct involvement in the laboratory and clinical components of the course. Additionally, student quizzes were modified to include laboratory and didactic questions, decreasing knowledge-based questions, and increasing application-based questions. Qualitative results of student evaluations of the course in spring of 2016 indicated improvement. Students were specifically positive about the quizzes and their value to students in preparing for midterm and final examinations. The School of Nursing also recently reviewed the course Populations at Risk (NURS 761) in the Master of Science program. The course is largely didactic and focuses on the mission of public health and the various organizations that support the responsibilities of public health at the international, national, and local levels. The course explores family systems as well as support and risk communications that influence public health and populations at risk. The course also examines factors that influence the effectiveness of health promotion and disease prevention programs. Students reported in course evaluations that critical topics in the course were being taught too late in the curriculum. Subsequently, the course was moved to the fall semester, which is earlier in the curriculum. Faculty members also advised students to enroll in the course in the first or second semester of their program. Orientation sessions for new students incorporated the change and encouraged students to take the course early in their program. New students reported being more enthusiastic about the community and public health specialty and subsequently, nearly all students took the course early in their program of study. The School of Nursing's focus on assessing student learning outcomes has resulted in not only improvement in course evaluations but also in relation to certification examinations. Key outcome indicators monitored in relation to student outcomes in the Master and Doctor of Nursing Practice programs include certification examination pass rates for graduates. Aggregate data are compared annually to trend data and benchmark, when available, to state and national standards. The Program Assessment Questionnaire (PAQ) is completed by all graduating students and assesses five aspects of program satisfaction, including program utility and efficacy, curricular options and individualization, time efficiency and student demands, faculty-student relationships, and learning resources. Program outcomes for the master's and doctoral specialties are reflected in the certification rates of graduates. For example, graduates of the nurse anesthesia graduate specialty are eligible to sit for the national certification examination offered by the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists. In 2013, 100 percent of UMB students who took the certification exam passed within two attempts, University of Maryland, Baltimore140 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 6 - Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment with 90 percent passing on the first attempt. Moreover, the CCNE accreditation document for evaluation and outcomes measurements details the School of Nursing's favorable outcome metrics. Entry-level student 2013 NCLEX pass rates, for first-time test takers, was 96.65 percent (above the state and national pass levels) as compared to 85.86 percent of all test takers in Maryland. sChoo L of Phar MaCy stUdent Learning a ssessM ent Degree Programs and Student Learning Outcomes The School of Pharmacy offers the four-year Doctor of Pharmacy program (PharmD), and four graduate programs, two leading to the PhD \u2014 Pharmaceutical Science and Pharmaceutical Health Services Research, and three leading to the MS in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Regulatory Science, and Pharmacometrics. The oversight for student learning outcomes assessment for these programs is managed by a schoolwide Curriculum Committee, consisting of faculty and student representatives. This committee oversees all curricular changes and evaluates changes to be considered by the faculty. The committee provides recommendations for all major course additions, deletions, and revisions. Substantial curricular changes are reviewed by the Curriculum Committee, forwarded to the Executive Council, and approved by the School's Faculty Assembly. Graduate-level courses and programs are reviewed by the School's Graduate Studies and Research Committee and forwarded to the Graduate School Council for approval. The Curriculum Committee also meets annually with the Assessment Committee to review the education goals of the school's strategic plan, discuss data, and review evidence of progress toward the goals. General Abilities and Terminal Performance Outcomes have been created for the Doctor of Pharmacy degree in accordance with the standards of the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education. Both the General Abilities and the Terminal Performance Outcomes inform course-level student learning outcomes, which define the knowledge, skills, and abilities that the successful learning is expected to achieve by the end of the course. The school's assistant dean of academic affairs is responsible for overall assessment activities in collaboration with the standing committees and administrative committees. These entities help to ensure effective assessment of student learning outcomes. A sample of outcomes for the Doctor of Pharmacy degree are listed below: Participate in the development of patient- specific therapeutic plans Select the appropriate dosage form, formulation, route of drug administration, and or/drug delivery system Provide drug products to patients Use technology effectively to carry out professional functions Prepare medications for patient use Educate patients regarding patient-specific therapeutic plans Administer drug products to patients Perform basic life-support measures and triage patients Maximize appropriate drug use behaviors Participate in the process of monitoring patient outcomes Answer patient-specific questions Identify payment sources and mechanisms for professional services and products Participate in quality assurance processes related to drug use Participate in health education Participate in health policy decision-making processes related to drug use Maintain professional competence A full list of General Abilities and Terminal Performance Outcomes is available in the course catalog at: http://www.pharmacy.umaryland.edu/media/SOP/attachments/ 2011.pdf University of Maryland, Baltimore141 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 6 - Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment Processes and Methods for Student Learning Outcome Assessment A variety of assessment measures and methods are used to evaluate student learning and achievement, both in aggregate and at the individual student level. This includes an annual student satisfaction survey that affords an opportunity to get feedback on student learning; results are provided in aggregate to class year and campus cohorts as they progress through the curriculum. Additionally, student learning outcomes are evaluated in both a formative and summative manner via a variety of methods in the curriculum. Each semester, the Office of Academic Affairs provides to faculty course managers, department chairs, and education department vice chairs the summary data and students' comments from course evaluations on course structure, content, administration, and instructors, along with summary data on student performance derived from Blackboard course sites and Banner. Finally, the National American Pharmacist Licensure Examination and the Maryland Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination scores represent the most basic measurement of curriculum effectiveness. Nearly all graduating students sign a waiver enabling the National Associate of Boards of Pharmacy to release their identified scores to the school, which can then be compared to admission data, course grades, OSCE and APPE performance, and final GPA. Graduates of the School of Pharmacy take the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination, as well as a law exam in the state where the graduate is applying for a license for those states that require it. The School of Pharmacy passing rate for the year 2014 was 97.3 percent. Illustrations of Course-Level Assessment and Improvement Examples of how student learning outcome assessment has resulted in course-level improvement are abundant in the School of Pharmacy. For instance, the Abilities Lab is a series of six courses that occur each semester during the first three years of the curriculum designed to introduce and reinforce contemporary pharmacy practice skills and drug knowledge skills. The sequence includes Objective Structured Clinical Examinations, quizzes, high-stakes practical examinations, and written exams to assess knowledge retention of self-paced study. The School of Pharmacy has used students' formative feedback to incorporate course modifications and a variety of new courses that were not emphasized prior to experiential rotations. Although many didactic courses rely on multiple-choice examinations, there has been a concerted effort to increase the number and variety of alternative assessment methods. Changes have been made to include open-ended case-based questions, debates, and practical skills examinations. Many courses have incorporated lower-stakes quizzes and audience response questions into lecture that allow students to receive formative feedback about content mastery before the summative exam. These changes have enhanced the ability of the faculty to track and assess development of skills over time. The results of these efforts are evident in improved rotation and licensing exam preparedness. Course improvements also have been undertaken in the School of Pharmacy's master's and doctoral programs. For instance, the online Regulatory Science program has been in existence for two years, but has already benefited from student learning outcome review through the Quality Matters program, an international organization representing broad University of Maryland, Baltimore142 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 6 - Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment inter-institutional collaboration and a shared understanding of online course quality. Based on the Quality Matters certification and feedback, courses have been adjusted to allow for building an online student community through increased student- and teacher-initiated interactions. Courses in the PhD program in Pharmaceutical Sciences also have evolved as a result of student learning outcome assessment. The program's courses were reviewed by an external panel of experts and based on their analysis of student feedback two new courses in biostatistics and ethics were added to the curriculum. Additionally, a required course in Principles of Drug Discovery and Development was streamlined into two separate modular courses to accommodate changing student career needs. sChoo L of s oCiaL work stUdent Learning a ssessM ent Degree Programs and Student Learning Outcomes The School of Social Work offers three degrees. The Bachelor of Science in Social Work taught at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, the Master of Social Work, and the Doctor of Philosophy in Social Work. Samples of student learning outcomes are presented below for selected degree programs in the School of Social Work: Master of Social Work Students are prepared: For advanced practice with individuals, families, groups, organizations, communities, and society For advanced practice in a method of concentration and an area of specialization To practice in a manner that reflects the principles underlying the Social Work Code of Ethics and the National Association of Social Workers To practice effectively with, and on behalf of, systems and people of diverse backgrounds and needs To practice with, and on behalf of, vulnerable populations, populations-in-need, and oppressed populations To practice in a manner that promotes social and economic justice To practice utilizing a person-environment framework and a strengths perspective To appreciate the importance of continuing professional development and of contributing to the knowledge and skill base of the profession Processes and Methods for Student Learning Outcomes Assessment The School of Social Work program outcomes are based on Council for Social Work's Education (CSWE) Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS). The EPAS describe four features of an integrated curriculum design: program mission and goals, explicit curriculum, implicit curriculum, and assessment. The 10 CSWE core competencies that all MSW students should demonstrate upon graduation from the UMB SSW include: identify as a professional social worker, apply ethical principles to guide professional practice, apply critical thinking, engage diversity and difference in practice, advance human rights and social and economic justice, engage in research-informed practice, apply knowledge of human behavior and social environment, apply policy practice to advance social well-being, respond to context, engage, assess, intervene, evaluate individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. Individual competencies to be emphasized and measured are selected for each course and are based on the 10 core competencies. Students complete evaluations online at the end of every course. In addition, two dean's forums per year give additional venues for student feedback. The Master's Program Faculty Committee (MPC) conducts five student focus groups per year, and the dean, in his State of the School annual presentation to faculty and students, shares the results of the student evaluations.University of Maryland, Baltimore143 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 6 - Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment Illustrations of Course-Level Assessment and Improvement The School of Social Work makes course-level improvements based on student learning outcome assessment in a systematic and regular fashion. For example, the course Social Work Practice with Individuals (SOWK 630) in the Master of Social Work program was recently reviewed. This course provides students with foundation content on engaging, assessing, planning, intervening, and terminating with clients; along with frameworks for practice. Students also are introduced to crisis intervention and motivational interviewing. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 significantly expanded health coverage and integrated services in mental health, substance abuse, and primary care. In response to the new law, the School of Social Work commissioned research and a report to identify both opportunities and challenges for the Master of Science in Social Work curriculum. Among the recommendations in the report was to increase training content on standardized substance abuse screening instruments. The Clinical Concentration and the Behavioral Health Specialization Committee decided to infuse this new content into the SOWK 630 course. Specifically, screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment training were added to the course. A total of 328 students received an online hybrid and in-class training as a component of the course. Although data analysis is currently taking place, preliminary findings suggest that course changes were well-received by students and they displayed marked improvement in knowledge, skills, and behavior related to the incorporation of screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment content additions. In another example of curriculum improvement, it was identified that students were not prepared to utilize theory in their dissertations in the Doctor of Philosophy in Social Work program. As a part of the review process, a former course was eliminated and replaced with Integrative Seminar (SOWK 812), which specifically focuses on integrating theory and research. The new course examines the relationship between theory and research methods in the development of research questions and research design. The course reviews application of theory and theoretical frameworks, the difference between theoretical and conceptual frameworks, the difference between theories and logic models; various approaches to theory and research within interdisciplinary work; the connections between research and history, policy, and practice; and the role of ethics in both theoretical development and research design. Additionally, at the conclusion of the course students are expected to have an understanding of the proposal and dissertation process. The result of this improvement is that dissertation chairs and committee members report that students are now better prepared to use theory in their dissertations. Moreover, student course evaluations are consistently positive. The school's focus on student learning outcomes has resulted in positive national exam and licensure pass rates. Graduating students take the standard Maryland State LGSW exam. In 2013, the first-time pass rate was 90 percent, 8 percent above the national average. grad Uate sC hoo L stUdent Learning a ssessM ent Degree Programs The Graduate School offers graduate education and training in biomedical, health, and human service sciences. The school offers 23 Maryland Higher Education Commission approved Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree programs, and three post-baccalaureate certificate programs in these areas of study. It also offers dual degrees with the University's professional schools including PhD/MD, PhD/ PharmD, and PhD/DDS degree programs, and participates in inter-institutional studies in biochemistry, gerontology, and toxicology with other University System of Maryland campuses. Master's and doctoral studies have been offered on the UMB campus since 1917.University of Maryland, Baltimore144 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 6 - Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment The Graduate School is organized into two divisions: 1) collaborative master's and PhD programs in association with UMB's other schools as described above, and 2) unaffiliated programs for which the Graduate School has exclusive responsibility for issues such as student learning outcomes. Currently, in the unaffiliated division the Graduate School operates the Master of Science in Health Sciences, Master of Medical Forensics, and three certificate programs in Research Ethics, Applied Thanatology, and Global Health Systems. Graduate School Collaborative Division In the collaborative division of the Graduate School, assessment of outcomes occurs within a framework of Academic Program Reviews. The annual program review for master's degrees and PhD degrees includes the extent to which the program is advancing the state of the discipline, teaching effectiveness, and contribution to the mission of UMB. Additionally, experts in the field assess the programs quality and make recommendations on the specific aspects of how the program may be improved. At the time of the annual program review, UMB's assessment requires educational goals, learning outcomes, and program assessment plan that includes: 1) assessments and outcomes that are consistent with the review of program-level learning outcomes; 2) strengths and weaknesses of the program; and 3) changes made or proposed at the course and/or program levels to improve teaching and enhance student learning.

The student learning outcomes associated with this program include: Prepare students to search, interpret, and evaluate the medical literature including interpretation of bio-statistical methods, access to common medical databases, and sampling methods Deliver instruction in health care delivery systems and health policy Provide an overview of health care system delivery, patient safety, quality and risk management Thoroughly review public health as it relates to the role of practicing clinician with regard to prevention of disease, maintenance of public health, and participating in disease surveillance, reporting and intervention; and Provide instruction in the principles and practice of medical and public health ethics Processes and Methods for Student Learning Outcome Assessment All courses designed in the unaffiliated division utilize Quality Matters (QM), a faculty-centered peer review process designed to certify the quality of online courses and online components. Program and course-level outcomes and instructional objectives for each course are all aligned with a comprehensive assessment strategy. Each instructional objective has linked assessment questions. After each exam, a qualitative and quantitative analysis is performed to evaluate individual and cohort performance. Additionally, mid- and post- course student surveys are used to make course improvements. These data are reviewed by the curriculum committee for the program and the faculty make recommendations for course improvement and monitor implementation and continuing evaluation. Illustration of Course-Level Assessment and Improvement In addition to the routine course-level student learning assessments that occur in collaboration with UMB's six other schools, the Graduate School has robust assessment in the unaffiliated division of the Graduate School. For example, when Bio-statistical Methods (PREV 621) was offered online in the fall of 2014 it had not yet met all standards of the Quality Matters informal review, 17 out of 39 (43.5 percent) students failed the midterm exam, and issues with the statistical package led to significant confusion for students. Midcourse student evaluations during the initial offering of the course reflected concerns about the statistical package used in the course and the need for additional practice opportunities. The curriculum committee met and made recommendations for improvement to the course. Additional practice problems were added and the statistical package issues were resolved. Students performed much better on the final exam and only one student failed the class. Moreover, in post-course analysis, all Quality Matters issues were resolved, weekly practice, and quizzes were added as knowledge self-check for students and formative feedback for the instructor. Videos were redone with shorter length and attention to objectives and a new statistical package was used. At the midterm there were two exam failures as opposed to 17 the year prior with a similar class size of 45 students. The same final exam was used in both years and the final outcome was that no students failed the class.University of Maryland, Baltimore146 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016STANDARDS EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND ASSESSMENT Chapter 6 - Educational Programs and Student Learning Assessment instit Utiona L roLe in sC hoo L-Based stUdent Learning a ssessM ent The culture of student learning assessment at UMB is vigorous and integrated at the institutional level, program level, and course level. At the institutional level, student learning outcomes reflect the extent to which UMB's mission, vision, and strategic goals are met in academic programs within the seven schools. Student learning assessment is an ongoing, institutional process, forging an ethos of assessment in which sufficient resources are devoted to the process. At the program level, student leaning outcomes address the extent to which the degree program is effective by measuring competencies, knowledge, skills, and abilities. At the course level, student learning outcomes address the effectiveness of each individual course and are connected to program-level student learning outcomes. sUMMary The University and its schools and programs regularly assess student learning and use this data to make informed adjustments to its courses and programs. Therefore, the University is in compliance with Standard 14: Assessment of Student Learning.RESEARCH QUESTIONS PHOTO BY Trace Y Br OwnUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore148 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016CHAPTER 7 INSTITUTIONAL APPRAISAL THEME 1 - E DUCATIONAL I NNOVATION AND T RANSFORMATION THEME 2 - R ESEARCH , SCHOLARSHIP , AND E NTREPRENEURSHIP THEME 3 - S TUDENT L IFE, CAREER D EVELOPMENT , AND S UPPORT S ERVICES THEME 4 - I NSTITUTIONAL E FFECTIVENESS THEME 5 - C OMMUNITY E NgAgEMENTRESEARCH QUESTIONSUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore149 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 resear Ch QUestion 1 What, if any, are the benefits to the University of leveraging technology and emerging pedagogical models and tools to improve, design, and launch high-quality, high-demand, and self-sustaining academic offerings? findings Instructional technology will continue to be an evolving field within the world of education at-large and within the schools at UMB in particular. The current platforms within the schools have shown tremendous growth, though major commitments to coordination and planning will be a key going forward. The Need for Increased Coordination To create a more collaborative environment on campus, instructional technology (IT) will need to become more coordinated. Currently, differences in hardware and software make coordination difficult, and the University will need to selectively standardize these IT elements in order to maximize collaboration. With the plethora of hardware and software in the marketplace (desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc.), careful coordination and selective standardization across the University will be needed to maximize collaboration. The goal is to leverage the educational resources within UMB as well as across the University System of Maryland (USM) as a whole so that students, faculty, and administrators all benefit. The UMB Middle States Self-Study Survey responses support the need for improvements in the relationship among University IT resources and IT resources of the individual schools. Coordination requires addressing the universal tension between centralized and decentralized models of IT management. This balance of competing interests will require careful management and oversight.Innovation is the Result of Coordination Increasing IT coordination will help University faculty access and use innovative instructional technologies. However, faculty also need training to use these technologies to their fullest. To this end, faculty development (including sufficient release time from other activities) must continue at both the school and University levels. Enhancing faculty development activities with regard to instructional design and implementation at the University level would allow UMB to maximize current resources and allow faculty members from each school to share best practices. At present, some schools are experimenting with the flipped classroom model of instruction, where students' in-class time is devoted to exercises and projects instead of lecture. This format makes availability of instructional technology critical. Other schools mount virtually all of their curricular materials online. Distance learning, especially as exemplified by the Universities at Shady Grove (USG) campus, demonstrates the need for synchronous instructional technologies in which students and instructors can interact in real time. Audience response is used in several schools, and the Center for Interprofessional Education (described below) already has begun to lay the groundwork for virtual IPE across schools. resear Ch QUestion 2 What actions could the University undertake to promote interprofessional teaching and learning across the professions? findings UMB presents a wealth of opportunities for interprofessional education (IPE). With an IPE needs assessment, the University should be poised to create a road map for the Center for Interprofessional Education. The likelihood of success of this endeavor is supported by the fact that resources already have been allocated by the president and the strategic plan. THEME 1: E DUCATIONAL I NNOVATION AND T RANSFORMATIONRESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore150 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 The Center for Interprofessional Education The Center for IPE is led by the dean of the School of Nursing as director and two co- directors, each from different schools across campus. During the past two years, the center has launched many initiatives, including an IPE website, grant support for faculty seed and development grants, financial support for team training programs (e.g., IPEC Institute and Team STEPPS), and an annual IPE Day. Yet, there is still more to be done. The plan for the center is that it will serve as a repository for IPE offerings across campus and as a location where all students, faculty, and staff can go to find existing and planned IPE opportunities and resources. IPE Needs Assessment In order to guide activities listed above, UMB must be properly equipped with information about the current climate of IPE at a University as well as at the national and international level. Conducting a needs assessment across the University would guide development of new IPE activities. Additionally, knowledge about IPE curricula and initiatives at other leading IPE institutions across the country could help shape IPE experiences at UMB. There are three main categories of IPE experiences: 1. introductory experiences, including early exposure to different disciplines and learning about discipline specific roles and responsibilities 2. simulation \"practice\" experiences, including case-based team activities to use of high-fidelity simulation and standardized patients (SPs) to simulate a safe environment to practice team-based care 3. clinical experiences, including seeing patients in a team-based collaborative setting UMB already has opportunities for students in each of these areas, but not enough to meet the needs of the entire UMB student body. The needs assessment would identify successful existing IPE opportunities and use them as a source of best practices for replication across campus. Innovative IPE Offerings Once existing IPE opportunities are maximized, the exploration and creation of new IPE collaborative opportunities should occur. A review of elective coursework at the University during the development of the strategic plan revealed overlap in areas including geriatrics, pediatrics, oncology, and leadership. Bringing faculty together from different schools that teach similar class content could be a means to create new IPE offerings with relative ease. Another way to afford students and faculty with more opportunities to engage in IPE activities is to leverage innovative technologies to bring students and faculty together and foster collaboration. Space constraints can limit the number of students who can participate in IPE activities. Online IPE learning tools, applications, and technologies should be explored to maximize IPE opportunities at UMB, regardless of their school or campus, and they will need to be supported by robust IT resources. In 2009, six national educational associations of schools of the health professions formed the Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC). In 2011, IPEC developed Core Competencies for Interprofessional Collaborative Practice surrounding practice; roles/responsibilities; interprofessional communication; and teams and teamwork. As existing IPE opportunities are expanded and new experiences created and implemented at UMB, each IPE opportunity should be mapped to the IPEC Core Competencies for Interprofessional Collaborative Practice as well as UMB student learning outcomes. Once IPE opportunities are mapped, IPE graduation requirements can be defined based on completion of identified IPEC Core Competencies.RESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore151 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 Expanded Collaboration For UMB faculty to be equipped to develop, implement, and lead IPE opportunities for students, robust and ongoing faculty development programs must be available. UMB, through the Center for IPE , should offer regular (e.g., every semester) IPE faculty development workshops at varying levels of IPE expertise. Further, an IPE Focused Interest Group could be created as a means for faculty interested in IPE to network and collaborate. Finally, to augment the potential for IPE opportunities, UMB should foster collaboration with other USM institutions and community partners. Many USM institutions have health- related programs that could significantly enhance IPE opportunities for UMB students. Community partnerships also could bring opportunities for IPE internships and experiential rotations, affording students additional opportunities to refine their IPE knowledge and skills. resear Ch QUestion 3 How could the University ensure that its academic programs remain affordable and accessible? findings While the constituent schools of UMB remain affordable, the combination of current state spending trends and prior necessary tuition increases requires acknowledgment that future affordability may be in jeopardy. Affordability Questions of affordability must consider a range of variables. Obvious costs include tuition and fees, room and board, and textbooks and supplies. But given the increasing number of non-traditional students on campus, costs also can take the form of lost wages: hours spent learning are also hours not spent earning. While affordability is usually determined by comparing these costs against expected family contributions (EFC) and potential financial aid, this calculation often fails to take into account future earnings. The ability to borrow today is not the same as the ability to repay tomorrow. Additionally, calculating based on EFC fails to recognize the socioeconomic reality of many Marylanders. As a public institution, the University believes that its programs should remain accessible and should reflect the demographics of the state of Maryland. Recent research suggests that debt also impacts career choice. Students with higher debt are more likely to seek jobs with higher initial wages, and often these jobs fall outside of the categories of public interest and primary care. In fact, one study has suggested that graduates pursuing primary care with higher than median debt levels would need to consider strategies to support repayment outside of earned salary. Thus, in a sense, burdening students with a large debt load is antithetical to the University's mission to improve the human condition and serve the public good of Maryland and society at-large through education, research, clinical care, and service. When considering affordability, the University has a moral obligation to ask itself, \"affordable for whom?\" Tuition and Fees Due to the fact that the majority of its students are graduate and professional students, UMB did not benefit from the prior governor's \"enrollment initiative\" that provided state support in lieu of tuition increases for undergraduate in-state students over a number of successive years. Nonetheless, the University works diligently during each year's budgeting cycle to diminish, where possible, the need to increase tuition and fees as a way to supplement state funding shortfalls. Tuition and fees are set at UMB through both a top-down and a bottom-up process. The Board of Regents must RESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore152 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 approve, annually, proposed tuition and fees for each school and program in the University System of Maryland. It begins the process by setting a threshold percentage by which tuition may not be raised. This information is communicated by President Perman to the deans who then consult with the appropriate administrators within the school to determine a proposal for the next academic year's tuition and fees. (Because there are school/ program specific fees as well as University fees, UMB also has a student fee committee that gives advice and counsel with regard to fy 2015-16 t Uition PRO gRAM RESIDENT TUITION NON -RESIDENT TUITION School of Dentistry DDS $33,692 $62,612 BS Dental $27,138 MPH per credit per credit NursingMS $682 per credit $1,251 per credit CNL $633 $1,217 per credit $692 per $8,329 credit $1,135 per fee increases.) Once President Perman has reviewed the deans' proposals, and each dean is called upon to explain the rationale for any proposed increase. UMB then submits a schedule, covering all schools and programs, to the Board of Regents for final approval. Decisions regarding increases also are made with an eye toward ways to supplement available financial aid. Because of the University's unique structure, tuition and fees differ across the schools. Current tuition for each school is listed in the table below: RESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore153 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 Students also pay a number of fees. Fees standard across all schools include student activities, student government, supporting facilities, shuttle, and technology fees. Each school has additional fees. For example, dental students pay fees covering dental equipment purchases, laundry services, and malpractice insurance. A full breakdown of tuition and fees by school and program . Managing Costs The Office of Student Financial Assistance and Education (SFAE) provides many resources to help prospective, current, and graduating students manage the costs of their education. The office provides prospective students with detailed cost of attendance information for the programs on campus. Prospective students also can easily find information about applying for financial aid and a detailed explanation about how financial need is determined, including information on budgets and expected family contributions on the SFAE website. The assistant vice president in charge of SFAE also is available to answer questions as are trained counselors specifically dedicated by school/program. For the past few years, the associate dean for admissions at the School of Medicine has had the SFAE assistant vice president address all applicants on their interview day. The student affairs staff at the Carey School of Law includes a student financial planning coordinator who assists both prospective and current students with the financial aid process. The student financial planning coordinator can help students to understand the various options available and can assist students in making their way through what can be a complex and confusing process. Current students also utilize the wide range of financial aid information available on the SFAE website. For example, for students who qualify for federal work study, there is an online listing of available positions. SFAE awards over $1 million in non-repayable funds each year through the federal work study program. School specific counselors also offer individual consultations. Moreover, SFAE has a director of financial wellness who offers an extensive variety of financial literacy workshops on topics like maintaining good credit, preparing taxes, and investing. Approximately 80 percent of UMB students receive assistance through SFAE. Roughly $150 million in financial assistance is processed annually for eligible students from a variety of sources, including institutional grants and scholarships, loans, and federal student aid programs. Finally, SFAE provides graduating students with exit counseling and with information on loan consolidation, public service loan forgiveness, and the federal \"Pay As You Earn\" loan repayment plan. For example, SFAE created a comprehensive worksheet to walk students through the process of using the Pay As You Earn calculator. The worksheet provides specific instructions: These calculators were designed to provide borrowers with a view of how payments made under IBR and Pay As You Earn (ICR-A) may vary from the standard repayment plan. With your input, the calculators will estimate your required monthly payment under each repayment plan. The calculator provides estimates for a one-year period, as each borrower's monthly payment is recalculated annually based upon the borrower's financial characteristics (i.e., income, residence, and family size).RESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore154 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 It goes on to literally describe the appropriate keystrokes students should use when utilizing the calculator: INSTRUCTIONS You will need to answer five questions in order to obtain your payment estimate. Question 1: Residence Cell E8 Will you live in the Continental United States (this includes 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia)? Click on Cell E8 and Select YES or NO Question 2: AK or HI Residents Cell E10 If you plan to live in Alaska or Hawaii then use the dropdown menu to select your state of residence. Click on Cell E10 and select Alaska or Hawaii *Question 3: Family Size Cell E12 If you are single with no dependents, click Cell E12 and type the number 1. Increase this number by one for each individual you claim as a dependent for tax purposes. *Note: Tips for married borrowers can be found in the last section of this document. Question 4: Adjusted Gross Income Cell E15 Click cell E15 and enter the salary you expect to earn (before taxes) once you begin working after graduation. Note: Repayment may not begin until several months after you graduate. If you choose a repayment plan that considers your income, then your initial payment may be based upon your adjusted gross income for the year in which you graduated. If you had no income during that year, then it is possible for your required payment to equal zero for the first year of repayment. Question 5: Your Student Loans Cells H9:J16 Your student loans may be broken down into the following categories: Direct Stafford Subsidized, Direct Stafford Unsubsidized, Direct PLUS Graduate, or Direct Consolidation. Do not include Parent PLUS Loans.Remaining Affordable and Accessible The University has worked to keep its educational programs affordable. For example, President Perman has pushed the state legislature for increased scholarships and loan repayment programs. To keep the amount need-based borrowing low, the schools have continued to expand their philanthropic efforts focused on providing scholarships. After out-of-state students are admitted, some are successful in obtaining a deferral so that they may move to Maryland and obtain employment thereby increasing the possibility of being classified as an in-state resident for purposes of tuition. Likewise, to accommodate students who, for financial reason prefer to work during the day, the Carey School of Law offers an evening program and a limited part-time day program. Other efforts across USM include the Maryland Open Source Textbook initiative, which aims to advocate for the use of open source textbook throughout the system in order to reduce costs. UMB also complies with state law concerning textbook adoption and affordability and has compiled \"best practices\" that apply across the board. President Perman values transparency and in the first year of presidency when he was the one evaluating tuition and fee increase requests, he published a letter to all students explaining the financial picture for the University in relation to what was ahead for the upcoming year and with regard to the tuition and fees schedule being put forth to the Board of Regents. At the same time, he acknowledged that the information was being shared \"a bit late in the process\" and promised more student communication in coming years. He has met his promise. Under President Perman's leadership, a Student Fee Advisory Board now exists to provide feedback, annually, with regard to the type and amount of mandatory student fees, including student government association, transportation, housing, and support facilities. RESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore155 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 Still, without a more rigorous understanding of what affordability actually looks like for Maryland residents from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, the University risks becoming increasingly inaccessible. Adopting consistent, evidence-based metrics of affordability would help guide the University's decisions. sUMM ary of f indings and s trategiC Priorities Opportunities exist for the University to enhance its educational offerings through technological innovation and interprofessional collaboration. However, these efforts will matter little if the University's programs become unaffordable and inaccessible.The Educational Innovation and Transformation Working Group proposes that the following be considered in the University's next strategic plan: Establish a Universitywide \"Center for Faculty Excellence and Innovation in Teaching, Learning, and Instructional Design\" whose mission includes enhancing the information technology infrastructure to more fully integrate student learning and faculty development across all schools. Establish \"affordability metrics\" that form the basis of a financial aid program that ensures UMB's academic offerings remain affordable and accessible to Maryland residents from a diverse range of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.RESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore156 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 resear Ch QUestion 1 What strategies could the University adopt to diversify the sources of funding for biomedical and social sciences research? resear Ch QUestion 2 How could the University enhance its research environment to make the institution more competitive in securing grants and awards? findings Diversity of Funding UMB's research portfolio currently contains diverse sources of funding. In 2014, approximately 51 percent of funding was obtained from federal sources, including National Institutes of Health (NIH) and non-NIH agencies. However, compared to 2013, NIH and non-NIH federal funding experienced a slight decrease in comparison to funding from other sources. Noteworthy, funding obtained from foundations, associations, and corporations in 2014 increased significantly in the same year. One example is the recent partnership with MedImmune, the global biologics research and development arm of AstraZeneca, which announced a five-year $6+ million strategic collaboration that includes UMB, University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) , and University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). As a result, total research funding from all sources increased 4.4 percent from FY 2013 to FY 2014. This growth could be sustained by clarifying Universitywide strategies for securing funding from diverse sources. When asked as part of the Middle States Self-Study Survey if their school's leadership had a clear strategy for promoting diversity of research funding, nearly half of faculty reported that they either were unable to judge or neither agreed nor disagreed. A clarified strategy could focus on helping faculty secure NIH funding and encourage the pursuit of funding from foundations, associations, and corporations. Research Environment UMB has enhanced its culture of research, collaboration, and commercialization through the MPowering the State and UM Ventures initiative as well as through the establishment and development of the University of Maryland BioPark. The MPowering the State initiative, a joint relationship with UMCP, attracts exceptional faculty, better serves students, and improves the economic position of the state of Maryland. UMB is engaging its researchers with expertise in bioscience, health, law, and human services with UMCP's engineering, mathematics, business, and social sciences programs to explore different approaches to creating collaborative and impactful results that improve human health. These efforts are aimed at triggering opportunities to bring research findings derived from the collaboration of clinicians, basic scientists, engineers, lawyers, and business experts into the marketplace. UM Ventures, which grew out of MPowering the State, is bringing UMB and UMCP together to commercialize discoveries and create economic impact by engaging partners in industry and social ventures. By encouraging students and faculty and by providing expert advice and business services, more discoveries reach the market. Engaging directly with external partners allows for new investment, expanded markets, and more startup ventures. Lastly, the University of Maryland BioPark is also bringing breakthrough therapies, diagnostics, and devices into the marketplace, and promoting the creation of innovative startup companies. The UMB research community also benefits from state-of-the-art research facilities. For example, the Center for Innovative Biomedical Resources (CIBR) plays a major role in providing specialized expertise, cutting-edge technological and scientific resources to support the robust basic, clinical, and translational biomedical research environment. Although it is considered the administrative home for THEME 2: R ESEARCH , SCHOLARSHIP , AND E NTREPRENEURSHIPRESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore157 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 the UMB School of Medicine biomedical core, CIBR serves as a center of excellence for state-of-the-art technologies and high- tech instrumentation for the UMB research community at-large. Newly renovated space has allowed the physical consolidation of many core facilities in a common area, creating a dynamic environment that will enhance and stimulate high-impact research. Faculty and other researchers can get access to sophisticated instrumentation, as well as highly trained technical staff who can offer support on experimental design, data analysis, and interpretation, and provide training opportunities for graduate and medical students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty within the University and its collaborators. Additionally, the Health Sciences and Human Services Library supports research activities on campus. Opportunities exist for the University to strengthen its research environment by encouraging more collaboration within the schools. Enhanced collaboration can help reduce the silos that many faculty perceive on campus. For example, the University can continue to allocate seed money for interdisciplinary and interprofessional pilot grants. Additionally, UMB can provide ongoing support for upgrading equipment in core facilities and for maintaining the expert personnel necessary for this equipment's optimal use. resear Ch QUestion 3 How could the University nurture, promote, and sustain an environment where innovation and entrepreneurship in teaching, research, and scholarship are recognized, rewarded, and encouraged? resear Ch QUestion 4 How can the University continue to effectively promote ethics and integrity in our research, scholarship, and clinical activities? findings Teaching Each year, more and more students arrive on campus expecting a flexible learning environment from faculty in ways such as the ability to hear lectures at the time and place of their choosing; receiving online resources rather than paper copies of documents and/or books; and the availability of online testing. Innovation in teaching is an important part of moving UMB forward and the faculty share the students' enthusiasm for new models. In their Self-Study Survey responses, two-thirds of UMB faculty indicated that implementing new technology and pedagogical models to improve academic offerings should be a high or very high priority. Investments are being made each year to advance teaching technology. For example, the School of Dentistry purchased 450 new laptop computers to provide a testing environment that preserves the integrity of the examination and all lectures are disseminated using Mediasite. The School of Nursing, through its Teaching in Nursing and the Health Professions Certificate program, trains faculty to design courses specifically for the online environment. Most recently, the School of Nursing has implemented Quality Matters to promote the integrity of online course design. Quality Matters is a nationally recognized peer review process that is designed to certify the quality of online courses and online components. All has not been smooth, however. As distance learning and hybrid teaching become more common at UMB, additional investments will be needed. The teaching technology platforms are not consistent across schools, making online interprofessional teaching more challenging. Many faculty members have not been trained to use technology effectively to teach, and the opportunities to receive this training vary across schools. In the Middle States Self-Study Survey , 25 percent of faculty indicated that it would be difficult or very difficult to implement new technology and pedagogical models in RESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore158 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 their school. Additionally, faculty who are new to teaching with technology regret the loss of relationships with students that they have had in the past, and express concern that this lack of face-to-face mentoring could have deleterious effects. While UMB has encouraged the use of electronic formats, as an institution it can place more emphasis on preparing educators to use these platforms, as has been done in the Graduate School. Research Although research-related costs are high, UMB has responded to this challenge by making significant investments in promising areas for commercialization. The UMB BioPark co- locates academic investigators with commercial life science companies. The Institute for Genome Sciences and the Institute for Human Virology are two prominent research centers that have developed products for licensing. The University also provides significant services to innovators who develop patentable products, like new molecular devices, to transfer technology to commercial applications using the services of UM Ventures. However, faculty indicate that existing workload measures do not adequately capture the effort required to obtain grants and contracts or the time spent helping others to be successful with their research and grant applications. Moreover, faculty responses to the Middle States Self-Study Survey indicated that the UMB Office of Research Development could do more to assist in the development of grant applications. Limitations of physical infrastructure and administrative assistance also were cited as a barrier to research. UMB should work to ensure that all faculty have access to its research-related resources.Scholarship UMB faculty non-instructional productivity is at a high level. For the AY 2013-2014, UMB faculty published 259 books, 5,609 refereed publications, and 810 non-refereed publications. They engaged in 2,301 creative activities, gave 3,790 professional presentations, and contributed 10.2 days in public service per FTE. Faculty who responded to the Middle States Self-Study Survey indicated that these productivity metrics were moderately to very important. Faculty assessment of their school's active support (funds and/or programs) to increase scholarship was neutral to moderately positive. To increase innovation and entrepreneurship in scholarly activities at UMB, three areas have been identified for further development: mentoring programs, non-traditional dissemination vehicles, and mechanisms to improve interprofessional scholarship. Strong faculty mentoring programs can assist new faculty and those that are retooling to develop or maintain a high level of productivity. Faculty mentoring varies between schools and between departments within some schools, but excellent examples of systematic mentoring do exist on the campus. The Carey School of Law's \"half-baked\" junior faculty sessions encourage faculty to share scholarly ideas and writing in the gestational stage and receive expert input. At present, traditional forms of dissemination, such as publications in peer-reviewed journals and books, are highly valued and form the basis for promotion and tenure. However, creative projects are becoming increasingly common among faculty but it is reported that they are less valued for recognition and promotion despite their effectiveness in rapidly disseminating information in a more targeted and direct way. To date, UMB has not been as aggressive at using or recognize the newer media forms (e.g., YouTube) as some of its peer institutions. This should be remedied. Finally, RESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore159 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 in every key stakeholder interview, the issue of silos was raised. Reducing the silos that separate the schools holds the most promise to increase interprofessional collaboration innovation. Recent successes such as the 3rd Annual Interprofessional Education Day, which brought together students from all seven schools, along with faculty facilitators, to promote interdisciplinary teamwork, should continue to be lauded and more activities of this nature should be encouraged. Awareness also should be raised about the existence of and activities hosted by the Center for Interprofessional Education , which was established in 2013 by President Perman. Ethics and Integrity As was discussed in Standard 6: Integrity, the University has successfully created a culture of integrity and accountability. Information conveyed from in-person sessions and written communication corroborates adherence to UMB's core values, Code of Ethics and Conduct , and institutional as well as school policies and yielded specific examples to further demonstrate fulfillment of this standard. Feedback from individuals across the University consistently recommended continuing existing programs and activities that promote ethics and integrity in research, scholarship, and clinical activities and enhance efforts to collaborate in inter- and intra-professional activities. sUMM ary of f indings and s trategiC Priorities Innovation and entrepreneurship are valued at UMB, particularly in research areas where commercialization opportunities exist, and UMB can do more to diversify its funding sources. Innovation in teaching is a developing area, particularly in interprofessional education. UMB should continue to work to increase collaboration among its faculty. The Research, Scholarship, and Entrepreneurship Working Group proposes that the following be considered in the University's next strategic plan: Assess and revise, as appropriate, the \"Appointment, Promotion, and Tenure Policies and Procedures\" at the University and in each of the schools to advance a culture that values and promotes both conventional and non-traditional sources of research funding; inter- and intra-school collaborations in research, teaching, and scholarship; and ethics and integrity in research, scholarship, and clinical activities.RESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore160 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 resear Ch QUestion 1 How could the University pursue a more integrated and coordinated co-curricular program for our students to both support and enhance their academic experience? findings Co-curricular programs are those offerings that complement and enhance an institution's graded, for-credit curricula. These activities help develop valuable skills, such as leadership or public speaking, that are not explicitly included in course learning outcomes. Many co-curricular activities are interdisciplinary in nature and allow for different schools on campus to interact with each other. These collaborative programs often have a large community engagement component to them. UMB has many co-curricular programs, but can do more to emphasize their importance to overall student success. Existing Co-Curricular Offerings UMB has an existing co-curricular program called the President's Student Leadership Institute (PSLI) . PSLI is a self-driven program focused on exposing UMB students to contemporary issues in leadership in order to prepare them to lead in a diverse and global society. According to PSLI's learning outcomes, students who complete the program will be able to: connect with students outside of their academic disciplines be exposed to concepts that explore their civic responsibility as a leader have a greater understanding for the importance of values in professional development be exposed to the role of wellness in professional development acquire a comprehensive set of practical skills for their professional development have a greater understanding of their personal identity and how this identity shapes leadership and followershipUpon completion of the program, participants are invited to an awards ceremony. President Perman and staff from Interprofessional Student Learning and Service Initiatives (ISLSI) recognize PSLI graduates by presenting them with certificates and the UMB Interprofessional Honor Cord, which these students can wear during commencement. Apart from PSLI, UMB offers other programs that can be considered co-curricular. First, there are a variety of on-campus events, such as the Poverty Simulation and Interprofessional Education Day, which provide students with the opportunity to build valuable skills. Second, there are co-curricular offerings tied to specific employment opportunities. For example, URecFit (University Recreation and Fitness) offers its student employees a highly structured training program that covers topics ranging from customer service and leadership to CPR and first aid. Co-curricular content also is available online to accommodate the differing schedules of UMB students. For example, the Writing Center offers online writing workshops that have clearly articulated learning outcomes and feature pre- and post-tests so that students can assess their learning. Opportunities for Improvement The Middle States Self-Study Survey and the focus group data indicate that many students, faculty, and staff do not understand what is meant by the term \"co-curricular.\" This indicates an opportunity to educate students, faculty, and staff about the co-curriculum in general and, more specifically, about its potential value to employers. Focus group data also indicate that there are redundancies in programming across campus. Staff and students often are not aware of offerings in different departments and schools. Efforts to ameliorate this gap include the Campus Life Weekly email, which promotes Universitywide opportunities and highlights upcoming opportunities. UMB should THEME 3: S TUDENT L IFE, CAREER D EVELOPMENT , AND S UPPORT S ERVICESRESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore161 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 continue to work to encourage cross-campus collaboration in developing and implementing programs for students. resear Ch QUestion 2 What trends in the employment market or changes in competition may affect enrollment and training in the University's schools and programs? findings While the employment market remains strong for some of UMB's schools, labor trends have caused a decline in enrollment at the Carey School of Law. Additionally, competition for clinical sites may impact other schools in the future. Trends and Competition The job market remains strong for dentists, pharmacists, and physicians. This trend is reflected in enrollment at the schools of Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Medicine. For example, the School of Medicine typically receives 4,500 to 5,000 applications for 160 seats in the first year class. Likewise, the School of Dentistry received 2,620 applications for the 2014-2015 cycle, and the number of applications for the 2015-2016 is likely to exceed that mark. The School of Nursing also has responded to labor market demands by expanding its partnerships with educational and health care institutions and by continuing to develop relationships with four-year institutions for the school's entry into practice programs. However, increased competition from other programs has the potential to affect enrollment and training at UMB schools. These competing programs include online programs and similar or identical programs offered by other University System of Maryland (USM) institutions and by non-USM institutions. These programs not only compete for students: they also compete for field placements. For example, the highly rated online MSW program through the University of Southern California competes with UMB for social work field placements in Maryland. Special Case: The Carey School of Law The Carey School of Law presents a special case of how the labor market has impacted enrollment. Declines in the market for legal services brought on by the 2007-2008 financial crisis have pushed enrollment downward at law schools nationally, and the Carey School of Law. This decline in demand for lawyers, combined with a perceived oversupply of graduates for existing legal jobs, has resulted in declining enrollments at the Carey School of Law. In 2008, first-year enrollment totaled 306, but that number steadily declined to 206 by 2013. Enrollment numbers have since hovered at the same level. In response to the declines in enrollment at the Carey School of Law, the University and the Carey School of Law are working on a multi-year plan to rebalance the law school's budget through increasing efficiencies, hiring freezes, and re-evaluating other programs. This process has affected training in the Carey School of Law in that some non-essential courses are not offered due to the hiring freeze and the lack of instructors. The law school also has responded to the declining enrollment numbers by working to increase enrollment in the LLM program and by creating a new Master of Science Law (MSL) program targeted at working professionals. The MSL degree is designed to enable students to develop a working knowledge of legal principles and analysis to enhance their careers in highly regulated industries. resear Ch QUestion 3 What is the outlook for the U.S. and global biomedical research workforce, and what, if any, changes could the University contemplate with respect to its graduate and postdoctoral training program to adequately prepare its students and trainees to succeed? RESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore162 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 findings Given the highly competitive job market for academic positions, the University can do more to prepare its graduate and postdoctoral students to leverage their degrees into alternative career pathways. Outlook In recent years, the results of biomedical research have led to important and dynamic changes in the U.S. and global economies, launching the biotechnology industry and changing the way pharmaceutical companies develop new drugs and treatments. Successful biomedical research relies on a talented and creative scientific workforce and a continual supply of highly trained people who can bring new insights to our understanding of biology and disease, and accelerate the translation of this knowledge into better treatments and health benefits for all. Though the outlook for the U.S. and global biomedical research workforce is strong, persistent challenges remain. Even though unemployment rates are low for PhD trained researchers, these scientists face a shortage in academic faculty positions with approximately 23 percent obtaining tenure track faculty positions. Some of these trainees question the worth of spending years securing an elite academic qualification when there are so few jobs available. Alternative Pathways The University should ensure that PhD graduates and postdoctoral trainees are equipped with a broad set of skills that are applicable to a wide range of non- academic careers, such as careers in industry and government regulation. UMB is well recognized for its excellence in preparing students and postdoctoral fellows for academic careers, and it has already made a number of changes to meet the career challenges facing these graduates in order to expand their career paths, and is committed to further development in this direction. For instance, in the past year, an interprofessional course was launched in Entrepreneurship in Life Sciences as a joint venture between GPILS and the UMB Research and Development Office, the first of its kind on campus. In this course, students learn how to assess the feasibility of a life science startup venture, evaluate financial and market opportunities, explore the customer discovery process, author a business plan, and build financial projections. In the past year, a new course was offered titled Leadership and Business of Science. This course covers topics that would give students and postdoctoral fellows the skills needed to be future leaders in the field and to gain a grasp of the business of science \u2014 whether this would be in the lab, running a biotech company, or leading a group in any capacity. Additionally, various schools at the University offer targeted seminar series, skills training courses, internships, and professional development seminars. Other opportunities to expand graduate and postdoctoral fellows skill sets have been established with programs like Toastmasters International to assist in public speaking, a Writing Center to assist students in their writing skills, and the opening of the President's Student Leadership Institute to postdoctoral fellows as well as students. Moreover, offerings like Interprofessional Education Day and the Interprofessional Patient Management Competition not only foster understanding and collaboration across all health care fields but also build interprofessional student bonds to tackle the shifting biomedical landscape of the future. UMB should build upon these existing offerings to create a more integrated co- curricular program for its graduates and postdocs. These offerings also could expand to include internships in the biomedical industry, entrepreneurial fellowships, and consultancy programs. In fact, the FY 2017 enhancement request already has requested $500,000 to facilitate these initiatives. RESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore163 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 resear Ch QUestion 4 In what ways could student support services change to support a more diverse student body and enhance career development services? findings Although the University and its schools support its students in a variety of ways, one area of particular focus should be developing a coherent set of learning modules to assist students who desire enhanced career development services. Campuswide Career Services A recent analysis of student services facilitated by Campus Life Services (CLS) identified the need to develop more substantial campuswide career services. Students rated career services as an area of high importance but low satisfaction. CLS met to discuss the results and determined that it needed to enhance its career services offerings. To aid in this process, CLS formed a Career Services Workgroup (CSW) in 2014. CSW includes individuals focused on career services from each school. In monthly meetings, members share career services resources and collaborate on programs. CSW has found that career services staff across campus have a varied range of career services experience. Indeed, many schools lack a dedicated staff member with a background in career services pedagogy. Most individuals who provide career services have other primary job duties that often occupy the majority of their time. The schools also vary in the range of services they provide, a limiting factor with regard to the opportunities provided to whole student populations. Currently, there are few centralized career services. The Writing Center offers consultations on resumes, cover letters, CVs, and personal statements. Also, ISLSI provides diversity programs to students that include practical skills for working with and within diverse populations, creating inclusive environments, and fostering open dialogues. While these services are helpful, the University can do more to coordinate and strengthen its career services. For example, centralized career services can focus on providing a range of general skills to students of all disciplines. These skills include interviewing, networking, maintaining a social media presence, delivering presentations, and exploring alternative career pathways. Due to the unique nature of UMB's campus, the University should continue to employ a hybrid model, where general career services are offered at a campus level and profession-specific services are provided in the schools. Still, an effective hybrid model will require expanding centralized services and coordinating services among the schools. This could be accomplished by creating a career resource area within Campus Life Services. This program would be staffed by professionals with knowledge of career services pedagogy and best practices. sUMM ary of f indings and s trategiC Priorities To prepare its students to be competitive in today's job market, the University should strengthen its co-curricular and career service offerings. Doing so will help students learn the skills they will need to successfully compete for employment and to leverage their degrees into alternative career pathways. The Student Life, Career Development, and Support Services Working Group proposes that the following be considered in the University's next strategic plan: Establish a University \"Career and Professional Development Program\" that enhances the employment prospects of students by offering learning modules to provide early career entrants and aspiring entrepreneurs with a diverse array of career pathways.RESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore164 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 resear Ch QUestion 1 How could the University design and operationalize an institutional decision-making framework that promotes the University's core values and positions the institution to realize its strategic objectives? resear Ch QUestion 2 What are the key metrics by which the University measures institutional effectiveness, and are they still appropriate and relevant in determining UMB's baseline performance? resear Ch QUestion 3 How could the University capitalize on the robust culture of accreditation among its schools to design a conceptual framework to create a culture of assessment that holistically evaluates student learning outcomes on a graduate and professional campus? findings Shared Governance The successful implementation of shared governance at UMB cuts across each of UMB's core values. The shared governance protocol identifies points of accountability and fosters collaboration and civility in campus decision-making. It also capitalizes on the great diversity at UMB to arrive at high-quality decisions reflecting multiple perspectives, and it can help UMB develop leadership and achieve excellence in the creation of knowledge critical to tackling tough social problems in the state of Maryland and beyond. Shared governance has been successful at the University level. The review of documents and websites, and conversations with the Faculty and Staff Senates and campus leadership all reveal an increased emphasis and commitment to fostering a strong sense of shared governance on the UMB campus since the University's last Middle States Self-Study . Indeed, in the interview with the two senior vice presidents, Dr. Bruce Jarrell and Pete Gilbert, they both stated that President Perman is genuinely committed to shared governance and made this one of his priorities when he became president. The level of activity within the senates and the increased level of communication and dialogue between campus leadership and the senates demonstrate how President Perman's strong support for shared governance is being implemented. However, shared governance is not consistent at the school level. Survey data from a Faculty Senate Survey indicate that faculty were fairly evenly split in their perception of the state of shared governance overall, the inclusion of faculty in budgetary decisions, and the effectiveness of communication between administration and senate leadership. Qualitative comments in this survey indicated some concern about shared governance at the school level, leading the Faculty Senate to suggest that schools and departments should address this issue of shared governance. Staff Senate, as well, has experienced this apparent divide. The Middle States Self-Study Survey also revealed a fairly even split among faculty, staff, and student respondents when asked if shared governance was sufficient at the campus and school levels. The University is aware that the success of campuswide self-governance needs to be replicated at the school level. One tactic would be to commit to follow-up surveys to assess adequately whether the increase in shared governance efforts results in shifts in the perceptions of campus stakeholder groups. The campus is well-positioned to build upon this solid foundation and foster even greater engagement among faculty, staff, and students in future campus decisions and governance, which will only enhance UMB's potential to promote its core values. THEME 4: I NSTITUTIONAL E FFECTIVENESSRESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore165 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 Student Learning Outcomes Each of the UMB's professional schools has an evaluation plan where an array of information is gathered, and students' activities and satisfaction from admission to post-graduation are tracked. For example, the School of Pharmacy (SOP) tracks student scholarly activities, national recognition/awards for academic excellence, board pass rate, job placement upon graduation, increase in fellowship and residency placement, recognition for improved patient outcomes in the community, and patent number. In addition, satisfaction rate, faculty retention, and alumni participation in continuing education are tracked as well as extramural funding, faculty publications, and participation in collaborative NIH-sponsored grants, multi-investigator grants. However, the School of Medicine (SOM) has no overall, summative matrix for trainees' evaluation. Instead, assessment at different levels and for both undergraduates (medical students) and postgraduates (medical residents) is performed. The assessment of students in all clinical experiences, as well as the residents, is done via standard evaluation forms that are competency-based. Tracking is done of students' performance on internal exams, shelf exams, and national licensing exams as well as their acceptance in one of their first three choices of residency training programs, as well as first-year students' participation in community service projects. Students services and adequacy of learning environment are also evaluated. For an overall evaluation of the education at UMB, the University should generate a matrix template with a variety of domains, which builds on the schools' assessment processes and outcomes. A table like this should be stored in a centralized place where UMB administrators can find all data and use it to decide on improvements to student outcomes. The format of the table can be transparent, with the actual results available to central administration and the level of access, beyond faculty, determined by central administration and/or by each school. Public access and publicity may be based on material compiled from the table. A summary of commonly tracked students' activities and learning outcomes will allow UMB to improve the learning environment and allow self-reflection, as well as better planning and allocating resources for the future. Institutionwide Metrics The various schools use metrics to collect important data about their effectiveness. As one might predict in a highly decentralized University, these metrics are developed around specific unit functions and school-based accreditation and reporting requirements. However, many of these key metrics overlap, providing an opportunity to create standard metrics for all schools. After a review of the metrics employed by each school and the University as a whole, the Institutional Effectiveness Working Group selected key metrics that seemed common to the schools and of interest to the University. A list of these metrics was developed and included in the Middle States Self-Study Survey. The survey sought input from the University community and asked members to evaluate the metrics for their importance and usefulness as an institutional evaluation tool. In general, the respondents felt the various metrics were of importance to measuring overall effectiveness in achieving its mission. Such metrics included: Overall research funding Graduation rate Faculty retention Employment outcomes for graduates Licensing rate of graduatesRESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore166 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 While these results are promising, the University community and stakeholders' understanding of key benchmarks and metrics would be enhanced by a more comprehensive plan to share key metrics across and among schools and units linked to the University's core values and strategic plan . sUMM ary of f indings and s trategiC Priorities Since the schools are accredited by their respective professional organizations, they already have tools in place for collecting assessment data. However, not all of this data is regularly reported to the University despite it being the subject of discussions between the president and his deans during yearly meetings and/or formal review. The Office of Institutional Research and Accountability (OIRA) does a laudable job in transforming what is reported into easily accessible reports on its website and reporting the information out to the University System of Maryland (USM) or the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) . For greater transparency and accountability, the University should consider creating a framework to pull all available data up to the institutional level. Not only would this data allow the University to make improvements, but it also would allow the schools to share best practices. Perhaps most importantly, it would allow University leadership to have a more accurate picture of the effectiveness of the individual schools. The Institutional Effectiveness Working Group proposes that the following be considered in the University's next strategic plan: Enhance the University's culture of assessment by adopting a management and leadership framework that defines a set of \"Critical Institutional Metrics\" to assess each administrative and academic unit's progress in key strategic areas, including student learning outcomes, affordability, alumni career outcomes, community engagement, shared governance, diversity and inclusion, fundraising, and facilities utilization. RESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore167 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 resear Ch QUestion 1 How could the University leverage its status as an anchor institution to drive economic growth and community development in West Baltimore? findings As an anchor of West Baltimore, the University is committed to the sustainable success of the entire community. It can fulfill this commitment by continuing to partner with community and government organizations, using its purchasing power to support local businesses, and hiring from the local community. Continuing Partnerships UMB should continue to engage with the community and local government in planning activities aimed at identifying opportunities, setting priorities, and developing strategies for economic growth and community development. The University of Maryland BioPark is UMB's flagship community partnership effort. Its mission is to create a University-associated research park that accelerates biotechnology commercialization and economic development in the surrounding community and throughout the region. Since its first building opened in 2005, the BioPark has created 700 new jobs and provided the community with a new police substation and bank branch. Additionally, a dedicated fund supported by a small portion of BioPark tenant rent has provided grants for community projects, including the purchase of lab and computer equipment for the nearby Vivien T. Thomas Medical Arts Academy, which is a Baltimore City health sciences magnet high school. UMB also should continue its involvement in the Southwest Partnership (SWP), a coalition of seven Baltimore neighborhoods near campus and six anchor institutions. Established in 2013, the SWP holds monthly meetings and large gatherings with the community and anchor institution partners. Several UMB administration staff members have been active, even serving on the SWP Steering Committee. Through its continued participation with the SWP, the University has strengthened the bond between itself and its neighbors and identified opportunities to drive community development in West Baltimore. Nevertheless, the area surrounding the UMB campus is in desperate need of revitalization and repair. To this end, UMB should continue its involvement with Baltimore City government through the UniverCity Partnership, the vision of the mayor of Baltimore and President Perman for phasing in a mixed-use, mixed-income neighborhood on downtown's Westside. A top priority of UniverCity is revitalizing Lexington Market, which is adjacent to campus, to drive economic growth in the area. Purchasing Power UMB is examining ways to apply its purchasing power to neighborhood businesses and help drive economic growth in West Baltimore. An examination of the products and services that compose the majority of UMB's spending \u2014 such as scientific equipment, chemicals, etc. \u2014 revealed that most items cannot be produced by companies in the local community. However, UMB did find potential in local small businesses that produce goods and services such as food and catering. Unfortunately, these small businesses often possess limited capacity to complete procurement processes and market themselves to campus buyers. To help local businesses overcome these challenges, UMB obtained a $20,000 grant to start the Merchant Access Program (MAP), which will develop tools to increase the ability of locally owned food businesses to participate in UMB procurement processes. These tools will enable University affiliates to identify and evaluate local food options that deliver to and cater on campus. On-campus food fairs and off-campus food tours also create opportunities for engagement with local food businesses. In addition, the BioPark THEME 5: C OMMUNITY E NgAgEMENTRESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore168 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 invites local food businesses to participate in regular social events such as \"Science in the City,\" making them more visible to tenants of and visitors to the BioPark. Hiring Locally UMB should continue its effort to hire from the local community. UMB, the BioPark, and the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) collectively hire more than 400 entry-level workers each year, with a majority of hires coming from Baltimore City. Currently, UMB partners with community organizations and other anchor institutions to prepare local residents for positions at UMB and UMMC. For example, UMB is partnering with the Center for Urban Families to create a workforce development pilot program that will link qualified residents to training programs, making them more competitive to apply for positions at UMB and UMMC. Additionally, since many of UMB's educational requirements are an employment barrier to community members, Human Resource Services has looked for opportunities to restructure requirements and make jobs more accessible. Most recently, UMB collaborated with the Life Science Institute of Baltimore City Community College (BCCC) to create a new laboratory research technician assistant position, which only requires an associate's degree. Previously, BCCC graduates were ineligible for positions at UMB because they did not have a bachelor's degree, but this new position provides them an opportunity for employment at the University. resear Ch QUestion 2 How could the University create learning opportunities for students that foster community involvement and service? findings The issue is not necessarily the absence of learning opportunities and thus the need to create them but, rather, a need to make these offerings more visible and effective. The role of the University should be to catalog, coordinate, and promote the existing efforts. Local Opportunities UMB provides many opportunities for students to serve the local community. Typically, student engagement takes the form of mentoring or providing free services. For example, A Bridge to Academic Excellence (ABAE) and Medical Education Resources Initiatives for Teens (MERIT) provide extensive mentoring services. ABAE attracts students from a variety of local communities, who come to campus on Saturdays to be mentored by UMB students in subjects like SAT and AP exam preparation. The MERIT program selects high-potential Baltimore youth and provides them with mentoring and emotional and pre-professional support as they transition into college. The medical students who participate in this program have stated that they seek and value interactions with the communities they serve and that they desire to share the skills they have developed in their programs. In terms of free services, the Carey School of Law provides more than 140,000 hours of free legal advice each year through its JustAdvice clinic. This program allows law students to work alongside faculty members on real-life cases and gain a unique combination of theoretical study and practical experience. Global Opportunities UMB students also have opportunities for global-to-local service: engaging in global experiences where resources may be limited and must be leveraged in creative ways, and then bringing those experiences to bear in under-resourced or poorly accessed areas in the Baltimore community. One such global-to-local service organization is the Global Medical Brigade (GMB). GMB operates under the holistic model of Global Brigade, which is a student-led, nonprofit organization that provides sustained health care relief to underserved RESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore169 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 communities throughout the world while respecting local culture. A GMB operates like a traditional hospital and consists of dedicated student volunteers, doctors, pharmacists, nurses, and other health care professionals. As patients move from intake to consultation and onward to other services, they receive health-related education. For example, while waiting for their prescriptions to be filled in the pharmacy, adult patients attend a public health education workshop and pediatric patients partake in a dental education program, where they receive a fluoride treatment along with materials and demonstrations for proper dental hygiene. UMB's GMB chapter is just one of hundreds of chapters around the globe. Each chapter brings students and health care professionals on one-week trips to areas in Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua, or Ghana that have little access to health care. There, they work together to set up makeshift clinics and see anywhere from 500 to 1,000 patients per brigade. On GMB's last trip, 32 students from the schools of Pharmacy, Nursing, Medicine, Social Work, and the Graduate School provided care for 678 patients in a rural community in Honduras. The Student Center for Global Education also provides service opportunities for students. The center was created in 2012 to support the global interprofessional educational experience for UMB students and to build ties across campus and throughout the world where opportunities for global experiential learning can be realized. The center has facilitated projects in places such as Rwanda, Malawi, Ghana, Brazil, and the Philippines. While some of these projects provide academic credit, all of them require extensive service beyond the traditional credit hour. Coordinating Efforts To best match community, student, and University needs, UMB should serve as a central source of structure and a catalog of activities. This will allow empowered choices and engagement on both the students' and the community's behalf. Cataloging must be transmitted as informational and should not interfere with the autonomy of any program. These efforts, in turn, can help procure funding to build and maintain successful, sustainable programs in the future. resear Ch QUestion 3 How should the University bring about better coordination of our disparate community initiatives to maximize community impact and to extend our outreach efforts? findings Though the University has made progress in coordinating its community engagement initiatives by establishing the Office of Community Engagement (OCE) , UMB could increase its impact by creating an advisory board with representation from each school and from the community. Current Coordination In response to recommendations laid out in the strategic plan and in a white paper produced by the 2012 President's Fellows, UMB has made significant progress in coordinating its community engagement efforts. First, President Perman has created a new position, the executive director of strategic initiatives and community engagement. This position oversees the OCE, which develops and nurtures Universitywide partnerships with external stakeholders, including K-12 public schools, community organizations, nonprofits, and local businesses. OCE's website will eventually list all relevant UMB programs such that anyone in need of volunteers, programs, and services can easily locate them. Second, as part of the OCE, UMB has established the Center for Community-Based Engagement and Learning (CBEL) . The center coordinates, guides, and enhances opportunities for community-based student engagement, scholarship, service, and learning in order to improve the health and RESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore170 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 welfare of the West Baltimore community. For example, CBEL has worked in partnership with the Social Work Community Outreach Service to develop an interactive map to inform University and community members about where UMB students are engaged in service learning locations. Advisory Board To further coordinate community engagement efforts, the University could develop a community advisory board with representation from West Baltimore stakeholders. Such a group would enhance UMB's ability to partner with West Baltimore communities and ensure that community members have a voice in UMB initiatives. The board also should have representation from each school and administrative unit within the University. However, full representation has proved difficult for neighboring institutions. Of the institutions examined, only Johns Hopkins' Student Outreach Resource Center (SOURCE) received full participation from all targeted schools. The Shriver Center at UMBC, a renowned leader in applied learning, civic engagement, and community-based service delivery, has had difficulties achieving full cross-campus participation in its civic engagement due to a lack of executive level participation in planning from all schools on campus. Nevertheless, the success of the University's Diversity Advisory Council and its Council for the Arts & Culture suggest that UMB can achieve and maintain such cross-campus collaboration. To support this advisory board, each school could task a person in its academic or student affairs organizations to serve as the community engagement point of contact. This person would be responsible for having a comprehensive knowledge of the school's community engagement activities. The board should work to reduce the barriers that often hinder interprofessional projects among the University's schools. Currently, when schools partner on community projects, a specific Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) must outline the nature of the partnership. These MOUs must be reviewed by each school and then by the UMB legal office. This process of vetting MOUs takes a significant amount of time and sets up individual agreements for each project. These individual agreements are one of the factors that contribute to the siloing among schools, which can exclude other schools from participating and learning through the community engagement activities. UMB would benefit from drafting Universitywide policies that encourage schools to engage with each other in a more nimble and cooperative manner. With a Universitywide policy in place, more schools should be willing to work together on projects that can more widely impact the University's community-based projects. sUMM ary of f indings and s trategiC Priorities Like many of its peers, UMB has difficulty in effectively coordinating its community engagement activities. However, frameworks do exist that could help the University develop a more cohesive program. For example, the process of applying for Carnegie Community Engagement Classification \u2014 an elective classification offered by the Carnegie Foundation \u2014 could unify various efforts on- and off-campus through the establishment of a common goal and shared expectations. The Community Engagement Working Group proposes that the following be considered in the University's next strategic plan: Institutionalize the University's community engagement strategy by pursuing the standards in the \"Community Engagement Carnegie Classification Documentation Framework,\" with the goal of applying for this prestigious elective classification in 2018.RESEARCH QUESTIONS Chapter 7 - Institutional AppraisalCONCLUSION PHOTO BY Trace Y Br OwnUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore172 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 The University recognized and embraced the principle that its decennial evaluation is intended to strengthen and sustain UMB as a pre-eminent institution of higher education worthy of the state's and public's confidence and investment. To that end, the University chose the Comprehensive Report Reordering the Standards design for its Self-Study to highlight its robust culture of planning and accreditation. This Self-Study design also allowed UMB to appraise every aspect of its programs and services, governing and supporting structures, resources, and educational outcomes in relation to the institution's mission and goals while simultaneously focusing on its strategic priorities. Further, the selected design allowed the University the best opportunity to address the standards in a manner that reflects the unique nature and culture of the institution. The Steering Committee agreed on five themes for the Self-Study and elected to establish the working groups around these themes. To explore these themes, the working groups were assigned specific standards and research questions. The themes were Educational Innovation and Transformation; Research, Scholarship, and Entrepreneurship; Student Life, Career Development, and Support Services; Institutional Effectiveness; and Community Engagement. The major outcomes expected from the Self-Study were articulated as follows for each of the working groups: to engage in an inclusive and transparent self-appraisal process that actively and deliberately seeks to involve members of the University community from every corner of the campus; to produce a Self- Study report that demonstrates compliance with the Middle States Commission on Higher Education accreditation standards; and to develop forward-looking recommendations to move the institution further along its quest for excellence in graduate and professional education, research, clinical care, and service for the public good. The University recognized that community involvement was vital in the reaccreditation process and, therefore, allowed each of the working groups the latitude to fashion the method and approach by which it sought input and active participation from among the various constituents in the University community. At every step of the process, faculty, staff, and students were encouraged to stay informed about the Middle States process through frequent communications from the Office of the President and the Steering Committee; volunteer to participate in a working group; respond to surveys, focus groups, and questionnaires prepared by the working groups; provide feedback via the UMB Middle States website; and to attend town halls and other information sessions to become familiar with and offer feedback on the working group findings.CONCLUSIONCONCLUSIONUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore173 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 After a comprehensive review of the fundamental elements associated with each of the standards, and after a careful examination and assessment of those elements in the context of the University's teaching, research, clinical care, and service missions, each of the five working groups concluded that the University was in full compliance with the standards assigned to the group. In addition, the working groups examined a combined total of 17 theme- based research questions and proposed six areas of focus for consideration under the University's next strategic plan. The themes in the proposed areas of focus included: enhancing faculty excellence and innovation in teaching, learning, and instructional design ensuring that UMB's academic offerings remain affordable and accessible to Maryland residents from a diverse range of ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds valuing non-traditional sources of research funding, research collaboration, and ethics and integrity in the University's appointment, promotion, and tenure policies enhancing career and professional development opportunities for students establishing institutional metrics to assess administrative and academic effectiveness in key strategic areas and institutionalizing the University's commitment to community engagementOne of the University's major objectives throughout this 2 \u00bd-year self-appraisal was to create a \"living document\" that would inform and guide its strategic and other planning activities well after the Middle States evaluation team concluded its visit. The University believes that it has achieved this objective.CONCLUSIONgLOSSARYPHOTO BY Trace Y Br OwnUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore175 MIDDLE STATES Accreditation Self-Study ReportFebruary 19, 2016 A Bridge to Academic Excellence (ABAE) Project formed in 2000 by the SOP to offer tutoring and mentoring to middle and high school students from the Baltimore metro area, with UMB students from pharmacy, medicine, physical therapy, social work, Graduate School, and dentistry serving as tutors.
