In 2019, 48 schools indicated in the Medical School Admission Requirements that they accept applications from international applicants. Between the U.S. and Canada, only 82 medical schools accept international students\u201464 allopathic and 18 osteopathic. international students only make up about 0.6% of all U.S. medical school matriculants Given how lucrative medical school is, why don't more US (and perhaps Canadian) medical schools accept international students? Are there perhaps any legal barriers? (I understand there are probably US Medical Associations that want to protect their industry and so restrict the supply of doctors by for example restricting the ability of foreign doctors to practice in the US, but this doesn't seem to explain why US medical schools aren't free to teach and award medical degrees to international students.)
