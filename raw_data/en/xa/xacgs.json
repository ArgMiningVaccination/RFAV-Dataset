We begin as a group on May 31, 2023 With a drop in melatonin downregulating the immune system and a spike in serotonin enabling parasite mobility during a full moon, it's the perfect time to provide your body with extra support to maximize detox results and evict unwanted guests! The 30-day gut cleanse (CellCore Bioscience's Full Moon Cleanse) is designed to open up your elimination pathways, scrub the gut and get rid of anything unwanted that is prohibiting you from optimal absorption and vibrant health. Over the years, our gut develops a build-up of byproducts called mucosal plaque. This occurs from eating dairy, gluten, processed sugar, and other inflammatory foods over the years. This mucosal buildup can breed an environment for parasites, bacteria, yeast, and pathogens to take hold. WHAT'S INCLUDED PARA 1 Cellcore Science's cornerstone immune and digestive support product provides the type of visible results that you're looking for in your detox journey. In your digestive tract, Para 1 becomes a gelatinous, sticky gut scrubber. As it works its way through the intestinal tract, it scrubs and pulls out toxins, heavy metals, biofilm, and other unwanted elements. It's like deep cleaning for your insides! PARA 2 Developed over years of clinical trials, Para 2 is a multi-herb blend specifically designed for powerful immune and digestive support. Proven natural ingredients like vidanga, neem, triphala, clove, and holarrhena are merged with our BioActive Carbons to create a potent, yet tolerable, solution to pathogen problems. PARA 3 Para 3 is a potent combination of synergistic herbs that work together for optimal effect. Para 3 approaches immune support from a fresh angle. It offers enhanced antioxidant production while addressing systemic pathogens that other products may have missed. This heroic herb combination hits hard on many pathogens but is especially effective against strongyloides, liver flukes, clostridium, and Blastocystis hominis. Para 3 comes in liquid tincture form, which provides rapid systemic absorption and maximum control over dosing. BIOTOXIN BINDER With its optimized binding ability, BioToxin Binder supports your fight against biotoxins like mold, ammonia, sulfur, Candida, and fungal toxins. BOWEL MOVER The result of more than ten years of development and clinical utilization. This is the perfect blend of ingredients in the proper ratio designed to provide non-habit-forming, safe, effective digestive support. Bowel Mover is specifically designed to help promote digestive and detox support while executing its primary function of supporting proper bowel function. This product helps remove all those unwanted guests during the cleanse. PROTOCOL Para 1: 2 capsules 2x/day Para 2: 2 capsules 2x/day Binder: Para 3: 10 drops 3x/day Bowel Mover: Added in to keep bowel movements moving! Start with 1 1x/day. Increase to 1 2x/day if needed. **Make sure all drainage pathways are moving well! Don't stop intestinal moving herbs or lymphatic drainage herbs. Since the parasites are moving more, this could block pathways. Lower your doses if you are uncomfortable. These are general guidelines and can be changed. What past Full Moon Gut Cleaners have to say about their experience! If you are ready to truly optimize this cleanse and heal your gut, add in Dr. Kaisa's Suggested 30 Day Diet Protocol What to eat: (Think real food...on the periphery of the grocery store) Eat moderate amounts of meat, seafood, and eggs. Eat lots of vegetables. Eat root vegetables as a source of carbohydrates including sweet potatoes. Eat some low glycemic fruit like berries, apples, and pears. Eat plenty of natural fats like raw nuts, avocados, and olives. Rice and quinoa are acceptable forms of carbohydrates but keep these minimal. Eat foods with very few ingredients that you can pronounce or no ingredients at all. Foods to Avoid: Remember, removing these foods from your diet for the 30 day cleanse will help you eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal your digestive tract and reduce inflammation. No sugar...real or artificial (This includes honey, agave, coconut sugar, maple syrup, date syrup, stevia, Equal, Nutrasweet, xylitol, etc. ) No alcohol No gluten No corn No baked goods, junk foods, or \"treats\"...even if they are gluten-free (This includes tortilla chips, biscuits, muffins, cupcakes, cookies, brownies, pizza, fried foods, or ice cream. If you question it, it's a no.) No dairy (This includes cow, goat, or sheep's milk products like milk, cream, cheese, yogurt, sour cream, ice cream, or frozen yogurt. ) No MSG or carrageenan No peanuts or peanut butter No soy (This includes soy sauce, miso, tofu, tempeh, edamame, and soy lecithin.) Drink 100oz of filtered water each day. Consider adding some electrolytes to your water. Why Is The Full Moon Relevant? Have you ever noticed that you feel differently at different times? It's not just you. Everything in nature has cycles. The seasons are just one example. And within those cycles are more cycles, like days, weeks, and months. And of course, the cycle of the full moon. These cycles play a huge role in our health because they influence our bodies' levels of neurotransmitters. Melatonin is one. It plays an important role in the body, by fighting off critters so when your melatonin levels are down, critters take advantage. Serotonin is another. It's a \"feel-good\" neurotransmitter. But it works for critters, too. When you have less serotonin, critters are paralyzed. You can see why the moon cycle is so important for your overall health and why it's the perfect time to evict those nasty critters from your body. FAQ's WHY DO THIS DURING A FULL MOON? DON'T THE SUPPLEMENTS ALREADY WORK WELL? As noted in the summary, the increase in parasitic activity, uptick in serotonin, and a decrease in melatonin during this period make your efforts more effective. Think of it like hitting the gas pedal to pass that slower vehicle in front of you. The Full Moon Kit is designed to \"ramp things up\" a bit in order to take advantage of the increase in activity and improve results. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN USING THESE SUPPLEMENTS NORMALLY AND DURING A FULL MOON? Parasitic activity is greater during a full moon period. Leveraging an increased dosage of these supplements during a full moon will help target and eliminate parasites that might be a little harder to find during normal periods. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO SHIP? Once you place your order, you will be shipped your kit in about 3 - 7 business days, depending on your location. WILL THERE BE SUPPORT DURING THIS 30-DAY CLEANSE?
