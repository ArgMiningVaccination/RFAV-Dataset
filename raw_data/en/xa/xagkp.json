Unfortunately, due to modern farming practices that deplete our soil of nutrients, our food supply is lacking in this mighty mineral. Compounding the issue, magnesium is found in whole foods that the standard American diet misses. Modern, refined-food diets are not geared toward the very foods that provide the nutrition our bodies need to function optimally. Magnesium is involved in hundreds of biochemical reactions in your body. In fact, every cell of your body needs it to function. When your dietary intake of magnesium is lacking, it makes you vulnerable to develop certain chronic diseases. Research has linked diseases such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to low levels of magnesium. Fortunately, magnesium is easy to find in foods when you know where to look. It is also generally safe to take as a supplement whether you are pregnant, breastfeeding or trying to conceive. You should always check with your doctor or licensed health practitioner to find out if supplementation is safe for you. Read on to understand how magnesium can help you specifically, where to find it in foods and how to navigate choosing the best form of magnesium for you. Benefits of Magnesium: Stress relief - Magnesium calms the nervous system, moving us out of sympathetic \"fight or flight\" mode and into parasympathetic \"rest and digest\" mode. Recent studies show that magnesium helps to reduce [anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5452159/)and [depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25748766/). Reduces muscle contractions-Due to its regulation of muscle contraction, magnesium reduces tension from backaches to menstrual cramps. Improves sleep- Because of it's calming effect, magnesium is effective in helping folks fall asleep. Taking it at bedtime can also improve sleep quality. Relieves constipation- Magnesium helps draw water into the colon, assisting with elimination. Certain forms of magnesium are not as well absorbed and as a result they work best for the GI tract. Magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide are particularly good to help with constipation. Prevention of migraines and headaches- Some types of headaches and migraines are affected by hormonal fluctuations. [Magnesium deficiency](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12010379/)may give rise to these types of menstrual headaches. Supplementation with Magnesium Glycinate can be a big help in relieving them. Important in pregnancy- Magnesium could reduce the chances of developing issues with blood pressure such as preeclampsia during pregnancy. Magnesium is also essential for fetal development. Bone Health- Magnesium is an important building block for bone tissue. A large 2014 study linked low [magnesium intake](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3953885/)with reduced bone density- which increases risk of osteoporosis. Insulin sensitivity- Research shows that people with the highest intake of magnesium have the lowest risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Supplementation has been shown to reduce blood sugar in some people. Reduces blood pressure- Magnesium helps lower blood pressure in folks with low levels of magnesium, but does not have the same impact on those with normal levels of magnesium. Supports thyroid function- Magnesium is key to help your thyroid produce the right amounts of hormones. [Severely low levels of magnesium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6028657/)are linked with the swelling of the thyroid- also known as a goiter- in those with hyperthyroidism. Food Sources of Magnesium: The following foods are excellent sources of magnesium: Pumpkin seeds, almonds, cashews Spinach, swiss chard Dark beans, quinoa, Halibut, mackerel Avocado Supplementing Magnesium- Which Form is Best For You? Magnesium Glycinate- One of the best absorbed forms, this is the golden child of magnesium due to its calming effects on anxiety, depression and insomnia as well as its assistance in relaxing muscle tension and improving elimination. Magnesium Taurate- Containing the amino acid taurine, this form of magnesium helps regulate blood sugar . Magnesium and taurine also help to promote healthy blood pressure. Magnesium L-Threonate- Formed by combining magnesium with threonic acid, this form is easily absorbed. Animal research indicates it may be the most effective in increasing magnesium concentration in brain cells. Magnesium L-Thronate may support brain health, potentially helping with conditions like depression and age-related memory loss. Magnesium Malate- Easy on the digestive tract, and with less laxative effect, Mag Malate is sometimes recommended for people who suffer from fibromyalgia as it may be helpful to reduce muscle soreness. Magnesium Citrate- Bound with citric acid, Mag Citrate has got a tart taste. it is among the most common to find on the shelf. Due to its natural laxative effect, it is most known for its help in relieving constipation, although it can mildly help with muscle tension and nervous system relaxation. Magnesium Chloride- This Mag will not do much to raise your magnesium levels but is often found in topical creams to reduce muscle soreness and tension. Magnesium Oxide- Combined with oxygen, this not-well-absorbed form of magnesium makes it a good choice for short term relief of acute constipation or other digestive upsets such as reflux or indigestion. Magnesium Lactate- A gentle friend, Mag Lactate is easy on the digestive tract. It's great for folks who cannot tolerate other forms of magnesium very well or who need to take especially large doses. Magnesium Sulfate- This is magnesium combines with sulfur- essentially Epsom salts! This divine salt is frequently used dissolved into bath water. Absorbed transdermally through your skin, magnesium sulfate is helpful to reduce stress and soothe sore muscles.
