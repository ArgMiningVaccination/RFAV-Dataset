What's scalp psoriasis? Psoriasis is an auto-immune disorder where the white blood cells or the immunity cells of the body, instead of attacking a disease, start attacking the healthy skin cells. Scalp psoriasis appears as red, itchy patches with silvery-white scales. It is a common autoimmune disorder in which your body's skin cells multiply at a faster rate than usual. The actual time period for new skin cells to generate lasts anywhere between three to five weeks. But in psoriasis, new skin cells are formed every 3 to 5 days. That's pretty quick, isn't it? Thus, as new cells multiply, the old cells on the surface don't get sufficient time to fall off. This merger of the old and new cells leads to a red, silvery-white scaly rash called psoriasis. And since it is on the backside of Rishi's head, it's called scalp psoriasis.
