In Quechua, the word 'Aya' means spirit or ancestor and the word 'huasca' means vine or rope (cord). The indigenous people believe that ingesting the 'vine of the souls' will invest the user with the power to communicate with the spirit world. Ayahuasca works on not only the thymus gland but also particularly on the gland secretes melatonin and serotonin. Melatonin is directly related to seasonal changes which the body undergoes as a result of the changing patterns of sunlight. There is an increase in melatonin in the body as a result of decreased or absence of light (i.e. in the winter or at night while asleep). The subject succumbs to drowsiness. There are also longer-term effects of melatonin, which are related to sexual maturation. Serotonin, on the other hand, is a neurotransmitter, which is stored in the synapses of the nerves and has its greatest concentration within the pineal gland. It is associated with mood swings, depression and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDs). Disease mainly enters through the pituitary gland (Sycotic and Syphilitic miasmatic disease can enter generative zone). The endocrine glands are \"energy centres\" and so the use of radiotherapy affects the ability of the endocrine glands to process their energy. Allopathic methods for treating tumours destroy the flower - the \"visible\" manifestation. The seed is in the endocrine glands, so this is the area that needs treatment. It is possible to work through lots of medical drugs but prescribe high and repeatedly 1M and 10M. Use high, reduces sickness on chemotherapy. Buddleia - tumours in eyes and ears. There is always a seed in cancer. In eye cancer it is in pineal gland, gives credence to pineal gland being third eye. In breast cancer the seed is in the thymus or the heart centre. People often do not resolve relationship issues when they should. Relationships can be worked on to a certain point but there does come point when they can't be retrieved. Remedies allow this process to develop naturally and the outcome is not our decision. When the heart centre opens all the centres start to open up. People with damage at the heart need a lot of remedies. Often start with NATRUM-MURIATICUM for a closed heart. AURUM, EMERALD, ROSE QUARTZ, SEA SALT. Roots of syphilis are in the heart and particularly thymus gland.
