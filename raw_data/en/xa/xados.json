His background is in business, biology, and nutritional science and he's been featured all over major media outlets and podcasts. He's also the co-founder of Advanced Integrative Health Alliance, which helps empower people with customized health and wellness programs. Shawn and I both get to interview amazing people for a living and learn from some of the world's best health experts. However, there's no way to implement all of the health tips we get on a weekly or even daily basis. Shawn shares what his non-negotiables are when it comes to healthy routines and how sleep and nutrition are really at the core of it. Movement is also an important component, but as I've discussed before, hours of cardio can actually do more harm than good in many cases. We cover what the latest science really says about the best forms of exercise, maintaining brain health, and what's going to give us the best results overall in our health. I always have so much fun chatting with Shawn and learn a lot. I hope you'll join me and listen in on today's talk!
