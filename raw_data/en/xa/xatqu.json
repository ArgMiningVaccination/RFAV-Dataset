These include topical treatments that you can put directly on your skin, as well as lifestyle strategies like dietary modifications and stress management. Like all forms of acne, back acne occurs when the hair follicles beneath the skin become clogged. The overproduction of oil (sebum), the buildup of bacteria, and the inflammation of oil-producing sebaceous glands can all play a part in pimple development. Moreover, since pores on the back are significantly larger than facial pores, they can become clogged more easily and quickly set the stage for an acute breakout. If you are struggling with back blemishes, trust that you are far from being alone. About half of the people with acne have a condition called truncal acne in which pimples can form on the back, chest, shoulders, and torso. This article discusses eight natural remedies you can try at home to manage back acne. Back and Body Acne Causes and Treatments 1 Tea Tree Oil ronstik/Getty Images Tea tree oil, an essential oil long used in aromatherapy, has been shown in some studies to help reduce the number of pimples for people who have acne. Some commercial body washes use tea tree oil as a key ingredient, which could help alleviate back acne. Tea tree oil can cause skin irritation and allergic contact dermatitis in some people. To avoid problems, test the oil on a small patch of skin and wait 24 hours to see if any reaction develops. 2 Natural Exfoliators Herb Dehler/EyeEm/Getty Images Exfoliation\u2014the process of removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin using a chemical, granular substance, or exfoliation tool\u2014can keep pores from getting clogged. With the help of a dry brush, you can slough off dead skin cells that can mix with sebum and cause pore blockage. You can buy a commercial body scrub or you can create your own natural version by mixing brown sugar and raw honey in equal parts with a bit of olive oil. It's important to note that exfoliation is a preventative strategy. It is best not to scrub the skin during an active breakout because this can cause inflammation and scarring. Types of Acne Scars and How to Treat Them 3 Botanical Emollients Ruth Jenkinson/Getty Images Since body creams and massage oils containing mineral oil, synthetic lanolin, and cocoa butter can aggravate acne, try hydrating with plant-derived products that are oil-free or are less likely to clog pores. These include: Aloe vera gel Argan oil Neem oil Shea butter Tamanu oil Sea buckthorn oil Studies involving the combination of tretinoin (retinoic acid) and 50% aloe vera gel improved symptoms in people with mild to moderate acne. On its own, aloe was soothing but was not seen to offer any significant relief of an outbreak. 4 Anti-Inflammatory Foods Westend61/Getty Images Because inflammation and acne are closely linked, focusing your diet on anti-inflammatory foods such as berries, certain kinds of nuts, whole grains, and beans may help reduce future outbreaks of back acne. Studies have shown that eating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids (like fatty fish and chia seeds) and decreasing omega-6 fatty acids (found in canola and soybean oils) can help reduce inflammation, androgen levels, and acne symptoms. Do Anti-Acne Diets Work? 5 Low-Glycemic Foods John Anthony Rizzo/Getty Images Filling up on foods with a high glycemic load, such as candy, sugary drinks, white rice, french fries, and low-fiber cereals, can increase your risk of acne. Studies show that foods with a high glycemic index can contribute to acne by elevating insulin levels, which in turn increases sebum production and male hormone (androgen) levels\u2014both of which promote acne development. To help improve your skin and boost your overall health, follow a diet with a low glycemic load by opting for fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and beans. Low Glycemia Index Snack Ideas 6 Zinc-Rich Foods Westend61/Getty Images Some research indicates that the essential mineral zinc may help tame acne-related inflammation and curb your skin's production of sebum. Zinc is known to reduce the production of the pro-inflammator cytokine called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-). You can boost your zinc intake with foods such as wheat germ, oysters, pumpkin seeds, and spinach. Surprising Immune Benefits of Zinc 7 Reduced Dairy Intake Kristin Duvall/Getty Images Easing up on dairy could help fend off back acne. Research suggests that androgens and growth hormones found in milk products can stimulate acne development. According to a 2018 study in the journal Nutrients, the daily consumption of one glass of milk is linked to a 1.25-fold increase in the risk of an acne outbreak, increasing to a 1.43-fold if more than two glasses are consumed. 8 Stress Management Hero Images/Getty Images There is some evidence that stress can make acne worse. One study found that a group of medical students had more severe acne with increased stress. For help in keeping back acne at bay, try taking up stress-reducing practices like yoga and meditation. Although stress was believed to be a factor, other issues such as heat and humidity contributed to the effect. A Word From Verywell It is important to be aware that the research supporting these natural acne remedies is limited. If you decide to pursue a natural approach to managing your acne, speak with your healthcare provider or a dermatologist to determine if it is safe and won't end up causing more harm than good.
