Ingredients Vitamin B6 - 10mg (as Selenium Amino Acid Chelate) Has the special ability to counteract the toxic effects of heavy metals by working as a potent antioxidant to help regulate oxidative stress. When low in this trace mineral, one could have problems with free radicle activity, causing chronic health issues. Selenium also helps produce glutathione, which is the ultimate antioxidant with powerful effects in every cell in the body and vital functions that include: making DNA, supporting immune health, neutralizing free radicles, assisting enzymes, restoring vitamin E and C, eliminating mercury from the brain, supporting liver and gallbladder function, and promoting apoptosis. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) - 300mg Amino acid found in proteins that binds toxic heavy metals like mercury that is found in silver dental fillings and vaccinations. Heavy metals can downgrade brain health and our ability to manufacture neurotransmitters. Phosphatidylcholine - 300mg Protects the liver against damage from alcoholism, pharmaceuticals, pollutant substances, viruses, and other toxic influences, most of which operate by damaging cell membranes. R-lipoic Acid - 100mg Contains the natural form of alpha lipoic acid and helps to safeguard against heavy metal toxicity by rendering metals inactive and safely expelling them from the body. Studies have found that it shielded the liver against arsenic exposure and has protective properties against mercury poisoning. Quercetin Dihydrate - 250mg Powerful immune boosting and anti-viral properties. Shown to help prevent/reduce the effects of coronaviruses, lower inflammation, fight allergies, support heart health, fight pain, improve energy, protect liver health, and protect the brain. L-Methionine - 150mg Research points to the ability for methionine, combined with folate and vitamins B6 and B12, to help treat the effects of liver disease. Dimethylglycine (DMG) - 125mg Supports liver metabolism and function and helps support the body's ability to detoxify dangerous chemicals. Perilla (Perilla Frutescens) Leaf Extract (90% Luteolin) - 100mg Shown in studies to be an anti-inflammatory & have potentially broad antiviral properties.
