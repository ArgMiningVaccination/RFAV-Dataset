Collins Head, Pain and Palliative Care Service,The Children's Hospital at Westmead Sydney, New South Wales, Australia The World Health Organization document Cancer Pain Relief and Palliative Care in Children (WHO, 1998) advo- cates the global application of the principles of pain management and palliative care for children with cancer. Theprinciples of pain management include the application of the WHO analgesic ladder, appropriate opioid dose escala-tion, the use of adjuvant analgesics, and the use of non-pharmacological methods of pain control. These principlesof pain management should be incorporated into the treatment protocols of all children with cancer, acknowledgingthat treatment options may be limited for some children. #2001 European Federation of Chapters of the Interna- tional Association for the Study of Pain K EYWORDS: treatment protocols of children with cancer, opioids, analgesics, non-pharmacological methods of pain control. INTRODUCTION Pain is one of the most common and one of the most feared symptoms of children with cancer and their families. If current pain management techniques are utilized the majority of children can achieve ade- quate analgesia. It is the rare paediatric patient who develops intractable pain. The WHO has estab- lished principles of pain management and palliative care as a universal standard of care for all childrenwith cancer. Cancer Pain Relief and Palliative Care in Children is a guideline which contains infor- mation on the assessment of pain, analgesics and adjuvant analgesics, and the principles of non- pharmacological methods of pain control for painful procedures [WHO, 1998]. THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF CANCER PAIN IN CHILDREN A survey of British and Australian children aged 7\u00b112 years with cancer revealed that approximatelyone-third had experienced pain in the previous 48 hours. Over half of this group had pain severity in the medium to severe range, and one-third were highly distressed by their experience (Collins et al. ). Information was acquired about symptom char- acteristics from a population of children with cancer aged 10\u00b118 years at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York (Collins et al.). Pain was the most prevalent symptom in the inpatient group (84.4%) and was rated as moderate to severe by 86.8% and highly distressing (`quite a bit to very much') by 52.8% of these children. Pain was experienced by 35.1% of the outpatient group, of whom 75% rated it as being moderate to severe and 26.3% rated distress as `quite a bit to very much'. Although pain is a highly prevalent symptom in children with cancer, its assessment must be con-sidered in the context of highly symptomatic chil- dren with complex illnesses. A study at the National Cancer Institute (Miser et al., 1987a) found that 62% of children presented to their practitioners with some sort of pain com- plaint prior to their diagnosis of cancer. Pain had been present in these children for a median of 74 days before definitive anti-cancer treatment was begun. The duration of pain experienced was not related to the extent of disease. Following initiation of therapy directed at their cancer, the majority ofCorrespondence to: Collins, John J.

NON-PHARMAC OLOGICAL METHODS IN CHILDREN WITH CANCER Non-pharmacol ogical methods ofpain control include physical (e.g. heat, cold stimulation, elec- trical nerve stimulation, acupuncture, massage), behavioural ling, desensitization, artandplay therapy), orcog- nitive techniques (e.g. distraction, imagery, thought stopping, hypnosis, music therapy), according to whether theintervention isfocused onmodifying anindividual's sensory perception, daily value and ashorter elimination half life(t1/2)in Morphine-6-glu curonide onaperkgbasis dose for weight, younger children arelikely tohave signi- with muco- sitisfollowing bone marrow transplantation showed that hydromorphone was well tolerated and had apotency during acute intravenous administration. hasa shorter than thatformorphine.
