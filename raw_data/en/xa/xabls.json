Feeling stressed can leave you not feeling yourself and out of balance. Prolonged stress can really drain our energy, affecting us mentally and physically. When talking about energy, you may have heard people talking about chakras or their chakras being off-balance and wondered 'what are they talking about'? So let's find out a bit more... What are Chakras? The idea of Chakras comes from ancient mediation practices, the word 'chakra' in Sanskrit (the language of Hinduism) means 'wheel' or 'disk' and refers to spiritual energy points within the body. These energy centres, or points, within your body are linked to nerve and organ areas. There are seven known chakras within the body; Crown, Third Eye, Throat, Heart, Solar Plexus, Sacral and Root. Why do Chakras need to be balanced? Balanced chakras is meant to mean your life energy, prana or gi (we all have different names for it) is flowing freely, openly and clear within the body, and you feel on top of the world! When this is happening, it is believed to stimulate your health and wellbeing. So if this magical energy becomes blocked it can generate physical, mental, or emotional imbalances that manifest as stress, anxiety or tiredness. How do I know if my Chakras are not balanced? You might just be feeling 'off', unwell, or you may just feel like nothing is going your way lately. You may be able to match what is wrong with the chakra that needs balancing, such as feeling ungrounded or pains in your feet or legs could well be linked to your root chakra. If it feels more complicated, you may want to see a therapist who works with energy to get a deeper understanding of what needs aligning, such as a reiki practitioner. So how can essential oils help? Essential oils can have amazing power on the body, mind and soul to achieve homeostasis, and this can be adapted to support your chakras. As with any aromatherapy practice, there are several ways you can work with oils, such as oil blends for massage, use of oils in a diffuser or perhaps a pulse point roller ball, this may depend on the Chaka you are trying to balance.
