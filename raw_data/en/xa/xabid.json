We know women at that age start entering perimenopause, menopause, and beyond. We are discussing how homeopathy can help with menopause relief with Sarah. Sarah is a natural menopause expert as well as a homeopath. Joining me live from the UK. Thank you so much, Sarah. Menopause Expert Sarah: Great to be here. Thank you for inviting me, Amita. NourishDoc: Absolutely. Let's start with a little about what made you go into this particular area of menopause. Then we talk about homeopathy and beyond. Menopause Expert Sarah: Yeah, sure. Well, I mean, I guess my story starts with my perimenopause. Of course, suffering often takes you into these things, and at forty-five, I was in my second career. I was in a very demanding career as a corporate management consultant. I also had a toddler because I had a child at forty-one, and I started feeling awful, like super tired. Weak. I couldn't get up the stairs without; there are two flights of stairs here; I couldn't get up the stairs without stopping twice. I have a serial infection, and my memory wasn't working. I was dropping the ball at work, and probably the biggest issue was that I got so anxious. So I was becoming anxious about things that had never been man's choice. I was getting anxious about things I could do in my sleep before, and I just put it down to stress and having a lot on my plate. And I had never heard of perimenopause. It wasn't even on my radar, and I didn't know that perimenopause started in your 40s while you still have a period. So I was like many women are now; about 83% of women say they don't know this stuff about perimenopause. And so it is like a bit of a hidden saboteur because I was so ill. I went to see a homeopath, and the results were so amazing that I thought, oh my goodness, I have to study this. So I left my career as a management consultant and did a three-year degree in homeopathic medicine. Then I started specializing in menopause to do it naturally and help others. How Homeopathy For Menopause Can Help? NourishDoc: Okay? Then I think let's talk about homeopathy first. Then the second question is, what is homeopathy give relief to women going into perimenopause and menopause? Menopause Expert Sarah: Yeah, good idea. So, it's good to explain homeopathy first because many people are unfamiliar with it. Many people think that homeopathy means herbs and supplements and diet, which it's not. We may add that. Homeopathy is a different system of medicine that is different from herbal medicine. It's different from Chinese medicine, ayurvedic medicine, or naturopathy. Homeopathy gives nano doses of [natural substances designed to stimulate the person's self-healing and immune system](https://www.nourishdoc.com/health/how-to-boost-immunity-weak-immune-system-naturally). So, the healing is not being done by the pill itself. The body itself does the healing; the pill triggers the self-healing system. So it's a bit like vaccination. But it's very gentle, it's very natural, and It has no side effects. And it's the second most popular system of medicine after mainstream. It's used by something like two or three hundred million people worldwide. And it can be used for everything from physical stuff like bruises, coughs, colds, and flu to more chronic stuff like asthma. It can be used for viral and bacterial affections. It can be used for psychological and emotional trauma, anxiety, and depression. Homeopathic Remedies Manages Many Symptoms So, that's homeopathy. So when it comes to menopause, I've used it successfully for many, many symptoms. I mean, on my growing list of [menopause symptoms](https://www.nourishdoc.com/health/acupuncture-for-menopause-symptoms). I'm so far at about fifty-two possible [symptoms for menopause and perimenopause](https://www.nourishdoc.com/health/perimenopause-symptoms-natural-remedies). But I've used it successfully with that exhaustion that I went through often hits women in perimenopause. I've successfully used it for [anxiety and panic attacks](https://www.nourishdoc.com/case/anxiety-panic-attackes) for sleep issues. I see my homeopath, and in my menopause journey, I've struggled with insomnia. Homeopathy has got my amazing sleep map. It helps with mood swings, headaches, night sweats, and hot flashes. So, I won't go through all 50 symptoms, but it helps. Menopause Case Study: Gallbladder, Hip, Thigh Pain, Hair Loss NourishDoc: Okay, so we want to validate some case studies or one of your client case studies that you can talk about a couple of clients and their journey with us and what it is that we did, which would help us more. Menopause Expert Sarah: Yeah. So, I'm going to call her Virginia to cover her identity. When she came to me, she was doing postmenopausal [adrenal fatigue](https://www.nourishdoc.com/webinars/how-to-fix-adrenal-fatigue-naturally). She was exhausted. And in fact, the test showed that she was on the edge of burnout. Her cortisol, her adrenals, they were shocked. She was like on the floor and was in a position many women are in at this age. This is a midlife thing. It's like our generation, often called the sandwich generation. It's because they're sandwiched between still having children at home; she also had an elderly sick mother and was running her own business. And she was on the floor. She wasn't sleeping well. she had very irritable with her husband. She was also very anxious. She had no boundaries whatsoever. She found it very difficult to say no to demanding clients or no to the family that was making demands of her. She had headaches, neckaches, and shoulder aches. She had what was being called sciatica, but I think it was gallbladder, hip, and thigh pain. What else did she have? Oh, she had [hair loss](https://www.nourishdoc.com/health/how-much-hair-loss-is-normal). So, she was losing her hair. And I took her, we approached it the way I do in that particular program which is an integration of testing, hormonal testing, nutrition with nutritionists that I work with, and homeopathy, and that together, it brought, I mean, it all those things went. She started sleeping again. She was getting much better at saying no. She manages to shift her mother to make other arrangements for her mother rather than being the only one in the family burdened with her care. And her hairdresser started remarking on the fact that her hair was growing again. And she got rid of the anxiety and the irritability. So that that's one case study. Another quite interesting one is somebody whom I'll call Mary. What was interesting about her is that I identified pretty quickly had liver issues. So she came to me with perimenopausal rage and migraines. Before her 40s, she had only had rage and migraines before her period. So as all homeopaths do, I told her, \" Listen, when did these headaches and mood issues start before your periods? And she said, oh, it was about 20 years ago. And I said, so, what happened 20 years ago? She said, well, I was treated for acne. And I was treated with the birth control pill with lots and lots of antibiotics and with a very powerful drug called, and one of the side effects of it can be depression, so she was put on antidepressants. So, this made me include as a homeopath that her liver was overloaded with all the drugs she had been through and that we wouldn't get anywhere if we didn't clear the liver. So I started her on homeopathic liver detox, and she sent me an email ten days later. She said oh my goodness, this had been a rollercoaster. She said that after five days, I broke out in boils. Now as a homeopath, that's a good sign because that shows that the toxins in the liver are moving to the skin. Then the boils cleared, and she said I feel like a completely different person. It cleared both the migraines and the rage. And that I was only starting the treatment with her. So those are a couple of stories or cases. Personalized Homeopathic Remedies For Menopause NourishDoc: Okay, so my question is, this is incredible. But my question is, did you treat these women with only one homeopathic remedy, or were they multiple remedies? We don't want to know the exact medicine name. However, we want to understand, on a level, whether there was any exercise, diet, or homeopathy. It was an integrative approach. Do you want to expand on that? Menopause Expert Sarah: Yes, yes, it's a good question. So, so what happens when you see a homeopath? I always tell people it's very different from mainstream medicine. When you see a doctor, mainstream medicine works according to the principles, mainly of one ill, one diagnosis equals one pill. So, if you go to the doctor and ask for help with menopause, the main thing you'll be given is HRT. It might be slightly different doses or slightly different to get given some progesterone or some estrogen gel. But it's mainly one thing. Whereas with homeopathy, there are 550 [homeopathic medicines](https://www.nourishdoc.com/case/effectiveness-of-homeopathic-medicine-for-anxiety-and-depression) for hot flushes alone. So, the way that we work in homeopathy is that it's a journey. It's not an event. So, you will start, you get an intake session for 2 hours, where I take all your symptoms, mental, physical, emotional, and emotional. Your medical history and your ancestral history, and then I prescribe for where you are right now. Once that remedy's done its work, the next layer will come up, and you'll show a different remedy state. So you will progress through a different remedy, and I'd use different methods for different people. So with Virginia, that I talked about. I did a triad method where we treated one remedy for inherited stuff. One remedy was for her physical and emotional symptoms, and the third was to support her adrenal glands under pressure. Does that give you an idea of how it worked with a homeopathic process? Now I have two programs, but in this program which is the treatment program, you also when you've done the Dutch test, which is a very advanced hormone test. Then you see the nutritionist I work with. She was looking at your diet, your health history, and your lifestyle, and will look at what is the best nutrition for you given what your test results show and what your symptoms are. She and I talk to each other. On another program, I do group work where you learn the best diets, sleep tips, exercise for your energy level, and stress reduction techniques, and then you're given more of a broader spectrum combination of homeopathic remedies to help generally settle the hormones. How Much Time Does Homeopathy Take To Heal? NourishDoc: Okay, I know, that makes sense, and then the last question is, how much time did it take? Because menopause and perimenopause, the symptoms I was reading about online, can last for years. It's not just like, right? It's almost like a chronic condition, that a chronic condition phase that women go through at that time. So, how much time is she still on homeopathy medication? Or did she take it for a few months? How did you manage that? Menopause Expert Sarah: Yeah. So, that's a very good point; they say the average length of menopause symptoms, and like 80% of women have menopause symptoms, is ten years from perry to post. So, that's why when I see people in a treatment program, I see them for a minimum of 6 months. I would probably sell more programs if I said three months. However, I don't feel the integrity to say that because often, the menopause symptoms are a. Let me put this another way. What happens in menopause, in my view, is anything unresolved in your system, be it physical, like for me, it was digestive weaknesses, or be it emotional, like you have trauma in your history or you have relationship history issues and poor boundaries. They all come up like this. In menopause, it takes time to work through all that because they've taken a lifetime actually to develop and get you to that point. If that makes sense, I would say a minimum of 6 months. The woman that you said, is she still seeing me? She saw me for the six-month program. She was in a pretty good space but wanted to do more. So, she did a bit more homeopathy. I don't see her now. So, I see some people anywhere from six to 9 months. Some people want to keep going because they find that it's helping them grow emotionally. So for me, I see a homeopath every month. I have done it for 10 or 12 years because it also helps with personal development; they say there are three levels of healing in homeopathy. Curing illness creates health, strengthens vitality, reduces susceptibility to disease, and increases longevity. Then there's a level of fulfillment that gets you more on your life path. I have had people who may have come to me for past clients, not menopause clients, but they've come to me for, say, [irritable bowel syndrome](https://www.nourishdoc.com/health/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs-symptoms-causes-and-natural-treatments). I can think of one woman who came for irritable bowel syndrome, and she ended up she and she was working in fashion PR. She ended up retraining to be a psychotherapist. So it got her on track as well with her life path. NourishDoc: This is great.
