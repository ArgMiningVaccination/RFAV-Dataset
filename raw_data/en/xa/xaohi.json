Raindrop Technique\u00ae was created by Gary Young, the founder of Young Living Essential Oils. It combines the art of aromatherapy with the techniques of Vita Flex (a form of reflexology) and a feathering technique known as effleurage, a light touch \"skimming\" process commonly used in Swedish massage. Raindrop Technique uses a layering process of nine different Young Living therapeutic and medicinal grade essential oils. The oils are applied, one at a time, to the soles of the feet using the Vita Flex process. Then, one at a time, the oils are dropped from about six inches above the spine, simulating rain drops. The oils are then feathered in and along the spine. To complete the session, a warm, moist towel is applied to the back to accelerate the oils penetrating the skin and reaching sub-dermal and cellular levels of healing. Raindrop Technique operates on the premise that the oils interact with the electrical field around the body (also known as the energy field) before the oils even begin to penetrate the skin. This greatly enhances the electromagnetic and healing properties of the oils. Raindrop Technique has been known to: - support the immune system - reduce inflammation - ease respiratory discomfort - enhance detoxification - relax muscles - relieve body and joint pain - reduce bacterial pathogens - boost concentration - balance energy - lift the spirit - restore calm We focus the essential oils directly on the spinal column because viruses and bacteria can lie dormant along the spine. The oils create an environment that is not hospitable to these \"foreign\" agents in our bodies and causes them to be eliminated naturally. Raindrop Technique is a very gentle therapy and offers you the opportunity to completely relax while improving your overall wellbeing on all levels. The effects are cumulative over several sessions, and the results can vary depending on the individual.
