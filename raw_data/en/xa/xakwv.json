The Goals were adopted by all United Nations Member States in September 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which sets out a 15-year plan to achieve the Goals and their related targets. Never before had world leaders pledged common action across such a broad and universal policy agenda. The 17 Goals are interconnected, apply to all countries, and need to be carried out by all stakeholders - governments, the private sector, civil society, the United Nations system and others - in a collaborative partnership. This year marks the midpoint of SDG implementation. However, on its current course, the world may miss many Sustainable Development Goals targets by 2030. For the first time in decades, development progress has stalled and even reversed under the combined weight of climate disasters, conflict, economic downturn and the lingering aftermath of COVID-19. The SDG Summit, held on 18 to 19 September 2023 at the UN Headquarters in New York is a unique opportunity for the world to pivot from crisis to development and deliver the breakthroughs needed to achieve the Goals. This exhibit illustrates the Sustainable Development Goals through photos from around the world, bringing to life what the 17 Goals mean for people on the planet. This exhibit was produced by the UN Department of Global Communications. [GOAL 1: No Poverty](#sdg1) [GOAL 2: Zero Hunger](#sdg2) [GOAL Health Institutions](#sdg16) [GOAL 17: Partnerships for the Goals](#sdg17) NOW IS THE TIME FOR CHANGE ActNow is the United Nations campaign for individual action on climate change and sustainability. Every one of us can help limit global warming and take care of our planet. By changing our habits and making choices that have less harmful effects on the environment, we have the power to confront the climate challenge and build a more sustainable world. Now is the time for change. A confluence of multiple global crises have upended our lives. The way we work, the way we interact, the way we move about. This can be a turning point. Let's seize the moment and change course - toward more sustainable lifestyles. Small changes in your daily life can save you money, improve your health and help cut harmful pollution. [ActNow](https://www.un.org/en/actnow/) is the United Nations campaign for individual action on climate change and sustainability. Every one of us can help limit global warming and take care of our planet. By changing our habits and making choices that have less harmful effects on the environment, we have the power to confront the climate challenge and build a more sustainable world. The [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/) is guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and is grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As such, the Agenda's Sustainable Development Goals aim not only to achieve sustainable development in its three dimensions - economic, social and environmental - but also to foster peaceful, just and inclusive societies, realizing the human rights of all. They offer a blueprint for tackling the defining issues of our time, such as climate change, which requires urgent and transformative action that leaves no one behind. The United Nations and its agencies, funds and programmes are working with Member States, civil society, the private sector and other stakeholders to accelerate progress toward the Goals, in a spirit of global solidarity, focused in particular on the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable.
