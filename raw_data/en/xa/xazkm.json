Introduction The Western perspective on health care has been focused on medications for treatment of health care conditions. It was common for pain to be treated with various levels of opioids and receiving prescriptions for medications with each physician visit. Sadly, over time, opioids and antianxiety medications were abused, with the result of these medications purchased from drug dealers, overdosing, and death. The federal government and states stepped in, passing laws monitoring prescriptions written for opioids; therefore, a search for alternative medicine began. Alternative methods were found in the Eastern perspective on health care. Yoga, Pilates, mindfulness meditation, acupuncture, and scented oils were used with massage. Westerners found many alternative methods to treat medical conditions, such as pain, anxiety, depression, and insomnia, with scented oils from various plant sources. The pendulum began to swing from Western medication to an Eastern holistic approach. Aromatherapy emerged and was embraced as an alternative medicine for many medical conditions. This article investigates the use of clinical aromatherapy. Credibility is seen in the historical evolution and nursing theorist support. Aromatherapy regulation of guidelines, plant sources for aromatic oils, and safe use of essential oils in symptom management in clinical aromatherapy is reviewed. Suggestions are recommended for a best practice model for clinical aromatherapy. Clinical aromatherapy Aromatherapy is a fast-growing complementary therapy worldwide. According to the National Institutes of Health National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, Americans spend more than $30.2 billion annually on this therapy. [1](#bib1) It is predicted the global market will grow in spending to $5 trillion by 2050. [2](#bib2) Aromatherapy also is called integrative medicine. [3](#bib3) It is especially important for frontline nurses to understand the difference between alternative therapy and integrative therapy. In alternative medicine, the therapy works as an addition to conventional medical treatment, whereas integrative therapy is solo and replaces any conventional medical care. The National Institutes of Health National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health developed categories for these therapies\u2014mind-body therapy, biologically based practices, manipulative and body-based practices, energy medicine, and whole medical systems, such as Ayurvedic medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. [3](#bib3) , [4](#bib4) Nursing health care aromatherapy falls into the category of mind-body therapy. Nursing health care uses essential oils to complement therapeutic interventions, decrease anxiety. It is expected that the plant-based essential oil applications can be measured, such as a preanxiety symptoms, interventions with essential oil, and postanxiety symptoms. The outcome from the administration of essential oil can be measured with a pre anxiety level and post level of anxiety to determine if the essential oil is effective. [4](#bib4) , [5](#bib5) Worldwide historical evolution of aromatherapy Aromatherapy has been used for thousands of years. Hippocrates, father of modern medicine, advocated the use of aromatherapy due to his belief that aromatic baths and scented massage were key to good health. Essential oils leaders emerged, supporting aromatherapy as a credible therapy for mind, body, and spirit. [Table 1](/pmc/articles/PMC7520654/table/tbl1/) summarizes major historical timelines of countries and cultural influences, validating aromatherapy as medical, clinical, and holistic. Table 1 |Country||Cultural Therapy| |Egyptian culture||Resins, balms, and fragrant oils| Papyrus Ebers wrote a famous manuscript about aromatic medicine. This is believed to be around 2800 bc. |Iraq||A skeleton was found 30,000 years ago with concentration of extracted plant essential oils.| |India||The Ayurveda natural system of medicine was based on disease due to an imbalance of stress in a person's consciousness.| Need to regain balance by internal purifications followed by special diet, herbal remedies, massage therapy, yoga, and meditation |China||Shen Nung's manuscript listed 350 plants in 2800 bc.| Ayurvedic physicians are called holy men. Indian shamans are known as perfumeros, from scents of plants. Chinese culture still embraces herbal medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine Based on harmony energy of yin-yang Opposites balance is key to health. Imbalance have illness Acupuncture, cupping, herbal teas, powders from plants, meditation, and herbal burning near skin |Greece||Theophrastus inherited the botanic garden from Aristotle. He wrote a book about specific uses and formulas for aromatics.| Kyphi formula contained 16 plants and was used for sleep and anxiety, to soothe skin, and as an antidote for snake bite. He became the father of botany. Hippocrates wrote about aromatic baths and antibacterial properties and urged people to carry aromatic plants for protection. Pedanius Dioscorides wrote De Materia Medica covering 700 plants, including aromatics. Pre-Christian era emerged with the belief that essential oils were pagan. In response, Pope Gregory the Great passed a law banning all aromatics. Works of Galen and Hippocrates were smuggled to Syria for safekeeping. |Arabia||Ibn Sina, an Arabic physician, used aromatics, such as senna, camphor, and cloves, for medical treatment.| Inhaled henbane was used as anesthetic. Topical sugar was used to stop bleeding. Rose or orange blossom was used as flavor to medicine. This led to the manufacturing of medicine. Medical aromatherapy emerged in the third century. The first private apothecary shop opened in Baghdad. with dispensing medicines. such as tinctures, suppositories, inhalants, and pills. |German||Hieronymus Braunschweig a surgeon and botanist, wrote a book on distillation of oils from plants that included 25 oils| |France||In 1919, Gattefoss\u00e9, a famous chemist, was burned in an explosion in his laboratory.

Shirley Price authored Aromatherapy for Healthcare Professionals. She is known for clinical use of essential oils. In 1961, Marguerite Maury, a nurse, published Le Capital \"Jeunesse\". This book classified clinical departments' use of essential oils, such as surgery and spa treatment. Maury won 2 international awards for her research. Nursing theorists support for health care aromatherapy Historical evolution of medical, clinical, and holistic uses of essential oils is embraced by 8 major nursing theorists. Their theoretic frameworks and concepts reflect the use of clinical aromatherapy as a patient-centered and holistic approach for balancing physical health, spiritual needs and well-being. The 8 theorists' embracement confirms health care aromatherapy is a credible alternative method ( [Table 2](/pmc/articles/PMC7520654/table/tbl2/) promotes personal growth| |Martha Rogers| Unitary human beings and their environment are one |Interrelationship between people and plants| |Sister Horta| Basic human needs |Restore balance, |Promote holistic patient comfort| |Jean Watson| Transpersonal care |Holistic harmony caring interactive healing relationship such as massage and talk|[4](#bib4) Regulation guidelines for essential oils The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States guidelines classify essential oils for aromatherapy as cosmetics, because they are not drugs for treating or prevention of a disease. [10](#bib10) Therefore, aromatherapy essential oils are not regulated by the FDA. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) monitors unsafe products. [11](#bib11) The CSPC enforces federal laws to protect consumers against unreasonable injury and death from products. [12](#bib12) The following are examples of how these 2 federal organizations monitor essential oils. - 1.Aromatherapy waterless vaporizers and diffusers were recalled due to a defective heater causing a fire multiple times with consumers. The CPSC had the authority to cease the sale of the products and refund consumers. [11](#bib11) - 2.The FDA protects consumers from false claims and mislabeled products that mislead the public. Surveillance found Quinessence Aromatherapy Ltd posted on their website advertisement that essential oils protect against and cure coronavirus disease-2019. (COVID-19). This false statement triggered a FDA letter warning to the owner to take the information off their website within 48 hours and cease the sale of essential oil for prevention and cure of COVID-19. These 48 hours included developing a plan to be approved by the COVID-19 Task Force. The company was located in Europe with essential oils sold in the United States. The owner ignored the warning. Due to the fraudulent statement describing essential oils as a curing drug for COVID -19, a second joint letter was sent to the owner by the FDA, CPSC, the secretary of Health and Human Services, and the U.S. Public Health Services ordered the owner of the company to immediately take down the website and cease the sell of essential oils as a curing drug. The company's website was also put on the federal surveillance website list. Administrators were ordered to cease sale and remove from the Web site immediately. This incidence of a false claim has brought awareness that currently essential oils are complementary therapy and do not treat and/or prevent a disease. Sellers need to be aware of descriptions of aromatherapy and consumers need to know that aromatherapy is complementary. [12](#bib12) Nurse awareness of essential oils plant sources and uses Essential oils are used every day for their aromatic scents\u2014for example, perfumes, candles, essential oil plug-ins, scented aerosol sprays for the home, fabric softeners for clothes, hair shampoos, and spices to add flavor to food. Essential oils also are used in over-the-counter herbs and added to medications to add a pleasant flavor to bitter medications.

Nursing commonly uses topical skin application of essential oil for administration. If a facility has an integrative medicine department, massage therapy usually includes an essential oil. The following is an overview of the 4 methods by which essential oils are absorbed. - 1.Topical application with skin absorption of the essential oil. Examples include massage, scented bath, cosmetics, and perfumes. - 2.Absorption of the essential oil by inhaling in nostrils. Examples include direct inhalation via diffuser with steam, aroma stones, and oil-scented strip of cloth. Indirect absorption examples include scented room spray and heated candle wax, detergent, and bathroom and floor cleaners. - 3.Oral absorption of the essential oil. Examples include gelatin capsules and safe dose of essential oil diluted. - 4. Pathophysiologic response to health care aromatherapy When essential oil in aromatherapy is inhaled, molecules activate the olfactory, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and/or integumentary systems based on the pathway of activation. These molecules are capable of releasing neurotransmitters, such as endorphins, to trigger a sense of well-being and an analgesic effect. [20](#bib20) , [21](#bib21) There are 2 common pathways triggering a pathophysiologic response to aromatherapy molecules. The most common pathway is inhalation, such as by a diffuser. Activation of olfactory stimulation produces immediate change in parameters for blood pressure, pulse rate, muscle tension, pupil dilation, body temperature, and blood flow. [20](#bib20) , [21](#bib21) The following summarizes this pathway: - The olfactory stimulation by aromatherapy travels via nostrils to the olfactory bulb. - The stimulus then travels to the brain for processing, where the amygdala triggers an emotional response and the hippocampus retrieves and/or forms memories. - The limbic system interacts with the cerebral cortex, activating thoughts and feelings. - The inhaled aromatherapy molecules travel to the upper respiratory tract and then to the lower respiratory tract. - - In summary, the inhaled aromatherapy molecules affect mind, body, and spirit. The second common pathway is through the skin, such as by a massage, in which molecules are absorbed through the skin. The pathway is summarized: - The molecules travel to the upper respiratory track and then the lower respiratory tract. - - The skin pathway can activate olfactory stimulation and also activates application of scented oil to the skin pathway triggering a mental and physiological response. - The skin pathway absorption of essential oils can reduce a patient's perceived stress, enhance healing, and increase communication. [20](#bib20) Safe use of essential oils Coming home from a long challenging day of work to the aromatic smell of a favorite essential oil can immediately decrease the stress from a busy and challenging day. Relaxing in a scented uplifting bubble bath can make someone feel like a new person. On the flip side, aromatic essential oils can be toxic, causing chemical burns and even death. Aromatherapy is growing in usage and can be extremely dangerous if not used safely because of a knowledge deficit. Two ethical principles apply to nurses when administering essential oils. The first is beneficence, in which the nurse takes positive steps to prevent harm. The second ethical principle is nonmaleficence, which means having an obligation to do no harm to a patient. Legal consequences could result if harm to a patient occurs due to negligence from administering of aromatherapy. Therefore, the bottom line is the need for nurses to learn about aromatherapy essential oils and their potential harms, such as poison and lethal complication. The following case reports portray safety considerations, complications, and interventions. Combustion Reaction Safety TF is a 54-year-old man who lives in Phoenix, Arizona; he is an advocate of essential oils and frequently uses them for anxiety and to promote sleep. On his day off, TF has several errands, including his monthly supply of essential oils. His first errand was to purchase essential oils. During his last errand, TF heard his name being called by an old friend. TF sat down to visit with his friend for a few minutes; the visit lasted 45 minutes. When TF returned to his car, he found black smoke in the car and a large burnt hole in his backseat where his purchased essential oils were placed. TF called the police to file a report. Critical analysis revealed the large supply of essential oils were stored in the back seat. TF left the oils in the car for 45 minutes with the outside temperature of 112\u00b0F, with the potential increase in the temperature in the car increasing to 160\u00b0F. The essential oils caught on fire, resulting in the smoke and burnt hole in the backseat of the car. Intervention for this unsafe use of essential oil is education that these oils are flammable and need to be stored in a cool dark place in the original bottle, which is colored to prevent direct sunlight penetrating to the essential oil. Unsafe storage by leaving essential oils in a hot car can cause a combustion reaction, triggering flames and a fire. Elder and Child Safety CF, a 66-year-old woman, was admitted for inpatient treatment of sepsis from an acute urinary infection. At night she can become agitated and screamed that snakes were crawling up her wall. The provider ordered aromatherapy and increased lighting in the room. Turning on a bed alarm and increased rounding also were ordered. The nurse brought the aromatherapy essential oil to the room and left to get a steam diffuser. When the nurse returned, CF appeared drunk. The nurse found the bottle open on the bedside table. The nurse called for assistance. Critical analysis revealed the nurse left the bottle of essential oil on the nightstand unattended when she left the room. The patient was able to open the bottle and drink a small amount of the essential oil, causing the drunken behavior. Intervention for essential oil left attended with a confused elderly patient was administration of milk to dilute the essential oil. The provider was called for further orders and an incident report was completed. The elderly and children are vulnerable to adverse effects from inappropriate use of essential oils. Early recognition is appearing drunk. Essential oils should be locked in a container in a hospital and kept away from elders and children. An essential oil bottle should not be left unattended, especially with this confused patient with delusions. The diffuser with the essential oil needs to be prepared outside of the patient's room. [11](#bib11) Allergic Contact Dermatitis and Primary Contact Dermatitis TA, a 30-year-old woman, works at a massage therapist and is extremely popular. Bookings must be in advance because her schedule stays full. Each day she works 8 hours to 9 hours, with mostly 1.5-hour massages. She uses a lotion with an aromatic essential oil. After 3 months, she developed a bright bred rash on her hands and lower arms. She used a steroid cream on the rash without resolving the rash. Over the next month, the rash got worse. TA scheduled an appointment with a dermatologist. Critical analysis evaluated allergic contact dermatitis versus primary contact dermatitis. In allergic contact dermatitis, the allergy occurs over a period whereas primary contact dermatitis occurs the first time the essential oil is used. In allergic contact dermatitis, the symptoms are a bright red rash that worsens with time whereas the primary contact dermatitis a presents as a red wheal or burn. [20](#bib20) , [23](#bib23) Intervention was based on treating allergic contact dermatitis based on symptomatology and length of time. Patch testing revealed the specific essential oil to stop using, allowing her to continue as a massage therapist. If TA had primary contact dermatitis, the red wheal or burn area from the toxic oil would be diluted with vegetable oil or milk then washed with unscented soap. [23](#bib23) Essential Oil Phototoxicity AJ is a 34-year-old woman who loves the sun. She lives in an apartment with a swimming pool. The average summer temperature is 102\u00b0F. On weekends she can be found at the swimming pool for 4 hours per weekend day. AJ's pool relaxing is 4 hours to 5 hours per day. She sets an alarm hourly to turn from back to stomach. AJ says the sunrays lift her up and gives her a beautiful brown tan with sunscreen oil. Due to the shutdown of her state due to COVID-19 and stores closed, AJ decided to shop online for home delivery of essential oils. AJ found a Web site with a sale on essential oils that had a pop-up advertisement declaring breaking news that essential oils prevent and cure the COVID-19 virus. AJ purchased several citrus fruit essential oils. AJ applied a mandarin essential oil to her neck and chest to ward off the COVID-19 virus. AJ left the pool early because of a burning sensation on her neck and chest. She took a shower and noticed several burned areas. The next day, the red burned areas turned to a brown skin damage appearance unlike any sunburn she ever experienced. AJ scheduled a dermatologist appointment due to the discoloration and discomfort not resolving. [16](#bib16) , [20](#bib20) , [23](#bib23) Critical analysis revealed that AJ was scammed by a fraudulent online statement to sell essential oils in a pandemic COVID-19 fearful time. The mandarin essential oil was not diluted when applied to the skin, increasing the risk for dermal toxicity. The pure mandarin essential oil was phototoxic and inflected damage to the skin, resulting in dark pigmented skin that could be permanent. [16](#bib16) , [23](#bib23) Dermal toxicity also occurred with the essential oil not being diluted. The regular sunburn resulted in redness and blisters on her skin. AJ scheduled an urgent dermatology appointment. She used an over-the-counter steroid cream for pain relief. The intervention to stop using the phototoxic essential oil and seek a specialist, which AJ did, with scheduling the dermatology appointment. The essential oil label always should be read for safety instructions. If a photosensitivity essential oil is used, wait a minimum of 12 hours before exposure to sun ultraviolet radiation. AJ should consult a qualified aromatherapist who has training for aromatherapy, not a seller of essential oils, to prevent harm from essential oils. A registry database for trained aromatherapists who have passed the core level of aromatherapy examination can be found at t [https://www.aromatherapycouncil.org.uk/about_us](https://www.aromatherapycouncil.org.uk/about_us) [10](#bib10) Essential oils always should be diluted in a carrier oil. A carrier oil prevents irritation to the skin and side effects of the essential oil. Examples of carrier oils include coconut oil, coconut oil, aloe vera gel, unscented lotion, vegetable oil, and avocado oil. Because oil and water do not mix, milk is used to remove the oil and calm the skin followed by washing of the skin by unscented soap. [23](#bib23) Phototoxic essential oil contains constituents that triggers a chemical process that changes the skin DNA, making the skin susceptible to sun ultraviolet radiation. This chemical change in the skin is called photosensitivity and the primary constituent is confurocoumarins that causes phototoxic reaction. Exposure of the applied photosensitivity essential oil to ultraviolet radiation from the sun inflicts skin damage with darkly pigmented skin that can be permanent due to the long period of exposure to sun ultraviolet radiation. [23](#bib23) It is extremely important to determine if an essential oil is phototoxic. AJ should find this warning on the label of the essential oil. Essential oils are not regulated by the FDA but the FDA monitors Web sites for fraudulent postings. AJ should report the online site and harm to her skin to the FDA for investigation. [11](#bib11) Oral Toxicity LM, a 110-pounds 20-year-old woman who lived with her mother, was told by an essential oil seller that she heard essential oils could prevent and cure COVID-19. LM was terrified that she could contract the virus with a resurgence of COVID-19 later in the year. LM was extremely excited about this information and asked which essential oil she should use orally to protect herself from this deadly pandemic COVID-19 virus. The seller recommended a safe dose for eucalyptus essential oil twice weekly orally. After a week LM decided to increase the oral dose to ward off the COVID-19 virus. She decided to drink half of an 8 oz glass of eucalyptus essential oil. Within 10 minutes she experienced burning in her throat, mouth, and stomach. [23](#bib23) LM yelled for her mother to come quickly. The mother found the daughter vomiting, staggering, and with slurred speech. The mother found the eucalyptus essential oil bottle and a glass indicating she had drunk eucalyptus essential oil. The mother called 911 with the dispatcher sending an ambulance and notifying the Poison Control Center for eucalyptus poisoning. Critical analysis of oral toxicity of eucalyptus revealed LM had drunk an unsafe dose causing poisoning with central nervous system depression and a chemical burn in her mouth, throat, and stomach. LM was admitted to the intensive care unit. Intervention was police investigation of the fraudulent information that eucalyptus could prevent and cure COVID-19 information by the seller of the essential oil with unintentional poisoning LM. A qualified aromatherapist that is certified or completed aromatherapy curriculum. Don't take advise from a seller of essential oils without expertise. Seek consultation for safe use of essential oils. [11](#bib11) Even with a safe oral dose of eucalyptus can cause harm. Safe use of essential oils is to not take essential oils internally. It is extremely important that induced vomiting is not done for this toxicity. Oral toxicity symptoms are rapid decline with complaint of burning in the mouth and throat and abdominal pain. Central nervous symptoms are ataxia and respiratory depression, and, with a higher dose, possible nasal intubation is needed for mechanical ventilation and deep coma. Death can occur with a toxic dose. [20](#bib20) , [23](#bib23) Eye Safety MF accidently splashed essential oil in an eye when she was preparing essential oil for a diffuser. Her eye was burning and painful and her vision blurred in the eye. Critical analysis reveals essential oils are toxic to eyes and can result in a chemical burn. The eye should be rapidly irrigated with milk or a vegetable oil carrier. A washcloth or cotton ball can help with the irrigation. After treatment flush the eye with water. Do not flush the eye with water initially due to oil and water not mixing. Aromatherapy clinical management Clinical nursing aromatherapy is patient symptom management with measuring the outcome in a clinical setting. When aromatherapy is ordered by a provider for symptom management, a nurse needs to perform a history assessment, obtain vital signs, identify the symptom, educate the patient, measure symptom management, evaluate the effectiveness, and document the plan of care. [1](#bib1) , [6](#bib6) , [7](#bib7) , [24](#bib24) The following is an overview of clinical management of the essential oil: - Allergy\u2014inhalant, skin, food, and medication allergy or sensitivity. Consider the need for a patch test. - Chronic conditions\u2014assess condition that could be impacted by aromatherapy, such as plant source triggering asthma attack or cancer that is fed by estrogen, with a few essential oils having estrogenic activity. - Obtain vital signs\u2014assess if there is a problem proceeding with essential oil administration. - Symptoms needing to be managed\u2014such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, nausea, and pain - Educate the patient about the essential oil, procedure, safety, symptom management, patient-centered selection of the essential oil, and consent for implementation. - Outcome measurement of symptom relief\u2014select a tool for measuring the symptom, such as pain. The pain tool could be measurement of pain from 1 to 10 or visual picture rating of pain; or, a nonverbal patient's pain could be measured with a visual picture range, and pain in a patient unable to communicate could be measured with physiologic changes, such as vital signs, guarding of the area, and facial grimaces from discomfort. After selection of the pain measurement tool, rate the presymptom range, and post-implementation, measure at end of post symptom score for a change in outcome findings. - Evaluate the effectiveness of the essential oil on the symptom. The outcome goals are decrease in the symptom and increased well-being and quality of life. Patient-centered symptom management and presence of a nurse could increase patient satisfaction. - Document the procedure and incorporate into the plan of care. - Examples of clinical conditions and settings that can benefit in the management of symptoms in the inpatient and outpatient settings are pain, nausea and vomiting, preoperative anxiety, critical care, general well-being, anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia, respiratory, dementia, oncology, palliative care, hospice, and end of life. [1](#bib1), [6](#bib6), [7](#bib7), [24](#bib24) Best practice model for clinical symptom management Aromatherapy is used as an alternative medicine and complement to traditional care. Aromatherapy is rising in popularity and is a cost-effective symptom manager. The following are suggested steps for guidance and triggers for brainstorming to develop a customized patient-centered symptom management program using essential oils in an inpatient or outpatient setting. - 1.Buy-in from major stakeholders. Develop a committee that includes interprofessional members. Input from all stakeholders, including frontline nurses, needs to be embraced; and, commit, by a recorded vote, to proceeding with the aromatherapy program. - 2.Develop a policy and procedure manual. Search the literature for best practice aromatherapy models. If possible, contact the facility for assistance with the startup of the program. For example, a best practice model is at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix Arizona. This research and education facility uses aromatherapy for alternative medicine and has integrative medicine. - 3.Upon approval, establish guidelines for safe and effective implementation, including infection control, safe storage, and disposal of the chemical oil. - 4.Identify common symptoms that could occur in the facility, such as pain, anxiety, depression, nausea, and insomnia. - 5.Identify nursing considerations, such as assessment, chronic illness, administration, and safety. - 6.Identify preoutcome and postoutcome measurements and best tools for measurement. For example, anxiety is a symptom: identify a pretest and post-test to measure anxiety that is a short tool. - 7.Identify and educate aromatherapy champions to lead the new program by supervising and mentoring nurses, for example, a classroom course for hospital nurses and a certified clinical aromatherapy practitioner course. - 8.Evaluate the data from the pre-intervention and post-intervention of aromatherapy. Interpret the findings and refine if needed. - 9.Data analysis to justify aromatherapy is an effective intervention for symptom management. Summary Aromatic scents and oils used in clinical aromatherapy can be beneficial for symptom management such as pain, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia, agitation with dementia, cancer pain, and end of life symptoms, Clinical aromatherapy has been found beneficial in the inpatient and outpatient settings especially critical care, oncology, palliative care, hospice, and surgical. On the flip side, aromatic essential oils can be dangerous and toxic due to certain oils being flammable, causing skin dermatitis, or being phototoxic, with risks of chemical burn, oral toxicity, and even death. Therefore, it is important that nurses learn about essential oils. If a facility has a clinical aromatherapy program, it is critical that frontline nurses be educated with a classroom course on essential oils. Champions need to be selected for a clinical aromatherapy practitioner course. These certified aromatherapists can lead the program, serve as consultants, and mentor nurses. Disclosure A.J.
