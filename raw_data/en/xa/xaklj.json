Yet, the economics of vaccination technology during the CoVID-19 pandemic (still in progress) may be one of the gravest discontents of the 21st century from the perspective of people, healthcare access and ethical globalization. The public health alarm is not restricted to affluent OECD nations and affluence cannot mitigate the risks of future epidemics and pandemics. Vaccination and immunization, when possible, must be globally accessible and available to mitigate the threat from worldwide transmission, increasing virulence due to antigenic drift and economic devastation which follows, naturally. Description \"The Health of Nations\" is a review/summary of research results over the past 30+ years which indicates that untreated, raw, plant products (leafs, stems, roots) may be effective in delivering antigens (e.g. viral proteins engineered in recombinant vectors for production in transgenic plant tissue) to humans and animals to vaccinate against future infections (e.g. emerging threat from viruses with pandemic potential). Delivery of plant-produced antigens induces immunogenic response in animals and are capable of conferring immunity in humans. The failure to translate this credible scientific research into solutions for the less-affluent world (80% of the global population) may be a crime against humanity.
