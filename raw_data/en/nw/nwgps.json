After October 18, 2021, \"a health care provider or healthcare staff person may not work, learn, study, assist, observe, or volunteer in a healthcare setting unless they are fully vaccinated or have provided documentation of a medical or religious exception.\" The Oregon Health Authority has been tasked as the enforcement agency. The final temporary rule is available at [https://secure.sos.state.or.us/oard/viewSingleRule.action?ruleVrsnRsn=280799](https://secure.sos.state.or.us/oard/viewSingleRule.action?ruleVrsnRsn=280799). On Thursday, August 5, 2021, The Oregon Health Authority (OHA) published a final temporary rule (OAR 333-019-1010) that requires healthcare personnel and healthcare staff who work in healthcare settings to either be fully vaccinated or be tested for COVID-19 on a weekly basis. The rule is effective August 5, however compliance will not be enforced until September 30, 2021. Rule violations will carry a civil penalty of $500 per day per violation, imposed by the OHA. Penalties will not be imposed before September 30, 2021. Oregon-based chiropractic physicians, naturopathic physicians, acupuncturists, and massage therapists meet the OHA definition of \"healthcare providers and healthcare staff (\"any individual licensed by a health regulatory board as that is defined in ORS 676.16\"). The rule includes information on the role of the employer of healthcare providers or healthcare staff including policy development and recordkeeping. The rule also covers the documentation or testing for self-employed providers as well, stating \"If a health care provider is self-employed the health care provider must maintain their own documentation of vaccination or weekly COVID-19 test results.\" Documentation of vaccination status or weekly testing must be maintained for two years and must be provided to the OHA upon request for both employers and the self-employed. Oregon boards for integrative healthcare providers are listed below. Providers should reach out to the appropriate board with questions concerning this final temporary rule. "}
