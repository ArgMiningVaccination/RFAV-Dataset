[Dr. Minoo Sachdev](/doctor/dr-minoo-sachdev-ayurveda)Ayurvedic Doctor 15 Years Exp.Bachelor of Applied Science in Management (BASM), MD - AM If you are looking for an effective immunity boost in your body, you should choose [Ayurveda](https://www.lybrate.com/ayurveda) and undertake Ayurvedic procedures and remedies. Good health, according to Ayurveda, involves balancing of your doshas such as vata, pitta and kapha and making sure that your agni or digestive system is working smoothly. There are several Ayurvedic ways using which you will be able to boost your body's immune system and its capability. They are as follows: - Keep your immune system in proper balance by eating proper food: A weakened immune system makes you prone to all sorts of illnesses and diseases. In case the immune system becomes overactive, it targets your body's own tissues, confusing them for foreign invaders and attacks them. Your [diet](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/healthy-diet)is very important for balancing this fighting response within your body. If your body gets the right nutrients and eliminates toxins effectively, the immune system gets strengthened. You should consume leafy vegetables, whole grain, nuts, legumes and highly pigmented food. - Detox: According to Ayurveda, ama is a primary factor, which leads to the development of diseases. Ama is the name of stored toxins in Sanskrit language and if your body has unhealthy ama, an environment is created where invaders thrive. Ama may occur due to both mental and physical [indigestion](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/indigestion). Ama and indigestion prevent essential nutrients from reaching your tissues, which weaken your immune function. You need to detoxify your body at regular intervals if you have unhealthy eating habits or get exposed to harmful environmental toxins. - Keep your agni strong: The digestive system or agni is very important for your health and it highly influences your immunity and immune system capability. The ability of digestion, assimilation and absorption of nutrients by the body also determines your immune strength. If your agni gets impaired because of an imbalance within the tridosha, your metabolism is affected, which weakens the immune system and body's natural resistance. Eating food items which are harmful for the digestive system leads to excess ama formation. A toxic environment is created in the body. This factor interferes with the natural intelligence of every cell which is encoded with the will of living healthy and working as a whole, together. Ayurveda aims at restoring this intelligence factor. You can boost your agni by consuming hot water and [ginger](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/ginger-adrak-benefits-and-side-effects) [tea](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/benefits-of-tea-and-its-side-effects)regularly.
