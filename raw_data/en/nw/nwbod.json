Explanation: This language specifies that the fiscal 2024 award will be for nine months and requires the State fiscal 2024 VOCA awards to be awarded at a prorated level equal to that of fiscal 2023 in order to ensure the continuity of victim services. Funds not needed to provide continuation funding will be used to offer competitive awards to providers of victim services in the State. Furthe r, in the event that available funding is reduced or not available, priority shall be given to non- State service providers, and funding for all non- State providers must be reduced by the same percentage. Grantees will be able to receive reimbursement on a monthly basis upon request for awards of $50,000 or more annually. D21 Joint Chairmen 's Report - Operating Budget, April 2023 23 The language restricts funds pending the submission of a report by GOCPYVS detailing how non-State providers were given funding priority and proposed VOCA awards for the fiscal 2024 grant cycle.

The report should detail whether each of the grant recipients received the same level of VOCA funding during the federal fiscal 2022 VOCA grant cycle and the information on each of the grant programs receiving such funds. For each open three -year grant cycle (federal fiscal 2021, 2022, and 2023), GOCPYVS should report the amount of currently unexpended funds, the reason these funds remain unspent, and whether they will be held in reserve. The report should provide further detail regarding the expendit ure of funds for the two most recently completed funding cycles - federal fiscal 2019 and 2020. The report should provide a comparison of the program' s aggregate outcome or performance measure in recent fiscal years. Finally, the report should identify any differences between the legislative appropriation and actual spending levels for each closed out fiscal year, beginning with State fiscal 2017: State fiscal 2017; 2018; 2019; 2020; 2021; 2022; and 2023.

While competitive compensation is a major component of any solution, the State must also undertake significant reforms to the way it recruits and hires State employees. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) should create a Task Force on the Modernization of the State Personnel Management System. The task force should include: \u00b7 representatives of DBM 's Office of Personnel Services and Benefits; \u00b7 State agency executives; \u00b7 collective bargaining unit representatives; \u00b7 private-sector human resources experts; and \u00b7 representatives of the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), which has a personnel system independent of SPMS. The task force should identify current State hiring practices that hinder recruitment and hiring, including: \u00b7 the approval process for agencies to begin hiring for a position; \u00b7 the length of time between stages of the hiring process; \u00b7 the requirements for selection to an interview; \u00b7 degree requirements; and F10A02 Joint Chairmen 's Report - Operating Budget, April 2023 56 \u00b7 any other impediments to the State hiring process.

It is the intent of the General Assembly that the funds to support the COLA are transferred only to those agencies that have mad e progress in filling vacant positions and require funding to provide the COLA. Explanation: Personnel costs are overfunded by approximately $271 million based on the current vacancy and turnover rates, which will result in significant personnel cost savings. This language would delay the transfer of funds for a salary increase and express the i ntent of the General Assembly that funds are only provided to agencies that make progress in filling vacant positions.

It is similar to Maryland 's Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) program, but the DBE requirements apply only to projects receiving federal transportation funding. The committees are interested in exploring how the DBE program differs from Maryland 's MBE program, and whether the DBE requirements can be expanded to include projects funded from non- transportation federal funding as well. Since the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) is Maryland' s official certification agency for both programs, the committees request that MDOT submit a report by November 1, 2023 that: \u00b7 provides a summary of the DBE and MBE programs and highlights how they differ; \u00b7 in consultation with the Maryland Office of the Attorney Ge neral, identifies any legal barriers that would prevent extending the use of the DBE program for procurements for projects receiving federal funding through non- USDOT agencies; and \u00b7 whether Maryland 's MBE program could be improved by adding requirements from the DBE program that are not currently included in the MBE program.

In particular, this evaluation should focus on cost savings from MDPCP reducing unnecessary utilization or hospitalization for patients participating in MDPCP over the increased expenditures from provider incentives. The evaluation should include reporting on the racial and ethnic diversity of the program, any efforts to improve minority representation in the program, and improve data collection on racial and ethnic diversity of providers. The evaluation should also consider existing disparities in primary care access and ways in which the State can address these disparities. Further, given the anticipated benefits that the outcome -based credits have against MDPCP 's care management fees, the committees are interested in aggregate costs of the care management fees against TCOC, the amount that outcome -based credits have discounted these expenses, and MDPCP 's contribution to the achievement and maximization of the current and future outcome -based credits and other population health goals. Information Request Evaluation of MDPCP Author Health Services Cost Review Commission Due Date October 1, 2023 N00A01 Office of the Secretary Department of Human Services Joint Chairmen 's Report - Operating Budget, April 2023 135 Budget Amendments N00A01.01 Office of the Secretary Add the following language to the general fund appropriation: , provided that $100,000 of this appropriation made for the Office of the Secretary may not be expended until the Department of Human Services (DHS) submits a report to the budget committees detailing the department' s efforts to improve oversight of the local department of social services (LDSS) to ensure compliance with State law and regulations and DHS policy as well as improve oversight of procurement processes as included as a repeat findin g in the fiscal compliance audit of Local Department Operations released by the Office of Legislative Audits in March 2022.

Funds restricted pending the receipt of a report may not be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any other purpose and shall be canceled if the report is not submitted to the budget committees. Explanation: Due to concern over repeat audit findings, the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee has requested language restricting funds until repeat audit findings are resolved. Given the unique nature of the Local Department Operations audit, which reviews DHS Office of Inspector General audit reports on each LDSS, this language represents a modification to the standard language. This la nguage restricts funds within the Office of the Secretary pending information on efforts by the department to improve oversight of LDSS as well as information on the steps taken by LDSS to address the repeat audit findings.

It also strikes language regarding the No Child Left Behind Act due to technical differences with the reauthorized Element ary and Secondary Education Act. R00A03 Joint Chairmen 's Report - Operating Budget, April 2023 183 Amend the following language to the special fund appropriation: (2) Not charge more tuition to a participating student than the statewide average per pupil expenditure by the local education agencies, as calculated by the department, with appropriate exceptions for special education students as determined by the department; and (3) Comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.; and (4) Submit its student handbook or other written policy related to student admissions to the Maryland State Department of Education for review to ensure compliance with program eligibility requirements. Explanation: This action requires schools that participate in the Aid to Non- Public Schools Program to submit a student handbook or policy on student admissions to the Maryland State Department of Education to ensure compliance with program eligibility requirements.

A nonpublic school participating in the program may not discriminate in student admissions, retention, or expulsion, or otherwise discriminate against any student on the basis of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression. Nothing herein shall require any school or institution to adopt any rule, regulation, or policy that conflicts with its religious or moral teachings. However, all participating schools must agree that they will not discriminate in student admissions, retention, or expulsion or otherwise discriminate against any student on the basis of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression. Any school found to be in violation of the requirements to not discriminate shall be required to return to the Maryland State Department of Education all textbooks or computer hardware and software and other electronically delivered learning materials acquired through the fiscal 2023 allocation.

Any school that is found in violation of the nondiscrimination requirements in fiscal 2023 or 2024 may not participate in the program in fiscal 2024. It is the in tent of the General Assembly that a school that violates the nondiscrimination requirements is ineligible to participate in the Aid to Non -Public Schools Program, the Broadening Options and Opportunities for Students Today Program, the James E. \"Ed\" DeGran ge Nonpublic Aging Schools Program, and the Nonpublic School Security Improvements Program in the year of the violation and the following 2 years. Explanation: This action requires a nonpublic school participating in the Aid to Non- Public Schools Program to certify compliance with Title 20, Subtitle 6 of the State Government Article (Discrimination in Employment). It also specifies that a participating school may not discriminate in student admissions on the basis of race, color, nat ional origin, sexual orientation, R00A03 Joint Chairmen 's Report - Operating Budget, April 2023 184 or gender identity or expression. Violation of these provisions means that a school will be ineligible for the program. Similar language has been included in the budget since fiscal 2017. This action also specifies that sc hools that violate the provisions must return all textbooks and technology received through the program to the Maryland State Department of Education.

By focusing on these f aculty, the committees gain a sense of the teaching activities for the regular core faculty. However, there are other types of instructional faculty at institutions, such as full - and part -time nontenured/nontenure -track faculty including adjunct faculty, instructors, and lecturers. Focusing on only tenured/tenure -track faculty provides an incomplete picture of how students are taught. Therefore, the report should also include the instructional workload when all types of faculty are considered. Additional information may be included at the institution's discretion. Furthermore, the USM report should include the percent of faculty meeting or exceeding teaching standards for tenured/tenure -track faculty for the University of Maryland, Baltimore Campus. Infor mation Request Annual report on faculty workload Author USM MSU SMCM Due Date December 11, 2023 Report on Programs to Foster Equitable Growth in the Cannabis Industry: Beginning in July 2023, Marylanders will be able to purchase recreational marijuana. With this new industry there is an education gap in not only providing those with knowledge and skills needed to work in industry, but also more research needs to be conducted about cannabis. Additionally, there is a workforce gap due to a lack of people who have the knowledge and skills to work in the cannabis industry. Moreover, communities most harmed by cannabis criminalization need access to training to participate i n this emerging sector. The committees are interested in fostering the development of the cannabis industry and request the University System of Maryland (USM), Morgan State University (MSU), St. Mary's College of Maryland (SMCM), and the Maryland Associat ion of Community Colleges (MACC) to establish a workgroup to investigate the development of cannabis focused programs, courses, and certificates to train students for the cannabis industry.

Therefore, the committees request that the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) submit a report on the fees, fines, and penalties necessary for a new dedicated special fund supporting the Dam Safety Progr am to ensure oversight of privately owned dams for public safety. Information Request Report on Dam Safety Program funding needed for oversight of privately owned dams Author MDE Due Date September 29, 2023 Back River and Patapsco Wastewater Treatment Plant Monthly Status Reports: The committees continue to be concerned about the Back River and Patapsco Wastewater Treatment Plants.

The requested report shall be submitted no later than November 1, 2023. The budget committees shall have 45 days from the date of the receipt of the report to review and comment. Funds restricted pending the receipt of the report may not be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any other purpose and shall revert to the General Fund if the report is not submitted to the budget committees. Explanation: This action restricts funding pending the submission by November 1, 2023, of the Maryland Scrap Tire Annual Report. Section 9- 275(c) of the Environment Article specifies that an annual status report is due on or before November 1 of each year, which was not consistently met before the inclusion of annual budget bill language. Information Request Maryland Used Tire Cleanup and Recycling Fund annual report Author Maryland Department of the Environment Due Date November 1, 2023 Committee Narrative AIR AND RADIATION ADMINISTRATION U00A07.01 Air and Radiation Administration Ambient Air Monitoring Report: The committees are interested in what is needed to deploy an ambient air monitoring network across the State and how this would improve public health. Therefore, the committees request that the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) submit a report on what is needed to deploy an ambient air monitoring network across the State. In addition, the report is requested to include information on how the data collected from a network would mitigate exposure to toxic pollutants, inform permit decision-making processes, and help reduce the cumulative impacts of pollutants such as particulate matter and fine particulate matter. The report is requested to be submitted to the committees by December 31, 2023. Information Request Ambient air monitoring report Author MDE Due Date December 31, 2023 U00A Joint Chairmen 's Report - Operating Budget, April 2023 215 Budget Amendments COORDINATING OFFICES U00A10.01 Coordinating Offices Add the following language to the general fund appropriation: , provided that $100,000 of this appropriation made for the purpose of general administrative expenses may not be expended until the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), in cooperation with the Department of Budget and Management, submits a confir matory letter to the budget committees indicating that MDE's fiscal 2023 actual personnel expenditures and the fiscal 2024 working appropriation personnel expenditures are budgeted in the correct statewide subobjects. The confirmatory letter shall be submitted with the fiscal 2025 budget submission, and the budget committees shall have 45 days from the date of the receipt of the confirmatory letter to review and comment. Funds restricted pending the receipt of a confirmatory letter may not be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any other purpose and shall revert to the General Fund if the confirmatory letter is not submitted to the budget committees. Explanation: For the second year in a row, MDE's most recent actual fiscal year budget data incorrectly reflects the allocation of funding for personnel expenditures. The 2021 Joint Chairmen's Report included committee narrative requesting that the fiscal 2021 budget data be correctly reflected with the fiscal 2023 budget submission. Then, fiscal 20 23 budget bill language restricted funding pending the submission of a confirmatory letter with the fiscal 2024 budget submission, indicating that prior year actual personnel expenditures up to and including fiscal 2022 are budgeted in the correct statewide subobjects. The fringe benefit expenditures - health insurance, pension contributions, and turnover adjustments, among others - are almost entirely reflected as Social Security contributions, which makes it difficult to do historical data comparisons. In addition, MDE budgets in its working appropriation a portion of its personnel expenditures in a subobject used as a temporary placeholder, miscellaneous adjustments, which makes it difficult to compare the working appropriation with the Governor's allowance. Therefore, funding is restricted until MDE and the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) submit a confirmatory letter with the fiscal 2025 budget submission indicating that fiscal 2023 actual personnel expenditures and fiscal 2024 working appropria tion personnel expenditures are budgeted in the correct statewide subobjects. Information Request Budgeting of fiscal 2023 actual and fiscal 2024 working appropriation personnel expenditures Author MDE DBM Due Date Fiscal 2025 budget submission U00A Joint Chairmen 's Report - Operating Budget, April 2023 216 Add the following language to the general fund appropriation: Further provided that $100,000 of this appropriation made for the purpose of general operating expenses may not be expended until the Maryland Department of the Environment submits a report to the budget committees on revised structures for the fees, fines, and penalties that support the Maryland Clean Water Fund, the Lead Poisoning Prevention Fund, and the Maryland Clean Air Fund with the goal of ensuring that the special funds can adequately support the Water and Science Administration, the Land and Materials Administration, and the Air and Radiation Administration, respectively, and thereby reduce the need for general fund support. The report shall include the following: (1) a description of who pays each fee, fine, and penalty; (2) a description of how the revenue for each fee, fine, and penalty is used; (3) whether each fee is recurring or one time; (4) the volume of payors and revenue for each year since each fee, fine, and penalty was last increased; (5) an explanation for any significant changes in the revenues received from each fee, fine, and penalty, including, but not limited to, changes in the number of payors or amount paid by each payor; (6) a comparison of Maryland to other peer states in terms of how the functions supported by each fee, fine, and penalty are handled; (7) the size of each of the special fund shortfalls now and a projection of each of the special fund shortfalls into the future; and (8) an analysis of how much of each of the special fund shortfalls would have been addressed by indexing each fee, fine, and penalty to inflation. The report shall be submitted by September 29, 2023, and the budg et committees shall have 45 days from the date of the receipt of the report to review and comment. Funds restricted pending the receipt of a report may not be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any other purpose and shall revert to the General Fund if the report is not submitted to the budget committees. Explanation: Fiscal 2023 general fund deficiency appropriations of $1.5 million are budgeted in each of the Water and Science Administration, the Land and Materials Administration, and the Ai r and Radiation Administration to counter declining special fund revenue. This is the fourth fiscal year in which funding has been provided for declining special fund revenue in at least one of the Maryland Department of the Environment's (MDE) administrations. According to the polluter pays principle, a core tenant of environmental law and environmental economics, U00A Joint Chairmen 's Report - Operating Budget, April 2023 217 social welfare is maximized when all costs - environmental, social, and actual - are reflected in prices. This is not occurring because of outda ted fee, fine, and penalty structures for the special funds supporting the three administrations: the Maryland Clean Water Fund; the Lead Poisoning Prevention Fund; and the Maryland Clean Air Fund. Therefore, this budget bill language restricts funding pe nding the submission of a report on revised fee, fine, and penalty structures for the three special funds supporting these three administrations with the goal of ensuring that the special funds can adequately support the administrations and thereby reduce the need for general fund support. The report is required to be submitted by September 29, 2023. Information Request Revised fee, fine, and penalty structures report Author MDE Due Date September 29, 2023 Committee Narrative Text Alert System for Environmental Accidents: The committees are concerned that affected parties are not notified of environmental accidents, such as the release of hazardous materials or illegal discharges from wastewater treatment plants, in a timely manner. Ther efore, the committees request that the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) and Maryland Department of Emergency Management (MDEM) conduct a study to determine the feasibility and cost of implementing a text alert system for environmental accidents along the lines of the current weather and AMBER alert systems. The study should include information about the relevancy of the national Emergency Alert System to the proposed text alert system and an evaluation of the type of environmental events or acci dents that would be most beneficial to include in such a system. The report is requested to be submitted by September 29, 2023. Information Request Text alert system for environmental accidents Author MDE MDEM Due Date September 29, 2023 Posting of Federal Funding Online and a Report: The committees are interested in tracking the status of federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) discretionary funding available to the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE). Therefore, the committees request that MDE post information monthly on its website about federal IIJA and IRA discretionary grant funding by piece of federal legislation, federal assistance listing number, MDE program, MDE project, and both State and federal fiscal year as follows: (1) applied for but not awarded; (2) applied for and federal review is pending; (3) awarded but not yet budgeted; (4) budgeted but not yet completed; and (5) completed. In addition, the committees request that MDE summarize the information from these monthly posts in a report to be submitted by December 31, 2023. U00A Joint Chairmen 's Report - Operating Budget, April 2023 218 Information Request Posting of federal funding online and a report Author MDE Due Date December 31, 2023 Posting of Permit Violation Supporting Documents on the Open Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) Website: MDE began posting information about citizen complaints, compliance inspections, violations, enforcement actions, permits, and sewage overflows at least as far back as December 20, 2021. Subsequently, Chapter 22 of 2022 (Environment - Discharge Permits - Inspections and Administrative Continuations) required MDE to maintain a list on its website of permit holders determined to be in significant noncompliance, sorted by county. The following supporting documents relevant to compliance entities with violations would be helpful for understanding the context and background of permit violations but are not posted on the Open MDE website: enforcement documents; settle ment agreements; and consent decrees. Therefore, the committees request that MDE begin posting permit violation supporting documents - enforcement documents, settlement agreements, and consent decrees - on the Open MDE website and submit a letter confirmin g that change has been implemented by December 1, 2023.

Information Request Enforcement and inspection position strength assessment and vacant position Author MDA MDE Due Date July 1, 2023 October 1, 2023 January 1, 2024 April 1, 2024 Add the following section: Section 38 Uniform Crime Report SECTION 38. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That $250,000 of the general fund appropriation within the Department of State Police (DSP) may not be expended until DSP submits the Crime in Maryland, 2022 Uniform Crime Report (UCR) to the budget committees. The budget committees shall have 45 days from the date of the receipt of the report to review and comment. Funds restricted pending the receipt of the report may not be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any other purpose and shall revert to the General Fund if the report is not submitted to the budget committees. Further provided that, if DSP encounters difficulty obtaining, or validating the accuracy of, the necessary crime data by November 1, 2023, from local jurisdictions who provide the data f or inclusion in the UCR, DSP shall notify the Governor's Office of Crime Prevention, Youth, and Victim Services (GOCPYVS).

GOCPYVS shall withhold SAPP funds until such a time that the jurisdiction submits its crime data to DSP and DSP verifies the accuracy of the data. DSP and GOCPYVS shall submit a report to the budget committees indicating any jurisdiction from which crime data was not received by November 1, 2023, and the amount of SAPP funding from each jurisdiction. Explanation: The annual language was originally added because DSP had not been submitting its annual crime report in a timely manner due to issues related to receiving crime data from the local jurisdictions. The 2017 UCR was not submitted until March 2019, and the 2018 UCR was not submitted until March 2020. The 2019 and 2020 UCRs were submitted on time, as was the 2022 UCR data verification letter. Though data contributors were able to provide the department with 2021 crime data, there have been delays in compiling the 2021 UCR due to the inability for all contributors to submit it in compliance with the new federal reporting system. The 2021 UCR is not expected to be published until mid-March 2023. This language withholds a portion of the general fund appropriation until the budget committees receive the 202 2 UCR. The language also specifies that GOCPYVS, upon receipt of notification from DSP, must withhold a portion of a delinquent jurisdiction's SAPP grant until certain crime data is received by DSP. Finally, DSP and GOCPYVS mus t submit a report to the budget committees that includes information on any jurisdiction that did not report crime data by November 1, 2023, and the amount of SAPP funding that is withheld from each jurisdiction.

Similar language is annually included in the capital budget bill to ensure that State grants are not unnecessarily held up by technical di fferences that can be incorporated into the grant agreement with the State.
