JoAnne is a multi-lineage practitioner which means that she has received training and mastery in a variety of different energy healing modalities. To name a few of the more commonly known methods, JoAnne is a Usui Reiki Master & Teacher, Shamanic Reiki Hypnotherapist, EFT practitioner/trainer, Meditation Teacher, Angelic Medium. In addition to her formal training, JoAnne is also a gifted channel to Spirit. JoAnne skillfully integrates her training in eastern and western medicine to bridge the gap between spirituality and psychology. This combination of mind/body techniques addresses the person as a whole. Oftentimes clients find that they have mentally and emotionally processed their traumas, narratives, anxieties, and stressors, yet they still feel \"stuck\". Energy healing allows the client to release at the energetic and subconscious level where unconscious programming might be impeding progress. The outcome of this type of healing approach speeds up the process of clearing old patterns, clarifying your life purpose, and making lasting changes. After an energy healing session, clients report feeling lighter, having a better sense of clarity and ease, and feeling overall balanced. "}
