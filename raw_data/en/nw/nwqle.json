It is essentially an ancient Indian system of medicine that focuses on the balance of the mind, body, and spirit. Although the principles of Ayurveda date back over 5,000 years, people follow the remedies and regimens of the ancient wellness science even today. Incorporating Ayurveda into your daily life can be especially helpful if you are trying to improve your overall well-being and reduce excess weight. What does an Ayurvedic diet chart for weight loss involve? In Ayurveda, weight loss is approached through a combination of dietary and lifestyle changes that are personalized to the individual, based on their unique constitution, or dosha. If you want to lose weight and improve your overall health using the principles of Ayurveda, here are 7 diet tips that can help. Tips: Ayurvedic diet for weight loss 1) Eat three meals a day, without snacking in between Unlike popular diets, an Ayurveda diet plan for weight loss highlights the importance of eating healthy and balanced meals. In line with this, Ayurvedic practitioners recommend eating three meals with adequate matra (calorie content) every day in order to lose weight. This is because eating too little while dieting can result in slow metabolism. That said, keep in mind that snacking in between meals is discouraged in Ayurveda. 2) Be mindful, even when you eat Add meditation, even if it is for just 10 minutes every morning and evening, to your routine to reduce the amount of cortisol in your body. The reduction in cortisol \u2014 the stress hormone \u2014 will help your body burn more fat. It's also important to eat in a peaceful, calm environment that allows you to focus on the sacred act of eating. When you eat mindfully, you will be able to tell when you are satisfied and feeling full. 3) Exercise regularly If you want to lose weight, you cannot avoid exercising. While yoga is a great first step, it's also smart to add aerobic exercise to your workout routine. For consistent weight loss, aim to get at least 45 to 60 minutes of exercise around three days a week or more. Those with busy schedules or mobility challenges should aim to exercise for at least 15 to 20 minutes a day. Keep in mind that when you exercise can affect the efficacy of your workout. According to Ayurvedic practitioners, exercising during the morning hours on an empty stomach is the best for your body. *Note: Check with your doctor before beginning a new exercise routine. 4) Eat seasonal foods Ayurvedic diet charts for weight loss recommend eating foods that are seasonal and available locally to promote normal digestion. So, for instance, in the fall and winter, eat plenty of root vegetables (except potato and sweet potato), stored grains, nuts and seeds. During the warm months, consume more green leafy vegetables, fresh fruits, and sprouts. 5) Consume a Kapha-pacifying diet Ayurvedic practitioners believe that excess Kapha in the body can cause obesity, a slow metabolism, congestion, and water retention, among other problems. Consuming a Kapha-pacifying diet can help prevent the buildup of Kapha and help you remain at a healthy weight, while also improving your overall health. A Kapha-pacifying diet involves eating foods that are warm, easily digestible, light, rough and dry. So, when following an Ayurvedic diet for weight loss, try to incorporate cooked vegetables, lentils, and whole grains into your meals, and avoid cold, raw, and processed foods. Remember that the [Ayurvedic treatment for weight loss](https://madhavbaug.org/obesity-management/) does not require you to give up on the foods you may have come to love. Instead, all you need to do is practice moderation with your food choices in order to restore balance. 6) Follow a routine Following a fixed routine every day has a soothing effect on one's nervous system, thereby reducing stress. This, in turn, can help support Ayurvedic weight loss. As part of your daily routine, make sure to: - Decide your sleep and wake times: Ayurvedic diet plans for weight loss recommend sleeping by 10 p.m. and waking up before 6 a.m. Keep in mind that you're more likely to stick to your routine if you get sufficient sleep. - Set aside time to exercise and practice yoga: Whether it is 20 minutes or an hour, carve out time daily for your yoga practice and workout routine. Ayurvedic practitioners recommend that you work out early in the morning; however, if you are pressed for time, you could also exercise in the evening. - Ensure that you consume your meals at around the same time every day: Eating at roughly the same time every day helps get your metabolism on track. Make sure that your lunch is the largest meal and that you eat it between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. while your Ama (digestive fire) is at its strongest. After each of your meals, take a quick walk to aid your digestion. 7) Perform a dietary cleanse An Ayurvedic cleanse can give your metabolism a break and allow your body a chance to repair and rejuvenate itself. A cleanse need not be a full-day rigorous fast; instead, it can simply involve eating something light like whole fruits or vegetable salads. You could also use a few Ayurvedic weight loss recipes during your cleanse. "}
