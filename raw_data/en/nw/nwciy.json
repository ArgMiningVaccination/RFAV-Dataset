In the UK, booster shots of [Moderna](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/moderna-vaccine-2/98858/) and Pfizer are being given to the entire population. This roll-out comes in the wake of data suggesting that the NHS will be overwhelmed by case levels in early 2022, which will impact other services - such as cancer care and planned surgeries. Right now, the UK is 70% double vaccinated, then 41% of people have their booster shot. In countries with low levels of vaccination, a new variant is the difference between life and death. These countries are still fighting to access [COVID vaccines at an affordable price.](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/trips-covid-19-waiver/103738/) However, people continue to spread misinformation about the Moderna booster, despite widespread use as a primary double-jab. We've written about basic Moderna side effects in the past, [which you can read here.](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/what-are-the-side-effects-of-the-moderna-vaccine/106767/) 1. Do I need to take a vaccine booster if I have COVID antibodies? Yes. There is no data that proves people make the same level of antibodies after COVID infection. Scientists also can't agree on how long antibodies last. Levels of antibodies can drop [one month](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/covid-19-antibodies-decline/94148/) or [11 months](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/antibodies-11-months/111192/) after initial infection, meaning that a person can be at risk of reinfection or transmitting COVID to another person. A booster will also be critical to those who are immunocompromised or vulnerable to the virus because of existing illnesses. Antibodies created through earlier illness are most likely adapted to Delta or Alpha, while Omicron presents an unknown kind of threat. Anything from diabetes to high blood pressure can create complications in the body if COVID is also present - which makes all the difference in severe cases of the virus. Without extra protection, the virus can disarm major organs in vulnerable individuals. According to the US Food and Drug Administrations' analysis, taking the Moderna vaccine is safe for people who have had COVID. 2. Can I experience hair loss after the Moderna booster? Currently, hair loss is a COVID side effect, not a vaccine one. Studies are finding a connection between COVID infection and hair loss, as a long-term impact of having survived the virus. [In a study published August, 2021,](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11845-021-02754-5) scientists found that COVID increased the likelihood of acute telogen effluvium - a non-scaring hair loss. This condition usually occurs 3 months after the stressful event that causes hair shedding, and lasts up to 6 months. In a more general focus on long-term effects of COVID, which remain relatively obscure despite the two-year period of the virus, scientists also noted that hair loss was an issue. Dr Chaolin Huang, writing a study of released COVID patients, explained that: \"The primary outcomes included symptoms (fatigue or muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, hair loss, smell disorder), exercise capacity (distance walked in 6 min), health-related quality of life (pain or discomfort, anxiety or depression, mobility, personal care, and usual activity), lung function, and chest CT pattern at follow-up.\" 3. Can the Moderna booster protect against Omicron? So far, so good. According to research by Imperial College London, booster vaccines are [80% effective](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-48-global-omicron/) against the Omicron variant. However, this study was conducted specifically with Pfizer boosters. Imperial scientists also say that \"Omicron variant-specific vaccines are likely to be required\" to stop infections. Today (20 December) Moderna released some [specific data](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2021/Moderna-Announces-Preliminary-Booster-Data-and-Updates-Strategy-to-Address-Omicron-Variant/default.aspx) about how well their vaccine works. According to the stats, a booster dose of 50 micrograms increases protection 37 times above the level of antibodies that were there with a double-dose. On the other hand, a 100 microgram dose pushes that protection up 83 times what it already was. Right now, this data still needs to be peer-reviewed, but it remains quite hopeful. For reference, both initial shots of Moderna are 100 micrograms each. The company are working on a vaccine that targets Omicron, with clinical trials set to begin in early 2022. For now, only real-world data can explain if the vaccine can protect people throughout the winter. \"The dramatic increase in COVID-19 cases from the Omicron variant is concerning to all.\" said St\u00e9phane Bancel, Moderna CEO. 4. Can I get heart inflammation from taking the vaccine? Yes, there is a very rare possibility. When people are diagnosed with [ heart inflammation](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/covid-vaccine-safe/118705/) after taking an mRNA vaccine, they face a very rare chance of death or severity of illness. Myocarditis, also known as heart inflammation, was found to be associated with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine - although extremely rare, and mostly mild. In a study on over one million Pfizer-vaccinated people in Israel, scientists found 2.7 excess cases of heart inflammation per 100,000 vaccinated individuals. Heart inflammation was also mostly found in men aged between 20 and 34, when it was found at all. Essentially, there were just 11 excess cases of heart inflammation per 100,000 infected individuals. There is no Moderna-specific study on a similar scale, but global medical authorities continue to keep their finger on the pulse of how a vaccine is working. If a potential risk ever becomes substantial, then vaccine guidelines will be updated.
