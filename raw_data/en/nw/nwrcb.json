About Us Choosing someone to help you address and manage painful health problems is a big decision. When trying to find solutions that are effective, safe, and lasting, it's probably not the best idea to choose someone just because 'they are close to you' or just because they 'take your insurance'. Things like skill, experience, creativity, rapport, and customization of treatment is how we have built one of the premier non-surgical, non-pharmaceutical pain relief clinics anywhere around. The most expensive type of healthcare comes from doing things that don't work. If you are the type of person that values their health and wants individualized and effective care...this will be your type of place. We have a myriad of treatments and modalities along with cutting-edge equipment available to help you... and no two cases are treated the same. We attempt to locate, detect, and then correct the cause of your pain...then we do our very best to keep it from returning. We are not a 'cattle mill' office who pushes to see large volumes of patients. We take our time to listen and then collaborate with our patients to find the best options for treatment to help them in the short term by resolving painful conditions as well as making choices to prevent symptoms from returning and keep our patients healthy for the long term. To schedule an appointment, call Alternative Physical Medicine of Colorado or book online today. \"Welcome to the community of people who have decided that their health is a priority and living in pain is no longer acceptable\" Dave Logan shares his personal experience with Alternative Physical Medicine and Dr. Ron Spallone Chiropractic and Physical Medicine Chiropractic K-Laser PEMF Spinal decompression Shockwave Therapy Auto Medicine Prolozone PRP/Platelet Therapy Bio-identical Hormone Custom Orthotics Functional Medicine Peptides Conditions We help Sports Injuries Disc Conditions Shoulder Pain Back Pain Neck Pain Knee Pain Chronic Pain Hip Pain Tendonitis Neuropathy Plantar Fasciitis Our Mission Our mission is to be an integral part of the healthcare team of like-minded families within our community.
