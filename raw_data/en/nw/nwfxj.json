I'm Dr. Katie Resick, and I am the crunchy mama whom owns and operates Optimal Health & Wellness in Natrona Heights. As you can see I am into all things natural from my chiropractic office, massage therapy, 24-Hour Gym, Personal Training, Supplement and Health Store, and yes all the way to chemical free healthy living through Essential Oils! As you can see from my many posts, I use Young Living Essential Oils for my family's health and with the patients in my chiropractic and holistic medicine practice. Read why this is the ONLY BRAND I TRUST. You are probably on this page because you're curious about essential oils and want to know more about how they can help you. Or, you've seen enough and you want to know how you can [buy your own](https://www.youngliving.com/vo/#/signup/start?site=US&sponsorid=2735086&enrollerid=2735086). It's my mission as a doctor and a mama to help you and your family stay healthy and live a non-toxic lifestyle. Even if you have do not have children or are not super into health like I am, trust me when I tell you that these little bottles have literally TRANSFORMED the HEALTH and well being of countless thousands of people around the world, myself and my family included. First - Why Young Living? I have a passion for finding the most natural products possible to support health as you can see by my Store inside my office, and I'm blessed to live in an area of the country where a large percentage of the population feels the same way. Take our food, for example. I have great access to local produce, fresh farm eggs, and pastured meats. I also look for soy-free, GMO-free organic food as much as possible for my family. In a nutshell, I want to know what I'm putting in my body, and I want my family to thrive without health struggles and medication. So, it's only natural that I would set the bar very high when choosing an essential oil company. Young Living is the only company that owns it own farms and oversees the production of its oils from Seed to Seal. Consumers are free to visit Young Living in Utah and see the process first hand, in the lavender fields and in the distillation facility. Try that with another company! [Take a look at this site to find out more for yourself](http://seedtoseal.com/en). These oils are pure and unadulterated and are made to be used therapeutically, and in many cases, internally. You will never be able to do this with a health food store oil. Just look at the label. If it says DO NOT INGEST, why would you rub it on your skin or inhale it? Your nasal membranes and skin are very porous and sensitive to anything with contact with them whether you realize it or not. How Do I Know Which Oils I Need? Young Living has over 168 single oils and blends, so how in the world do you know which ones to get first? It can be quite overwhelming, but the process has been simplified so that it's easy to get started. There are a few oils that are like your kitchen staples. You know, the ones you build meals around because they're so versatile? Young Living has put all these together in the Premium Starter Kit which is the easiest and most economical way to start using essential oils: What's included? - 10 of the most popular oils in a beautifully crafted display box - a choice of one aromatherapy diffuser made specially to disperse oils into the air - a bonus bottle of Stress Away, a \"tropical vacation in a bottle\" - 10 sample sachets of 5 different oils, so you can share - 2- 2oz packs of a super anti-oxidant drink, Ningxia Red - a roller ball to attach to any bottle for easy application - 10 mini sample bottles made to share - product info cards with cutouts for sample bottles - tons of great info in the box, including a full-size product guide What you need to know: - No membership fees - No Sign Up Fees - No Annual fees - No minimum orders - No requirements - No catch! Just purchase the kit and enjoy 24% off anytime you want to order! Are you now thinking how will I learn how to use all these oils? We make it simple! Education through our private online group, [Online and In-Person Classes](/eoclass/) and more! HOW CAN I GET THESE OILS? I recommend to all my friends, family and patients that they take advantage of the tremendous savings of becoming a Young Living wholesale member. This is the only way to get the starter kit shown above. The items in this kit retail for over $300 if purchased separately. But as a wholesale member, your price is only $160! And, once you become a member, you will save 24% on all future orders. Do not click to sign-up if you are not ready to purchase. If you want to look around- visit [www.YoungLiving.com](http://www.YoungLiving.com) then come back and click to purchase when you are ready to buy! DO I HAVE TO SELL STUFF IF I JOIN? Good news! Stick with me here. There are absolutely no strings attached! You never have to speak a word of these oils to anyone else (but you will) unless you want to. You are under no obligation to ever buy anything again. If you want to keep your account active, you simply spend $50 per year. If you don't, nothing lost, no penalty. This was another huge reason I chose to purchase from this company, aside from the astounding quality and effectiveness. As a Young Living wholesale member, you also have the option to join the optional frequent buyer's club called Essential Rewards. Again, you don't have to. But once you start using these oils, you'll want more! And if you're buying monthly anyway, like I am, you may as well get points back to use toward future purchases. I'll be happy to tell you more about this program if you're interested. If you decide to sign up using the link below, you can opt to simply skip the Essential Rewards portion so you can experience the oils before you decide. You can always enjoy added savings and perks later on. Here's a Quick Overview of the Signup Process: PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE don't forget to CONFIRM YOUR ORDER if you decide to sign up! I've had several sad people miss this step. When you've completed your order, you will receive a welcome email from Young Living, and that beautiful kit of wellness will be on its way. Click here to see a beautiful color brochure giving a quick outline of the starter kit with possible uses for each oil. If you are ready to ditch the drugstore, rid your home of dangerous toxins, and make lasting changes in your family's health, then NOW is the time to take the plunge. When you sign up for your kit, I will send you a welcome email. Simply reply to that email and I will send your reference package right away! I'm so happy that I discovered these oils and nearly every day I am surprised by how they are replacing toxic products that I used to buy regularly- even some organic lotions, cleaners, detergents etc still have unwanted items in them. It's amazing how many chemicals we're dousing ourselves with daily! Even \"natural\" and \"gentle\" products can contain really nasty ingredients because these words aren't regulated by the FDA. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. And when you're ready to start your own health transformation, sign up here. I look forward to seeing you thrive!
