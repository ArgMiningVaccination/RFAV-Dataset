Aromatherapy is the practice of using essential oils for therapeutic and cosmetic purposes. The surge in demand for aromatherapy can be ascribed to a number of causes, the most prominent of which is the general increase in income over the last decade. Consumer tastes and preferences have changed toward more complex products as earnings have increased. Essential oils have become a critical ingredient of choice for food processors as the global food and beverage industry undergoes a gradual but major transformation in terms of ingredient compositions, owing to the growing customer preference for natural and organic products. As consumer awareness about the harmful health effects of synthetic chemicals used for flavor applications grows, manufacturers are encouraged to use natural ingredients such as essential oils to improve the aesthetic appeal of food products while also improving the nutritional and functional properties. This in turn is expected to drive the growth of the essential oil market. Regulations encouraging the use of ecologically friendly substances in cosmetics and the food and beverage industries have piqued people's interest in seeking out natural products. The demand for 100 percent plant-based oils that are free of synthetic scents and animal-derived components has skyrocketed in recent years. As a result, the vast majority of people are turning to organic products to improve their health. This is further expected to increase the essential oil market size.
