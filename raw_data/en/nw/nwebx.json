Ratings and Reviews This app helped me through the worst year of my life. I have never reviewed an app before but really feel compelled to for Balance. 2022 was unfortunately a very terrible year for me due to personal loss, mental health, and a soul crushing ending to a 10+ years long relationship, and as usual it seemed like all of these things hit at the same time. I was struggling so badly and really didn't think I was going to make it through at times. While trying to get medical help, I found the free year of Balance offer somewhere and figured it couldn't hurt to try at that point, though I'd never really been a big believer in meditation. I am so happy to admit how wrong I was- this app helped my emotional health so much before and after I got the additional help I needed. The sleep modules in particular were so helpful- Ofosu's voice alone is so calming and peaceful, and the meditations really help my mind stop wandering until it can relax and I can fall asleep. There are so many great non-sleep modules as well for different situations - it seems like there's something there anytime I need it. Sometimes I go in knowing I will feel emotional, but sometimes it sneaks up on me in an unexpected and beautiful way too. I just purchased the lifetime plan- even though I don't rely on this as a crutch like I used to, it has become something I want to do instead of something I have to do to get though the day. A M A Z I N G This app is beyond amazing! I love it so much. All of the single meditations are like little bites of joy when you need it, or a helping hand for the soul if things are rocky. I was already using another well-known app pretty regularly, but the set-up of this one is just perfect. You can choose to follow along with a plan or open the app up for a quick single meditation based on your specific need at the time. And the best part is, you can choose the duration of time that works specifically for you. Usually it's 5 or 10 minutes but with some, they go down to 3 minutes or up to 15. I cannot say enough good things about this app. Thank you for being so kind and generous with your software during this wild time; it does not go unnoticed. I will happily sign up for the paid subscription to this beautiful app when the time comes. Some kind suggestions: I would love to see more single meditations added on a regular basis, or different variations of the same ones. For instance, with the concentrate meditation, I was surprised that it didn't include visualization. On that note, I would LOVE to see an entire guided plan for visualization practice/learning how to visualize. It would be cool if there was a log to see which meditations you did on which days. Also, different breathing techniques included in different meditations \u2014 I adore the 'energize' single. That's all for now. Thank you again, you beautiful humans! xoxo Best and favorite app by far!! I had been hearing the many benefits that meditation has to offer, but hadn't ever tried it. I was skeptical at first but I downloaded the Balance application just to see what all the fuss was about. I was absolutely amazed that after only one session, I felt so calm, relaxed and just better in general. I guess I wasn't aware of exactly how tense and stressed I was. I have since recommended this app to all of my family and friends and they too are very impressed. With all the things we have going on day to day, we tend to forget to take care of ourselves and we don't realize how important self are is. The Balance app does just that, it helps you balance and manage those day to day stresses and make life more manageable and enjoyable. There's truth in the saying \"you need to stop and smell the roses,\" and this wellness app helps you do that! I love the fact that Balance makes a personalized program to suit each individual's needs based on how you answer questions within the app. There are also \"singles\" you can do that are helpful if you're feeling a certain way or having trouble sleeping or focusing etc...I'm not usually one to write a review on an application but I highly recommend this app to everyone!! If you are open to exploring the benefits that meditation has to offer and want balance and wellness in your life, then this is the app for you!!
