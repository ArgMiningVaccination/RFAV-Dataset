Part 2: This phase will assess the efficacy of prophylactic VXA-CoV2-1.1-S against confirmed COVID-19 occurring from 7 days after second dose with a repeat-dose vaccination schedule in healthy adults compared to placebo. Safety and immunogenicity of VXA-CoV2-1.1-S will also be evaluated in this or disease||Intervention/treatment||Phase| |COVID-19||Drug: VXA-CoV2-1.1-S Other: This is an open-label, dose-ranging phase of the study to determine the safety and immunogenicity of an orally administered adenoviral-vector based vaccine (VXA-COV2-1.1-S) expressing a SARS-CoV-2 antigen and dsRNA adjuvant. Post screening activities, healthy adult volunteers, either na\u00efve or prior vaccinated with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, aged 18 - 55 yrs old, and then 56 - 75 yrs old, will be enrolled into the study in 8 subgroups. Participants will receive either a low or a high dose of an oral tableted vaccine at Days 1 and Day 29. The total study period will last ~ 2 months during the active phase, with a total 12 month safety follow-up period post last vaccination. Safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity assessments will be performed at set times during the study active and follow-up periods. Subjects will be monitored for symptoms of COVID-19 throughout the duration of the study follow-up period. An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will provide safety oversight through the duration of the trial. Safety and immunogenicity data will inform on the dose selection for Part 2. Part 2: This will be a placebo-controlled phase with the vaccine dose level selected from Part 1. Subjects will receive two doses of vaccine or placebo at Days 1 and 29. Subjects will be followed as in Part 1 for safety and immunogenicity. They will also be followed for 6 months for efficacy. |Study Type dose and age escalation lead in phase in naive and prior vaccinated subjects, followed by a multi-center, placebo-controlled efficacy phase.| Determine the Safety, Immunogenicity and Efficacy of an Adenoviral-Vector Based Vaccine Expressing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and dsRNA Adjuvant Administered Orally| |Actual Study Start Date |Actual Primary Date :||May Disease](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6544/acute-graft-versus-host-disease) [Severe Acute | Experimental: Part 1 (Na\u00efve, young adult) | 1E10 repeat-dose vaccinations with VXA-CoV2-1.1-S at Days 1 and 29 in young adults (18-55 yrs) who are vaccine na\u00efve | Drug: VXA-CoV2-1.1-S | COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) E1-/E3-Deleted Replication Defective Recombinant Adenovirus 5 with dsRNA Adjuvant Oral Tablet Vaccine Other Name: Oral Tableted Ad5 COVID-19 Vaccine | Experimental: Part 1 Cohort 1b (Na\u00efve, high dose, young adult) | 1E11 repeat-dose vaccinations with VXA-CoV2-1.1-S at Days 1 and 29 in young adults (18-55 yrs) who are vaccine na\u00efve | Drug: VXA-CoV2-1.1-S | COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) E1-/E3-Deleted Replication Defective Recombinant Adenovirus 5 with dsRNA Adjuvant Oral Tablet Vaccine Other Name: Oral Tableted Ad5 COVID-19 Vaccine | Experimental: Part 1 Cohort 1c (Na\u00efve, low dose, older adult) | 1E10 repeat-dose vaccinations with VXA-CoV2-1.1-S at Days 1 and 29 in older adults (56-75 yrs) who are vaccine na\u00efve | Drug: VXA-CoV2-1.1-S | COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) E1-/E3-Deleted Replication Defective Recombinant Adenovirus 5 with dsRNA Adjuvant Oral Tablet Vaccine Other Name: Oral Tableted Ad5 COVID-19 Vaccine | Experimental: Part 1 Cohort 1d (Na\u00efve, high dose, older adult) | 1E11 repeat-dose vaccinations with VXA-CoV2-1.1-S at Days 1 and 29 in older adults (56-75 yrs) who are vaccine na\u00efve | Drug: VXA-CoV2-1.1-S | COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) E1-/E3-Deleted Replication Defective Recombinant Adenovirus 5 with dsRNA Adjuvant Oral Tablet Vaccine Other Name: Oral Tableted Ad5 COVID-19 Vaccine | Experimental: Part 1 Cohort 2a (Prior vaccinated, low dose, young adult) | 1E10 repeat-dose vaccinations with VXA-CoV2-1.1-S at Days 1 and 29 in young adults (18-55 yrs) who have received prior vaccinations with an mRNA vaccine | Drug: VXA-CoV2-1.1-S | COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) E1-/E3-Deleted Replication Defective Recombinant Adenovirus 5 with dsRNA Adjuvant Oral Tablet Vaccine Other Name: Oral Tableted Ad5 COVID-19 Vaccine | Experimental: Part 1 Cohort 2b (Prior vaccinated, high dose, young adult) | 1E11 repeat-dose vaccinations with VXA-CoV2-1.1-S at Days 1 and 29 in young adults (18-55 yrs) who have received prior vaccinations with an mRNA vaccine | Drug: VXA-CoV2-1.1-S | COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) E1-/E3-Deleted Replication Defective Recombinant Adenovirus 5 with dsRNA Adjuvant Oral Tablet Vaccine Other Name: Oral Tableted Ad5 COVID-19 Vaccine | Experimental: Part 1 Cohort 2c (Prior vaccinated, low dose, older adult) | 1E10 repeat-dose vaccinations with VXA-CoV2-1.1-S at Days 1 and 29 in older adults (56-75 yrs) who have received prior vaccinations with an mRNA vaccine | Drug: VXA-CoV2-1.1-S | COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) E1-/E3-Deleted Replication Defective Recombinant Adenovirus 5 with dsRNA Adjuvant Oral Tablet Vaccine Other Name: Oral Tableted Ad5 COVID-19 Vaccine | Experimental: Part 1 Cohort 2d (Prior vaccinated, high dose, older adult) | 1E11 repeat-dose vaccinations with VXA-CoV2-1.1-S at Days 1 and 29 in older adults (56-75 yrs) who have received prior vaccinations with an mRNA vaccine | Drug: VXA-CoV2-1.1-S | COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) E1-/E3-Deleted Replication Defective Recombinant Adenovirus 5 with dsRNA Adjuvant Oral Tablet Vaccine Other Name: Oral Tableted Ad5 COVID-19 Vaccine | Experimental: Part 2 Healthy Adults: Active vaccine | Repeat dose vaccinations with VXA-CoV2-1.1-S at dose selected from Part 1 in healthy male and female adult volunteers 18 to 75 years old | Drug: VXA-CoV2-1.1-S | COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) E1-/E3-Deleted Replication Defective Recombinant Adenovirus 5 with dsRNA Adjuvant Oral Tablet Vaccine Other Name: Oral Tableted Ad5 COVID-19 Vaccine | Placebo Comparator: Part 2 Healthy Adults: Placebo control | Repeat dose administration with matching placebo tablets in healthy male and female adult volunteers 18 to 75 years old | Other: Placebo Tablets | Placebo tablets matching the active vaccine tablets -
