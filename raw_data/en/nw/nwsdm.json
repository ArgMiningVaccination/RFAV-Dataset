Supporting natural balance Under normal circumstances, healthy flora is balanced in the body and causes no harm. However, correct balance of digestive flora is important in maintaining health in many different body systems, as well as certain parts of your body. Candida overgrowth and/or candidiasis can lead to stomach problems and digestive problems such as bloating, constipation, or diarrhea. A balanced pH level is the key to maintaining balanced systemic flora. The body has a healthy pH (alkaline or acidity level) of 6.4 if measuring urine or saliva. Maintaining pH balance within the normal range - neither too acidic, nor too alkaline - is important to support digestive flora. The natural ability to keep conditions stable also depends greatly on the immune system, which also helps to support normal pH and maintain acid balance in the body. A healthy diet is the best way to support the immune system. The Natural Way There are many natural ways to support the immune system such as diet, adequate sleep, moderate exercise, and relaxation. pH and digestive flora can also be kept at appropriate levels by avoiding excess grains, dairy, sugar, dietary yeast and most processed foods in the diet. Raw vegetables should also be included in a healthy eating plan. Some experts recommend a Candida cleanse diet, which includes no sugar, white flour, yeast and cheese, based on the theory that these foods promote Candida overgrowth. However, today's modern lifestyle is filled with fast food, pollution, and stress. Over time, these factors can sometimes affect the body, particularly the body's natural ability to keep digestive health and flora in check. Acidophilus is a probiotic culture that is present in most yogurts (especially organic sugar-free yogurt). This probiotic culture contains plenty of probiotics and can help to support the immune system and maintain normal flora in the system. Natural remedies have been used for thousands of years to support the immune system, a healthy balance of pH and balanced probiotics in the body. In more recent times, research has confirmed this traditional wisdom. "}
