A carton of vials may take up to 3 hours to thaw, and thawed vials can be stored in the refrigerator for up to five days (120 hours) o Allowing vial(s) to sit at room temperature [up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F)] for 30 minutes Using either thawing method, vials must reach room temperature before dilution and must be diluted within 2 hours Step 2: Invert Before dilution invert vaccine vial gently 10 times Do not shake Inspect the liquid in the vial prior to dilution. The liquid is a white to off-white suspension and may contain white to off-white opaque amorphous particles Do not use if liquid is discolored or if other particles are observed Step 3: Dilute Obtain sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Use only this as the diluent Using aseptic technique, withdraw 1.8 mL of dil uent into a transfer syringe (21 -gauge or narrower needle) Cleanse the vaccine vial stopper with a single -use antiseptic swab Add 1.8 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP into the vaccine vial Step 4: Equalize Equalize vial pressure before removing the needle from the vial by withdrawing 1.8 mL of air into the empty diluent syringe Procedure for Preparation and Reconstitution of Pfizer's COVID -19 Vaccine Step 5: Invert Gently invert the vial containing the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine 10 times to mix Do not shake Inspect the vaccine in the vial The vaccine will be an off -white suspension. Do not use if vaccine is discolored or contains particulate matter Step 6: Record and Store Record the date and time of dilution on the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID - 19 Vaccine vial label Store between 2\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (35\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F) Discard any unused vaccine 6 hours after dilution Cleanse Using aseptic technique, cleanse the vial stopper with a single -use antiseptic swab, and withdraw 0.3 mL of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine Administer immediately For each additional dose, use a new sterile syringe and needle and ensure the vial stopper is cleansed with antiseptic before each withdrawal. Verify the final dosing volume of 0.3 mL. Multiple Dose Vial The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine Multiple Dose Vial, when diluted, contains 5 vaccine doses. Dosing and Schedule The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccination is administered intramuscularly as a series of 2 doses (0.3 mL each) 3 weeks apart. Procedure for Preparation and Reconstitution of Pfizer's COVID -19 Vaccine Dose Preparation The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine Multiple Dose V ial contains a frozen suspension that does not contain preservative and must be thawed and diluted prior to administration Vials may be thawed in the refrigerator or at room temperature [up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F)] Prior to dilution , the thawed suspension may conta in white to off -white opaque amorphous particles The contents of the vial must be diluted with 1.8 mL of sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to form the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine After dilution, the vial contains 5 doses of 0.3 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is not packaged with the vaccine and must be sourced separately. Do not use bacteriostatic 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or any other diluent. Please see the Q&A section for more information on dose preparation After dilution , the vaccine will be an off -white suspension. Inspect vials to confirm there are no particulates and no discoloration is observed Strict adherence to aseptic "}
