Decreased performance of our physical immunity makes us defenseless from outside invaders, diseases, viruses, and illness- whereas an overactive system drives the body to attack its own tissues- a behavior known as AUTOIMMUNE disease. INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE OF NY specializes in Clinical Immunotherapy- the science of maintaining, balancing, and treating the body's immune system. Poor Nutrition, Infection, Toxins, Trauma and Stress are the main causes of our immune system to fail or malfunction. This causes illness and disease to occur when our bodies are 'defenseless' against outside influencers like viruses. Autoimmune diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, Thyroiditis, Lupus, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Diabetes are some of the most debilitating diseases caused by our malfunctioning immune system- generating antibodies that attack our tissues instead of defending us. An autoimmune disease can appear in many different ways and can affect a wide range of our functions and organs simultaneously. The specialized study of immunotherapy targets and reverses autoimmune diseases. This therapy consists of various mixes of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients that are given slowly, directly into a vein, through a small needle. It can be very useful in situations where oral nutrients or other therapies are not working or are working to slowly. When nutrients are given intravenously, your digestive system is bypassed and a much higher level of nutrition can be delivered directly to your cells via the bloodstream. The nutrients then kick-start your system on a cellular level. This type of therapy would be especially appropriate for anyone who has digestive problems, including bloating, diarrhea, food allergies, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, or other GI problems or anyone with an acute condition that we want to resolve quickly. For example, one IV solution that we use is called a Myer's cocktail, named after Dr. John Myer. He was a pioneering physician and was the first physician to extensively use intravenous nutrient therapy to obtain positive clinical results for a variety of medical conditions. The general effect of a Myers Cocktail intravenous therapy appears to be a marked improvement in the energy capacity and function of cells. If your cells can function at their best, it's more likely you can recover faster. People respond differently to intravenous nutrient therapy. Some may only need an occasional Myers' Cocktail, while others may need one monthly or even weekly in order to keep their healing momentum going forward. Once you've tried one or two you'll feel when your body needs another. The Myers Cocktail IV therapy may be helpful for many chronic or acute conditions, including fatigue, fibromyalgia, depression, infection, asthma, palpitations, migraine headaches, cardiovascular disease, respiratory problems, seasonal allergies, hives, hyperthyroidism, and acute muscle spasms, to name a few. A Myers' Cocktail can even help athletes recover faster from an illness so they can participate in an event. Along with our nutritionist, physician, and other staff members, we'll design a vitamin regime specific to your needs. This might include intravenous drips of vitamin C for a wide range of conditions. Given intravenously, much higher concentrations of vitamin C can be attained. At this higher concentration, vitamin C has different characteristics than if given orally, as it boosts immunity and assists in tissue repair. Furthermore, at these high doses delivered directly into the bloodstream, it may act to increase levels of hydrogen peroxide deep in the tissues, assisting white blood cells in fighting infection and possibly cancer. The nutrients then kick-start your system on a cellular level. This type of therapy would be especially appropriate for anyone who has digestive problems, including bloating, diarrhea, food allergies, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, or other GI problems or anyone with an acute condition that we want to resolve quickly. Treatment of allergies, in addition to other treatments offered at the PBW, supplements may be recommended to further alleviate allergy related symptoms and improve immune function. For example, Vitamin C is an antioxidant and acts to boost immunity and support the adrenal glands. N-acetyl-cysteine is an antioxidant involved in glutathione production and is an enhancement to immune function as well. It assists restoration of free breathing and healthy bronchial activity by breaking up mucus associated with allergies. Quercitin is a bioflavonoid that acts as a histamine reducing agent as well as an anti-inflammatory. The mineral rich herb Nettles is helpful in relieving symptoms of allergies such as runny nose and congestion. Auto immunity develops when the body initiates an immune response against its own cells and tissues. Auto immune disorders respond well to immune boosting vitamin C in therapeutic doses. Wobenzym, is an enzyme supplement that works systemically to reduce the formation of circulating immune complexes that cause inflammation and pain. Cyto-ess is an immune modulator and is recommended to provide components of a healthy immune system for a balanced response and continuous support. EPA is an essential fatty acid that reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins. DHEA helps to reduce adrenal stress and the over production of cortisol.Autism and Dietary SupplementationChildren with autism often have self-limiting food choices, and poorly functioning enzymes and nutrient absorption, resulting in various nutritional deficiencies. These nutrients, when in short supply, are implicated in poor speech development, mood swings and difficult behaviors. B vitamin complex is important for growth, carbohydrate metabolism, energy production, mood, and healthy skin, hair, and nerves. B-12 supplementation helps stabilize the mood and improve methylation, an important route of detoxification. Glutathione is a powerful antioxidant and detoxifier that helps recovery from heavy metal contamination. Cod liver oil, with essential fatty acids EPA and DHA and vitamins D and A improves the mood, brain function and immune health. Specific enzymes may be added to reduce the effects of food sensitivities and improve digestion. Probiotics support immune function in the gut. A Greens supplement may be recommended for children with extreme food choices, to replace important nutrients obtained from green vegetables. Often those who have had Lyme disease continue to suffer from inflammation, muscle and joint pain, and extreme fatigue. Weakened immunity is often present. Vitamin C therapy and pycnogenol act as antioxidants and immune system boosters. Curamin, an herbal anti-inflammatory without negative effects on gut lining, liver or kidneys may be recommended as well. Wobenzym, an enzyme supplement is recommended to reduce the formation of inflammatory molecules in the body, reducing aches and pain. Cyto-ess helps to provide components of a healthy immune system and reduce overreaction. Essential fatty acid EPA, an omega-3 fat, helps to discourage the formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reducing overall inflammation. Address: 520 Franklin Ave, "}
