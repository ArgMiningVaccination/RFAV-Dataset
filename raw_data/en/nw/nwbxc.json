Mis en place en 2012 par le r\u00e9seau Sentinelles, c'est un projet de surveillance Back in 2016, a team from Inserm had made a major contribution to the development of an aerosol capable of rapidly administering, into the deepest reaches of the lungs, an antidote to ricin. Ricin is highly toxic when inhaled and dreaded in the event of a bioterrorism attack. Among the challenges addressed: adapt this antibody for clinical use and, above all, succeed in effectively delivering it into the lungs - particularly into the small air sacs where ricin has a devastating effect. This is the reason why the French army sought the help of an Inserm laboratory specialized in biological medicinal product administration via the respiratory route. The project was funded by the French government defense procurement and technology agency (DGA). Usutu is an arbovirus from the same family as the Zika and West Nile viruses. Like its cousins, it is transmitted by mosquitoes. While we know that it is responsible for high mortality in birds, principally passerines, knowledge on human pathology remains limited. Only 26 cases of human infection by Usutu have been reported in Europe, a figure which is most certainly underestimated according to Yannick Simonin, lecturer-researcher specialized in the virus, given the non-existence of commercial screening tests and the general ignorance of the associated symptoms. Animal studies show very strong neurological tropism of Usutu. Very recently, Simonin and his team from Unit 1058 \"Pathogenesis and control of chronic infections\" (Inserm/Universit\u00e9 Montpellier/Montpellier University Hospital/ EFS) published in Emerging Infectious Diseases results showing its presence in the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient from Montpellier University Hospital in 2016, confirming this neurotropism. The clinical symptoms of the patient, which included temporary facial paralysis, had not until that point been linked to any specific disease. Additional investigations are necessary if we are to improve our understanding of the clinical picture associated with this emerging virus. The research activities developed by JRU 1058 include determining the virulence, notably neuronal, of the various Usutu strains circulating in France in order to compare them in the laboratory and evaluate their pathogenicity. The Unit is also studying the transmission mechanisms of the virus in order to better elucidate the associated risks. The Astre unit of [CIRAD](https://www.cirad.fr/) partner of Unit 1058 for this study, is also participating in vector mapping the Usutu virus. \u00a9 Fotolia A study published in the Bulletin \u00e9pid\u00e9miologique hebdomadaire (BEH - Weekly Epidemiology Report) for World Parkinson's Day suggests that the risk of developing the disease is higher in people who live in farming districts. A national study, published in the BEH devoted to the epidemiology of Parkinson's disease in France, is researching the incidence of Parkinson's disease in relation to the agricultural characteristics of French districts. Two Inserm researchers, Sofiane Kab and Alexis Elbaz (Inserm/Sant\u00e9 Publique France) are participating in the study. By analyzing the French state health insurance's SNIIRAM database, this national study confirms that Parkinson's disease is associated with professional exposure to pesticides, a fact that has already been revealed by several studies. This has made it possible to observe that Parkinson's disease occurs more frequently among those affiliated to the social security body for agricultural workers (Mutualit\u00e9 Sociale Agricole), particularly farmers, than among affiliates of other national health insurance plans. On top of this, the results suggest that non-professional pesticide exposure related to environmental exposure, for example, could also increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease. The number of cases of Parkinson's disease that can be attributed to pesticide exposure is thought to surpass professional exposure. These results do need to be confirmed by complementary studies. Yet they tend to confirm that the incidence of Parkinson's disease in the general population is higher in the most highly agricultural districts, especially viticultural districts.

Show you care.\" and the #ShowYourRare hashtag. World Rare Disease Day was created in 2008 by [EURORDIS](https://www.eurordis.org/fr/news/rares-fiers-soyons-solidaires-lors-de-la-journee-internationale-des-maladies-rares-2018) and the Council of National Alliances. Ninety countries will be participating in 2018. [Orphanet](http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/index.php?lng=FR), which is coordinated by Inserm and is a member of the Rare Disease Platform, is the portal of reference for rare diseases and orphan drugs. It offers an array of freely accessible services to allow patients to understand their disease and its consequences, and to orient them in their care pathways by identifying diagnosis laboratories and reference centers. A large consortium headed by the University of T\u00fcbingen (Germany), the Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen (Netherlands), and the University of Leicester (UK), as well as Inserm in France through Orphanet, two major research institutions (the Myology Center for Research and the Brain and Spine institute in Paris), Eurordis, and the Dijon University Hospital, received a \u20ac15 million grant for the SOLVE-RD research program. Today, no less than twenty-four European Reference Networks (ERN) have been set up to improve and harmonize diagnosis and treatment for people with rare diseases. To date, four of them have joined SOLVE-RD by adding and sharing their patient data: [RND](http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/Clinics_Networks.php?lng=FR&data_id=120788&title=ERN-RND--European-Reference-Network-on-Rare-Neurological-Diseases&search=Disease_Search_Simple) for rare neurological diseases, [EURO-NMD](http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/Clinics_Search.php?lng=FR&data_id=118639&Centres%20experts=Expert-team-for-rare-neuromuscular-diseases---Team-NMD&title=Expert-team-for-rare-neuromuscular-diseases---Team-NMD&search=Clinics_Search_Name) for neuromuscular diseases, [ITHACA](http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=fr&Expert=485586) for congenital malformations and intellectual disability, and [GENTURIS](http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=fr&Expert=483651) for genetic tumor risk syndromes. Other ERNs will join the project in the months to come.

While this principle may currently seem less vital, or even optional, to parents who no longer face the same tragedies arising from infection as in the past, it nonetheless remains an essential public health measure. Mandatory immunization came into force on January 1, 2018, and has thus given rise to concerns and debate in public opinion. Numerous scientific falsehoods are doing the rounds, underlining the so-called hazards of vaccines, and debating the relevance of immunization. On December 18, Inserm published a [Clarification](http://presse.inserm.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PPInsermVaccins2018V2.pdf) which aims to provide the scientific perspective on the 11 vaccines which will be mandatory for all infants in France in 2018. In the face of these rumors, Alain Fischer, pediatrician, immunology researcher, coordinator of Concertation Citoyenne sur la vaccination, and Philippe Sansonetti, specialist in infectious diseases, microbiology researcher, author of \"Vaccins\", both professors at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, have joined forces to offer an in-depth review of every aspect of immunization.

(What (only available in French)](https://youtu.be/c7sahtPIwcc) The [Sentinel network](https://websenti.u707.jussieu.fr/sentiweb/?page=presentation), a collaborative surveillance system developed by Inserm and Pierre and Marie Curie University (UPMC), is made up of 1,300 primary care practitioners, and approximately one hundred independent pediatricians, spread over mainland France. The network is coordinated by the \"Transmissible Diseases Surveillance and Modeling\" team at the Inserm and UPMC Pierre Louis Epidemiology and Public Health Institute (iPLESP), in collaboration with the French National Public Health Agency (ANRS) and Sant\u00e9 Publique France (French Public Health Agency). The data are transferred in real time, based on 9 health indicators. Analysis of these data thus makes it possible to estimate the weekly incidence rate for each indicator, and to monitor changes at national level. According to the weekly Sentinel network newsletter dated December 13, 2017, the incidence rate for cases of acute diarrhea is above the epidemic threshold (188 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). According to the Sentinel network, it is still too early to talk about an epidemic, strictly speaking, and the level of activity for acute diarrhea should remain stable in the next few weeks. The Sentinel network states that the highest incidence rates for acute diarrhea have been observed in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4tes d'Azur, Pays de la Loire, and Hauts-de-France regions. On the other hand, influenza syndrome, until now well below the epidemic threshold, has increased from 19 cases, to 98 cases per 10,000 inhabitants. The highest incidence rates have been observed in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur, Brittany, and Centre-Val de Loire regions. The Sentinel network, which now comprises a new instrument for detecting influenza epidemics developed with Sant\u00e9 Publique France (French Public Health Agency), indicates a marked increase in influenza activity in mainland France.
