CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 4 SECTION 1: Disaster Response Overview Definitions of Disaster A disaster is a natural or human-caused occurrence (e.g., hurricane, tornado, flood, tsunami, earthquake, explosion, hazardous materials accident, mass criminal victimization incident, war, transportation accident, fire, terrorist attack, famine, epidemic) that causes human suffering. A disaster creates a collective need that overwhelms local resources and requires additional assistance. Adapted from the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), 2000. A disaster is any natural catastrophe (e.g., tornado, hurricane, storm, high water, wind- driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, drought) or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion in any part of the United States that, in the determination of the President, causes sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1974 (Stafford Act). Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 1974. Notes: CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 5 Characteristics of This Disaster Worksheet Cause: Size: Scope: Natural or Human- caused Disaster: Impact on survivors: CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 6 Natural v. Human- Caused Disasters Natural Human-Caused Earthquakes, fires, floods, tornadoes Airplane crashes, chemical leaks, mass violence, terrorism No one to blame People, governments, or businesses to blame Beyond human control Seen as preventable and a betrayal by fellow humans Advance warning is possible No advance warning Post-disaster distress is high and felt mainly by survivors Post-disaster dis tress is often more intense than the distress experienced by people after natural disasters , and it is felt by more people not directly affected by the disaster CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 7 Feder al Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) Disaster Assistance FEMA Disaster Operations Structure Thi s chart reflects a typical disaster response structure in the immediate aftermath of large, usually natural, disasters. In a typical disaster, it is the responsibility of the FEMA region where the disaster occurred to carry out the initial response, do damage assessments, set up a joint field office, and deploy staff. Immediately after the declaration, FEMA disaster workers arrive and set up a central field office to coordinate the recovery effort. A toll -free telephone number is available for use by affected residents and business owners in registering for assistance (1 -800-621 - FEMA [3362] or TTY 1-800-462-7585 for people with speech or hearing needs). Disaster recovery centers are open for disaster survivors to meet with program representatives and obtain information about available aid and the recovery process. CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 8 Types of Assistance Available From FEMA The Presidential disaster declaration will specify the types of assistance for which a state is eligible. Hazard Mitigation\u2014Disaster survivors and public entities are encouraged to avoid the life and property risks of future disasters. Examples include the elevation or relocation of chronically flood-damaged homes away from flood hazard areas, retrofitting buildings to make them resistant to earthquakes or strong winds, and adoption and enforcement of adequate codes and standards by local, s tate, and federal governments. Public Assistance\u2014Aid to s tate or local governments to pay part of the costs of rebuilding a community's damaged infrastructure. Generally, public assistance programs pay for 75 percent of the approved project costs. Public assistance may include debris removal, emergency protective measures and public services, repair of damaged public property, loans needed by communities for essential government functions, and grants for public schools. Individual Assistance\u2014Includes FEMA CCPs and is covered in detail in this section.

CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 11 The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Disaster Technical Assistance Center ( DTAC ) Provides TA to the SAMHSA Project Officer , FEMA, and the CCP . Is a resource for materials and trainings . Notes: CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 12 SECTION 2: Crisis Counseling Program and Services The CCP model is . . . Strengths based\u2014While CCP workers may assess significant adverse reactions and refer people accordingly, program services assume natural resilience in individuals and communities. Anonymous\u2014People should not be classified, labeled, or diagnosed. Each person should be seen as unique in his or her needs and recovery. Therefore, there are no case files, records, or diagnoses for users of CCP services. Outreach oriented\u2014Crisis counselors take services into the community rather than waiting for survivors to seek services. Culturally aware \u2014Throughout the project, staff should strive to understand and respect the community and the cultures within the community. Conducted in nontraditional settings\u2014Crisis counseling is community based and occurs primarily in homes, community centers, disaster shelters, and settings other than traditional mental health clinics or hospitals. Designed to strengthen existing community support systems\u2014The CCP supports but does not supplant natural community support systems. Likewise, the crisis counselor supports community recovery activities but does not organize or manage them. Based on an assumption of natural resilience and competence\u2014Most people will recover and move on with their lives after a disaster, even without assistance. Promote independence rather than dependence on the CCP, other people, or other organizations and assume competence in recovery. A key step in recovery is regaining a sense of mastery and control. CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 13 Traditional Treatment v. Crisis Counseling Notes: Traditional Treatment Is office-based May involve diagnosis and treatment of mental illness, as well as identification of strengths and coping skills May focus on longer-term issues Validates experiences associated with distress that has brought the person to treatment Keeps records, charts, case files, etc. Crisis Counseling Is home-and community-based Involves identification of strengths and coping skills Counsels on disaster-related issues Validates common disaster reactions and experiences Does not collect identifying information CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 14 Reach of Services CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 15 Overview of CCP Services Individual crisis counseling\u2014Assists disaster survivors in understanding their current situation s and reactions, reviewing their options, and linking them with other individuals and agencies that may assist them. During individual services, crisis counseling staff are active listeners who provide emotional support. Individual crisis counseling also includes working with the family as a unit. This service is more than 15 minutes in duration. Brief educational or supportive contact \u2014The number of brief contacts with individuals, or groups of individuals, that did not result in indepth discussion or interaction of an educational or crisis counseling nature. This service is 15 minutes or less in duration. Group crisis counseling\u2014Involves providing and facilitating support or education to a group to help members cope with their situations and reactions. Public education\u2014Involves the distribution of educational information on CCP or crisis counseling-related topics. Educational information may be provided via public presentations, brochures, flyers, mailings, and training to human services personnel. The media are often partners in providing information through public service announcements, newspaper articles, and advertisements. Assessment, referral, and resource linkage\u2014Assessment determines the need for referral. Referrals can link survivors experiencing severe reactions with formal mental health and substance abuse treatment. Referrals also can direct survivors to other disaster relief resources in their community to meet physical, structural, or economic needs. Community support and networking\u2014Suppor ts every other service delivered by the CCP. CCP staff participate in, but do not initiate or lead, community support activities (e.g., being present at remembrance events). Crisis counselors can provide a \"compassionate presence\" and be available to provide crisis counseling services, should the need arise. CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 16 Needs Assessment Worksheet Identify the geographic areas affected in the disaster. Who ar e the special population groups? What ar e the priority needs in the affected communities (e.g., rebuilding/repairing homes, employment, treatment)? CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 17 Resource Identification Worksheet For several of the priority needs selected, identify the community resources that would be needed to meet those needs (e.g., community organizations such as faith-based organizations, disaster assistance organizations, schools). CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 18 Outreach Strategy Worksheet What are the key actions this program should take to conduct successful outreach to survivors? What k ey actions can you take to conduct outreach to organizations that have resources available for survivors? CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 19 Individual/ Family Crisis Counseling Encounter Characteristics Thi s service c onsist s of encounters or visits with adults and children. It can last 15 minutes or longer. It ty pically ranges from one to five visits . The num ber of visits provided should be determined through discussions wi th s upervisors and teams. M ultiple visits may indicate a need for referral to longer -term services an d s hould be discussed with supervisors. E ach visit should stand alone. Crisis counselors should reinforce prior successful coping skills in addition to helping survivors develop new ones . G oals and Objectives E ngage\u2014Through outreach, make contact with affected individuals to pr ovide crisis counseling services . Ident ify immediate needs\u2014Assist survivors in assessing their curr ent needs . Gat her information\u2014U se reframing, reflecting, paraphrasing, and openi ng s kills to gather information to assess the survivor's needs. P rioritize needs\u2014Disaster survivors often have safety and physical needs that need to be met firs t. P rovide practical assistance\u2014Provide referrals and linkage to additional services including disaster assistance, clothing, food, and shelter. P rovide education\u2014Teach survivors about common reactions, stress management techniques, and coping skills. P rovide emotional support\u2014Normalize the survivor's reactions , and pr ovide reassurance. D etermine next steps and follow up\u2014Assist the survivor in developing a pl an and creating action steps. Brief Educational or Supportive Contact Thi s service is less than 15 minutes long. It p rovides reassurance, other support, and information. A ctivities, such as brief interactions, telephone calls, and handi ng out br ochures, are examples of brief educational or supportive contact.CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 20 Group Crisis Counseling Encounter Characteristics G roup crisis counseling refers to services that help group members understand their current situations and reactions to the disaster, help them review or discuss their options, provide emotional support or referral services , and pr ovide skills to cope with their current situations and reactions. In group c ounseling, participants do most of the talking. G roup counseling encounters last 15 minutes or longer. The C CP focuses on two types of groups: support and education groups , and s elf-help groups . G roup counseling may vary from less structured, purely educational groups to m ore structured support groups. All groups are likely to share some el ements of support and education. G roups can be led by a licensed mental health professional, co-facilitate d w ith a mental health professional and a paraprofessional, or led by survivors themselves. When m embers of social support networks are struggling with the disaster's aftermath, counseling groups may augment overloaded support systems . It i s important to ensure that group members have had similar levels of ex posure to the disaster event. People with low exposure shoul d not be ex posed to the stories of those whose exposure was significantly higher. Support and Educational Groups Inc rease the social support network. Fac ilitate exchange of information on life situations. H elp develop new ways of adapting and coping. P rovide tools to obtain and process new information. P rovide practical and concrete assistance. U se handouts and factual information relevant to the group's discussion. U se speakers relevant to content area and group members' needs. Tips for Starting and Facilitating Support and Educational Groups In a s upport group, it is acceptable to allow members to begin the dialogue. Keep track of time, and facilitate discussion. It m ay be helpful to have homogeneous membership (e.g., bereaved parents , nei ghbors, occupational groups, women, children). The for mat and content of the group and educational materials presented should be tailored to meet the developmental and cultural needs of group members. Consider accessing written resources in various languages a ndCCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 21 materials geared toward people with disabilities and targeted toward children's developmental stages. S peakers may include mental health and substance abuse professionals , publ ic health workers, faith-based leaders, community leaders, and disaster survivors . P eople need to be emotionally ready to participate in group crisis counseling. Bringing people together too early can be detrimental. Use caution in deciding when to begin group crisis counseling. Self -Help Groups A re initially facilitated by a crisis counselor. C an be co-facilitated by a group member to encourage transiti on to a m ember -facilitated process. A re no longer a CCP service once the group has transitioned to a member - facilitated process . Practical Concerns in Group Crisis Counseling C ounselors should assess their own skills and knowledge about the group's content to set clear boundaries on how to approach the group process . G roup members may inquire about symptoms on which counselors are not author ized to give advice. Counselors can, however, provide concr ete i nformation and make appropriate referrals to mental health professionals . B e aware of personal biases related to religion, spirituality, culture, ethnicity , and gender . It is common and healthy to recognize these qualities fo r per sonal reflection, but it is detrimental if these qualities disrupt the group process. R espect and maintain confidentiality. A group should be in a safe place i n w hich people, families, and communities can freely share their feelings without worrying about other people knowing their personal business. Fac ilitate the group by making sure that each member has a chance to talk and that no one person is dominating the conversation. Ask a member w ho has not spoken if he or she would like to talk; however, respect his or her right to just sit back and lis ten. A sk for feedback. Some groups may warrant more structure than others will ; how ever, it can be empowering for group members to become actively engaged in the process of deciding what they would like to achieve in gr oup se ssions. Public Education Inc ludes distribution of information and education al materials Is likely to increase during the course of the CCP Is designed to do the following:CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 22 -B uild resilience -P romote constructive coping skills -E ducate about disaster reactions -H elp people access support and services -Leav e a legacy of knowledge, skills, and community resources Distribution of educational materials: Thi s includes flyers, brochures, tip sheets, guidance, and w ebsite content. It c overs the following topics: -B asic disaster information -K ey of -D isaster reactions -C oping skills -Indi vidual and community resilience Contac t SAMHSA DTAC for help in accessing educational materials. C ulturally appropriate materials address special populations , are available in multiple languages, and consider varying educational levels of survivors. D istribution of educational materials is captured on the Weekly Tally Sheet.CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 23 Assessment and Referral A ssessment is the process of reviewing, identifying, and evaluating survivors' needs. The C CP screens for the following : -P ractical or tangible needs of survivors -S ubstance abuse and mental health needs C risis counselors also identify resources in the community that matc h the needs of survivors. The C CP Adult Assessment and Referral Tool may be used to assist crisis counselors in making decisions regarding the need for referral . C risis counselors provide information on available resources to meet tangibl e needs . -C risis counselors help survivors meet unmet needs through resourc e l inkage. -S ervices are provided regardless of level of functioning. -R esource linkage empowers survivors to advocate for themselves. -C risis counselors assist survivor s in prioritizing and accessing services. -R elationships with survivors are short term. Assessment and Referral Considerations A mount of time since the event\u2014Some reactions are very common i n the fi rst few weeks and, by themselves, do not necessitate referral. Poo r func tioning, avoidance of situations, and sleeping problems are common at fi rst. D egree to which the symptoms are interfering with daily lif e f unctioning\u2014This includes how well the individual is managing his or her symptoms, and how strong his or her support systems are. Emergency Treatment Referral A lert the team leader if you notice any of the following: -Ther e is intent or means to harm self or others. -A per son exhibits severe paranoia, delusions, or hallucinations. -Func tioning is so poor that a person's (or dependent's) safety is i n danger . -E xcessive substance use is placing a person or others at risk. -A child's safety or health is at risk. When i n doubt, call 911, or refer for immediate psychiatric or medical intervention.CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 24 Nonemergency Treatment Referral R educe perceived stigma: -D emystify mental health or substance abuse treatment by letting peopl e k now that counseling and treatment are methods of suppor t, i nformation, education, problem solving, and coping. -E xplore referral options, and give choices. Inc rease compliance: -E xplore obstacles to accepting services. -E ncourage the person to call for the appointment while the counselor is there. -A ccompany the person to the first appointment, if necessary and appr opriate. S ometimes it is acceptable to guide survivors through the referral process. Some strategies include the following: -P rovide referral options. -A ssist them in making appointments. -R emind them to attend appointments. -Fol low up to see if they attended. Fac ilitating the survivor's connection with the external provider can increas e futur e follow -through with treatment.CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 25 Community Support and Networking Through community support and networking, the CCP engages in the following activities : P artners with community support systems P articipates in community gatherings and rituals R eaches out to community groups and leaders M aintains a compassionate presence B olsters, but does not replace, systems in place The CCP has the following goals for its community support and n etworking work : Fos ter community resilience through improved connectivity . P romote familiarity with disaster relief resources. C reate a seamless system for referral. C reate opportunities for shared resources and training. M ake referrals to organizations and agencies, and do not limit referrals to thos e for mental health and substance abuse treatment. Referrals c an be m ade for other disaster relief services as well. S hare training resources, as appropriate, with other disaster reli ef or ganizations. Us e networking to help identify needs , referral sources, and sources of in- kind donations. Community support and networking activities are captured on the Weekly Tally Sheet. CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 26 Typical Community Partners O ther potential partners: E mergency management Law enforcement S ubstance abuse prevention community O ffice for Victims of Crime C ommunity -based cultural organizations A merican Indian and Alaska Native tribal community leaders R efugee organizations S uicide prevention organizations M ental health and substance abuse consumer groups CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 27 Media Messaging and Risk Communication M edia messaging and risk communication are important parts of a c omprehensive disaster behavioral health plan and any CCP. An effectiv e pl an for engaging the media will get the word out about CCP resources a nd the m essage of resilience. The C CP reaches large numbers of disaster survivors through medi a c ampaigns. M edia messaging accomplishes the following : -Inc reases education and awareness for survivors -P romotes a shared understanding of the CCP message -D elivers a clear message regarding the CCP -P romotes the services of the CCP, such as the helpline, ongoing crisis counseling, and referral -S hares information on common reactions and important talking points The S AMHSA publication Communicating in a Crisis: Risk Communicati on G uidelines for Public O fficials is a good resource for planning communicati on and deal ing with the media. It is available online at https://store.samhsa.gov/product/communicating-crisis -risk-communication- guidelines -public -officials/pep19-01- 01-005 . Developing a CCP media plan helps to do the following things : Identi fy spokespeople with expertise in the field of disaster behavioral heal th and ex perience in dealing with the media. D evelop simple talking points that reflect the goals and services of the CCP. D evelop a press kit with information on the CCP and its services. There are several important points to consider when developing talking points: The C CP emphasizes resilience and hope. H elp is available through a variety of services provided by the CCP. The C CP provides education on common reactions and teaches effectiv e c oping skills. C ultural diversity is respected in providing assistance. P eople often find stories of people like them interesting and compelling. If appr opriate, and while maintaining confidentiality, highlight stories of peopl e w ho have been helped by the CCP. SECTION 3: Survivor Reactions Key Concepts E veryone who experiences a disaster is affected by it in some way.CCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 28 Highest Risk Lower Risk People pull together during and after a disaster. Stress and grief are common reactions to uncommon situations. People's natural resilience will support individual and collective recovery. Vulnerability Factors Poverty Race Age Ethnicity Unemployment Gender Risk Factors Model The risk factors model helps identify potential populations who are most at risk for adverse reactions and potentially in need of crisis counseling services. A.Injured survivors, bereaved family members B.Survivors with high exposure to disaster trauma, or evacuated from disaster zones C.Bereaved extended family and friends, first responders D.People who lost homes, jobs, and possessions; people withpreexisting trauma and dysfunction; special groups; other disaster responders E.Affected people from the larger communityCCP Participant Workbook: Virtual Core Content Training 29 Survivor Reactions Worksheet For the type of reaction assigned to your group, discuss the following: What specific reactions have you seen in this category\u2014either in response to this disaster, or in previous experiences? What di fferences in reactions have you seen \u2014or could you imagine \u2014across age groups?

Training manual for mental health and human service workers in major disasters (DHHS Publication 90-538). Washington, DC: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Center for Mental Health Services. CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 32 Pre-Disaster Phase D isasters with no warning can cause feelings of vulnerability and lack of security ; fear s of the future and of unpredicted tragedies; a sense of loss of control; and the sense of being unable to protect one self and one's family. D isasters with warning can cause guilt or self-blame for failure to heed warnings. Impact Phase R eactions can range from shock to overt panic. Ini tial confusion and disbelief are followed by focus on self-preservation and family protection. S low, low -threat disasters and rapid, dangerous disasters have differ ent ps ychological effects. G reat destruction and loss lead to great psychosocial effects. Fam ily separation during impact causes considerable anxiety. Heroic Phase M any exhibit adrenaline- induced rescue behavior and have high activity with low productivity. R isk assessment may be impaired. Ther e is a sense of altruism. E vacuation and relocation have psychological significance\u2014 effect of physical hazards and repercussions of family separation. Honeymoon Phase D isaster assistance is readily available. C ommunity bonding occurs. O ptimism exists that everything quickly will return to normal. C CP staff can establish program identity, gain entr\u00e9e to affected people, and buil d r elationships with stakeholders. Disillusionment Phase S tress and fatigue take a toll . O ptimism turns into discouragement. Ther e may be an increased need for substance abuse services. The l arger community returns to business as usual. The C CP may have an increased demand for services, as individuals an d c ommunities become ready to accept support. R eality of losses sets in. D iminishing assistance leads to feelings of abandonment. Reconstruction Phase Indi viduals and communities begin to assume responsibility for rebuilding their lives. P eople begin to adjust to new circumstances. Ther e is recognition of growth and opportunity. The r econstruction process may continue for years . P eople adjust to a new \"normal,\" while continuing to grieve losses.CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 33 Resilience Worksheet H ow do you define resilience? What hel ps foster the resilience of individuals? What hel ps foster the resilience of communities? What fac tors decrease resilience? CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 34 SECTION 4 : Special Populations Special Populations Worksheet Which populations are most affected by this disaster? H ow well served are they? H ow have the services they rely on been affected? P rioritize the populations according to how much they have been affected . CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 35 Children and Youth For children and youth, their age and development determine their capacity to understand what is occurring around them and to regulate their emotional reactions. Children are considered at risk for psychological problems following a disaster for a number of reasons: Les s developed cognitive skills may limit the ways children understand and process events. Li mited experience coping with adversity may result in a lack of coping skills for managing stress. Li mited verbal skills may impede the processing of events and expressions of r eactions . D ependence on adults for resources and psychological support may result in limi ted i ndependence and self-reliance. M ost importantly, children's development is at risk if they are unable to proceed wit h the nor mal activities and developmental tasks of childhood. Risk Factors Ri sk factors for children and youth include these: -S eparation from family -E vacuation and relocation -Los s of a family member or a close friend -H igh levels of parental distress -Fam ily members at risk (such as first responders) C hildren's reactions depend on how much destruction they have experienced. The death of fam ily or close friends is most traumatic for children; followed by loss of hom e, school, or pets ; and extensive damage to the community. R eactions also are influenced by the destruction children experience sec ondhand thr ough television and other media. The s trongest predictor of children's distress is parental distress. The c aregiver is the role model for children, in terms of disaster reactions, copi ng, and r ecovery. Fam ily support and stability are positively correlated with children's well -being. P reexisting adjustment or learning difficulties may be exacerbated. M ost children will recover without professional intervention. Most simply need time to experience their world as a secure place again and their parents as nurturi ng c aregivers who are again in charge. E ach element of a child's world\u2014family, school, friends, pets, and social clubs \u2014are i mportant in the recovery process.CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 36 C hildren are more vulnerable to difficulty when they have experienced other li fe s tressors in the past year (e.g., divorce, moving, death of a loved one). C hildren who have secure relationships with nurturing caregivers are the mos t r esilient in reconciling the disruption and recovering from traumatic events. S tability and security of home life affect how a child reacts to trauma. Special Considerations P arents or caregivers often deny help for themselves but accept it for their children. P arents or caregivers often see disaster stress in their children before seeing it i n them selves. P arents or caregivers sometimes overlook the disaster stress in their children. P arents are sometimes unaware of how their own stress affects their children. It i s mandatory to involve parents and caregivers when working with children. C onsideration should be given to the needs of single parents or caregivers , es pecially single women. S ometimes the simple presence of a crisis counselor in discussion is eno ugh to fac ilitate communication within the family. O ften parents and caregivers will deny the need for disaster mental heal th i nformation for themselves but will gladly participate in programs or gatherings i n w hich this type of information is provided as support for their childr en. P arents and caregivers often will recognize stress reactions in their children befor e they recognize them in themselves. The crisis counselor helps all members of the fam ily unit by sensitizing parents to the signs of stress in their children a nd s uggesting strategies for helping their children. The c aregiver is the child's role model, in terms of disaster reactions, copi ng, and r ecovery. S ingle parents or caregivers may be under added stress and may need specializ ed r eferral. How Adults Can Support Children M odel calm behaviors\u2014Be a role model. Children will take cues of how to handl e s ituations from their parents. Modeling calm behaviors will be important duri ng c haotic times. M aintain routines\u2014Even in the midst of chaos and change, children feel safer and m ore secure with structure and routine (e.g., mealtimes, bedtime). E ngage in fun activities\u2014Should be age appropriate. This can include colori ng, boar d games, and other family activities.CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 37 Lim it media exposure\u2014It is important for parents to protect their children from overexposure to sights and images of the event, including those in newspapers , on the Inter net, or on television. R epeat instructions often\u2014Be patient. Children may need added reminders or extra help with chores or homework once school is in session, as they may be mor e di stracted. P rovide support at bedtime\u2014Children may become anxious when they separ ate fr om their parents, particularly at bedtime. T ry to spend more time with the chil d at bedti me with activities such as reading a book. It is okay to make temporary arrangements for young children to sleep in bed with their parents, with t he under standing that they will go back to normal sleeping arrangements at a set futur e date. Notes: CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 38 Older Adults Risk Factors Physical limitations\u2014In older adults these limitations include sensory deficits, limited mobility, decreased cognitive ability, or chronic illness. Older adults' experience of the disaster is often influenced by their physical needs. Previous losses\u2014Recent losses and cumulative unresolved trauma leave older adults at risk for difficulty in coping with disaster aftermath. However, successful coping in the past may create a reservoir of skills that increase resilience and the ability to adapt to disaster aftermath. Relocation trauma\u2014Rel ocation from nursing homes and other residential facilities can cause distress and disorientation. Sudden evacuations sometimes precipitate a decline in health and functioning. Dependence on medications\u2014A disaster may cause interruption of prescribed medi cations that are difficult to replace quickly after the effects of the disaster. Improper use of multiple medications (both prescribed and over -the-counter medications ) can pose a risk for abuse or severe side effects. Disaster -related health risks\u2014Older adults are at risk for hyperthermia or hypothermia in disasters in which heating or air conditioning is interrupted. Lack of social supports\u2014Many may not have family or close friends. People with Prior Trauma History Prior trauma history includes physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, as well as combat veteran status or survival from prior disasters. In some cases, individuals may have flashbacks or other dissociative experiences. Disaster events may trigger preexisting posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) or place individuals with prior trauma at increased risk for developing PTSD. However, people with prior trauma history often have more resilience, experience, skills, and knowledge about how to cope with trauma. They can help others by sharing their coping skills and techniques. Risk Factors Feelings of increased vulnerability and decreased trust Increased likelihood of experiencing a trauma similar to the original one Increased risk for developing PTSD Increased risk of clinical depression or anxi ety CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 39 People with Serious Mental Illnesses The needs of most survivors with serious mental illnesses will be the same as the needs of the larger community \u2014physical, cognitive, behavioral, and emotional. Some may rise to the occasion in the immediate aftermath of disaster and function at a higher level than they usually do. For others, disaster stress can disrupt their tenuous balance and worsen their condition. The mere presence of serious mental illnesses does not necessarily indicate higher risk for disaster -related severe reactions. The type of mental illness, trauma history, and the level of stability before the disaster must be taken into consideration. When people with serious mental illnesses are able to maintain their regular mental health services or medications, many can cope with the additional stress presented by the disaster. If not stable prior to the disaster, they may require additional support, medication adjustment, or brief hospitalization. For those who had previously been diagnosed with PTSD, the disaster stimuli can trigger memories, can cause them to re-experienc e the trauma, or can worsen their symptoms. People with serious mental illnesses may have used social support systems in the past and, therefore, may be more open to receiving services. Risk Factors Inability to m aintain medication regimens and other essential services Tenuous stability prior to disaster Vulnerability to sudden changes in environment and routines Trauma or other symptoms that may be triggered or worsened by disaster stimuli CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 40 People with a History of Substance Abuse Substance use increases after a disaster due to new use, increased use, or relapse. Increased substance use may create additional demands on treatment systems. Risk factors for substance abuse: o Current users are at greatest risk for increased use and abuse. o Stress and PTSD are known risk factors for substance abuse. o Alcohol and drug users may experience an increase in use. Some may cross the line into addiction. o People with current addictions may worsen; those in recovery (even for a long time) may relapse. The CCP does not fund substance abuse treatment, but staff should be prepared within the program in the following ways to work with people with substance use and abuse issues: - Be trained to screen for substance abuse issues and make referrals - Be educated about the effect of substance abuse on individuals, families, and communities - Develop partnerships with treatment providers and the prevention community Substance abuse prevention strategies can play an important role in strengtheni ng individual and community resilience. Public education and outreach to people affected by a disaster can include general prevention information, in addition to links to emergency substance abuse services and resources. Such public education can begin immediately and continue well into the recovery process. Methadone patients\u2014I f a methadone clinic is closed due to a disaster, patients will need referr als to other methadone clinics for \"guest dosing.\" CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 41 People with Disabilities The disability community is not a homogeneous group. Therefore, people's risk factors vary. Partnerships with s tate and local disability organizations are essential in providing thoughtful and appropriate services for people with disabilities. The state emergency management agency ( SEMA ) often maintains a list of individuals with disabilities and their location s within the community. Risk Factors Evacuation can be more difficult. Service animals need to be considered. Shelters may not be wheelchair accessible. Access to medication or therapy may be disrupted. Educational materials may not be available in accessible formats. Low-Income Groups Stress that disaster risks are not limited to people in lower socioeconomic groups. Low-income groups often lack material support from family and friends and have no insurance or savings. This makes recovery longer, harder, and sometimes impossible. They lose a larger part of their material assets and suffer more lasting negative effects. Low-income housing often is more vulnerable to damage. There often are negative perceptions from experiences that occurred prior to the disaster, a lack of familiarity with sources of community support, a lack of transportation to obtain services, and an unwillingness to disclose immigration status. Many must relocate due to unaffordable rent increases after repairs, often moving several times to undesirable housing in locations far from social support and jobs. These people usually stay in mass -care shelters the longest. Risk Factors Have fewer resour ces Have greater preexisting vulnerability May have weaker support systems May be unable to relocate May have to spend more time in shelters CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 42 Public Safety Workers (PSWs) The CCP needs to understand the distinction between traditional PSWs (e.g., police, firefighters, emergency medical technicians) and nontraditional PSWs (e.g., construction staff, electricians, sewer or gas workers). The term \"first responder\" may carry emotional weight (e.g., people may disagree about who \"deserves\" the title). The CCP attempts to avoid this issue by taking a very broad definition of a PSW. Many traditional first responder organizations have excellent support systems already in place. Assess needs so that the CCP does not duplicate services. Risk factors include these: - Exposure to the disaster event - Threat of injury or harm - Separation from family - View of oneself as a helper, not as a person who needs help - Demanding work schedule CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 43 Additional Special Populations Recent immigrants Refugees Undocumented workers Non-English s peakers People with preexisting medical conditions Notes: CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 44 Intervention Strategies for Special Adults Be aware of unique needs. Canvass communities to locate isolated survivors. Educate community providers who work with special populations on disaster reactions. Collaborate with community leaders and cultural brokers. Partner with organizations that serve special populations. Consider cultural factors. Reconnect individuals to prior treatment services (i.e., substance abuse, mental health, medical). Ensure that services and materials are appropriate and accessible. Notes: CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 45 SECTION 5 : Interventions and Skills Engagement Engagement is a means of reaching affected individuals to provide crisis counseling services . It is also a method of creating a safe and comfortable environment. Engagement is done in partnership with other organizations to plan and execute events . Examples of engagement strategies include these: - Creative arts - Social networking opportunities - Community information fairs - Anniversary events When developing engagement approaches, the primary focus always should be on crisis counseling services. Teenagers are especially vulnerable. Using writing projects, such as journal writing, can be a helpful way to engage this population and identify their needs and coping skills. Crisis Counseling Skills Establishing rapport Calming Screening/a ssessment Empathy Reflecting feelings Validating feelings Paraphrasing Normalizing Active listening (nonverbal attending) Closing CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 46 Establishing Rapport Introduce yourself \u2014Identify who you are; give your name and the name of the CCP. Use door openers\u2014A door opener is generally a positive, nonjudgmental response made during the initial phase of contact. Examples include \"You seem sad; do you want to talk about it?\" \"What's on your mind?\" \"Can you say more about that?\" \"What would you like to talk about today?\" Use minimal encouragers \u2014These interactions are brief, supportive statements that convey attention and understanding. Such phrases reinforce talking on the part of the person and are often accompanied by an approving nod of the head. Examples include \"I see,\" \"Yes,\" \"Right,\" \"Okay,\" \"I hear you.\" Listen\u2014Pay close attention to what the survivor is saying. Listen with understanding and empathy. Do not interrupt or talk over the person. Notes: CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 47 Calming Skills These are m easures that may be taken if the individual is too upset, agitated, or disoriented to talk, or is showing extreme fear or panic . Address the primary concern\u2014R ather than encouraging the person to calm down or feel safe, attempt to help the person focus. Provide a supportive presence\u2014R emain nearby, showing that you are available, if needed. Offer something tangible such as a blanket or drink. Enlist support \u2014If family or friends are nearby, engage their help in providing emotional support. If a child or adolescent is with parents, see how the adults are coping, and work to empower the adults rather than undermine their role. Help provide focus\u2014O ffer support that helps the person focus on specific manageable feelings, thoughts, or goals. Notes: CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 48 Active Listening (Nonverbal Attending Skills) Crisis counselors use specific nonverbal behaviors to communicate listening, attention, openness, and safety: Eye contact\u2014Use a moderate amount of eye contact to communicate attention. A fixed stare can be disconcerting and should be broken intermittently if the person becomes uncomfortable. It may be best to try to mirror the survivor 's use of eye contact. Body position\u2014A relaxed yet attentive posture puts a person at ease. Attentive silence\u2014Brief periods of silence give the survivor moments for reflection and may prompt the survivor to open up more and fill the gap in the conversation. Facial expressions and gestures\u2014Try to be moderately reactive to the person's words and feelings with your gestures. Occasional head nodding for encouragement, a facial expression that indicates concern and interest, and encouraging movements of the hands that are not distracting can be helpful. Physical distance\u2014Personal space varies from culture to culture and from person to person. For most Americans, about 3 feet is a comfortable distance for personal interaction. Avoid physical barriers, such as desks, because they increase distance and add a feeling of formality. Note : Nonverbal cues will vary depending on cultural expectations and situational factors. Normalizing Educate the survivor about disaster reactions . Reassure the survivor that his or her reactions are common. Notes: CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 49 Empathy Is an awareness of and sensitiv ity to the survivor's experience Demonstrates that you are trying to understand how the survivor is experiencing the disaster Reflecting Feelings Lets the survivor know you are aware of how he or she is feeling Can encourage emotional expression Should include only what you hear clearly stated Does not include probing , interpreting , or speculat ing Paraphrasing Involves re phrasing or rewording what the survivor say s Does not change, modify, or add to the message Demonstrates that you have accurately heard what has been said Allows the survivor to either confirm that you are correct or provide additional clarification Validating Feelings Reassures survivors that their reactions are typical Lets survivors know that others have felt the way they feel Notes: CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 50 Some Do 's and Don'ts for Empathy and Paraphrasing: Do: Find an uninterrupted time and place to talk . Show interest, attention, and care. Show respect for individuals ' reactions and ways of coping. Talk about reactions to disasters that are to be expected and about healthy coping. Be free of expectations or judgments . Acknowledge that this type of stress can take time to resolve. Help brainstorm positive ways to deal with their reactions . Believe that they are capable of recovery. Offer to talk or spend time together as many times as is needed. Don't: Rush to tell them they will be okay or they should just \"get over it.\" Daydream about or discuss your own personal experiences instead of listening to them . Avoid talking about what is bothering them because you don't know how to handle it. Judge them to be weak or exaggerating because they aren't coping as well as you or others are. Give advice instead of asking them what works for them . Refrain from asking for help from a professional if you feel you can't help them enough. Probe for details or insist that others must talk .

Psychological First Aid: Field operations guide, second edition. Retrieved from http://www.nctsn.org CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 51 Screening Listen and observe for cues of functioning. Recognize when to consult a supervisor. Identify and prioritize issues with the survivor. Check in with the survivor to clarify what you're hearing and observing. Use the assessment and referral tools. Ask questions : o Closed questions\u2014These questions ask for specific information and usually require a short, factual response. Closed questions are necessary when it is important to get the facts straight or to clear up confusion in your understanding of the story. o Open questions \u2014These questions allow for more freedom of expression. They open general topics, rather than requesting specific information. Examples include \"Can you tell me what's been happening at school?\" and \"You say you're experiencing [x]; what do you mean by that?\" Notes: CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 52 Psychological First Aid What Is Psychological First Aid (PFA)? PFA is an approach to help survivors in the immediate aftermath of disaster and terrorism. It is designed to reduce the distress caused by traumatic events and to foster coping. It is consistent with the CCP m odel. It is an evidence-informed approach. Where D oes PFA Fit? After a disaster occurs, PFA fits into several parts of the response: Immediate aftermath\u2014 State- or p rovider-trained staff respond to evacuation sites or shelters and provide PFA. If no Presidential disaster declaration\u2014State or p rovider staff continue to provide PFA. If there is a Presidential disaster declaration\u2014The state applies for and delivers CCP services, which include PFA core actions. PFA Core Actions Contact and engagement \u2014To respond to contacts initiated by survivors, or to initiate contacts in a non-intrusive, compassionate, and helpful manner Safety and comfort\u2014T o enhance immediate and ongoing safety, and provide physical and emotional comfort Stabilization\u2014T o calm and orient emotionally overwhelmed or disoriented survivors Information gathering (current needs and concerns )\u2014To identify immediate needs and concerns, gather additional information, and tailor PFA interventions Practical assistance \u2014To offer practical help to survivors in addressing immediate needs and concerns Connection with social supports\u2014T o help establish brief or ongoing contacts with primary support persons and other sources of support, including family members, friends , and community helping resources Information on c oping\u2014T o provide information about stress reactions and coping to reduce distress and promote adaptive functioning Linkage with collaborative services\u2014T o link survivors with available services needed at the time or in the future CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 53 Simulation Exercise Case 1\u2014Craig You are meeting with Craig, one of the evacuees who suffered significant damage to his house and minimal damage to the convenience store he owns. During your meeting, Craig conveys sadness about the loss of his property, as well as anxiety about when he will be able to return home, but he expresses relief that neither he nor his family members were hurt. He tells you that he's not sure how to access financial help and requests your assistance in linking him to the appropriate resources. Preparation Worksheet As you prepare for your encounter with Craig, answer the following questions: How will you start the conversation with Craig? What are some specific questions you want to ask him? What skills do you want to be sure to use during the encounter? How will you use them? How will you provide information, education, and reassurance during the encounter? CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 54 Simulation Exercise Case 2\u2014James James, a 43-year -old man in recovery for 10 years from cocaine addiction, suffered injuries as he and his family took shelter from the disaster that devastated their home and community. Three months later, he is unemployed and stressed, but still a proud man as he tries to care for his family. You and your teammate have visited with James at his home once before.. He tells you he is proud of his time in recovery, yet jokes that he's not doing too badly because of the \"pain pills\" a doctor prescribed him for his injuries. You notice that he is more withdrawn this visit, that during the last time you met with him. In your last meeting with him, he disclosed that he had a few drinks, but that it is not a big deal because he has \"never had a problem with alcohol before.\" Preparation Worksheet As you prepare for your encounter with James , answer the following questions: How will you start the conversation with James? What are some specific questions you want to ask him? What skills do you want to be sure to use during the encounter? How will you use them?

Her mother, who lived with her, died in the disaster. Your first encounter with Rachel is to discuss arrangements for shelter and financial assistance; however, during your conversation, Rachel begins to cry and confides that she has not been sleeping or eating much, and she can't stop thinking about her mother dying. She does not feel that she will ever be able to move on. Preparation Worksheet As you prepare for your encounter with Rachel , answer the following questions: How will you start the conversation with Rachel?

Psychological First Aid: F ield operations guide, second edition. Retrieved from http://www.nctsn.org Goal -Setting Tools Crisis counselors assist individuals in doing the following to set goals : Identifying their needs Prioritiz ing their needs and identify ing the most pressing ones Developing a plan of action to address the needs Following through with the plan Remaining solution focused Social Support Tools Crisis counselors assist individuals in doing the following to access social support: Identifying primary or familial supports Identifying which of these supports is /are readily available Reaching out to use immediately available supports Identifying options to use when support is not working Supports vary by the individual and might include family, friends, significant others, religious groups , support groups, or mental health or substance abuse services providers. In addition to identifying supports, discussing support-seeking and giving strategies also may prove helpful. Coping Tools To teach better coping, crisis counselors assist individuals in doing the following: Identifying and address ing their primary concerns Seeing the crisis counselor as a supportive presence Allow ing family or friends to provide support Focusing on manageable feelings, thoughts, or goals Exploring the options for spiritual support Practic ing grounding exercises such as deep breathing Understanding common stress reactions Suggested coping actions : Talking to another person for support Getting needed information Getting adequate rest, nutrition, exercise Engaging in positive distracting activities (sports, hobbies, reading) Trying to maintain a normal schedule to the extent possible Telling yourself that it is natural to be upset for some period of ti me Scheduling pleasant activities Eating healthful meals CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 58 Taking breaks Spending time with others Participating in a support group Using relaxation methods Using calming self-talk Exercising in moderation Seeking counseling Keeping a journal Focusing on something practical you can do right now to manage the situation better Using coping methods that have been successful for you in the past Other coping tools: Positive activity scheduling\u2014One explanation for feeling sad or being withdrawn is that it results from, and is maintained by, having more negative experiences than positive ones. In order to improve your mood, you need to increase positive experiences and decrease negative ones. One way of achieving this is for the survivor to identify some enjoyable or pleasurable activities he or she could do in the following week. Relaxation techniques and self -calming\u2014People who have been exposed to extreme stress and fear as a result of disaster have bodies that are often on alert, ready for danger. In the absence of real danger, this anxiety is unnecessary and may have bad effects on one's health. Relaxation and self- calming can include breathing and muscle relaxation techniques. Stress management \u2014For more information on stress management, refer to Section 8 of Core Content Training. Helping survivors improve or learn coping skills is a way of fostering resilience. Notes: CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 59 Typical V isits or Encounters Phase of Visit Intervention/Skills Tools for Survivors Opening Establishing rapport Calming Screening/a ssessment Information gathering Self-calming Middle Information and education Active listening Normalizing reactions Empathy Reflecting feelings Paraphrasing Screening/a ssessment Practical assistance Linking to resources Validating feelings Prioritizing needs Goal setting Social support Coping skills Relaxation techniques Stress management Positive activity scheduling Problem solving Closing Screening/ assessment Referral, if needed Followup, if needed Next steps Each visit should be a standalone encounter in the event that the person is unavailable or not interested in additional encounters. Crisis counselors should remain solution focused, provide reassurance, and instill hope. Opening Opening skills - Ask about disaster damage\u2014\"Can you tell me what happened?\" \"Did your home sustain any damage?\" \"Did you have to evacuate?\" \"Did you have any warning?\" \"When did you return home?\" - Ask about the person\u2014\"What was it like for you?\" \"Where were you?\" \"How did you react?\" \"How are you doing now?\" Calming (if needed) - \"We notice you are very upset, having to catch your breath, having trouble sitting still, etc.; I can do a quick and easy exercise with you to help you feel calmer. You can even use this technique on your own.\" - Teach calming techniques. CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 60 Screening\u2014 - Observe behavior, emotional state, ability to think clearly; ask questions about daily functioning, maintenance of daily routines, eating, sleeping, working, caring for children, household activities, etc. Gathering information\u2014 - Ask survivor s to tell you about their most pressing concerns; safety issues; access to food, clothing, water; issues surrounding children and substance use or abuse. Middle Prioritizing needs \u2014Ask survivor s to tell you what they need right now . Goal setting \u2014Assist the survivor in setting attainable goals; use the intervention skills to teach the survivors the tools they need to promote their own recovery . Closing Encourage the survivor to use the tools he or she learned during the encounter. This ensures that the s urvivor leaves the encounter with a set of next steps he or she can carry out to achieve the goals identified in the middle of the encounter. Notes: CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 61 Survivor Tools Practice Scenario Paula is a retired 64-year -old African -American woman who was born and raised in a place where she continued to live until it was affected by a disaster . She lived alone in the house where she grew up until she was forced to evacuate during the disaster. Paula's house sustained extensive damage, and she has decided to sell the house rather than repair it. You first met Paula just after the disaster. She told you how upsetting it was to leave her childhood home and how she can't understand why God would put her through this trial. On her second visit to the crisis center, Paula talked about how lonely she feels now that she lives in a neighboring town, and she said that the people in her apartment building are not friendly. On her third visit to the center, she continued to talk about her loneliness but commented that she thinks the disaster may have been God's way of telling her she is getting too old to handle the upkeep of a house alone. She also admitted that she is beginning to like her apartment. How will you apply your assigned tool during your next encounter with Paula? CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 62 Description of Ethical Considerations Maintain Confidentiality Crisis counseling services provided through the CCP are anonymous and confidential. Crisis counselors should not share individual or group encounter experiences with anyone outside of the contact or group, with the exception of the following people: Their supervisor, for supervision purposes Other crisis counselors with a legitimate need to know the information to provide services Public safety personnel, if the individual or another human being is in imminent risk or danger Crisis counselors should not keep formal records ; there is not clinical charting in the CCP. However, it is appropriate to maintain basic contact information for the purpose of following up with individuals. Be sure to get permission for release of information from individuals before sharing any personal information for referrals or any other reason. Follow the state and local regulations on mandatory reporting for child or elder abuse and neglect. Immediately discuss any allegations or cases of suspected child abuse with your supervisor . Follow state and local reporting regulations in cases of suicidal or homicidal intent. Safeguard the interests and rights of individuals who lack decision making abilities \u2014e.g., children, people with developmental disabilities, people with severe mental illness, or people with cognitive impairments. Additional Ethical Guidelines Do no harm. Participation is voluntary. Consider reactions in relation to the disaster phase and context. Individual coping styles should be respected. Immediate interventions are supportive. Talking with a person in crisis does not always mean talking about the crisis. Be aware of the situational and cultural contexts of the survivor and the intervention itself. CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 63 Journal Reflection \u2014Sections 3 through 5 What were your key lessons learned from the practice sessions on using crisis counseling skills and survivor tools effectively? What did you learn today about the range of individual and collective reactions to disaster that will be helpful to you as a crisis counselor? What do you want to remember about the unique needs of and intervention strategies for special populations? How well are your training needs and expectations being met so far in this course? What suggestions do you have of topics or issues to focus on during tomorrow's sessions? CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 64 SECTION 6: Data Collection and Program Evaluation Data collection is a process of tracking the services provided, including these details of the services: o How many o What kind o To whom o Where provided Program evaluation is a systematic effort to collect, analyze, and interpret data/information. We collect data and evaluate programs to understand and improve services based on observable and verifiable data. CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 65 In most cases, a separate training session will be offered to learn details of CCP data collection : How the information is gathered How the encounter and contact s should be document ed How the data are entered (for data entry staff) How the data are analyzed (for program staff) Brief Overview of the Data Collection Forms The CCP data collection forms are cleared by the f ederal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have an official OMB number. They may not be altered. Included with each form is a page of detailed instructions for your reference. Every CCP is required to utilize and complete the following forms, as appropriate: o Individual/Family Crisis Counseling Services Encounter Log o Group Encounter Log o Weekly Tally Sheet o Adult Assessment and Referral Tool o Child/Youth Assessment and Referral Tool o Provider Feedback Forms and Participant Feedback Surveys are also required at 6 and 12 months after the disaster. Encounter Logs and Weekly Tally Sheets Are used to document all services delivered Ensure that services are counted in a standardized way in all areas Should always be completed by the crisis counselor in a timely manner, so that information is not lost. CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 66 Individual/Family Crisis Counseling Services Encounter Logs Document interactions of 15 minutes or longer with individuals or families Involve participant disclosure Capture information gathered by a team of crisis counselors on one form, rather than two separate forms - Parts of the form: First page c aptures visit type, demographic information, number of people in the encounter, and location of service. Second page (back of form) c aptures risk categories, event reactions, focus of encounter, materials , and referrals . o Event reactions \u2014Behavioral, emotional, physical, or cognitive reactions that are being experienced at the time of the service encounter o Focus of encounter \u2014Information, skills, coping tips, or support provided to the individual(s) participating in the encounter o Materials \u2014Printed educational materials made available and left with the survivor (s), so in most cases, this should be \"yes\" o Referrals \u2014List of names and contact information for commonly used resources and referrals provided when necessary A copy of this form can be found at https://www.samhsa.gov/dtac/ccp-toolkit/ccp-data -forms - trainings . CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 67 Group Encounter Logs Document group crisis counseling (in which participants do most of the talking) and public education (in which the counselor does most of the talking) Measure encounter characteristics, group identities, and focus Capture information gathered by a team of crisis counselors on one form, rather than two separate forms - Parts of the form: First page captures type of service, characteristics of encounter, and group identities . Second page (back of form) captures demographics, focus of group session, and materials provided. o Focus of encounter \u2014This includes the information, skills, coping tips, or support that is provided to the individual(s) participating in the encounter . o Materials \u2014Printed educational materials should be made available and l eft with the survivor(s), so in most cases, this should be \"yes .\" o Referrals \u2014List of names and contact information for commonly used resources and referrals should also be provided, when necessary. A copy of this form can be found at https://www.samhsa.gov/dtac/ccp-toolkit/ccp-data- forms -trainings . CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 68 Weekly Tally Sheets Document brief educational and supportive contacts (less than 15 minutes), telephone calls, e- mails, and material distribution Include information for 1 week (beginning Sunday) Tally services at the county level, using three- digit county codes Should be completed by crisis counselors for each county in which they work (one tally per crisis counselor for each c ounty ) May be partly completed ( the social networking and mass media sections) by administrative staff - Parts of the form : Captures number of contacts made through brief in-person contact s, telephone contacts by crisis counselors, hotline/helpline/lifeline contacts, e- mails, and community networking Captures materials distributed that are not otherwise captured on the Individual/Family Crisis Counseling Services Encounter Log or Group Encounter Log o When packets of materials are handed to people, mailed, or l eft at someone's house, the number of packets is counted (not individual pieces within the packet) . o When mass media messages and social networking announcements are posted, count the number of messages you post (not the number of viewers/listeners, and not the number that \"like ,\" \"re-tweet ,\" or share your message) . A copy of this form can be found at https://www.samhsa.gov/dtac/ccp-toolkit/ccp-data - forms -trainings . CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 69 Assessment and Referral Tools Your employer should have protocols or procedures in place for how to respond if serious reactions are indicated and should provide training on how to use th ese tools and when to make a referral for more intensive services. All of the following are true of t he Child/Youth Assessment and Referral Tool and the Adult Assessment and Referral Tool : They are used to facilitate referrals to more intensive behavioral health services. They can be used at any time if you suspect the individual may be experiencing serious reactions . They should always be used at the third individual/family crisis counseling encounter . They measure risk categories and event reactions using a structured interview approach. Assessment and referral tools are used in ISP and RSP, as needed. At the end of the form, you should review the responses that are indicated with a \"4\" or \"5 ,\" and be prepared to offer the respondent a referral for more intensive services. You should also have a plan in place (that adheres to your employer's protocol) for what to do if the individual says \"yes\" to the question \"Is there any possibility that you might hurt or kill yourself?\" Quality Assurance and Management Each form has a reviewer signature area at the bottom. A supervisor (team leader) in the field should approve and sign the form before sending it to data entry staff. Any recurring errors in completed forms should prompt followup training for crisis counselors. Data entry staff should review forms at the time of data entry. Data entered by one staff member should be checked by another to increase accuracy and minimize errors. CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 70 Data and evaluation staff should be providing regular reports of the data (at least every 2 weeks) and working with program staff to determine the impact of the analysis. CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 71 SECTION 7 : Stress Management Definition of Stress Stress is a response to a challenge or a threat. Stress is tension, strain, or pressure that requires people to use, adapt, or develop new coping skills. Stress can be positive or negative. Perception plays a key role in interpreting stressful situations. An optimum level can act as a motivational force. The Stress Cycle Notes: CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 72 Typical Stressors for Crisis Counselors At the core of a CCP are its staff\u2014the program's success is directly dependent on staff's ability to regulate their own stress. Particular care needs to be taken to address and process the effects this exposure can have on the crisis counselor. Individual supervision and process sessions following deployment shifts are two main venues for this type of support. My Top Three Stressors 1. 2. 3. CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 73 Warning Signs of Excessive Stress You cannot shake distressing images from your mind. Work consumes you at the expense of family and friends. You experience increased substance use or abuse. You are excessively irritable and impatient. You exhibit other serious or severe reactions. What To Do Disaster workers commonly experience many reactions that have limited impact on performance. However, when a number of reactions are experienced simultaneously and intensely, functioning is likely to be impaired. Under these circumstances, the worker should take a break from the disaster assignment for a few hours at first, and then, longer, if necessary.

CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 88 Recognizing Severe Reactions to Disaster and Common Psychiatric Disorders Introduction When meeting with disaster survivors, crisis counselors may come into contact with people experiencing severe reactions to the disaster. Because treatment is not part of the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP), the goal of crisis counseling is to recognize these reactions and know when to alert a team leader or program manager to any concerns. If unresolved, severe reactions, such as social isolation, paranoia, and suicidal behavior, may begin to interfere with daily functioning and develop into psychiatric disorders. The psychiatric disorders most often associated with a traumatic event include depressive disorders, substance abuse, acute stress disorder, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and dissociative disorders. Crisis counselors may also encounter survivors who have preexisting psychiatric disorders and have become disconnected from treatment, or who may be experiencing an aggravation of their symptoms. These disorders include those described above, as well as bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, and co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse. Crisis counselors need to be able to recognize the possible symptoms of common psychiatric disorders so they know when to request assistance from their team leaders or other professionals in the program. Since the CCP is not a treatment program, the role of team leaders or other mental health professionals is to recognize and refer those in need of treatment services to local behavioral health services and not to provide treatment themselves. Whenever possible, crisis counselors, in consultation with their team leaders, may follow up with survivors to ensure they have connected with the needed resources. Please note that only a trained mental health professional can diagnose mental illness and provide psychotherapy, and a psychiatrist or medical doctor typically prescribes medication. Crisis counselors may encounter developmental disabilities, cognitive impairments, dementia, traumatic brain injury, traumatic or complicated grief, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in some survivors. The contents of this handout are not exhausti ve. Crisis counselors should always seek the assistance of supervisors and clinical personnel in any situation where there is a question about a person's level of distress. CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 89 Severe Reactions to a Traumatic E vent The following severe reactions may result from an increase in the level of stress brought on by the traumatic event: Social Isolation Social isolation is a feeling of loneliness experienced by the patient as a threatening state imposed by others; a sense of loneliness caused by the absence of family and friends; or the absence of a supportive or significant personal relationship caused by the patient's unacceptable social behavior or social values, inability to engage in social situations, immature interests, inappropriate attitudes for his or her developmental age, alterations in physical appearance, or mental status or illness. It is important to be aware of the possibility of social isolation when counseling people who are known to have developmental disabilities, cognitive impairments, dementia, and traumatic brain injury. Symptoms: - Feelings of loneliness imposed by others - Feelings of rejection - Feelings of difference from others - Insecurity in public - Sad, dull affect - Uncommunicative and withdrawn behavior and lack of eye contact - Preoccupation with own thoughts or repetitive, meaningless actions - Hostility in voice and behavior Paranoia Paranoia is an unfounded or exaggerated distrust of others, sometimes reaching delusional proportions. Paranoid individuals constantly suspect the motives of those around them, and believe that certain individuals, or people in general, are \"out to get them.\" Acute, or short-term, paranoia may occur in some individuals overwhelmed by stress. Symptoms: - Belief that others are plotting against him or her - Preoccupation with unsupported doubts about friends or associates - Reluctance to confide in others due to a fear that information may be used against him or her - Reading negative meanings into innocuous remarks - Bearing grudges - Perceiving attacks on his or her reputation that are not clear to others and being quick to counterattack - Maintaining unfounded suspicions regarding the fidelity of a spouse or significant other Suicidal Behavior Suicidal behavior is a severe reaction that may result from several psychiatric disorders. Most people who kill themselves have a diagnosable and treatable psychiatric illness. CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 90 Symptoms: - History of attempted suicide (Those who have made serious suicide attempts are at a much higher risk for actually taking their lives.) - Family history of suicide, suicide attempts, depression, or other psychiatric illness - Depression with an unrelenting low mood, pessimism, hopelessness, desperation, anxiety, psychic pain, and inner tension - Sleep problems - Increased alcohol or drug use - Engagement in recent impulsive or unnecessarily risky behavior - Making threats of suicide or expressing a strong wish to die - Plans of self -harm or suicide - Allocation of prized possessions - Sudden or impulsive purchase of a firearm - Acquiring other means of killing oneself such as poisons or medications - Unexpected rage or anger Psychiatric Disorders Most Often Associated with a Traumatic Event If left untreated or if unresponsive to crisis counseling interventions, severe reactions may lead to a psychiatric disorder. These disorders may be preexisting or may result from an increase in the level of stress brought on by the traumatic event and include the following: Depressive Disorders Depressive disorders are illnesses that involve the body, mood, and thoughts. They affect the way a person eats and sleeps, the way one feels about oneself, and the way one thinks about things. A depressive disorder is not the same as a passing blue mood. It is not a sign of personal weakness or a condition that can be willed or wished away. Without treatment, symptoms can last for weeks, months, or years. Symptoms: - Persistently sad or irritable mood - Pronounced changes in sleep, appetite, and energy - Difficulty thinking, concentrating, and remembering - Physical slowing or agitation - Lack of interest in or pleasure from activities once enjoyed - Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, hopelessness, and emptiness - Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide - Persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive disorders, and chronic pain CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 91 Substance Abuse Substance abuse is a pattern of substance use resulting in consequences in major life areas. Substance misuse is the use of a substance in ways or for reasons other than intended for that substance. Symptoms: - Recurrent substance use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated absences or poor work performance related to substance use; substance-related absences, suspensions, or expulsions from school; neglect of children or household) - Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (e.g., driving an automobile or operating a machine when impaired by substance use) - Recurrent substance-related legal problems (e.g., arrests for substance- related disorderly conduct) - Continued substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance (e.g., arguments with spouse about consequences of intoxication, physical fights) Acute Stress Disorder Acute stress disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by a cluster of dissociative and anxiety symptoms that occur within a month of a traumatic stressor. The immediate cause of acute stress disorder is exposure to trauma\u2014 an extreme stressor involving a threat to life or the prospect of serious injury; witnessing an event that involves the death or serious injury of another person; or learning of the violent death or serious injury of a family member or close friend. Symptoms: - Being dazed or less aware of surroundings - Depersonalization - Dissociative amnesia - Reexperiencing the trauma in dreams, images, thoughts, illusions, or flashbacks; or intense distress when exposed to reminders of the trauma - Tendency to avoid people, places, objects, conversations, and other stimuli reminiscent of the trauma - Hyperarousal or anxiety, including sleep problems, irritability, inability to concentrate, an unusually intense startle response, hypervigilance, and physical restlessness - Significantly impaired social functions or the inability to do necessary tasks, including seeking help Anxiety Disorders Anxiety disorders, unlike the relatively mild, brief anxiety caused by a stressful event, last at least 6 months and can worsen if not treated. Anxiety disorders commonly occur along with other mental or physical illnesses, including alcohol CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 92 or substance abuse, which may mask anxiety symptoms or make them worse. In some cases, these other illnesses need to be treated before a person will respond to treatment for the anxiety disorder. Specific anxiety disorders include panic disorder, OCD, PTSD, social phobia (or social anxiety disorder), specific phobias, and generalized anxiety disorder. Symptoms: - Each anxiety disorder has different symptoms, but all the symptoms cluster around excessive, irrational fear and dread. - Sometimes alcoholism, depression, or other coexisting conditions have such a strong effect on the individual that treating the anxiety disorder must wait until the coexisting conditions are brought under control. PTSD PTSD is an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened. Traumatic events that may trigger PTSD include violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, accidents, or military combat. Not every traumatized person develops full -blown or even minor PTSD. Symptoms usually begin within 3 months of the incident but occasionally emerge years afterward. They must last more than a month to be considered PTSD. The course of the illness varies. Some people recover within 6 months; others have symptoms that last much longer. In some people, the condition becomes chronic. Symptoms: - Persistent frightening thoughts and memories of the ordeal - Emotional numbness, especially toward people with which the individual was once close - Sleep problems - Feelings of detachment - Being easily startled Dissociative Disorders Dissociative disorders are characterized by a dissociation from or interruption of a person's fundamental aspects of waking consciousness (such as one's personal identity or history). All of the dissociative disorders are thought to stem from trauma experienced by the individual with this disorder. Dissociative disorders include dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue, dissociative identity depersonalization disorder. Symptoms: - The person literally dissociates himself or herself from a situation or experience too traumatic to integrate with his or her conscious self. - Symptoms of one or more of the disorders are also seen in a number of other mental illnesses, including PTSD, panic disorder, and O CD. CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 93 Preexisting Psychiatric Disorders In addition to the disorders described above, the following conditions may also have existed prior to the disaster. Bipolar Disorder Bipolar disorder, or manic depression, causes extreme shifts in mood, energy, and functioning. These changes may be subtle or dramatic, typically varying greatly during a person's life as well as among individuals. Bipolar disorder is a chronic, generally lifelong condition with recurring episodes of mania and depression lasting from days to months; episodes often begin in adolescence or early adulthood, and occasionally in children. Symptoms of mania: - An elated, happy mood or an irritable, angry, unpleasant mood - Increased physical and mental activity and energy - Racing thoughts and flight of ideas - Increased talking, more rapid speech than normal - Ambitious, often grandiose plans - Risk taking - Impulsive activity (e.g., spending sprees, sexual indiscretion, alcohol abuse) - Decreased sleep without experiencing fatigue Symptoms of depression: - Loss of energy - Prolonged sadness - Decreased activity and energy - Restlessness and irritability - Inability to concentrate or make decisions - Increased feelings of worry and anxiety - Less interest or participation in and less enjoyment of activities normally enjoyed - Feelings of guilt and hopelessness - Thoughts of suicide - Change in appetite - Change in sleep patterns Borderline Personality Disorder Borderline personality disorder is characterized by instability in moods, interpersonal relationships, self-image, and behavior. This instability often disrupts family and work, long-term planning, and the individual's sense of self- identity. Symptoms \u2014A pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five or more of the following: - Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment - A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 94 -Identity disturbance\u2014markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self -Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g.,spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating) -Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior -Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intenseepisodic irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarelymore than a few days ) -Chronic feelings of emptiness -Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequentdisplays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights) -Transient, stress -related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms Eating disorders Anorexia nervosa is a serious, often chronic, and life-threatening eating disorder defined by a refusal to maintain minimal body weight within 15 percent of an individual's normal weight. Other essential features of this disorder include an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image. Symptoms include the following : -Preoccupation with food -Refusal to maintain minimally normal body weight -Continuing to think of oneself as fat even when he or she is bone-thin -Brittle hair and nails -Dry and yellow skin -Depression -Complaining of hypothermia -Fine, downy hair growth on the body -Strange eating habits such as cutting food into tiny pieces or refusing to eat in front of others Bulimia nervosa is marked by a destructive pattern of binge eating and recurrent inappropriate behavior to control one's weight. It can occur together with other psychiatric disorders such as depression, OCD, substance dependence, or self-injurious behavior. Binge eating is defined as the consumption of excessively large amounts of food within a short period of time. Symptoms include the following: -Constant concern about food and weight -Self-induced vomiting -Erosion of dental enamel -Scarring on the backs of the hands (due to repeatedly pushing fingers down the throat to induce vomiting) -Swelling of the glands near the cheeks (a small percentage of people show this symptom) -Irregular menstrual periods and a decrease in sexual interest -Depression -Sore throats and abdominal pain OCD OCD is a psychiatric disorder characterized by obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviors. While most people at one time or another experience such thoughtsCCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 95 or behaviors, an individual with OCD experiences obsessions and compulsions for more than an hour each day, in a way that interferes with his or her life. O bsessions are intrusive, irrational thoughts or unwanted ideas or impulses that r epeatedly well up in a person's mind. Again and again, the person experiences disturbing thoughts, such as \"My hands must be contaminated; I must was h the m\"; \"I may have left the gas stove on\"; \"I am going to injure my child.\" On one l evel, the sufferer knows these obsessive thoughts are irrational. But on another level, he or she fears these thoughts might be true. Trying to avoid suc h thoughts creates great anxiety. C ompulsions are repetitive rituals such as hand washing, counting, checki ng, hoar ding, or arranging. Individuals repeat these actions, perhaps feeling momentary relief, but without feeling satisfaction or a sense of completion . P eople with OCD feel they must perform these compulsive rituals or somethi ng bad w ill happen. S ymptoms: -R epeatedly checking things, perhaps dozens of times, before feeli ng s ecure -Fear of harming others -Feel ing dirty and contaminated -C onstantly arranging and ordering things -E xcessive concern with body imperfections -B eing ruled by numbers \u2014believing that certain numbers repres ent good, and other s represent evil -E xcessive concern with sin or blasphemy Panic Disorder P anic disorder is characterized by recurrent panic attacks, at least one of whic h l eads to a month of increased anxiety or avoidant behavior. Panic disorder may also be indicated if a person experiences fewer than four panic episodes but hasrecurrent or constant fears of having another panic attack. S ymptoms: -S weating -H ot losing control, or losing one's mind P anic attacks typically last about 10 minutes, but may be a few minutes shorter or longer. During the attack, the physical and emotional symptoms increas e qui ckly and then subside. A person may feel anxious and jittery for many hours after experiencing a panic attack.CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 96 Schizophrenia Schizophrenia often interferes with a person's ability to think clearly, distinguish reality from fantasy, manage emotions, make decisions, and relate to others. A person with schizophrenia does not have a \"split personality,\" and almost all people with schizophrenia are not dangerous or violent toward others while they are receiving treatment. Symptoms of schizophrenia are generally divided into three categories (positive, negative, and cognitive): - Positive symptoms, or \"psychotic\" symptoms, include delusions and hallucinations because the patient has lost touch with reality in certain important ways. \"Positive\" refers to having overt symptoms that should not be there. Delusions cause individuals to believe that people are r eading their thoughts or plotting against them, that others are secretly monitoring and threatening them, or that they can control other people's minds. Hallucinations cause people to hear or see things that are not present. - Negative symptoms include emotional flatness or lack of expression, an inability to start and follow through with activities, speech that is brief and devoid of content, and a lack of pleasure or interest in life. \"Negative\" does not refer to a person's attitude, but rather to a lack of certain characteristics that should be there. - Cognitive symptoms pertain to thinking processes. For example, people may have difficulty with prioritizing tasks, certain kinds of memory functions, and organizing their thoughts. A common problem associated with schizophrenia is the lack of insight into the condition itself. This is not a willful denial, but rather a part of the mental illness itself. Schizoaffective Disorder Schizoaffective disorder is one of the more common, chronic, and disabling mental illnesses. It is characterized by a combination of symptoms of schizophrenia and an affective (mood) disorder. Symptoms: - A person needs to have primary symptoms of schizophrenia (such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and disorganized behavior), along with a period of time when he or she also has symptoms of major depression or a manic episode. Accordingly, schizoaffective disorder may have two subtypes : (1) d epressive subtype, characterized by major depressive episodes only, and (2) b ipolar subtype, characterized by manic episodes with or without depressive symptoms or depressive episodes. - The mood symptoms in schizoaffective disorder are more prominent and last for a substantially longer time than those in schizophrenia. - Schizoaffective disorder may be distinguished from a mood disorder by the fact that delusions or hallucinations must be present in people with schizoaffective disorder for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms. - The diagnosis of a person with schizophrenia or mood disorder may change later to that of schizoaffective disorder, or vice versa . CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 97 Co-occurring Mental Illness and Substance Abuse Co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse are often referred to as co- occurring disorders. To recover fully, a consumer with co-occurring disorders needs treatment for both problems \u2014focusing on one does not ensure the other will go away. Dual-diagnosis services integrate assistance for each condition, helping people recover from both in one setting, at the same time. What follows are some statistics, provided by the National Alliance on Mental Illness, on the prevalence of co-occurring disorders: - Roughly 50 percent of individuals with severe mental disorders are affected by substance abuse. - Thirty -seven percent of alcohol abusers and 53 percent of drug abusers also have at least one serious mental illness. - Of all people diagnosed as mentally ill, 29 percent abuse either alcohol or drugs. - Of people with a 12-month addictive disorder, 42.7 percent had at least one 12-month mental disorder. - Of individuals with a 12- month mental disorder, 14.7 percent had at least one 12-month addictive disorder. - Forty -seven percent of individuals with schizophrenia also had a substance abuse disorder (more than four times as likely as the general population). - Sixty-one percent of individuals with bipolar disorder also had a substance abuse disorder (more than five times as likely as the general population). Often, people can suffer from more than one psychiatric disorder at a time. In addition, people can suffer from psychiatric and medical disorders simultaneously and may need treatment referrals for both. CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 98 Treatment Approaches This section identifies general treatment approaches for a variety of psychiatric disorder s. The following interventions are used either alone or in combination, depending on the treatment approach chosen by the survivor in consultation with his or her mental health treatment professional. A comprehensive approach to treatment would include a combination ofinterventions , such as the following: -Connecting the person with a peer counselor -Referring the person to a support group -Supporting family communication -Enhancing spirituality -Establishing a personal connection with a health care provider -Assisting the person with the use of Internet-based supports It is important to note several additional points : -Medication is most effective when it is used as part of an overall treatment plan that includes supportive therapy. -Medication-assisted treatment is the use of medications, in combination with counseling and behavioral therapies, to provide a whole-patientapproach to the treatment of substance-use disorders. Research shows that when treating substance-use disorders, a combination of medicationand behavioral therapies is most successful. -Support groups and community -based programs, as well as 12-step recovery programs, provide peer support to people suffering fromsubstance abuse. -Cognitive therapy is used to help people think and behave appropr iately. People learn to make the feared object or situation less threatening as theyare exposed to, and slowly get used to, whatever is so frightening to them. -Healthy living habits may also help. Exercise, a proper and balanced diet, moderate use of caffeine and alcohol, and learning how to reduce stressare all important. Ten Fundamental Components of Mental Health Recovery Mental health recovery is a journey of healing and transformation enabling a person with a mental health problem to live a meaningful life in a community of his or her choice while striving to achieve his or her full potential. Self-direction\u2014Consumers lead, control, exercise choice over, and determine their own path of recovery by optimizing autonomy, independence, and control ofresources to achieve a self-determined life. By definition, the recovery process must be self -directed by the individual, who defines his or her own life goals and designs a unique path towards those goals. Individualized and person-centered\u2014There are multiple pathways to recoverybased on an individual's unique strengths and resiliencies as well as his or herneeds, preferences, experiences (including past trauma), and cultural background in all of its diverse representations. Individuals also identify recovery as being an ongoing journey and an end result, as well as an overall paradigmfor achieving wellness and optimal mental health. Empowerment\u2014Consumers have the authority to choose from a range ofoptions and to participate in all decisions \u2014including the allocation of resources \u2014CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 99 that will affect their lives, and are educated and supported in so doing. They have the ability to join with other consumers to collectively and effectively speak for themselves about their needs, wants, desires, and aspirations. Through empowerment, an individual gains control of his or her own destiny and influences the organizational and societal structures in his or her life. Holistic\u2014Recovery encompasses an individual's whole life, including mind, body, spirit, and community. Recovery embraces all aspects of life, including housing, employment, education, mental health and health care treatment and services, complementary and naturalistic services, addictions treatment, spirituality, creativity, social networks, community participation, and family supports as determined by the person. Families, providers, organizations, systems, communities, and society play crucial roles in creating and maintaining meaningful opportunities for consumer access to these supports. Nonlinear \u2014Recovery is not a step -by-step process but one based on continual growth, occasional setbacks, and learning from experience. Recovery begins with an initial stage of awareness in which a person recognizes that positive change is possible. This awareness enables the consumer to move on to fully engage in the work of recovery. Strengths based\u2014Recovery focuses on valuing and building on the multiple capacities, resiliencies, talents, coping abilities, and inherent worth of individuals. By building on these strengths, consumers leave stymied life roles behind and engage in new life roles (e.g., partner, caregiver, friend, student, employee). The process of recovery moves forward through interaction with others in supportive, trust-based relationships. Peer support\u2014Mutual support\u2014including the sharing of experiential knowledge and skills and social learning\u2014plays an invaluable role in recovery. Consumers encourage and engage other consumers in recovery and provide each other with a sense of belonging, supportive relationships, valued roles, and community. Respect \u2014Community, systems, and societal acceptance and appreciation of consumers \u2014including protecting their rights and eliminating discrimination and stigma\u2014are crucial in achieving recovery. Self-acceptance and regaining belief in oneself are particularly vital. Respect ensures the inclusion and full partic ipation of consumers in all aspects of their lives. Responsibility \u2014Consumers have a personal responsibility for their own self- care and journeys of recovery. Taking steps toward their goals may require great courage. Consumers must strive to understand and give meaning to their experiences and identify coping strategies and healing processes to promote their own wellness. Hope\u2014Recovery provides the essential and motivating message of a better future\u2014that people can and do overcome the barriers and obstacles that confront them. Hope is internalized; but can be fostered by peers, families, friends, providers, and others. Hope is the catalyst of the recovery process. Conclusion This handout was designed to give crisis counselors more information about severe reactions to trauma and psychiatric disorders that they may encounter in a small number of disaster survivors. When a severe reaction or psychiatric disorder is suspected, the crisis counselor needs to alert the CCP team leader and clinical personnel. The crisis counselor CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 100 should work should work with the survivor to determine if referral is needed, and then, the crisis counselor should make use of the resource linkage to refer the survivor to the appropriate resource. If possible, crisis counselors can follow up with survivors to see if they have made use of the referred services. Use of the Adult Assessment and Referral Tool is a way to keep track of survivors who may be suffering from severe reactions to disaster. As with all issues related to severe reactions and psychiatric disorders, use of the tool for this purpose should be done in consultation with CCP team leaders and clinical personnel.

The death of a loved one, loss of a job, seri\u00ad ous illness, terrorist attacks, and other traumatic events: these are all examples of very challenging lite experiences . Many people react to such circum\u00ad stances with a flood of strong emotions and a sense of uncertainty. Yet people generally adapt well over time to lite-changing situations and stressful conditions. What enables them to do so? It involves resilience, an ongoing process that requires time and effort and engages people in taking a number of steps. This brochure is intended to help readers with taking their own road to resilience. The information within describes resilience and some factors that affect how people deal with hardship. Much of the brochure focuses on developing and using a personal strategy tor enhancing resilience. WHAT IS RE ILIENCE? Resilience is the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats, or even sig\u00ad nificant sources of stress -such as family and rela\u00ad tionship problems, serious health problems, or workplace and financial stressors. It means \"bouncing back\" from difficult experiences . Research has shown that resilience is ordinary, not extraordinary. People commonly demonstrate resilience. One example is the response of many Americans to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and individuals' efforts to rebuild their lives. Being resilient does not mean that a person doesn't experience difficulty or distress. Emotional pain and sadness are common in people who have suffered major adversity or trauma in their lives. In tact, the road to resilience is likely to involve considerable emotional distress. Resilience is not a trait that people either have or do not have. It involves behaviors, thoughts, and actions that can be learned and developed in anyone. CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 103 SOME FACTORS IN RESILIENCE A combination of factors contributes to resilience. Many studies show that the primary factor in resilience is having caring and supportive relation\u00ad ships within and outside the family. Relationships that create love and trust, provide role models, and offer encouragement and reassur\u00ad ance help bolster a person's resilience. Several additional factors are associated with resilience, including: The capacity to make realistic plans and take steps to carry them out A positive view of yourself and confidence in your strengths and abilities Skills in communication and problem solving The capacity to manage strong feelings and impulses All of these are factors that people can develop in themselves. STRATEGIES FOR BUILDING RESILIENCE Developing resilience is a personal journey. People do not all react the same way to traumatic and stressful life events. An approach to building resilience that works for one person might not work for another. People use varying strategies. Some variation may reflect cultural differences . A person's culture might have an impact on how he or she communicates feelings and deals with adversity -for example, whether and how a person connects with significant others, including extended family members and community resources. With growing cultural diversity, the public has greater access to a number of different approaches to building resilience. Some or many of the ways to build resilience in the following pages may be appropriate to consid\u00ad er in developing your personal strategy. CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 104 10 WAYS TO BUILD RESILIE CE Make connections. Good relationships with close family members, friends, or others are important. Accepting help and support from those who care about you and will listen to you strengthens resilience. Some people find that being active in civic groups, faith-based organizations, or other local groups provides social support and can help with reclaiming hope. Assisting others in their time of need also can benefit the helper. Avoid seeing crises as insurmountable problems. You can't change the fact that highly stressful events happen, but you can change how you inter\u00ad pret and respond to these events. Try looking beyond the present to how future circumstances may be a little better. Note any subtle ways in which you might already feel somewhat better as you deal with difficult situations. Accept that change is a part of living. Certain goals may no longer be attainable as a result of adverse situations. Accepting circumstances that cannot be changed can help you focus on circum\u00ad stances that you can alter. Move toward your goals. Develop some realistic goals. Do something regularly -even if it seems like a small accomplishment -that enables you to move toward your goals. Instead of focusing on tasks that seem unachievable, ask yourself, 'What's one thing I know I can accomplish today that helps me move in the direction I want to go?\" Take decisive actions. Act on adverse situations as much as you can. Take decisive actions, rather than detaching completely from problems and stresses and wishing they would just go away. I\u00b7--------------------------,.._ Look for opportunities for self-discovery. People often learn something about themselves and may find that they have grown in some respect as a result of their struggle with loss. Many people who have experienced tragedies and hardship have reported better relationships, greater sense of personal strength even while feeling vulnerable, increased sense of self-worth, a more developed spiri\u00ad tuality, and heightened appreciation for life. Nurture a positive view of yourself. Developing confi\u00ad dence in your ability to solve problems and trusting your instincts helps build resilience. Keep things in perspective . Even when facing very painful events, try to consider the stressful situation in a broader context and keep a long-term perspective. Avoid blowing the event out of proportion. Maintain a hopeful outlook. An optimistic outlook enables you to expect that good things will happen in your life. Try visualizing what you want, rather than wor\u00ad rying about what you fear. Take care of yourself. Pay attention to your own needs and feelings. Engage in activities that you enjoy and find relaxing. Exercise regularly. Taking care of yourself helps to keep your mind and body primed to deal with situations that require resilience. Additional ways of strengthening resilience may be helpful. For example, some people write about their deepest thoughts and feelings related to trauma or other stressful events in their life. Meditation and spiri\u00ad tual practices help some people build connections and restore hope. The key is to identify ways that are likely to work well for you as part of your own personal strategy for fostering resilience. CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 105 LEARNING FROM YOUR PAST SOME QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSB.F Focusing on past experiences and sources of per\u00ad sonal strength can help you learn about what strategies for building resilience might work for you. By exploring answers to the following ques\u00ad tions about yourself and your reactions to challeng\u00ad ing life events, you may discover how you can respond effectively to difficult situations in your life. Consider the following: What kinds of events have been most stressful for me? How have those events typically affected me? Have I found it helpful to think of important people in my life when I am distressed? To whom have I reached out for support in working through a traumatic or stressful experience? What have I learned about myself and my interactions with others during difficult times? Has it been helpful for me to assist someone else going through a similar experience? Have I been able to overcome obstacles, and if so, how? What has helped make me feel more hopeful about the future? t YI G FL BLE Resilience involves maintaining flexibility and balance in your life as you deal with stressful circumstances and traumatic events. This happens in several ways, including: Letting yourself experience strong emotions, and also realizing when you may need to avoid experiencing them at times in order to continue functioning Stepping forward and taking action to deal with your problems and meet the demands of daily living, and also stepping back to rest and reenergize yourself Spending time with loved ones to gain support and encouragement, and also nurturing yourself Relying on others, and also relying on yourself CCP Participant Workbook: Core Content Training 106 PLACES TO LOOK FOR HELP Getting help when you need it is crucial in building your resilience. Beyond caring family members and friends, people often find it helpful to turn to: Self-help and support groups. Such community groups can aid people struggling with hardships such as the death of a loved one. By sharing information, ideas, and emotions, group participants can assist one another and find comfort in knowing that they are not alone in experiencing difficulty. Books and other publications by people who have successfully managed adverse situations such as sur\u00ad viving cancer. These stories can motivate readers to find a strategy that might work for them personally. Online resources. Information on the web can be a helpful source of ideas, though the quality of information varies among sources. The APA Help Center, online at wwi. 11 J I r.rg is a good site to check. For many people, using their own resources and the kinds of help listed above may be sufficient for building resilience. At times, however, an individual might get stuck or have difficulty making progress on the road to resilience. A licensed mental health professional such as a psychologist can assist people in developing an appropriate strategy for moving forward. It is important to get professional help if you feel like you are unable to function or perform basic activities of daily living as a result of a traumatic or other stressful life experience. Different people tend to be comfortable with some\u00ad what different styles of interaction. A person should feel at ease and have good rapport in working with a mental health professional or partici\u00ad pating in a support group. u u To help summarize several of the main points in this brochure, think of resilience as similar to taking a raft trip down a river. On a river, you may encounter rapids, turns, slow water, and shallows. As in life, the changes you experience affect you differently along the way. In traveling the river, it helps to have knowledge about it and past experience in dealing with it. Your journey should be guided by a plan, a strategy that you consider likely to work well for you. Perseverance and trust in your ability to work your way around boulders and other obstacles are important. You can gain courage and insight by successfully navigating your way through white water. Trusted companions who accompany you on the journey can be especially helpful for dealing with rapids, upstream currents, and other difficult stretches of the river. You can climb out to rest alongside the river. But to get to the end of your journey, you need to get back in the raft and continue.
