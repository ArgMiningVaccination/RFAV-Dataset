Students Who Minor in HH Are More Likely to Graduate These findings are based on analyses comparing six-year graduation rates between 490 Holistic Health (HH) minors and 490 non-HH minors over a 10-year period from 2007-2017. SF State students were matched on 10 characteristics to control for gender, age, semester enrolled, major, year in school, first-generation status, socioeconomic background, transfer status, underrepresented minority status and SAT/ACT scores. Examining students from all backgrounds (n=980), first-generation students (n=240), and low-income students (n=418), we found that students who completed a HH minor graduated from the University at statistically significantly higher rates compared to students who did not complete the HH minor (ps = <.001, .049, and, .042, respectively).
