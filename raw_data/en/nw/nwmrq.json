Prepared by Montana Legal Services Association. Approved and distributed by the Montana Supreme Court Commission on Self-Represented Litigants . Rev. 7/02Introduction to Family Law in Montana, Page 2 of 18Warning This packet and the forms which come with it were created for people who have simple, uncontested dissolution of marriage (commonly known as \u0093divorce\u0094) cases. Thismeans that you do not expect your spouse to fight with you over the dissolution, property, debts, or kids. These forms may not be appropriate if you have a complicated family law case or if your spouse might contest the dissolution. Even \u0093simple\u0094 dissolutions can involve a lot of work. Many people have difficulty reading,understanding, and f illing out the necessary forms by themselves. If you have difficulty understanding this packet or f illing out the forms, you should speak to an attorney and should probably not try to file for a dissolution of marriage by yourself. How do I know if my case will become contested? There is no way of knowing for sure whether your spouse w ill contest all or part of your dissolution. Consider several factors: 1. Do you and your spouse dis agree about where the children w ill live? 2. Do you disagree about how to cover the children\u0092s medical insurance?3. Do you disagree on the division of property and debts?4. Can you work out these differ ences without going to court? 5. Are you asking for severe restrictions on contact between the children and the other parent? 6. Does your spouse have the resources to hire a private attorney? How do I know if my case is complicated? If your dissolution involves any of the following issues, it may be too complicated to use these forms: 1. Pensions, retirement benefits, or profit-sharing plans; 2. A pending personal injury case involving you or your spouse;3. Real estate that you or your spous e own with someone else or real estate located outside of Montana; 4. A family business;5. A bankruptcy case filed by your spouse;6. Complicated tax issues; or7. Contested custody and/or child support issues. Is there domestic violence involved ? If you or your children were victims of vi olence or abuse by your spouse, these forms may not be appropriate for you. Before proceeding, you may want to contact a privateattorney or the Montana Legal Services Association (800-666-6124). If you need immediate help and would like to find a victim advocate near you, you may contact theIntroduction to Family Law in Montana, Page 3 of 18Montana Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence (406-443-7794).

How to Use this Packet Read the Entire Packet : You should read this entire packet before attempting to use any of the forms that come with it. This packet is designed to provide you with the basic information you w ill need to file your own dissolution and/or parenting case. You may need to go back to thesesections from time to time as you are filling out the forms and proceeding with your dissolution. Introduction to Family Law will give you an overview of family law in Mont ana. It briefly describes some of the issues involved in dissolution and parenting cases. Throughout this section you w ill see references to the Montana Code Annotated (M.C.A.). The M.C.A contains the laws governing dissolutions and parenting plans and can be found in your local library or on the state law library web page atwww.lawlibrary.state.mt.us. Most of the relevant laws are in Title 40, chapter 4. A typical reference will look like this: M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4-212. This means Title 40, chapter 4, section 212. Reading the actual laws may be helpful to you. When you receive this packet, you should also be given a document entitled, How toIntroduction to Family Law in Montana, Page 4 of 18File for Dissolution of Marriage in Montana. If you are not married but are seeking to establish a parenting plan, the document will be called, How to File for a Permanent Parenting Plan in Montana. This document will list all of the forms you will need to f ill out and w ill walk you thr ough the steps you w ill need to follow in order to obtain your dissolution and/or parenting plan. Introduction to Family Law in Montana Dissolution of Marriage Dissolution: In Montana, the legal name for a divorce is a \u0093dissolution of marriage.\u0094 The Parties to the Dissolution: The wife and husband are called \u0093the parties to the dissolution.\u0094 The Petitioner is the party who first asks the court for a dissolution. The Petitioner asks the court for a dissolution by filing a Petition for Dissolution with the court. The Respondent is the other party. Who Can File for Dissolution in Montana? You only can get a dissolution in Montana if Montana has jurisdiction over your case. Montana has jurisdiction to rule on your dissolution if you have resided in Montana for at least 90 days prior to getting y our dissolution (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4-104). If there are children of the marriage who are under 18 years old, the children must have resided in Montana for at least six months before you can file for a dissolution in thestate. There are a few exceptions, but, generally, Montana courts do not have jurisdiction to make judgments regarding the children unless they have resided in thestate for at least six months (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4-211). How the Court Decides if You Should Get a Dissolution: The legal reasons you must show to get a dissolution are called the grounds for dissolution . In Montana, the ground for dissolution is \u0093an irretrievable breakdown in the marriage \u0094 (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4-107). When you ask the court for a dissolution, youIntroduction to Family Law in Montana, Page 5 of 18must state in the Petition that there is an irretrievable breakdown in the marriage. In order to show that there is an irretrievable breakdown, you must tell the court that either (1) you have lived separate and apart for 180 days prior to f iling for the dissolution, or (2) there is serious marital discord which adversely affects the attitude of one of theparties (M.C.A. 40-4-104). No Fault Dissolution: In Montana you do not have to show that one per son is at fault for the breakdown of the marriage. Your spouse does not have to agr ee to getting the dissolution, and you do not need to prove that there has been wrong-doing by one of the parties. Other Issues Settled in a Dissolution Case: A dissolution legally ends the marriage and changes your status from married to single. It also determines related issues that you should address in the Petition for Dissolution,such as: 1. Living arrangements for the children and what contact they w ill have with each parent; 2. Child support and medical support for the children;3. Who will k eep what property; and 4. Who will be res ponsible for which debts. You will need to know something about each of t hese issues before you file for your dissolution. Each issue is explained in more detail below. If your spouse disagrees over how one or mo re of these issues should be resolved, s/he may file an Answer or Response to your Petition. If your spouse answers your Petition, the case becomes a contested dissolution case. Default Dissolution: A default judgment is what the court awards you if your spouse does not answer your Petition for Dissolution. Your spouse, the Respondent, has 20 days to respond to thePetition after s/he is served with a copy of it. After 20 days, the Respondent\u0092s defaultcan be entered by the Clerk of Court. You still will have to sc hedule a hearing and appear in court in order to obtain your Final Decree of Dissolution. If you get a default judgment, you w ill be granted everything you asked for in the Petition, as l ong as the court finds that your request is \u0093equitable\u0094 (fair). If there are children, the court also must find that your proposed parenting plan is in the best interests of the children. Theinstructions included in this packet assume that your dissolution w ill be a default dissolution. If your spouse is likely to c ontest your Petition, and especially if s/he isIntroduction to Family Law in Montana, Page 6 of 18likely to hire a lawyer, these forms probably are not appropriate for you, and you should consult an attorney before proceeding. Joint Dissolution: If both you and your spouse can agree to all of the terms of your dissolution, including the parenting of the children and the division of property and debts, you may file for ajoint dissolution. With a joint dissolution, both you and your spouse are Petitioners,and you both sign the Petition and the Parenting Plan. If you can agree to do a jointdissolution, the process of filing for a dissolution may be more simple. A Note about Maintenance: Maintenance (sometimes called \u0093alimony\u0094) re fers to money one spouse pays to the other, separate from child support. If you hav e been married to your spouse for several years, you lack the means to provide for your reasonable needs, and you are unable to support yourself through employment, you may want to request maintenance in your Petition (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4-203). A request for ma intenance usually is not appropriate in a default dissolution. If your spouse is likely to contest such a request, you should see a private attorney to represent your interests. The forms which come with this packet do not include a provision for maintenance. Other Kinds of Legal Separation: In addition to a dissolution of marriage, there are two other ways to change your maritalstatus (neither of which are provided for in the set of forms which come with this packet. If you are interested in pursuing the options discussed in this section, you should speakto an attorney): Declaration of Invalidity of Marriage : A declaration of invalidity of marriage is commonly known as an \u0093annulment.\u0094 It states that the marriage never really existed because it was based on some false understanding or information. There are onlycertain, specific circumstances under wh ich an annulment can be granted in Montana (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-1-402). Separation : If either party asks, and the other party does not object, the court w ill grant a decree of separation instead of a decree of dissolution. The requirements for a legal separation are generally the same as for a dissolution. However, a decree ofseparation does not end the marriage. Y ou cannot legally remarry until the legal separation is first changed into a dissolution. After six months, either party may ask thecourt to change the decree of separation into a decree of dissolution.Introduction to Family Law in Montana, Page 7 of 18Parenting A Note About the Word \u0093Custody\u0094: Montana law no longer uses the words \u0093cust ody\u0094 and \u0093visitation.\u0094 Instead, it uses \u0093parenting\u0094 to promote the idea that both parents should be involved in the children\u0092s lives. How Will Parenting Duties Be Decided? In every dissolution and/or parenting case , the parents are expected to develop a Parenting Plan that explains where the children will live, how much time the children will s pend with each parent, and how decisions w ill be m ade about the children. The parents may or may not agree about all of the terms of the plan. If the parents cannotagree, the judge w ill hear both sides and decide what is in the best interests of the children. The court will approve a Final Parenting Plan which is intended to protect the best interests of the children, clarify parental authority and responsib ility, and help prevent future court action (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4-234). If you and the other party were married, you w ill ask for a parenting plan when you file your petition for dissolution of marriage. As a part of the dissolution, the court willaddress parenting arrangements for the children. If you were not married to the other parent, you can file a \u0093Petition to Establish a Permanent Parenting Plan.\u0094 In this kind of case, the court w ill not address property or debts. It w ill only address parenting arrangements, ch ild support, and medical support for the children. What Are the Best Interests of the Child? Montana law states that the court w ill decide parenting arra ngements based on what it believes are the \u0093best interests of the child\u0094 (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4-212). These are some of the factors that the court considers w hen trying to determine what the best interests of the child are: 1. The wishes of the child\u0092s parents; 2. The wishes of the child;3. The interaction of the child with the parents, siblings, and other persons who may significantly impact the child;Introduction to Family Law in Montana, Page 8 of 184. One parent\u0092s physical abuse or the threat of physical abuse against either the child or the other parent; 5. Chemical dependency or abuse by either parent;6. Continuity and stab ility of care; 7. Developmental needs of the child; and8. Whether a parent has knowingly failed to pay birth costs or child support that the parent is able to pay. Preference for Both Parents to Participate in the Children\u0092s Lives: In Montana, the law presumes that \u0093frequent and continuing contact\u0094 with both parents is best for the children unless it is proven to the court that this is not true (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4-212). If you want to restrict or lim it contact with the other parent, you w ill need to tell the court why it is in the children\u0092s best interests to do so. Paternity: Montana presumes that a child born during the marriage is the biological child of thehusband. If you are not sure whether the husband is the father of the child, you maywant to separately establish paternity. If the parents of the child are not married, andone of the parties questions the paternity, you w ill need to establish paternity before getting a parenting plan. Paternity can be established by a court or administrativejudgment, decree, or or der (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-6-105). If You Are Pregnant: If you are pregnant and your spouse is the father, you w ill have to wait until you are no longer pregnant in order to use the forms t hat come with this packet. If you are interested in filing for a dissolution of marriage before your child is born, you shouldspeak to an attorney. If you are pregnant and your spouse is not t he father, you must state this in your Petition. You may be required to establish paternity of the child before the court will grant your dissolution. Things to Consider when Setti ng Up Your Parenting Plan: Frequent and Continuing Contact: The court assumes that children should have \u0093frequent and continuing contact\u0094 with both par ents. It is not necessary for children to spend exactly equal amounts of time with each parent. However, when the childrenreside with one parent most of the time, the court expects that the other parent w ill beIntroduction to Family Law in Montana, Page 9 of 18allowed to have reasonable contact with the children. Decision Making: If you anticipate conflicts over i ssues related to your children\u0092s upbringing, you can specify in the parenting plan which parent w ill make decisions regarding such things as the children\u0092s education, spiritual development, and medicalcare. The court assumes that each parent has the authority to make emergency medical decisions as well as day-to-day dec isions while the children are residing with that parent (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4-234). Restricting Contact: If you believe that restricting contact between the children and the other parent is necessary, you can r equest certain conditions in your parenting plan. Examples are: 1. Supervised contact by an agr eed-upon third party (e.g., a grandparent, a mutual friend, a social agency, etc.). In order to get supervised visitation from the court, you will need to explain why the supervised visitation is necessary to protect the children; 2. Advance notice of intent to visit with the children (e.g., 24 or 48 hours, one week, one month); 3. Canceling the visit if the other parent is more than 30 minutes late;4. Requiring the children to remain in Montana unless otherwise agreed upon by both parents. Exchanging the Children for Visits: If you and your spouse often get into disagreements, you might want to include specific information about how the children w ill be exch anged for visits. If your relationship with your s pouse has been abusive, you might want to set up a meeting place for the exchange that is public and safe, such as the parking lot of a busyrestaurant or shopping center. Setting Up a Residential Schedule: Parenting plans can be general or very specific in stating where the children will be at different times. For example, the plan can state who the children will live with before the children start sc hool, while they are in school, during summer and winter vacations, and for different holidays and other special occasions. Themore specific you make your parenting plan, the less you and the other parent w ill be able to disagree over vague or unclear language. It also w ill be easier to enforce with the police or other officials if the other parent violat es the plan. If you are worried about enforcing the plan, the police should be able to tell by look ing at the plan where the children should be. For example, you should use language like, \u0093the first and third weekends of the month from 5:00 p.m. Friday to 5:00 p.m. Sunday\u0094 rather than just \u0093every other weekend.\u0094 Do not use general language such as \u0093reasonable visitation\u0094 if you are worried that the other parent will not follow the plan or that you will have disagreements over what \u0093reas onable\u0094 means.Introduction to Family Law in Montana, Page 10 of 18If a Parent Violates the Parenting Plan: If one parent violates the plan by fa iling to pay child support or by failing to return the children at the agreed-upon time, the other parent is st ill obligated to follow the plan. Child support and visits with the children are separ ate issues. If a parent does not visit the children, s/he must still pay court-ordered child s upport. If s/he does not pay court-ordered child support, that parent is st ill allowed to visit the children. Contact with both parents and child support are considered rights of the children . However, violation of the residential plan by one of the parents is punishable by contempt of court and can be a criminal offense. The offending parent can be subject to arrest and a fine of up to $500 or imprisonment in the county jail (M.C.A. \u00a7 45-5-631). When theother parent has kept a child over the set visitation time, you can go to court and get an order holding the other parent in contempt for violating the parenting plan. You should thenbe able to get the police to help you get your child back. Keep a diary of problems withcontact with the other parent. You can use the diary to give details in your statement or testimony to the court. Updating the Court with Information: Parenting plans must include a provision requiring both parties to update the court withchanges to the following information (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4-204): 1. Your Social Security number; 2. Your residential and ma iling addresses; 3. Your telephone number;4. Your driver\u0092s license number;5. Your employer\u0092s name, address, and telephone number;6. If the children are covered by a health or medical insurance plan, the name of the plan, the policy identification number, and the names of the persons covered; and 7. If the children are not covered, information about availab ility of cover age through the party\u0092s employer. Dispute Resolution: If you later decide to change the parenting pl an, the Judge may order you to go through some form of dispute resolution before returning to court (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4-219). You canspecify in your parenting plan what form of di spute resolution is appropriate. You can ask that a mutual friend, a family pastor, or another agreed-upon third party mediate between you and the other parent. A few community agenc ies offer free or reduced cost mediation services. Mediation is not appropriate in cases involving domestic abuse (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4-219(9)). If there has been physical abuse or the threat of physical abuse by one parent against theIntroduction to Family Law in Montana, Page 11 of 18other parent or the children, court action may be the only appropriate way to change the plan. Child and Medical Support Child Support: When the court establishes a final parenting plan, it also w ill order one or both parents to pay child support (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4-204). If you already have a Child Support and Medical Support Order through the Montana Child Support Enforcement Division(CSED) or another appropriate agency, the cour t may simply refer to that Order and acknowledge it as valid. If you do not already have a Child Support Order in place, the court w ill determine a child support amount based on Montana\u0092s child support guidelines. Computersoftware programs can do the complicated calculations automatically, and you mayhave to provide the court with the result of these calculations in a document called the Child Support Guidelines worksheet. You should ask the Clerk of District Court in theCounty where you are f iling your Petition if they have a procedure for doing the child support calculations. You may also call the Montana Legal Services Association (1-800-666-6124) to find out if there is assist ance available for running child support calculations in your area. How is the Child Support Amount Determined? The amount that the parents are asked to pay is based on what the court considers reasonable or necessary for raising the child. The amount is not affected by maritalmisconduct. It is based on the following factors: 1. The financial resources available to the child; 2. The financial resources available to each parent (income, pensions, etc.); 3. The standard of living the child would have had if the parents were st ill together; 4. The child\u0092s emotional, educational, and medical needs;5. The age of the child;6. The cost of day-care; and7. How much time the child spends with each parent. Financial Affidavit:Introduction to Family Law in Montana, Page 12 of 18One important factor in figuring the child support amount is how much each parent is earning. Both parents should complete a Child Support Guidelines Financial Affidavit. You must sign this document in front of a notary, swearing that the information in it istrue. You are also required to attach copi es of your pay stubs or other documentation of your income. CSED or the court will use this information to do the child su pport calculations. If you do not already have a child support order, you w ill be required to file a copy of this affidavit with the cour t and serve a copy on the other parent as a part of your dissolution or parenting case. How Does Unemployment Affect Child Support? Even if a parent is unemployed, or if his/her earnings are not known, the parent is still responsible for paying child support. In general, the court assumes that everybody could be working 40 hours each week and earning at least minimum wage. This amountis therefore \u0093imputed\u0094 to each parent. The court may impute higher than minimum wage if the parent\u0092s earning potential justifies it. How Are the Child Support Payments Made? Child support payments are generally made by automatic income withholding unlessthe court finds a good reason why income withholding is not appropriate (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-5-411). Income also can be withheld if the child support payment is delinquent (M.C.A.\u00a7 40-5-412). Support is considered delinquent if it is 8 days overdue. If you and the children are receiving public assistanc e under Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), the child s upport payments must be made through CSED. Notifying the Child Support Enforcement Division: If you are already receiving services from CSED, or if you receive public assistance under TANF, you must notify CSED that you have filed for a dissolution of marriageand/or parenting plan (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-5-202). Medical Insurance: Finally, every child support order also must include a provision about who w ill pay for the medical insurance and medical expenses of the minor children (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-5-805,806, 807). The general rule is that a parent who has medical insurance available through his or her employment must cover the children, if the insurance is available at a reasonablecost. If both parents have health plans, they may both provide coverage for thechildren. Sometimes the court will order both parents to pay premiums, deductibles, or other health care expenses based on perc entages determined by the child support guidelines. For instance, one parent may hav e to pay one-third of the expenses, whileIntroduction to Family Law in Montana, Page 13 of 18the other parent pays two-thirds. The obli gation to provide medical insurance ends when the child support obligation ends (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-5-808). Property As a part of a dissolution of marriage, the court must decide whether the property thatbelongs to the married couple should go to the husband or the wife. You must designate in your Petition who should get what property. The court w ill equitably distribute the property and assets of the marriage (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4-202). In deciding what is equitable, the court w ill consider a number of factors, including: 1. The duration of the marriage; 2. The age, health, occupation, income, vocational sk ills, estate, liabilities, and needs of both parties; 3. The parenting arrangements, if children are involved;4. Whether maintenance has been granted; 5. The opportunity for both parties to acquire income and assets in the future; and6. The contribution of a spouse as a homemaker to the family. Declaration of Assets, Debt s, Income, and Expenses: Under Montana law, both parties to the dissolution are required to give the other party a list of their assets, debts, income, and expenses within 60 days of serving the Petition(M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4-252). This document is called the Preliminary Declaration of Disclosure of Assets, Debts, Income, and Expenses. If BOTH parties agree, the exchange ofpreliminary declarations of disclosure may be waived. The law also requires the exchange of final declarations of disclosure by both parties before the case goes to trial or before t he parties reach an agreement. However, if your spouse does not answer the Petition, and a default judgement is granted, you may waive the final disclosure requirements (M.C.A . \u00a7 40-4-257). Except in the case of a default judgment, the parties can NOT agree to waive the exchange of final disclosures. Failure of either party to file a complete financial disclosure statement can authorize the court to accept the statement of the other party as accurate. Any deliberately false statement may subject a party to contempt of court, fines, or appropriate penalties. Introduction to Family Law in Montana, Page 14 of 18Major Property: Property such as houses or land are referred to as real property . If you have large assets to distribute in the dissolution, y ou should consider seek ing the advice of an attorney. In addition, married people might have a right to part of each other's pensions or retirement accounts. If you or your spous e have a pension or retirement account, you should consider seeking t he advice of an attorney. If you have cars or real property that you are dividing in your dissolution, you might want to ask in your Petition that one party remove his or her name from the title and deeds of the other person\u0092s property within 20 days of when the final decree is entered. Personal Property: Typically, dissolution papers list who should get which major pieces of property, and also state that each party is entitled to the personal property (such as clothing and personal items) \u0093currently in his or her possession.\u0094 If your spouse st ill has some of your personal property that you would like retur ned, be sure to state so explicitly in your Petition. Temporary Economic Restraining Order: While your dissolution is pending, both you and your spouse are prohibited fromselling, hiding, or disposing of any property without the consent of the other person, \u0093except in the usual course of business or for the necessities of life\u0094 or to pay attorney\u0092s fees (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4-121). Both of you also are restrained from changing thebeneficiaries of your insurance coverage while the dissolution is pending. Thistemporary restraining order on property is included in the Summons, the document that officially notifies your spouse that you are f iling for a dissolution. Debts When you are drafting your Petition for Dissolution, you also should designate who should be responsible for which debts (also known as \u0093liab ilities\u0094) of the marri age. The Petition also should state that each party should be responsible for his or her own debts from before the parties were married and a fter the parties separated. If you think the court should make an exception to this, state the exception and the reason for it.Introduction to Family Law in Montana, Page 15 of 18Be Specific: It is important to be as specific as possible when describing your debts. For example, describe a credit card debt as \u0093Capitol One Visa for $200.\u0094 Again, you are required todisclose all of your debts to your spouse in your Declaration of Disclosure (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4-252). You might want to get a credi t report prior to drafting your documents. Creditors: You are not responsible for the debts your spouse had before you were married or after you are divorced. However, creditors can collect from you on your joint debts of the marriage. These debts often include ut ility bills, credit cards, and contracts you both signed. Notify joint creditors of your separation as soon as possible. Only you and your ex- spouse are parties to your dissolution. Th is means that creditors are not required to honor the court\u0092s division of debts. For example, if your spouse had medical b ills during your marriage, creditors may st ill require you to pay them, even if the court orders your spouse to pay them. You may s how the creditor your decree of dissolution and explain to them how to contact your ex-spouse, but, again, the creditor does not have to honor the division of debts outlined in your decree. However, you can go back to the court wh ich issued your decree and ask the court to hold your ex-spouse in contempt for fa iling to pay the bills as required in the decree. You will usually need a lawyer to do this. Temporary Orders (Provisions for Temporary Orders are not pr ovided for in the set of forms which come with this packet. If you are interested in pursuing any of the temporary orders discussed in this section, you should speak to an attorney.) Temporary Order of Protection: If you feel that you or your children are in danger, you can file for a Temporary Order of Protection. A Temporary Order of Protection makes it illegal for the other party to have any contact with you and/or the minor child ren. The other parent may not come near you, call you, or threaten you. You can add specific language to protect you at school or work or any place that you often go. District Court: If you are in the middle of filing for a dissolution or a parenting plan, any temporary orders that you file must be f iled in District Court, where your dissolutionIntroduction to Family Law in Montana, Page 16 of 18or parenting plan also will be heard. If you already have an Order of Protection in place from municipal or justice court, you should transfer the Order to District Court . In order to do this, you must file a Notice of Removal with the court who issued the Order. For More Information: If you want more information about f iling for a temporary order of protection, you should call a victim advocat e in your area. To find a victim advocate near you, call the Montana Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence at 1-888-443-7794. Other Temporary Orders: Interim Parenting Plan: You can ask the court for an Interim Parenting Plan to outline the living arrangements for the children while you are waiting for the court to issue the Final Parenting Plan. You may want an Interim Parenting Plan if you feel that yourchildren are in imminent danger of being \u0093s natched\u0094 by the other parent. You will probably need an attorney to handle this matter. Temporary Maintenance: If you have been married to y our spouse for several years and need temporary financial assistance, y ou may want to pursue a Temporary Maintenance Order. A request for maintenance usually is not appropriate in a defaultdissolution. If your spouse is likely to c ontest such a request, you may need a private attorney to represent your interests. Temporary Child Support : If child support has not been established already and you need money from the other parent to take care of the children while your dissolution is pending, you can file a Motion for Temporary Child Support. Again, this might not beappropriate for an uncontested dissolution or parenting plan, and a private attorney may be necessary. Temporary Family Support Orders: You also can request a Temporary Family Support Order which, if granted, is effect ive while your dissolution is pending. This order is not meant to eliminate orders fo r temporary maintenance or child support. A Family Support Order puts a \u0093holding pattern \u0094 on the marital estate while property and debt issues are being decided. The Order gi ves the court the power to pay marital b ills based on the income and assets of both par ties. The court may order one or both parties to sell assets in order to pay bills, if necessary (M.C.A. \u00a7 40-4- 121).Introduction to Family Law in Montana, Page 17 of 18Post-Dissolution Issues Remember to Follow the Decree: When the court grants your dissolution, it w ill issue a \u0093Final Decree of Dissolution\u0094 dissolving the marriage and resolving the issues raised in the dissolution. Keep a copyof the Decree and the Final Parenting Plan in a safe place. Make sure to follow theorders in the Decree, including: 1. Paying your portion of the marital debts as soon as possible; and 2. Making sure vehicle and other titles ar e signed over to the appropriate party. If You Receive Support Payments Directly from the Other Parent: 1. Keep a written record of all payments; and 2. Make copies of all checks, and keep them in a safe place. If You Changed Your Name as Part of the Dissolution: 1. Keep your conformed copy of t he Decree as proof of the name change; 2. Notify the Social Security Administration (SSA) and complete the necessary forms to receive a new identification card; 3. Update your driver\u0092s license with the Department of Motor Vehicles;4. Change your name on other important l egal papers (e.g., powers of attorney, living wills, trusts, and contracts); 5. Notify other people and institutions with whom you have contact (e.g., friends and family, employers, schools, post office, banks, creditors, telephone andutility com panies, insurance agencies, the Public Assistance office, etc.). Some Tax Issues to Keep in Mind: 1. The IRS assumes that the parent who has the children most of the time is entitled to the exemptions, but parents are allowed to trade them back and forth,using IRS Form 8332. 2. Your marital status for tax filing is set as of the last day of the year. If you are still married on December 31 ( and you file as of a calendar year, as most people do), you must file as married (either jointl y or separately). If you are divorced as of December 31, you must file single (either as head of household or not). 3. Contact a tax professional if you have further questions or think you may be eligible for other tax credits.Introduction to Family Law in Montana, Page 18 of 18If You or the Other Party Wants to Change a Parenting Plan Later : Dispute Resolution: Look at your Final Parenting Plan to see if there is a section on Dispute Resolution. If you agreed to try mediation before going back to court, you should initiate mediation by following the process described in the plan. If the plandoes not specify who should do the mediation, try to find a mediator who can do themediation for you. Modifying Your Plan through the Court : If you cannot work out your disagreements through mediation, or if your plan does not provide for mediation, you w ill probably need a private attorney to amend your plan through the court. If You Decide to Move: A parent is required to give the other parent 30 days written notice before making any move that will \u0093significantly affect\u0094 the other parent\u0092s contact with the children (M.C.A. \u00a740-4-217). You must give notice by certified mail or personal service, and you must fileproof of service with the court. You must include a proposed revised residentialschedule with the notice. Thirty (30) days notice gives the other par ent time to ask the court to change the residential schedule. If you move to another state with your children without givingwritten notice to the other parent or getting the other parent\u0092s consent, you may becharged with \u0093aggravated visitation interference.\u0094 You could be fined up to $1000 andimprisoned up to 18 months. You may also be held in contempt of court (M.C.A. \u00a7 45-5-632).How to File for Dissolution of Marriage in Montana (with children) Table of Contents 1 .
