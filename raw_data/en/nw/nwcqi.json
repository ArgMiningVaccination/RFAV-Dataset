When indicated, the most accepted treatment for H. pylori eradication in this age group is first-line triple therapy. However, the increasing resistance to clarithromycin and nitroimidazoles has been associated with treatment failure, and thus, alternative treatment regimens have been proposed. To perform a systematic review of randomized controlled trials on treatment regimens for H. pylori infection in children. We surveyed relevant articles published in English from 2010 to April 2020 in the PubMed and MEDLINE databases. Keywords included \"Helicobacter pylori\"/\"children or childhood\"/\"treatment or eradication.\" The risk of bias was evaluated according to the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews for Interventions. Among the 1144 records identified through the database, 20 articles were selected. Four studies compared the eradication rates of H. pylori infection between standard triple therapies, changing only the main antibiotic used. Seven studies evaluated the effectiveness of standard triple therapy with the addition of probiotics. One study investigated the relationship between the effectiveness in the eradication rates of standard triple therapy and vitamin E levels. Six studies analyzed the eradication rates of sequential therapy. The findings suggest that although standard triple therapy is the most recommended regimen for children by the current guidelines, other therapeutic schemes have shown promising results and may also be recommended for clinical practice in the future. a bacterium that infects more than 50% of the population worldwide. In the last several years, no significant changes in the treatment of infected children have been observed, mainly due to a lack of studies with satisfactory scientific evidence to support the indication of therapies in clinical practice. We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials on treatment regimens for H. pylori infection in children. - Citation: da FAF, de Brito BB, Santos Silva J\u00fanior RT, Apolonio JS, de Carvalho LS, Silva CS, de Santos LK, Oliveira MV, Rocha GA, Treatment of Helicobacter pylori spiral bacterium that colonizes the gastric mucosa of more than 50% of the population worldwide. The infection is acquired predominantly in childhood, and is more prevalent in developing countries where about 70% of children are infected until 15-years-old[ [1](#B1), [2](#B2)], whereas it is disappearing in developed countries. Once acquired, the bacterium is rarely eliminated without adequate antibiotic therapy and individuals remain infected throughout life[ [3](#B3)]. Most infected individuals do not develop complications, but gastric colonization can progress to chronic gastritis, duodenal ulcer, gastric adenocarcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and bacterial eradication is associated with the prevention of such diseases[ [4](#B4)]. H. pylori infection has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of extra-gastric diseases, including iron deficiency anemia and chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The mechanisms by which the infection progresses to the above-mentioned diseases are not completely understood and depend on the relationship between host genetics and factors regarding the environment and bacterial virulence. Severe H. pylori-associated diseases are more common in adults than in children. This phenomenon can be explained, in part, by the differences in immune response between the two age groups, which seems to be a relevant factor influencing mucosal damage and clinical outcomes[ [5](#B5)]. In general, H. pylori infection induces a T helper type 1 (Th1)-polarized response with high levels of interferon- that stimulate gastric inflammation and mucosal damage in adults. Moreover, Th17 cells and interleukin (IL)-17 levels are important in that process because they stimulate the recruitment and activation of neutrophils in the gastric mucosa, increasing the inflammatory environment against the bacterium. In contrast to the pro-inflammatory response found in adults, children tend to exhibit an immune response pattern with a predominance of regulatory T cells that contribute to the persistence of the infection and milder clinical manifestations[ [6](#B6), [7](#B7)]. Children tend to have lower levels of Th1- and Th17-related cytokines as well as overexpression of IL-10 and transforming growth factor-, resulting in a lower degree of polymorphonuclear cell activation in the acute phase of infection[ [8](#B8), [9](#B9)] and prominent mononuclear cell infiltration in chronic infection compared with adults[ [10](#B10)]. H. pylori virulence factors also play an important role in the pathogenesis of infection in childhood. It is well documented that genes such as cytotoxin gene A (cagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin gene A (vacA) increase the risk of severe gastric diseases such as duodenal ulcer and gastric cancer[ [11](#B11)]. H. pylori eradication prevents duodenal ulcer recurrence and prevention of gastric cancer. In addition, H. pylori eradication in children induces platelet and iron recovery in immune thrombocytopenic purpura and iron deficiency anemia, respectively. Since eradication therapies show variable failure rates, retesting for H. pylori infection after an antimicrobial regimen is recommended to ensure that patients have been successfully treated[ [12](#B12)]. There are various available therapeutic options aimed toward H. pylori eradication, and clarithromycin-based triple therapy, sequential therapy, bismuth-containing quadruple therapy or triple therapy, and hybrid therapy are the regimens most often used[ [13](#B13)]. Moreover, various alternative approaches have been attempted in order to improve bacterial eradication such as susceptibility-guided therapies, probiotics, and vaccines[ [14](#B14)- [16](#B16)]. In that context, a number of factors influence the choice of appropriate treatment, including antimicrobial susceptibility profile, economic factors, and importantly, individual characteristics such as previous exposure to antibiotics and age[ [17](#B17)]. Performing H. pylori eradication in children demands specific precautions, of which avoiding regimens with unacceptable rates of adverse events (AEs) for this population is very important[ [18](#B18)]. In this context, the number of treatment options usually available for children tends to be significantly lower compared to the range of treatments at hand for adults. Clarithromycin-based triple therapy is the most used therapeutic scheme for children, although other standard therapies have also been tried[ [19](#B19)]. Moreover, to reduce the frequency and severity of side effects as well as to improve eradication rates, probiotics in association with standard therapy have been tested in children[ [20](#B20)]. Therefore, we reviewed the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of treatments for H. pylori eradication children. In this systematic review, the criteria recommended by the PRISMA checklist were used[ [21](#B21)]. Prospective RCTs, published in peer-reviewed journals from 2010 to April 2020 and reporting the results of antibiotic therapy and/or supplementation with other drugs for the H. pylori eradication in infected children under 18-years-old, were included. There was no restriction regarding the therapeutic schemes used. Excluded studies were those including adults or lacking their complete or free full text. Only English language studies were included. The inclusion criteria are outlined in Table [1](#T1). |Criteria||Description| |Date range||January 2010 to trials| H. pylori-positive patients under 18-years-old diagnosed by any validated test accepted by the scientific community for H. pylori detection. Patients who had previous failed antibiotic therapies were included. Prospective RCTs evaluating H. pylori eradication rates in children. We collected outcomes of intention-to-treat (ITT), per protocol (PP), and simple percentages of H. pylori infection eradication. We surveyed the relevant articles published in English language from 2010 to April 2020 in the PubMed and MEDLINE databases. The term strategies used for the search at databases were: ((Helicobacter childhood [and] (treatment [OR] eradication)). The eligibility of the articles was evaluated by two independent reviewers (Da Silva FAF and de Brito BB). Duplicate articles were excluded. The abstracts of the articles were evaluated and studies that were not prospective RCTs and/or did not evaluate H. pylori eradication rate in children were excluded. A third reviewer (de Melo FF) resolved disagreements between the two reviewers. To verify if the articles met all previously established criteria, each article was individually analyzed. To statistically evaluate the agreement between the reviewers, the Kappa coefficient (K) was calculated, which indicated a K = 0.752, considered as a substantially strong degree of agreement between the reviewers. We developed a structured data extraction spreadsheet specifically for this review based on the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews for Interventions[ [42](#B42)]. We independently reviewed the relevant study data and results of interest such as rates of eradication of H. pylori infection in childhood. Information was extracted from each study including: General characteristics of the participants and studies, type of intervention, therapeutic regimen used, type of outcome measure, and positive and negative outcomes. To assess the validity of RCTs, two authors independently analyzed the risk of bias criteria recommended by the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews for Interventions[ [42](#B42)]: Generation of the random sequence, concealment of allocation, blinding of participants and professionals, blinding of outcome evaluators, incomplete outcomes, and reporting of the selective outcome. Then the risk of bias was categorized as high, low, or uncertain. Of the 1144 articles reviewed (861 in NCBI and 283 in MEDLINE), 1118 were excluded using previously established inclusion criteria. Twenty-six articles were selected for complete analysis; however, eight were duplicate and thus were excluded. Finally, 2 studies were an additional reference list and 20 articles were included. Figure [1](#F1) shows the selection and distribution of articles according to the databases searched, from the first search to the application of all of the selection criteria. The characteristics of the 20 selected studies are summarized in Table [2](#T2). A total of 2261 children aged 22 mo to 18 years were included. Regarding the geographic distribution of the studies, 25% of the articles were from Iran; 25% from Turkey; 10% from China; and 40% from Algeria, Italy, Poland, India, Kenya, United States, Belgium, and France. The studies had a follow-up average of 6 wk. In addition, the articles evaluated conventional eradication therapies, probiotics, or sequential therapies as well as the eradication rates of H. pylori infection in pylori-positive children diagnosed by validated methods. Randomization methods and loss of follow-up were highlighted for analysis of the risk of bias. All articles were classified according to the criteria of the Oxford Center for Evidence-based Medicine - Levels of Evidence[ [43](#B43)] (Table [3](#T3)). Standard triple therapy was the main therapeutic scheme evaluated. The studies compared conventional triple therapy alone to triple therapy containing probiotics and to sequential therapies (Table low risk of bias for the following criteria: Generation of the random sequence, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and professionals, and blinding of outcome evaluators. Only the work by Akcam et al[ [24](#B24)] was classified as high risk of bias for generating the random sequence. All other RCTs had an uncertain or low rating for all of the criteria mentioned above. In general, we observed some risks of biases through deviations from the intended interventions, represented by the concealment of how the drugs were distributed and how the researchers made recommendations to the participants. In addition, interaction with a healthcare professional can improve symptoms and treatment adherence, becoming a possible bias for all the analyzed results. In pediatric clinical practice, H. pylori infection is common, especially in developing countries and certain populations such as ethnic minorities and migrant communities living in developed countries. In this systematic review, standard triple therapies, given for 7, 10, or 14 d were compared with sequential, third-line, and quadruple therapies for H. pylori eradication. In addition, some studies evaluated the efficacy of probiotics as adjuvant therapy for triple therapy. Currently, triple therapies recommended by the main guidelines for H. pylori eradication include a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or ranitidine, amoxicillin, and either clarithromycin or metronidazole, considered the first-line regimen, and bismuth, administered for 7, 10, or 14 d[ [45](#B45)]. The desirable target of anti-H. pylori treatment regimens is to reach an eradication rate of at least 90% in the per-protocol analysis whereas antibiotic use eradication rate below 80% is considered unacceptable[ [46](#B46)]. However, few studies have achieved this goal. The low efficacy of triple therapy observed in diverse geographic areas has been attributed to the rising resistance of H. pylori strains to clarithromycin and metronidazole, poor compliance, duration of treatment, and inadequate dosage and number of daily doses. The growing H. pylori resistance is due to the previous exposition of children to these antimicrobials that are overused to treat upper and lower respiratory diseases that are very common in childhood. Eradication rates of standard triple therapies are often below 80% in various regions of the world[ [47](#B47)]. In this study, extremely low eradication rates were observed in China, India, Kenya, and Turkey. The frequency of H. pylori-resistant strains was 16.4%, 75.2%, and 0.06% to clarithromycin, metronidazole, and amoxicillin, respectively, in children from the southeast regions of China[ [48](#B48)]. The resistance to clarithromycin in Turkish children ranges from 9.5% to 27%[ [49](#B49)]. No data are available on clarithromycin resistance in Indian and Kenyan children. Concerning resistance to metronidazole, no data are available on those countries. A trial comparing amoxicillin-based with metronidazole-based triple therapy, by ITT analysis, found that the latter showed a significantly higher eradication rate (68% vs 80%, respectively)[ [22](#B22)]. The 7 and 10 d triple therapy failed to eradicate H. pylori infection in most [34](#B34), [37](#B37)- [39](#B39)]. In rates were less than 60%. Esmaeili-Dooki et al[ [37](#B37)] compared a triple therapy consisting of azithromycin once daily plus amoxicillin and omeprazole given twice daily for 6 d with clarithromycin in association with amoxicillin and omeprazole twice daily for 10 d. Based on the ITT analysis, the eradication rates in the azithromycin and clarithromycin groups were 56.2% and 62.5%, respectively (P 0.40)[ AEs were in the omeprazole, and 3.1% in the omeprazole, azithromycin, and amoxicillin group (P = 0.19). Per protocol, the eradication rate was 61.9% in the azithromycin group and 69% in the clarithromycin group (P = 0.431). High resistance of H. pylori to clarithromycin and metronidazole, poor compliance, and a short duration of treatment may explain these findings, in part. European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and North American Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, and Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines recommend when antimicrobials susceptibility profiles are either unknown or H. pylori is susceptible to clarithromycin or metronidazole, a high-dose triple therapy with PPI, amoxicillin and triple for 14 d or bismuth-base quadruple therapy. In this review, the effectiveness of a triple therapy for 14 d was evaluated in eight studies. Eradication rate superior to 80% was observed in two of them[ [29](#B29), [40](#B40)]. Kasiri et al[ [29](#B29)] did not observe a significant difference in the eradication rate between 14 d amoxicillin-based (87.2%) and for metronidazole-based triple therapy (92.5%) in Iranian children. A study from Vietnam, triple therapy consisting of lansoprazole amoxicillin and either clarithromycin or metronidazole (LAM) therapy given once or twice daily for 14 d were compared[ [40](#B40)]. Eradication success was associated with the strain susceptibility to clarithromycin (78.2% vs 29.3%, P = 0.0001). PPI and clarithromycin given twice daily was superior to once-daily dosage for resistant strains (50.0% vs 14.7%, P = 0.004) and tended to be effective so also for sensitive strains (87.5% vs 65.2%, P = 0.051). The differences were less pronounced with LAM when PPI was given twice daily in comparison with PPI once a day (69.2% vs 50.0%, P = 0.096). The reported resistance metronidazole, and amoxicillin was 50.9%, 65.3%, and 0.5%, respectively. The authors found that resistance to clarithromycin was an important cause for treatment failure[ [40](#B40)]. Higher doses of PPI improve the success of eradication rate of clarithromycin and amoxicillin based-therapy[ [46](#B46)]. Moreover, younger children need a higher PPI dose per kg of bodyweight compared to adolescents and adults to obtain sufficient acid suppression[ [46](#B46)]. Eradication rate with triple therapy for 14 d ranged from 46% to 76.4% in five studies[ [24](#B24), [25](#B25), [31](#B31), a third-line therapy. Farahmand et al[ [26](#B26)] compared a regimen consisting of ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, and omeprazole, third-line therapy, with the standard triple therapy, amoxicillin, and omeprazole twice a day plus furazolidone once a day. Both regimens given for 1 wk reported that the eradication rate was significantly higher (P = 0.011) in the group treated with ciprofloxacin (87.9%) than in that receiving furazolidone (60.6%)[ [32](#B32)]. Probiotics have been proposed as an adjuvant to triple therapy to improve the efficacy and diminish AEs in both children and adults. Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting are the most frequent side effects of eradication therapy and are an important cause of poor compliance and treatment failure. Several studies did not show an increase in the eradication rate when triple therapy was supplemented with probiotics[ [23](#B23), [24](#B24), [25](#B25), [33](#B33)], by contrast, an increase in the H. pylori eradication rate was observed by others[ [27](#B27), [28](#B28), [35](#B35)]. Although the beneficial effects of probiotics depend on the strains of the microorganisms selected, more robust studies and meta-analyses on this issue should be performed to clarify these discrepant results[ [50](#B50)]. Of note, some studies demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in adverse gastrointestinal effects during the treatment[ [25](#B25), [27](#B27), [28](#B28), [35](#B35)]. This result was also observed in a meta-analysis using multiple strains to eradicate H. pylori and prevent AEs, in children and adults[ [51](#B51)]. Another meta-analysis observed that the addition of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Saccharomyces to standard triple therapy improved medication tolerance and patient compliance due to the decrease in side effects, both in children and adults[ [52](#B52)]. In the studies included in this review, commercial probiotics were used; however, the use in clinical practice is not economically accessible for many countries with high prevalence rates of H. pylori. T\u00fcmg\u00f6r et al[ [31](#B31)] evaluated the use of vitamin E with clarithromycin-based triple therapy in children and found no statistically significant difference between its eradication rate and triple therapy alone. Although the addition of antioxidant vitamins in the eradication treatments has been evaluated[ [53](#B53), [54](#B54)], no statistically significant differences were observed. It is important to highlight that the available studies on this therapeutic alternative have a small sample size and to moderate methodological design[ [53](#B53)]. Sequential therapy has been related to high H. pylori eradication rates[ [47](#B47)], and some articles included here corroborated this, showing success rates of 91.3%, 81.4%, and 84.6%, whereas the effectiveness of standard triple therapy ranged from 48.8% to 78.2%[ [30](#B30), [34](#B34), [38](#B38)]. However, two studies did not observe a statistically significant increase in eradication rates when this regimen was used[ [32](#B32), [36](#B36)]. A meta-analysis that evaluated sequential therapy compared to triple therapy in 13 RCTs also found a higher rate of H. pylori eradication in children when using sequential therapy, in accordance with the results of the articles analyzed in this review[ [55](#B55)]. Although it is a therapeutic regimen with encouraging rates of H. pylori eradication, more robust studies are necessary to prove its effectiveness and safety to substitute triple therapy in high clarithromycin and/or nitroimidazole resistance settings[ [56](#B56)]. This study had some limitations due to the small number of available studies evaluating each therapeutic regimen in children. The quality of included studies, the great diversity of treatment regimens, and the duration of treatment, doses, and administration frequency of the drugs as well as lack of antimicrobial susceptibility tests limit the comparison of the results. Most studies had an uncertain degree of bias for concealing the processes of allocation of patients as well as the blinding of participants, professionals, and outcome evaluators. In summary, the eradication rate associated with current treatments is not satisfactory in many geographical areas. Unfortunately, many of the published works on H. pylori eradication in children have weaknesses in their methods and do not meet the ideal scientific criteria to be indicated in practice. It has to be emphasized that, because H. pylori is disappearing in developed, studies investigating H. pylori treatment are scarce in adults and children. Otherwise, a number of countries that have a high prevalence of H. pylori infection face difficulties in conducting research with a good level of evidence due to the lack of structural and financial supports. Finally, the studies were limited to a few countries (n = 10), and good results observed in some studies may not work well in other geographical areas. In conclusion, although some studies support the use of new therapeutic regimens in the treatment of H. pylori infection in children, more methodologically reliable prospective studies evaluating the most promising new therapeutic regimens are needed to assess the applicability of these treatments in pediatric clinical practice. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative microaerophilic bacterium that infects the gastric epithelium and whose acquisition occurs mainly during childhood. In the last several years, no significant changes in the treatment of infected children have been observed, mainly due to the lack of studies with satisfactory scientific evidence to support the indication of new therapies in clinical practice. This systematic review evaluated the eradication rates of H. pylori infection using various therapeutic regimens and their positive and negative outcomes in pediatric patients. Standard triple therapy for the eradication of H. pylori infection has been used as first-line treatment in children worldwide. However, the effectiveness of standard triple therapy in eradicating H. pylori is decreasing in various geographical areas as a consequence of increasing bacterial resistance to clarithromycin and nitroimidazoles. To compare the eradication rates of H. pylori infection in childhood in controlled, randomized, and prospective studies evaluating different therapeutic schemes during the last 10 years. We systematically reviewed in PubMed and MEDLINE relevant publications from 2010 to April 2020. Twenty studies were shortlisted. This systematic review uses guidance from the PRISMA checklist. The results were quite heterogeneous. Standard triple therapy is still the most used regimen and its eradication rates vary according to the H. pylori susceptibility profiles in different world regions. The addition of probiotics to therapeutic schemes shows discrepant results in eradication rate, but decrease the incidence of side effects and increases the treatment adherence. Sequential therapy has been associated with higher eradication rates than triple therapies and is a promising therapeutic regimen for this population. Currently, standard triple therapy is the most recommended H. pylori eradication regimen for children worldwide. However, other therapeutic schemes have shown promising results in controlled trials and in a near future may be included in the guidelines recommendations. There are still few studies with satisfactory evidence levels evaluating the eradication of H. pylori infection in children, mainly due to the difficulties to conduct controlled clinical trials as well as to the low availability of sources for research in many developing countries where the prevalence of H. pylori infection remain elevated. Well-designed studies evaluating treatments for H. pylori eradication in children are needed to further evaluate new therapeutic options in pediatric clinical practice in high bacterial resistance settings.
