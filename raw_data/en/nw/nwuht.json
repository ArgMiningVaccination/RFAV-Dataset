Scope: Studied in a Scottish GP population, the overall seroresponse rate increased with annual influenza vaccinations and after 5 years it increased from 45.1% to 93.3% for influenza virus A (H1) and from 48.4% to98.3% for influenza virus A (H3). However, there was little boosting effect with further doses after becominga seroresponder. The pre-vaccination titres were signicantly higher in previous year's seroresponderscompared to non-responders.Conclusions: The policy of annual vaccination is supported by our data in order to increase the disappoint- ing response rate after one dose. However, the lack of a boosting response with subsequent doses andthe signicant residual immunity after becoming a seroresponder suggests a prior serological immunitycheck in order to better direct the vaccine supply (in the years of no antigenic drift), to those who need itmost. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction Outbreaks of influenza are associated with substantial adverse effects, including time lost from work or school, pneumonia andhospitalisation, especially among the at-risk group [1]. Epidemics of influenza typically occur during the winter months and areresponsible for an average of approximately 12,000 deaths peryear in England and Wales [2]and 20,000 deaths per year in the United States [3]. Rates of infection are highest among children, but rates of serious illness and death are highest among personsaged > 65 years and persons of any age who have medical conditionsthat place them at increased risk for complications from influenza[4,5] . Influenza vaccination is the primary method for preventing influenza and its severe complications. Vaccination has been shownto be associated with reductions in influenza-related respiratoryillness, physician visits among all age groups, hospitalisation anddeath among persons at high risk [6,7] . Active immunisation with inactivated vaccines against influenza virus types A and B is recom-mended, to be repeated annually, to deal with antigenic drift of thevirus and the decrease of antibody levels with time. This policy has Corresponding author at: West of Sctoland Specialist Virology Centre, Gartnavel General Hospital, Great Western Road, Glasgow G12 0ZA, UK.

Sivaprakasam).been challenged by evidence of a decrease in post-vaccination titres of persons who had been previously vaccinated with influenzavaccine [8-10] . Although the methods of these studies have been criticized [11] and the results not conrmed in some other studies [12,13] , the efcacy of annual influenza vaccination for the elderly continues to be debated. A recent Cochrane analysis of the litera-ture has seriously questioned the quantum and credibility of theevidence, which underpins the mammoth effort of annual vaccina-tion [14] . This is largely because of conflicting reports of response to annual influenza vaccine in the literature [15-18] . Studies from a pharmacoeconomic point of view are, however, quite encourag-ing with regards to the potential benets of influenza vaccinationin the elderly [19-21] . Here, we have studied serial vaccination over 5 years in a real-life settin g-ag eneral practice - in order to understand whether the current policy is supported by serologicalresponses using stringent denitions. We suggest ways by whichannual vaccine delivery problems may be abated. We have asked 6research questions and provide the results for each question. 2. Materials and method We recruited 750 subjects attending a Scottish General Practice which included at-risk groups with heart disease, respiratory dis-ease, renal disease and diabetes. Influenza vaccination was offeredfor 5 years, from 1997 to 2002 (except 1998). Research funding dif-culties forced us to restrain from data collection for the year 1998. 0264-410X/$ - see front matter \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Sivaprakasam et al. / Vaccine 26 (2008) 3772-3777 3773 Table 1 Number of vaccinations every year and vaccine strains for that year Year Numbers Vaccinated for the given year Influenza vaccine strains H1N1 H3N2 of vaccinations included fresh recruits for every year plus subjects who have had previous one or more years of vaccine. Each year a number of control populations were recruited, but not vaccinated. These served as controls for the validity of the labora-tory assay. Not all, but many received vaccination for more than1 year, either sequentially or with interruptions of one or moreyears, during the study period. The total number of vaccinationsgiven for every year (which included subjects who were rst timevaccines for that year and subjects who had previous one or moreyears of vaccination), and the vaccine strain used for that year areshown in Table 1 . The GP surgery faced manifold practical prob- lems in maintaining a continued participation of the same subjectsduring every year (despite home visits for house bound patients)such as: adverse reactions to vaccines which were both real andimagined despite robust health education, change in health status,death, failure to attend for second sample despite two reminders,long overseas winter holidays and change of mind. This shows theproblems in providing annual vaccination to all at-risk. However68 subjects attended the full 5 years of vaccination. The number ofyears of vaccinations received by the subjects as against the numberof years of follow-up is shown in Table 2 . The disproportionate num- ber of years of follow-up and years of vaccinations further reiteratesthe aforementioned GP surgery's practical problems. We collected paired serum samples from all the subjects just before, and 4-6 weeks after influenza vaccination. The sampleswere stored at 20 C until tested. Data on clinical history, previous immunisations, co-morbid conditions and deaths were recordedwhere available. The serum samples were examined for antibod-ies to flu vaccination by performing a standard haemagglutinationinhibition test (HAI). All assays were done at the same time. Anti-body response was measured each year to the individual vaccinereference strain (H3N2, H1N1 & B). Influenza viral antigens andturkey erythrocytes were obtained from The National Institute forBiological Standards and Controls (NIBSC). The subjects who hada four-fold increase of HAI antibody titre in the post-vaccinationsample as compared to the pre-vaccination sample were dened asseroresponders. Those who did not were dened as non-respondersirrespective of the absolute titre. This is standard diagnostic virolog-ical practice. The serological response to the different componentsof the vaccine were recorded and compared between the two agegroups (<65 years old - juniors and >65 years old - seniors). All thedata were entered in an Access database and analysed using Stata9.0. The seroresponse rates are presented here as percentages.

Research question 1 What is the seroresponse rate to influenza vaccine in the above and below 65 age groups? 2.1.1. Method The sero-resoponse rate for the rst time vaccinees for each year was calculated for the 3 strains of the influenza vaccine for the 2age groups (above and below 65). 2.2. Research question 2 Does the post-vaccination geometric mean titre of serorespon- ders go up with increasing number of years of vaccination? 2.2.1. Method To answer this, we identied the rst-time seroresponders for all the years of the study. We then looked into their post-vaccinationtitres in the following years of vaccination where available. We thencalculated their mean (geometric) values and presented the data asgeometric mean values on a logarithmic scale. 2.3. Research question 3 Do further yearly vaccinations seroconvert non-responders; if so, after how many? 2.3.1. Method To look for this information, we removed all the rst-time seroresponders for the 5 years of the study from the analysis. Fromthe remaining list we continued to remove the seroresponders aftersecond, third, fourth or fth subsequent years of vaccination, basedon the subjects' participation in the study. This provided us with thenumber of subjects that remained non-responders despite 2, 3, 4or 5 years of vaccination. 2.4. Research question 4 Do smoking and co-morbid conditions like diabetes and heart disease have an effect on the seroresponse to influenza vaccinationin the two age groups? 2.4.1. Method We used logistic regression analysis to identify the characteris- tics of persistent non-responders. Age (coded as 0 for below 65,and 1 for 65+ years) and smoking status (coded as 0 for neversmokers, 1 for current and 2 for ex-smokers) at the last follow-up, co-morbid conditions at the time of recruitment were included.Characteristics with p-values less than 0.2 in the univariate analysis3774 V.

Independent effects of model variables were considered reliable only if the signi-cance of the pair-wise interaction between variables was not below0.10. 2.5. Research question 5 What proportion of seroresponders would have residual immu- nity at the time of the next year's vaccination? 2.5.1. Method We rst identied all those seroresponders who had a previ- ous year influenza vaccination and compared their pre-vaccinationantibody titre to those who had not. We restricted this analysis tothe H3 strain, which is the most immunogenic. 2.6. Research question 6 Does the conclusion of any of these analyses change for the age group below and above 70 years of age. 2.6.1. Method All the above analyses were performed for the age-group above and below 70.3. Results 3.1. Research question 1. General response to vaccination The overall percentage of seroresponders to the different com- ponents of the influenza vaccine among rst time vaccinees foreach year is shown in Fig. 1 . It ranged from 13% to 72% and showed variations not only in the different years but also inthe different age groups and the different vaccine strains. Theperformance of H3 was generally better than the other strainswith a seroresponse rate reaching 72% in the juniors in 2000and around 50% for the rest of the years barring 1999 when theresponse was around 40%. The seroresponse to the B strain wasgenerally poor with a maximum of 53% in 1999. None of the con-trols included in the study showed serconversion for any of theyears. 3.2. Research question 2. Seroresponse of vaccine experienced subjects There was generally a uniform drop (albeit usually only reach- ing the \"protective level\" of 1:40) in the post-vaccination titre values previous responders after subsequent vac-cinations ( Fig. 2 ). This is quite unlike vaccination against other Fig. 2. The post-vaccination titres of rst-time responders in the following years of vaccination.

Of the three vaccine virus types, influenza Bagain appears to elicit the least response and H3 strain appears tobe the most immunogenic. 3.3. Research question 3. Status of non-responders There was a signicant reduction in the number of non- responders with increasing numbers of years of vaccination forall the 3 strains of the vaccine ( Table 3 ). The seroconversion rate of previous to 83.2% for H1, 89.2% forH3 and 75.5% for B after 3 years of individual vaccinations. After 5years, it increased to 93.3% for H1 and 98.3% for H3. The diminishingodds ratio of all the non-responders to vaccination with increasingnumbers of vaccination is maintained in all the three strains of thevaccine ( Table 3 ). 3.4. Research question 4. Smoking and co-morbid conditions There was no statistically signicant correlation between smok- ing and the chances of being a non-responder to influenzavaccination during the univariate analysis not shown here.However, there is a weak association for co-morbid condi-tions such as diabetes as shown in the multivariate analysis inTable 3 . 3.5. Research question 5. Pre-vaccination immunity in sero-responders The pre-vaccination titres of those who have had previous year's vaccination was 1:40 in 44%, as compared to 14% in those with no history of previous year's vaccination as shown inFig. 3 .

Sero-response and age There was no statistically signicant difference in the results of the analysis between age groups 'above and below 65 years' and'above and below 70 years'. 4. Discussion There is undisputed evidence in the literature that influenza vaccination protects the vulnerable at-risk population fromthe untoward complications of influenza. An American studyconducted by Barker et al. demonstrated 72% reduction in hos-pitalisation and 87% reduction in mortality during the 1972-1973epidemic caused by A/England/72(H 3N2)[22] . A large case-control study involving 12,784 people above 65 years of age residing in 149long time care facilities in Urban Japan, during 1998-1999 influenzaepidemic season, demonstrated that influenza vaccination dur-ing an epidemic signicantly reduced morbidity and mortality innursing homes for the elderly [23] . A meta analysis of 20 cohort observational studies, 3 case-control studies and 2 cost effectivestudies, concluded that flu vaccination reduces the risk of pneu-monia, hospitalisation and death in elderly persons. It was alsoshown to provide important cost savings per year per vaccinatedperson [7]. However, a recent Cochrane analysis of the literature has seriously questioned the quantum and credibility of the evidences,which backed the mammoth effort of vaccination [14] . Another review of similar nature conducted by the same authors concludedthat while having a signicant impact in the reduction of infec-tion and infection-related complications in the residential elderlypopulation, the usefulness of annual influenza vaccinations, for thesame group in the community were only of a modest nature [24] . Annual influenza vaccination for at-risk groups is an established health protection policy in the UK with a consensus of evidencethat it reduces mortality and morbidity. However this evidence isweakened by the lack of accurate diagnosis of influenza in manystudies and the understanding that many different viruses con-tribute to the burden of \"influenza like illness\" on the NHS duringthe winter season. The WHO and vaccine manufacturers anticipatecirculating influenza strains to generate the best annual vaccineconguration. There have been no long-term follow-up studies inUK general practice populations with repeated vaccinations. How-ever, there have been previous studies, which have looked into theprotective value of annual and sequential influenza vaccinationsboth directly in terms of morbidity and mortality and indirectlyby studying the antibody response. However the policy of annualand sequential influenza vaccination to the targeted vulnerablegroup has always been a topic of continued dispute and debate.Hoskins and associates reported that during an influenza outbreakin a group of resident adolescent boys in a boarding school, the3776 V. Sivaprakasam et al. / Vaccine 26 (2008) 3772-3777 clinical attack rate was higher in students who had also been vacci- nated in previous years, than it was among students who receivedonly the current year influenza vaccination [10] . Their ndings have been disputed on the basis of misinterpreted statistics and a poormatch between the vaccine and circulating virus strains. Gross etal., in their study with 139 young healthy adults, observed that hav-ing received influenza vaccine in the past appears to have had asignicant effect on the ability of healthy young adults to mounta response to current vaccine [25] . However, signicantly fewer adults developed a presumably protective level of serum antibodyto a new strain when they had been previously vaccinated. Keitelet al. in a placebo controlled evaluation study between 1983 and1988 in a healthy middle aged group, observed that annual vac-cination was associated with a substantial reduction in influenzainfection and viral shedding than those who had single vaccinations[26] . A Dutch study, which looked into the HAI antibody response to annually repeated influenza vaccination 1990-1993, concludedthat annually repeated vaccination contributes to a better antibody-response in the elderly [27] . The uniqueness of our study is the fact that we studied the performance of non-responders to annual influenza vaccination inelderly persons in relation to increasing years of vaccination. Inour study, the seroconversion rates after 1 year of vaccination weredisappointing as described previously; the immunogenicity of H3was best, followed by H1 and B strains ( Fig. 1 ). Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the likelihood of remaininga non-responder decreased until reaching a residue of 6% after 5years ( Table 3 ). Analysis of H1 strain serology results shows that seniors are less likely to be persistent non-responders as comparedto juniors. The association between age and seroconversion, whilebeing statistically signicant for H1, showed only week evidencefor the other strains. Similarly, a suggestive evidence of associa-tion between diabetes and seroconversion shown in B strain hasnot been seen in the other strains. Although the seniors are slightlymore likely to be vaccinated for more number of years, multivariateanalysis does adjust for this disparity and still results in a marginallysignicant age effect. As this is not the case for H3 and B strains, thisis unlikely to be clinically signicant. This aspect clearly supportsthe policy of yearly vaccination, but only for initial non-responders. Another interesting observation was that the seroresponse showed no difference whether compared above and below 65or above and below 70, implying that age does not matter forany vaccination policy as long as one remains relatively healthy.Although annual vaccination effectively reduces the number ofnon-responders, so supporting national policy, this was mitigatedby responders being unlikely to generate the same 'four-fold sero-logical response' after vaccination in subsequent years. This ledto a question as to whether responders need annual vaccination.Further, the pre-vaccination titres of those responders who hada vaccine dose the previous year was found to be 1:40 (which is considered as the threshold of seroprotection in terms of clini-cal effectiveness) in up to 44%. This would only apply if there hadbeen no signicant antigenic drift. It would be benecial to theannual influenza vaccination campaign if not everyone had to bevaccinated as there is often a shortage or late supply of vaccine. Further, as shown here, there is a substantial non-appearance year to year of eligible persons, implying that a lot of energy isexpended on getting people to come in for vaccine when they maynot need it. The only way, based on our current knowledge, to selectthe group who most need vaccination would be to deploy a cheap,easy to perform near patient test to detect the presence of anti-bodies to influenza vaccine by trained persons at the vaccinationcentre itself. Such an immunity check could be performed in aleisurely fashion during the summer months prior to the wintervaccine campaigns. This would allow better targeting of prioritygroups. Although the type of test that could be deployed is beyond the scope of this study, an immunochromatographic antibody testis worth consideration. Whether the cost of deploying this wouldoutweigh the marginal cost per patient of delivering the vaccine isunknown but would need to be considered in the light of the pres-sure on practices to vaccinate substantial numbers of people in ashort time once vaccine is available and the problems of insuf-cient vaccine supply with the worry this generates in the at-risk. Asimilar post-vaccination immunity check after vaccination wouldfurther identify the residual 6% who never seroconvert and wouldneed special protection during influenza epidemics from anti viraldrugs. The weakness in our study is the exclusion of 1998 from the study for reasons mentioned earlier. How this would affect theoverall study results is not known. 5. Conclusion What is already known on this topic? 1 . Influenza vaccination is known to reduce the morbidity and mortality of the at-risk population. 2. Annual vaccination is recommended to the at-risk popula- tion by government. 3. A recent Cochrane review has questioned the gap between policy and evidence for influenza vaccine (Ref. [14] ). What this study adds: 1 . Given at least 3 doses of vaccine, non-responders could be reduced to 10-15% and 6% after 5 doses with no antigenicdrift. 2. Background immunity could be ascertained in the summer during years of no antigenic drift to improve vaccine supplyand management during the annual vaccination campaign.
