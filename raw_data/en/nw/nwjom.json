Introduction The use of allopathic medicine, which is based on the biomedical model, provides many powerful lifesaving treatments to patients. The allopathic approach considers the individual as a biological machine, defines health as the absence of illness or disease, and emphasizes that the role of clinical diagnosis and intervention and the purpose of treatment are to achieve and maintain the physiological parameters within the established normal levels. However, this model fails to prevent diseases and evidently leads to continuously increasing rates chronic diseases and conditions worldwide. In the United States, nearly 1 in 2 Americans (133 million) has at least one chronic medical condition, affecting most individuals (58%) in this population between ages 18 and 64 years [1]. This number is projected to increase by more than 1% per year by 2030, resulting in a chronically ill population of an estimated 171 million people [1].There is a growing awareness that conventional treatments may be too harsh to use for treatment of chronic and non-life-threaten diseases. Moreover, concerns about adverse reactions to treatment and the escalating costs of conventional health care are fueling the search for alternative approaches to the prevention and management of illness [2,3]. Although the impact of stress on human health is widely recognized, conventional medicine has not effectively addressed the mental, emotional, and spiritual needs of individuals. Stress Exposure to chronic stress is considered extremely toxic because it is most likely to result in long-term or permanent changes of the emotional, physiological, and behavioral responses that influence an individual's susceptibility to disease and the course of disease [4- 5]. Acceptance of the fact that stress is linked to physical diseases or to other health problems has become commonplace. Research has shown many reciprocal links between the experience of stress and several body systems: the central nervous system, which ABSTRACT In the biomedical model, an individual' s mental, emotional, and spiritual needs are gravely neglected, and these aspects are partially addressed in nonconventional and alternative medicine. Unified integrative medicine is a system of medicine that focuses on the integration of body, psyche, and soul and considers the direct influence of emotional, mental, social, spiritual, and behavioral health factors. In this approach, health is a state of harmony and resonance between the magnetic fields of the soul and the physical body in which the defense system is able to cope with internal or external stimuli to maintain a state of homeostasis. In such a state, all cells, organs and the whole body pass rhythmically through the four life phases: excitation, expansion, contraction, and relaxation, each with its pace. In contrast, disease is a state of dissonance between the magnetic fields of the soul and the physical body in which the defense system fails to maintain a state of resonance. Energy-emotional washout is a technique to restore resonance by resolving the psychological conflict that led to energy blockage and caused dissonance. The technique is focused on renewing the flow of vital energy within the defense system as well as restoring the four phases of life and the state of homeostasis required to maintain the state of well-being and 08 October 2020Volume 3 | Issue 3 | 2 of 9 Int J Psychiatr Res, 2020recognizes and records experiences; the endocrine system, which produces hormones that govern many body functions; and the immune system, which organizes responses to infections and other challenges [6]. Ample evidence shows that adults who experience long-term stressors also experience high rates of adjustment difficulties and important biologic effects, such as persistent downregulation of elements of the immune system and other adverse health outcomes, such as higher rates of cardiovascular disease, respiratory tract infections, and cancer. Psychosocial Factors and Mind-Body Medicine It has long been recognized that specific behaviors are associated with increased risk of specific diseases and related conditions. Research has documented the importance of recognizing the association between socioeconomic status and health, as well as the influence of social networks, current or anticipated employment status, and personal beliefs on health, and also describes some of the mechanisms involved [7,8]. In addition, psychosocial interventions have been shown to improve the quality of life of patients with established disease and seem to influence biological processes that are thought to ameliorate disease progression [9]. Furthermore, scientific evidence for and mainstream applications of cognitive behavioral therapy are sufficient to support its use to address bodily functions and symptoms [10]. Mind-body medicine focuses on the interactions among the mind, body, and behavior and the powerful ways in which emotional, mental, social, spiritual, and behavioral factors can directly affect health. This approach to medicine emphasizes the role of the mind over the body and enhances each person's capacity for self- knowledge and self-care, as well as techniques that are grounded in this type of healing. Mind-body interventions such as yoga, tai chi, and Pilates [11,12] are health and fitness practices that focus on the interactions among brain, body, and behavior with the intent of using the mind to alter physical function and promote overall health and well-being on both the physical and mental levels [13,14]. Breathwork Classified as a mind-body, complementary health practice [15], breathwork has achieved a degree of recognition as a form of psychotherapy in Europe, particularly to treat depression and anxiety. One study examined the effectiveness of a standardized 10- session intervention of breathwork with 12 patients with depressions and anxiety based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , third edition, revised (DSM IIIR). Symptom change was assessed pre- and post-treatment and at 8-week follow-up, with 10 of 12 participants achieving clinically significant improvements, which were maintained at follow-up [16]. This technique involves therapists guiding patients throughout the session to maintain a continuous uninterrupted breathing rhythm with no pauses between the transitions between exhalation and inhalation, in which inhalation was actively performed to include expansion of the upper chest [17,18]. Electromagnetism It is well known that the human body emits low-level light, heat, and acoustic energy and has electrical and magnetic properties. Energy medicine is a domain in complementary and alternative medicine that deals with these energy fields. Many schools of energy healing exist, using various names, such as biofield energy healing [19,20], spiritual healing [21], contact healing, distant healing, qi do, therapeutic touch [22], reiki [23], or qigong [20]. Modern researchers have confirmed that every event in the body, either normal or pathological, produces electrical changes and thus alterations of the magnetic field in the spaces around the body [24]. Additional research has shown that viral and bacterial infections, as well as cancer, affect the ionic conduction, water content, and pH values of the extra cellular fluids, thereby affecting cell membrane potentials and tissue conductance [25]. Understanding the biophysical mechanism enables the discerning therapist to sense and manipulate energy fields to benefit the patient. The biofield energy concepts are well known under different names, such as chi in Chinese medicine, prana in traditional Indian medicine, and doshas in Ayurvedic medicine [26]. A complex, dynamic, and weak energy field is also involved in maintaining the integrity of the whole organism, regulating its physiological and biochemical responses, and is integral to development, healing, and regeneration [27,28]. These energies guide genetic, metabolic, physiological, and psychological functions. Overall these forces constitute the biofield, which corresponds to a life force [29]. Modern technologies allow measurement of the energy claimed by ancient cultures, such as the meridians in traditional Chinese medicine. Many scientists have tested the electrical resistance of acupuncture pathways and have correlated their conductance with specific pathological problems. Disturbances of the conductance at the acupuncture points could indicate dysfunction in the corresponding organs related to the Chinese meridians [30,31]. Weiss et al. reported that electrical potentials on the skin surface can be used for the differential diagnosis of breast lesions [32]. Benggeli and Weinstein demonstrated that cancer cells have lower membrane potentials compared with normal cells [33]. Cuzick et al. reported the results of clinical trials for a method of detecting breast cancer using electrode potential measurements of the skin [34,35]. Energy Fields Discoveries in quantum physics led to the development of instruments that can map the energy fields of the human body with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy. An instrument developed by James Edward Zimmerman and colleagues in 1970\u2014the superconducting quantum interference device, or SQUID\u2014is a highly sensitive magnetometer used to detect biomagnetic fields around the human body. Use of this device allows determination of the way in which the diseases alter the biomagnetic fields around the body. In other research, Cohen et al. described the heart's magnetic field and laid the foundation for a new field of diagnosis using the magnetocardiogram [36] and magnetoencephalography [37]. Therapists from various schools of energy medicine use their hands as a source of energy to re-establish energetic flow in the body. Research has documented that energy projected from the hands has similar frequencies and intensities of the pulsating Volume 3 | Issue 3 | 3 of 9 Int J Psychiatr Res, 2020magnetic field to that which is projected from electromagnetic devices. In fact, the scientific studies of John Zimmerman on therapeutic touch using the SQUID magnetometer detected a large biomagnetic field emanating from the practitioner's hands [38] Furthermore, Seto et al. [39] confirmed that an extraordinarily large biomagnetic field emanates from the hands of practitioners using a variety of healing and martial arts techniques, such as qigong, yoga, meditation, and Zen practices. The pulsating magnetic field is the common denominator between the electromagnetic devices and the practitioners' hands. Research has documented that these different approaches are efficacious for the individual to be healed. Biofield therapies are widely used by the public and by certain patient populations. Patient populations for whom the use biofield energy therapies is often reported include those with cancer and those receiving palliative care [40,41]. The major benefits associated with biofield interventions are the opportunity to intervene intensively and specifically tailor interventions to the needs of the individual patient. In addition, patients who are receiving these therapies are also likely to benefit from the social support provided by the group members of their disease and treatment poplaution [41]. As a final point for biofield energy therapies, medical research is now demonstrating that the use of devices producing a pulsing magnetic field at extra-low frequencies is beneficial for immune system modulation, as well as for tissue regeneration [43,44]. An Integrated Model and the Ideal Therapeutic System Most of this vital information remains unnoticed within mainstream medicine; therefore, an unmet need exists for a new model that combines different therapies from different systems and cultures\u2014 an approach that is able to integrate mind-body medicine, energy medicine, biofield energy therapies, behavior interventions within one model; to recognize the link between stress and health, and to understand the specific correlation between psychological conflicts, traumas, energy blockages, and organic diseases. The medical community and clinicians in these fields need to offer patients an integrated approach, taking into account their individual conditions, their interactions with their environment, their unique genetic composition, and their manifestations of their deep meaning of life. The ideal therapeutic system should be based on a systemic model in which multiple biological, psychological, social, and spiritual factors are seen as interlinked. Such a model should be effective to return the individual to a state of well-being with minimal costs. This ideal approach would be able to restore the vital flow of energy, enhance the biological constitution for strength, and increase the ability of the individual to realize projects according to individual's life path, thereby providing a sense of fulfillment and happiness. An effective therapeutic system will produce solid, reliable, and verifiable results, and should be simple and readily accessible to all members of the population. Energy Washout as a Novel Approach In this article, a new therapeutic technique called energy- emotional washout or energy washout (EWO) is presented, and is based on integrated model described in research recently published in different journals [29,46,50,51]. The basic model considers the humankind as the manifestation of the integration between body, psyche, and soul. The soul is defined as the energy and the information that animates the physical body. Meridians and chakras are a part of the magnetic fields, and these pathways are influenced by the psychological conflicts and traumas that can cause energy blockages. With the use of EWO, blocked energy pathways in the meridians and chakras are reopened, resolving the psychological causes of blockage and completing the psychological learning process to enable intellectual growth and spiritual evolution, ultimately resulting in the restoration of homeostasis and enhancing vitality to prevent the development of disease and to better manage chronic diseases. The term vitality means the state of being full of life and energy, which manifests as exuberant physical, mental, and emotional strength that provides the capacity for survival and the power giving continuance of life. The final aspect of this therapy is to obtain complete physical, psychological, spiritual, and social well-being by reducing stress and increasing vitality. Unified Integrative Medicine: A New Model for Changing Paradigm A challenge for the general incorporation of EWO therapy into conventional clinical care is the limited understanding of the mechanisms of these therapies within the biomedical paradigm. Unified integrative medicine is an approach to medicine that looks at the human body systems not as independent units but instead as part of an integrated whole, incorporating biochemical, physiological, and environmental interactions. Systems medicine draws on systems science and systems biology, and considers the complex interactions within the human body in light of a patient's genomics, behavior, and environment [45]. Unified integrative medicine is a new model that unifies allopathic medicine with mind-body medicine, with energy medicine, and with psychology and spirituality based on a systemic model. Moreover, it considers the interconnectedness of physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects, it recognizes that a human being exists as an integration between body, psyche, and soul; and it emphasizes the need to achieve the state of well- being. The definition of this state relies on the definition of health , according to the World Health Organization (WHO) as follows: \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\" (Preamble to the Constitution of WHO as adopted by the International Health Conference, New York, 1946). It is widely accepted that subjective well-being varies greatly between individuals; however, for the purposes of this article, well-being is defined as a state of mind in which a person has a sense of meaning and purpose and feels able to pursue self-defined aspirations with a sense of love, happiness, and freedom [46] To reach a state of well-being, an individual must be able to identify and realize personal aspirations, satisfy individual needs, and Volume 3 | Issue 3 | 4 of 9 Int J Psychiatr Res, 2020change or cope with the environment as needed [47]. Elements of well-being include a sense of balance in emotion, thoughts, social relationships, and pursuits, or the lack thereof. The relative importance of each construct will vary across subpopulations and developmental stages. Unified integrative medicine considers the uniqueness of each person related to all aspects of life and the individual's biology, personality, culture, background, religion, and spirituality beliefs. This model allows redefinition of the purpose of one's life as well as the usefulness of difficulties in life that cause conflicts and traumas [29]. The biofield plays a vital role in regulating the structure and function of the body. The meridian system described by traditional Chinese medicine is a continuous vibratory network branching into every part of the organism, extending to every organ and every cell in the body. Harmonic vibration and a free energetic flow is the basis of complete health [48,49]. Each cell, organ or a component of the organism is immersed in this field with its own vibration, which is influenced by other parts of the body and together form a harmonic and constant stream of vibratory information around the body\u2014thus forming the biofield. The biofield is the soul that is the missing link between the psyche, brain, and physical body. The soul is the energy and information network, which integrates information from ancient cultures, such as 12 meridians related to 12 organs in traditional Chinese medicine and the chakras in ancient Indian culture describing the energy centers related to the 7 endocrine glands [46]. Physical and emotional trauma led to alteration of the state of harmonic vibration in the biofield and to the interruption of the energetic flow along the energy channels (meridians) as a result of destructive wave interference [50]. When this disruption happens, cellular membrane potential, cellular function, and the body's defense and repair systems become impaired, and physical illness subsequently appears. Therefore, acting on the energetic field has the potential to improve the treatment of serious disorders and diseases that do not respond to clinical methods used in conventional medicine. A new mind-body model has been presented and describes the correlation between the type of conflict and its site of influence in the physical body [46]. According to this model, the body is divided into 7 segments; for each segment, an endocrine gland is related to a specific aspect of life. The organ systems were divided into 12 groups, which are related to the information-processing modes. A complete energetic map has been proposed so that, by understanding the physical disease, it is possible to interpret the underlying psychological conflict [46]. Therefore, based on this concept that emotional conflict or trauma quite often manifests as physical illness, each psychological conflict corresponds with a specific chakra, meridian, or organ. The trauma of an event is set in place virtually instantaneously\u2014in the fraction of second before self-awareness allows perception of the event. Unresolved and repeated psychological conflicts and traumas create a state of dissonance between the magnetoelectric field and the physical body, which causes unpleasant feelings. This dissonance causes destructive wave interference and blocks energy, therefore, causing a shift away from the state of homeostasis. In response, the vital energy decreased, dysfunction appears, and physical disease may manifest. General stress, unfavorable lifestyle habits, and environmental conditions can accelerate disease manifestation or aggravate the existing disease. The mechanism of the influence of the psyche on the body and the manifestation of different diseases in the same organ have been presented in previous research [51]. This study addressed the stress reaction and adaptation with reference to the 4 life phases: excitation, expansion, contraction, and relaxation [50]. According to this theory, the 4 life phases correspond to the 4 phases of the following 3 types of stress: Acute stress: threat, organization, flight and fight, and recovery or shock Chronic stress: alarm, resistance, adaptation, and exhaustion Fear: anxiety, fear, panic, and horror Each phase of acute stress is associated with a corresponding grade of fear. The 4 grades of fear are determined by the balance between the strength of the stimulus and the subjective capacity to cope with the stimulus. The subjective capacity depends on different factors, but mostly on the individual's experience and energy availability that determine psychological resilience. Unresolved traumatic conflict associated with 1 of 4 grades of fear remains blocked in the energetic system, corresponding to one of the phases of life and determine the kind of disease in the specific organ. Blocking or overconsuming emotions related to traumatic conflicts has an impact on the body's energy. A strong energy system (vitality), enables the defense system to maintain the state of homeostasis. However, low energy, because of repeated stress, exposure to environmental factors, or other psychological issues, consume the energy of the defensive system and may lead to the appearance of a physiological dysfunction, which leads to the occurrence of disease and illness. Therefore, a physical disease is developed when both conditions are present: a state of dissonance created by psychological problems or conflict and a lack of energy. The type of the disease as expressed in a given organ will help clinicians understand how the patient had expressed personal emotions in view of a past traumatic experience. This understanding will make it easier to take action to correct the energy imbalance underlying the disease. This model opens a wider vision to establish a new therapeutic strategy. In addition to the conventional approach to the physical body, in which surgery and drugs are used when necessary, the new model of unified integrative medicine takes into consideration both emotional, energetic, and spiritual aspects. The purpose of therapy is to free the body from blockages; to renew the energy Volume 3 | Issue 3 | 5 of 9 Int J Psychiatr Res, 2020flow in the chakras and meridians; to restore the normal pulsation of the 4 phases of life in all organs and tissues; to release the emotions; to unfold or elaborate on psychological conflicts and traumas; to complete the learning process and intellectual growth; to facilitate spiritual evolution; and to achieve a state of well- being, homeostasis, health. Energy-Emotional Washout Energy-emotional washout or energy washout (EWO) is a technique that combines body, mind, and soul in a practical way. The technique that most defines EWO and differentiates it from other relaxation, meditation and yoga exercises is referred to as conscious body-mind-energy work with which the patient becomes aware of the relationship between the body and psychological disturbances, past conflicts, and traumas as well as the spiritual path. The approach of EWO is not hypnosis. The patient remains fully conscious throughout the session and can stop it at any moment, although this discontinuation rarely happens because the feeling of relief and release is so powerful. The procedure favors the psycho- bio-physical drainage of fears and tensions in a mechanical and organic way, and this process helps the reduction of anxiety and fear and serves as an excellent strategy for emotional discharge, both in quantitative and qualitative terms. The EWO technique described herein involves therapists guiding patients through an approximately 1-hour process involving the ongoing regulation of breathing, pressure points, relaxation, and mindfulness while the patient lies comfortably in a supine position (on the back, face up). Throughout the session, the therapist provides the rationale for the approach and general support as well as cognitive or behavioral strategies to complete the learning process. Before applying the EWO technique, the therapist discusses with the patient the physical and psychological issues and explains the dynamics of the therapeutic session and the therapeutic strategy. The discussion is based on the understanding that different psychological experiences and conflicts affect different areas and parts of the body [46]. During the EWO session, the therapist maintains detailed awareness to the somatic experience as it unfolds moment-to- moment, and supports the patient to adopt an accepting and open attitude toward the inner negative and painful experience taking place. Therapist instructions include, \"Focus on identifying what kind of emotions you have, and where you feel these emotions in your body.\" The patient is invited to elaborate on these points, and to complete the learning process and pass on to the next conflict, if a new conflict appears. During EWO the whole physical body passes through the 4 stages of life: excitement, expansion, contraction and relaxation. The law of the 4 stages of life guides the practitioners into all levels of therapy; thus EWO consists of 4 phases: stimulation , charge , discharge , and elaboration .Following the principles of acupuncture, the stimulation phase consists of a physical stimulation of certain trigger points on the body that aims to loosen the energy blockages that represent the crystallized emotions in the physical tissue. This stimulation may cause physical pain and may recall buried emotions. The experience of physical pain is not essential in all cases; in some cases, only superficial touching is sufficient for the person to provoke a reaction and the subsequent liberation of the emotion. Therefore, EWO can even be performed without actually touching the patient, working only on the energy field instead. Special emphasis is given to readjusting the breathing process through guiding the patient to breathe with a certain rhythm and intensity. On study has reported that an inhibited breathing pattern is possibly developed as a response to the state of hopelessness experienced when facing an uncontrollable environment, which then may convert into a generalized breathing habit conditioned by the assessment of the world as a difficult or dangerous place [52]. The breathing rate and frequency of the stimuli depend on physiological, emotional, and emotive factors. Like all essential body functions, breathing has 4 phases that are parallel to the 4 phases of life. The length and frequency of each phase are affected and regulated by the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. The charge phase of breathing leads to expansion of the energy system as a consequence of physical stimulation and hyperventilation. In this phase, the patient feels hot and may perspire, have a sense of fullness, and feel an electric current and paresthesia in the hands. The therapist stands behind the patient's head, connect with the patient's magnetoelectric field, and applies energy from the therapist's hands over to the patient's head (Figure 1). Figure 1: EWO is the interaction between the therapist's magnetic field and patient magnetic field which leads to renewing the energy flow in the energy centers and meridians. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUK62PB3BE4 The patient is typically encouraged to adopt an inhalation of a Volume 3 | Issue 3 | 6 of 9 Int J Psychiatr Res, 2020greater depth, emphasizing mobilization of the entire chest, and at a quicker pace, especially when the patient feels pain in the trigger points when pressed by the therapist. This kind of breathing may provoke respiratory alkalosis, a condition in which the following occurs: the body's carbon dioxide pressure is suddenly lowered relative to the bicarbonate concentration; the pH increases above normal; and the calcium ions shift to intracellular compartments. These events cause general contraction, which produces emotional catharsis and allows the patient to pass to discharge phase. In the discharge phase , the patient may become aware of pre- existing tension or tension may develop in the form of tightening the body as a defensive response to an emerging somatic experience, after which an emotional catharsis may appear. Although the experience of emotional catharsis or abreaction with retrieval of a repressed memory may appear in any of the 4 therapeutic phases, in most cases it occurs in the discharge phase. This catharsis is a sign of internal transformation and should be considered as an important landmark for emerging healing. The patient relies on the therapist to receive the support, courage, and sense of security that is needed during the emotional discharge phase. In most cases, patients begin to manifest emotional reactions such as anxiety, fear, or anger as they being asked to describe the images they see and what they think or imagine, while they are also encouraged to describe the feelings in their body that these images cause. Most often what comes to mind is past crisis or traumatic experience that is still active and \"alive\" in the patient's emotional system. When brought to the surface and revisited, the painful experience can be reframed differently through the process of forgiveness, acceptance, release of the pain, seeing a different perspective of the experience, and/or feeling held and supported during the session. Once these feelings are released, pure energy is channeled through the body to allow healing and flow. Moreover, often after such release patients are able to connect with their higher consciousness and have beautiful, helpful, guiding visions for their pathway forward. The fourth phase is the elaboration phase , which in turn is divided into 4 stages that are useful to complete the learning process. These phases are: analysis , acceptance , reprogramming , and liberation , as described later in text. The psychological learning process means revisiting or reconsidering a past experience that has remained unresolved and emotionally painful. For the patient, this process feels like touching an open wound, yet the ability to give the situation a different meaning, such as understanding, forgiving, loving, viewing from a different angle, or even taking psychological guardianship over the situation, leads to the patient completing the psychological learning process. The elaboration process allows the patient to deeply understand past situations, which enables the ability to better experience similar situations in the future. This phase takes place immediately after the physical and emotional discharge. As just introduced, the 4 steps of the elaboration phase\u2014analysis, acceptance, reprogramming and liberation\u2014follow the physical and emotional discharge phase and are considered to be cognitive stages in which one begins to analyze and give meaning to the experience that arose during the discharge. The information elaboration allows the patient to make an adequate association between processed past events that are transformed into integrating experiences of an emotional and cognitive pattern, which is learned, stored, and made available in a constructive way, in order to more effectively face similar events in the future. Regarding the first step, analysis , recalling and experiencing a past event is insufficient to eradicate the problem. Therefore, this process of recalled experience should be analyzed to be learned, to assimilate the traumatic event, to incorporate it into a positive emotional and cognitive pattern stored with appropriate emotions, and to made available for future use. The second step is acceptance . Human suffering begins when the harmful experience is rejected. Problems and obstacles are part of every individuals' life's path. To address the inevitable suffering, it is critical for the individual to accept these experiences for intellectual growth and spiritual evolvement to occur. The reprogramming step is achieved by asking the patient to imagine being in a happy situation the future and to describe physical sensation and emotional perceptions related to the happy situation. The final stage is the sense of liberation from the burden of past experiences. In this phase, the person experiences a kind of extension of the senses, in which the colors of the external environment become sharper. The person feels a sense of inner emptiness and clarity of thought. The breathing become light and free, with a sense of openness. At this stage, the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system is restored, and the signs of stress ultimately disappear. With the completion of EWO treatment, the patient feels more at ease, clean, free, centered, and mindful\u2014all of which set the conditions for the patient's return for the self-realization process. At this point, energy drainage is performed by caressing the magnetic field along the entire body to harmonize the magnetoelectric field. The EWO treatment influences three aspects of the individual and allows one to obtain physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. The main physical effects of EWO are described as follows: it leads to a state of deep relaxation, granting a condition of physical and mental health; it activates and increases blood and lymphatic circulation, vitalizing all the organs as well as eliminate toxins, thus leading to a stronger immune system; it causes hyperemia and increases the temperature of the hands and skin overall, as well as nourishing the skin, thus improving skin tone and elasticity; it releases muscle tension because of the removal of metabolic waste; it stimulates or soothes sensory nerve endings; it reduces pain and increases resistance to physical pain; it prevents stress-related disorders such as headache, back pain, or menstrual cramps; and it increases vitality and improves sexual performance.Volume 3 | Issue 3 | 7 of 9 Int J Psychiatr Res, 2020At the level of the psyche, the primary mental effects are as follows: it reduces anxiety and diminish mental stress; it restores a sense of happiness, satisfaction, serenity, and self-esteem which leads to clarity of thought, better concentration, and an increased force of will; and it completes the learning process, thus allowing for increased tolerance and acceptance of unpleasant events and other events, such that self-fulfillment becomes easier and life's path seems clearer. Regarding the spiritual effects, a vibrational change occurs that allows the individual to progress in the evolutionary process. During EWO, a synchronization occurs between the soul and the brain that causes an increase in the individual's receptive capacity. The synchronization between the two hemispheres allows creative intuition and rationality to coexist in a synergistic way, and this coexistence allows a full awareness of the way of being, similarly to what happens during deep meditative states. The psyche comes into direct contact with the soul and senses a reality that transcends that limited by the 5 senses. Energy centers and channels are opened, so the energy flow between the two major poles is restored, which allows feeding of the physical body with life energy and the psyche with positive potentials. The EWO therapy help the individual to self-analyze and give meaning to the images and signals received, and thus to complete the learning process in a state of exceptional clarity of mind. The effect on the human soul appears as amplification of the memory that enables the individual to remember hidden events. Beliefs and feelings arising from these remembered events are reviewed, accepted, processed, analyzed, and assimilated to complete the learning process. The events that are lived again become a stimulus for learning because they are processed, learned, and stored with appropriate emotions, and made available for future use. This process leads a deep change, a growth and evolution that allows the individual to widen the horizons of life. An effective therapy leads to a dynamic change of the information received and to the assimilation of the new data with the appropriate emotion to be constructively used in the future. Conclusion The current gold standard of conventional medicine is simply no longer working today for the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. Many people find themselves increasingly frustrated with the current state of allopathic health care. New scientific findings support the idea that every patient requires individual and holistic support and treatment, according to the patient's own unique health needs. However, the actual health care system is not currently designed to accommodate these new requirements and approaches. Unified integrative medicine is a system medicine that integrates the best of modern achievements in the health sciences, especially lifesaving treatments, with a new holistic model that focus on the integration among the body, mind, and soul and considers the direct influence of emotional, mental, social, spiritual, and behavioral factors on health. The emphasis is on the relation between psychological conflicts and energy blockages, and, ultimately, physical disease. The basic health concepts are revised and redefined, such as well-being, health, malaise, vitality, homeostasis, and disease. To achieve health, it is critical need to reduce stress and to increase vitality. Effective therapy can be measured by its ability to achieve the state of well-being that is a state of mind by which the individual feels able to pursue and achieve self-defined goals accompanied with sense of love, happiness, and freedom. The EWO therapy integrates all of these components and offers such a solution that it revolutionize medicine as it is practiced today. The approach of EWO therapy cultivates complete physical, mental and social well-being, as defined by the World Health Organization. Psychological causes of disease are identified, elaborated, explained, and resolved. The resolution of the psychological conflicts and traumas allows completion of the learning process and intellectual growth, thus resolving energy blockages, renewing the 4 phases of life flow, increasing an individual's vital energy, and achieving spiritual evolution toward health and well-being. The retrieval of a repressed memory appears to be associated with high improvement rates. On the emotional level, this detoxification process frees the mind and spirit from the encapsulated behavior related to the trauma and reintegrates to a newly balanced state, clearing the physical body of blockages and strengthening the vital energy that confers an exuberant physical strength or mental vigor, which gives the capacity for survival or for the continuation of a meaningful or purposeful existence and the power for the individual to live and grow. Such an association helps patients to better understand their condition and encourages them to seek improvement in their own personal way. Furthermore, it reduces stress, releases tension, releases long-held negative emotions, such as anger, sadness, and pain, and provides the experience of \"lifting a weight off the shoulders.\" Other results are better breathing (particularly beneficial for patients with asthma), a feeling of lightness, and a sense of being in touch again with one's real self. The experience of EWO can also help with a myriad of symptoms of physical illness, for which the source is emotional (in some cases without self-awareness) rather than purely physical. After EWO treatment, the person enters into a state of relaxation with a sense of inner emptiness, of liberation, and of a stream of happiness, joy, and cheerfulness that flow from the chest with a very deep sense of love. The individual becomes aware of the presence of inner peace, which increases objectivity, the ability to be nonjudgmental, and the ability to not pay heed to issues that were previously disturbing. For the individual after EWO, the consciousness has been raised, trust is well established, and the whole being feels more in line and more in tune with the higher goals. In many cases, the feeling is described as an \"indescribable\" joy that allows an understanding and increasing closeness to the feelings in the state of enlightenment.Volume 3 | Issue 3 | 8 of 9 Int J Psychiatr Res, 2020Acknowledgements The author would like to thank Enago (www.enago.com) for the English language review.
