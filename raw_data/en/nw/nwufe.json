This includes three doses in the primary vaccine series and two booster doses. Having a weakened immune system puts you at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and makes you much more likely to have a breakthrough infection. Studies show that the initial vaccine doses are less effective for people with weakened immune systems, as they don't always produce enough antibodies to build adequate levels of protection, and that hospitalized breakthrough infections are rare but are also more likely in immunocompromised people. Those who are immunocompromised are eligible to receive a total of four doses of an mRNA vaccine, such as Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna. This includes three doses in the primary vaccine series and one booster dose. This vaccine series will help to further strengthen your immunity against COVID-19. Additional vaccine dose eligibility An additional dose of the COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for those individuals ages 6 months and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised. This includes people who have: - Been receiving active cancer treatment for tumors, or cancers of the blood - Received an organ transplant and are taking medicine to suppress the immune system - Received a stem cell transplant within the last two years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system - Moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (such as DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome) - Advanced or untreated HIV infection - Active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids or other drugs that may suppress your immune response If you are unsure if you or your child are eligible for an additional dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at this time or have concerns about the effectiveness of the vaccine you received, please contact your primary care provider. Frequently asked questions about the additional dose People ages 6 months and older are considered moderately to severely immunocompromised if they fit within the following criteria: - Been receiving active cancer treatment for tumors, or cancers of the blood - Received an organ transplant and are taking medicine to suppress the immune system - Received a stem cell transplant within the last 2 years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system - Moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (such as DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome) - Advanced or untreated HIV infection - Active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids or other drugs that may suppress your immune response Those who fall into these categories make up only about 3% of the adult population. Although those with breakthrough COVID-19 infections have been rarely hospitalized, fully vaccinated, immunocompromised people have accounted for a large proportion of those who do end up hospitalized with breakthrough infections. If you are uncertain if you are eligible to receive an additional COVID-19 vaccine dose based on these criteria, please contact your primary care provider. If you are unsure if you are eligible for an additional dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at this time or have concerns about the effectiveness of the vaccine you received, please contact your primary care provider. Having a weakened immune system puts you at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and makes you much more likely to have a breakthrough infection (breakthrough infections occur when vaccinated individuals contract the disease they've been vaccinated against). Studies show that the initial vaccine doses are not as effective for people with weakened immune systems, as they don't always produce the same level of antibodies to build adequate levels of protection. Hospitalized breakthrough cases are rare, but are also more likely in immunocompromised people. An additional dose of the vaccine will help to further strengthen your immunity against COVID-19. In addition to an additional dose, everyone ages 5 years and older who is fully vaccinated against COVID-19 is eligible for a [booster shot](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html). If you are moderately to severely immunocompromised and have received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech (Comirnaty) or Moderna vaccines or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine, you are no longer considered fully vaccinated and are now recommended to receive the additional dose in the vaccine series to be up to date on your vaccinations. [Get more information](https://uihc.org/covid-19-vaccine-information) on receiving an additional dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine (Comirnaty) from UI Health Care. Many local pharmacies are also offering the additional dose of the COVID-19 vaccines needed for immunocompromised people. Many local pharmacies are also offering both the Pfizer-BioNTech (Comirnaty) and Moderna (Spikevax) vaccines for this additional dose of the COVID-19 vaccines for immunocompromised people. No. People who are experiencing symptoms associated with COVID-19 should wait to be vaccinated until they have recovered from their illness and have met the criteria for discontinuing isolation if they are found to test positive. Regardless of your vaccination status or whether or not you are immunocompromised, it is important to get tested if you are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 and to stay home if you are sick. What to do if you feel unwell To be safe, you should stay home if you feel unwell. You should also [schedule a video visit](https://uihc.org/video-visits-mychart-covid-19-or-respiratory-symptoms) if you experience any symptoms that are similar to symptoms of COVID-19. COVID-19 symptoms: - A fever in the last 24 hours - New or worsening: - Sore throat - Cough - Shortness of breath - Individuals who are age 5 or older and are not immunocompromised should receive a COVID-19 vaccine booster. Yes. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have now authorized an additional dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 6 months and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised. If you are aged 5 years and older and received an additional dose of the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine you are eligible to receive COVID-19 boosters. You may be wondering what the difference between a booster dose and an additional dose is. Sometimes people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised do not build enough protection when they first get a vaccination. When this happens, getting an additional dose of the vaccine can help them build more protection against the disease. This is the case for some immunocompromised people and COVID-19 vaccines. In contrast, a \"booster dose\" refers to another dose of a vaccine that is given to someone who built enough protection after vaccination, but then that protection decreased over time (this is called waning immunity).
