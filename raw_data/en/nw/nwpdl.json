It is natural on festive occasions such as holidays or parties to eat more than usual, but many of us have turned up to the level of our satiation state so that we need to eat a large amount of food to feel satisfied all the time. This is contributed to by a great many emotional and psychological factors that may have started in our early years. It is often influenced by our parents and family members and by your own insecurities and self-image. Overeating often leads to obesity, which is a factor in many often diseases. The over-consumption if food also causes stress to the digestive tract and other organs and can lead to the overworking and weakening of those areas. Congestion or stagnation occurs more easily with overeating. These problems need to be dealt with at level from which they arise. If they stem from a nutritional deficiency, so that the body is craving missing nutrients that should be discovered and corrected. If they are of recent onset, stress may be the source. More often, though, overeating is a long0term and deep-seated problem that needs to be dealt with on both the psychological and nutritional levels. Moderation in eating is a very important habit to develop. Eating small meals several times a day instead of one or two large meals is probably better for most people. Balancing flavors as well as types of food will help satisfy us and may lesson our desire to eat more. Under-eating In recent years, there has been growing concern over problems associated with under eating, such as the medical conditions known as anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Under-eating usually has a strong stress or psychological component, which can range from being too nervous or concerned about an upcoming event or relationship, to part of a full-blown psychosis. All forms of under-eating, skipping meals, or eating only limited foods will lead to poor nutrition and eventually, to problems from protein, calorie, vitamin or mineral deficiencies. Other symptoms include lack of energy and subsequent weakness, malnourishment of internal organs, skin problems, and hair loss. Severe weight loss in spite of regular eating may indicate an underlying medical condition and warrants an evaluation by a doctor. People who under-eat are often overly concerned about obesity or have a distorted self image. This is more common in women and in teenage girl who become very body conscious or are concerned about becoming too shapely. Often, being very thin is similar to being fat in that it makes us less attractive and is a protection against intimacy with others. These issues may come up during sexual development\u2014that is, in adolescence. Anorexia means \"loss of appetite,\" and anorexia nervosa means not eating because of \"nervous\" or psychological problems. The majority of people with that condition are young females who want to be trim, or to be models or ballerinas, which require a long and lean body. This may not be the natural body shape of many people, who literally need to starve themselves to maintain that weight or shape. Bulimia is voluntary vomiting by people who wish to get rid of food just eaten so as not to absorb the calories and add weight. Many \"bulimics\" and \"anorexics\" also use laxatives pills or take regular enemas to clear out the intestines more rapidly. All of these problems have strong psychological bases and usually require counseling as well as a lot of support from loved ones. Occasionally, these situations become extreme and as with overeating, can be fatal. Fortunately, these conditions are often short-lived, and those troubled by them see their way clear to begin a new balanced diet and create a newly shaped body and self-image. Eating Late This is a common problem among people with busy daily schedules. Food often acts as a sedative and helps us to physically relax. After a meal, more blood goes to our digestive organs and away from our areas of physical and mental activity. So eating lightly during the day, getting hungry at night after work, and then eating our main meal in the evening is a convenient pattern for most schedules. However, going to bed on a full stomach is not necessarily helpful for digestion or sleep. The food may just sit there, undigested through the night, so that we wake up full and sluggish. Eating late can become a habit that robs us of our vitality. It is best to try to eat earlier in the evening, ideally before dark, and not too heavily; to engage in some activity, both mental and physical after dinner; and to eat very little in the two or three hours before bedtime. When we have not eaten enough through the day, it is wise to eat lightly in the evening also and sleep well to awaken energized for some exercise and a good, hearty breakfast. Rigid Diet Many people develop rigid eating patterns and consume only a limited selection of foods. This inflexibility is often based on a preference for certain tastes or just a discriminating personality. Teenagers and elderly people are subject to this lack of flexibility (as more some health food fanatics) more often than other areas of the population. Sometimes this is based on fear, rebellion, lack of adventure, or just being stuck in an attitude that will not allow them to be open to other ideas. They just maintain themselves on a few foods, such as hamburgers, hot dogs, French fries, and sodas for the younger crowd, or eggs, toast, potatoes, and meat in the older group. All lack the freshness and vitality found in natural foods. There are people who develop what I would call positive restrictions in their diet. We all have certain foods are clearly best avoided. Restricting foods such as meats, milk or chemical-containing foods may be based on certain philosophical or health choices. However, being too rigid in our diet is usually not in our best interest. It is difficult to get people to change when they do not wish to, especially in regard to what they eat. They already know that they wont like it before they even try. Sometimes, consulting with a nutritionist and doing a diet analysis by evaluation or computer can show people the excess or lack of nutrients in their diet, and this may educate and influence them to make some changes. Emotional Eating We have already discussed overeating and under-eating, but there are other issues surrounding the use of food in dealing with stress and psychological troubles. Some people eat when upset or depressed; others cannot eat at all in this condition. Our emotions strongly influence our eating behavior, so if we want to maintain a more balanced diet, and thus more balanced life, we need to learn to deal with our emotional states in ways other than with food. Using hunger as a guide, integrated with a regular eating plan, we create our basic diet. If we are overweight, we need to plan our meals to include less food; if underweight, we will include more food and calories and then maintain a balanced diet when we are at a better weight. We can learn to deal with stress, sadness, frustration, depression and so on through self-development techniques, through counseling, or through mental affirmations and visualized, all good ways to clear these problems\u2014or at least not let them take hold of us and run our lives. There are very few issues that are important enough to take precedence over our health. And not using food to cover up these important feelings. Thoughts and issues are crucial to maintaining our health. Liquids and Eating Many of us drink liquids with our meals. This is not really good practice, since extra fluids can dilute the digestive juices, making it more difficult to break down food. Drinking water before meals or sometimes after them is much better. A small amount (less than a cup) of water with meals may help dissolve the food and stimulate digestive juices. Water is generally our best beverage and consuming about eight to ten glasses a day (most of us will need less when we consume a higher amount of fruits and vegetables) is very helpful for weight loss and keeping the body functioning. It is best to drink two or three glasses about 30-60 minutes before dinner to reduce the appetite a bit. Sweetened soda pops should be avoided. Milk is a food (to be used sparingly by adults), not a beverage to be drunk with meals. Many people feel that a bit of alcohol before many people, and this enjoy meal probably not too detrimental when done occasionally. Overall, it is wise to be aware of needs and drink when thirsty and its is best to drink only between meals, giving our digestive tract the best shot at getting those nutrients ready for out cells. Addition habits to Cultivate Preparation - of both our food and ourselves is helpful. Food made with awareness and love adds that little extra, and when we take the time to prepare ourselves to receive nourishment, such as with a little prayer or some quite time, we also give ourselves the chance to get the most out of our meal. Relaxation - around eating is a good habit to develop. This is part of preparation and digestion. After a fair-sized meal, it is important to take some time to let digestion begin. After about an hour, we can begin some light activity. A walk is ideal. However, most of us cannot afford the luxury of taking this time around meals. When I cannot, I try to follow the Warrior's Diet of frequently small snacks, through the day, until I can take more time to prepare and eat a proper meal. Exercise - is very important to keeping our body healthy and utilize the nutrients that we consume. I do not recommend exercising for at least an hour, or longer, after eating. It is usually several hours after a meal before my body feels right doing any vigorous activity. Often, I exercise first and use eating, as a reward for doing the physical activity that I feel is needed. Early in the day before breakfast, and after work before dinner, are the two best times for exercising. Adapted from \"Staying "}
