The federally contracted vaccine distributor uses validated shipping procedures to maintain the vaccine cold chain and minimize the likelihood of vaccine loss or damage during shipment. There may be circumstances where COVID-19 vaccine needs to be redistributed beyond the identified primary CDC ship-to sites (i.e., for orders smaller than the minimum order size or for large organizations whose vaccine is shipped to a central depot and requires redistribution to additional clinic locations). In these instances, vaccination provider organizations/facilities, third-party vendors, and other vaccination providers may be allowed to redistribute vaccine, if approved by the jurisdiction's immunization program and if validated cold chain procedures are in place in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and CDC's guidance on COVID-19 vaccine storage and handling. There must be a signed CDC Supplemental COVID-19 Vaccine Redistribution Agreement for the facility/organization conducting redistribution and a fully completed CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Provider Profile Information form (Section B of the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement) for each receiving vaccination location. The parties to this agreement are CDC and healthcare organizations, third-party vendors, and vaccination providers that redistribute COVID-19 vaccine. CDC cannot reimburse costs of redistribution beyond the initial designated primary CDC ship-to site(s), or for purchase of any vaccine-specific refrigerators or qualified containers. Therefore, organizations planning for redistribution of COVID-19 vaccine must carefully assess the associated risks and costs (e.g., vaccine loss due to temperature excursions, purchase of vaccine-specific portable refrigerators and/or containers) before planning this activity.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Organization information Organization/facility name: FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY VTrckS ID: Unique COVID-19 Organization ID (from Section A): Primary address and contact information of COVID-19 vaccination organization Street address 1: Street address 2: City: County: State: ZIP: Telephone: Fax: Responsible officers Medical City: County: State: ZIP: Chief Executive Officer (or Chief Fiduciary) Last name: First name: Middle initial: Telephone number: Email: Street address 2: City: County: State: ZIP: CDC Supplemental COVID-19 Vaccine Redistribution Agreement09/29/20Primary point of contact responsible for receipt of COVID-19 vaccine (if different than medical director listed above) Last name: First name: Middle initial: Telephone number: Email: Secondary point of contact for receipt of COVID-19 vaccine Last name: First name: Middle initial: Telephone number: Email: COVID-19 vaccination organization redistribution agreement requirements To redistribute COVID-19 vaccine, constituent products, and ancillary supplies to secondary sites, this organization agrees to: 1. Sign and comply with all conditions as outlined in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement. 2. Ensure secondary locations receiving redistributed COVID-19 vaccine, constituent products, or ancillary supplies also sign and comply with all conditions in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement. 3. Comply with vaccine manufacturer instructions on cold chain management and CDC guidance in CDC's Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit , which will be updated to include specific information related to COVID-19 vaccine, for any redistribution of COVID-19 vaccine to secondary locations. 4. Document and make available any rrecords of COVID-19 vaccine redistribution to secondary sites to jurisdiction's immunization program as requested, including dates and times of redistribution, sending and receiving locations, lot numbers, expiration dates, and numbers of doses.
