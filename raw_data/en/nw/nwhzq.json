The CIM Section's Patient Education Kit for Migraine is a collection of evidence-based recommendations for lifestyle modifications that can help patients improve their migraine frequency and severity over time. Much of the information is sourced from our members and is based on what they use in their own practices. The final product is a concise collection of helpful recommendations, which includes references of the supporting literature. How Can It Be Used? The information can be incorporated into SmartPhrases, in the electronic medical record, which can be shared with patients and/or their referring physicians in visit notes, patient instructions, or other patient handouts. Introduction Lifestyle modification is an integral and evidence-based component of migraine treatment. We encourage you to gradually develop helpful, long-term habits that you will continue to maintain throughout your lifetime. It requires dedication and it is a work in progress.
