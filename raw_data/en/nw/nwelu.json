Controlled studies in pregnant women show no evidence of fetal risk.B: May be acceptable.

Animal studies show risk and human studies not available or neither animal nor human studies done. D: Use in LIFE-THREATENING emergencies when no safer drug available. Positive evidence of human fetal risk. X: Do not use in pregnancy. Risks involved outweigh potential benefits. Safer alternatives exist. NA: Information not available. Pharmacology Mechanism of Action Imidazotetrazine derivative prodrug; active metabolite MTIC methylates guanine-rich areas of DNA that initiate transcription, which lead to DNA double strand breaks and apoptosis Absorption Rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration Peak plasma time: 1 hr (empty stomach); 2.25 hr (high-fat meal) Bioequivalence: 100%; IV infusion (when administered over 90 min) is bioequivalent to same dose of oral capsule Mean peak plasma concentration and AUC decreased by 32% and 9%, respectively when administered after a high-fat breakfast Protein 15% Vd: hydrolyzed to to 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC), which is known to be an intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to methylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species Elimination Half-life: 1.8 hr Clearance: 5.5 L/hr/m\u00b2 Excretion: primarily urine (~38%) Administration IV Preparation Bring the vial to room temp Reconstitute 100-mg vial with 41 mL SWI to obtain 2.5 mg/mL solution; gently swirl to dissolve (do not shake) After reconstitution, store at room temp and use within 14 hr, including infusion time Using aseptic technique, withdraw up to 40 mL per vial to get required dose and transfer into empty 250 mL PVC infusion bag IV Administration Infuse IV using pump over 90 min Flush lines before and after infusion Do not infuse other medications simultaneously thru same infusion line Oral Administration Take capsule consistently either with or without food; preferably take on empty stomach HS to avoid N/V consider Inc. Patient Handout temozolomide TEMOZOLOMIDE - INJECTION (TEM-oh-ZOL-oh-mide) COMMON BRAND NAME(S): Temodar USES: This medication is used to treat certain types of brain cancer. Temozolomide belongs to a class of drugs known as alkylating agents. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells. HOW TO USE: Read the Patient Information Leaflet if available from your pharmacist before you start using temozolomide and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.This medication is given by injection into a vein as directed by your doctor. It is given by a health care professional, usually over 90 minutes.The dosage and treatment schedule are based on your medical condition, height, weight, and response to treatment. To get the most benefit, carefully follow the dosing schedule as directed by your doctor. To help you remember, mark your calendar to keep track of when to receive the next dose.Your doctor may also prescribe other medications (such as antibiotics) to help prevent infection or side effects. Follow your doctor's directions for taking all your medications. SIDE EFFECTS: Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, mouth sores, changes in taste, constipation, tiredness, dizziness, trouble sleeping, headache, or pain/redness/swelling at the injection site may occur. Nausea and vomiting can be severe. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe medication to prevent or relieve nausea and vomiting. Eating several small meals, not eating before treatment, or limiting activity may help lessen some of these effects. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.Temporary hair loss may occur. Normal hair growth should return after treatment has ended.People using this medication may have serious side effects. However, you have been prescribed this drug because your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Careful monitoring by your doctor may decrease your risk.Although temozolomide is used to treat cancer, it may rarely increase your risk of getting other cancers. Also, temozolomide decreases bone marrow function, an effect that may lead to a low number of blood cells such as red cells, white cells, and platelets. This effect can cause anemia, decrease your body's ability to fight an infection, or cause easy bruising/bleeding. Tell your doctor right away if you develop any of the following symptoms: unusual tiredness, pale skin, signs of infection (such as sore throat that doesn't go away, fever, chills), easy bruising/bleeding.Tell your doctor right away if you have any serious side effects, such as: symptoms of liver damage (such as stomach/abdominal pain, yellowing eyes/skin, dark urine).Get medical help right away if you have any very serious side effects, such as: seizure.A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, such as: rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing.This is not a complete list of possible side effects. If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist.In the US -Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or at www.fda.gov/medwatch.In Canada - Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to Health Canada at 1-866-234-2345.
