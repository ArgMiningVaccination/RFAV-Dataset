The caution was triggered by the case of a four-year-old boy with autism who was admitted to hospital in London after he became seriously ill. His parents later revealed they had been giving their only child 12 supplements on the recommendation of a naturopath they consulted for help with his autism. Doctors said there had been several cases of severe illness and even deaths from so-called 'natural' therapies and warned that it was dangerous to use alternative treatments without proper medical supervision. The boy's parents later revealed they had been giving their only child 12 supplements on the recommendation of a naturopath they consulted for help with his autism (stock image) Writing in the journal BMJ Case Reports, medics from St Bartholomew's Hospital said the boy had been taken into A&E suffering from acute vomiting, rapid weight loss, a loss of appetite and extreme thirst. Tests revealed he had toxic levels of calcium and high levels of vitamin D in his body but doctors could find no health conditions which might be causing his symptoms. After several days his parents admitted they had been giving the boy holistic supplements recommended by a naturopath - and doctors quickly realised these were to blame. They said his parents 'were devastated that something they had given to their son with good intent had made him so unwell'. The concoction of 12 supplements, which had been given to the boy for several months, included calcium, vitamin D, cod liver oil, camel milk, silver, zinc and epsom bath salts. He was treated with medication and large volumes of water to return his levels back to normal and made a full recovery within two weeks. In the report, doctors said: 'Many families view these therapies as safer 'natural' options. 'But as this case demonstrates, there can be significant adverse effects which may go unrecognised due to lack of monitoring, recognition and experience with these therapies. 'There are many reported cases of complications, including fatalities, and probably many others which are not reported to medical practitioners or recognised as being attributable to these.' Writing in the journal BMJ Case Reports, medics from St Bartholomew's Hospital (pictured) said the boy had been taken into A&E suffering from symptoms including acute vomiting Parents whose children have chronic conditions, including autism, often choose to use alternative therapies because they believe they may be safer and more natural. Often they do not disclose them to doctors when a problem arises as they do not want to admit using non-conventional medication or because they fail to realise it could be relevant. 'Although families may report benefits with these treatments, there is no regulation of their use and, as our case demonstrates, there can be significant adverse effects,' the doctors said. They added: 'Nutritional supplements are not regulated as drugs, so there is little oversight regarding quality control.' Police have been investigating the naturopath who had advised the therapy. Earlier this week, one of the three remaining NHS authorities in England providing homeopathic treatments dropped funding for it. The Wirral clinical commissioning group said its decision to end funding for homeopathy had 'overwhelming support from the public', with 95 per cent of patients wanting it to be removed. Only Bristol and London NHS trusts, as well as some in Scotland, now provide homeopathy on the NHS. Michael Marshall, of the Good Thinking Society, said: 'Homeopathy is not a valid use of limited NHS resources. The basic expectation of patients is that the treatments they are offered on the NHS actually work. Homeopathy has clearly failed to meet this expectation.'
