There are three paths of entry into the program including transferring into the program as an undergraduate student. The early-assurance program (freshman-entry), is a six-year curriculum, including two summers. Students admitted as freshmen receive a Bachelor of Science in Exercise Science - Physical Therapy (B.S.E.S.-P.T.) concentration after successfully completing the first four years of coursework, and the D.P.T. degree after completing the additional two post-baccalaureate years. Students who have already earned an undergraduate degree may enter as a post-baccalaureate for 3 years of graduate coursework including 2 summers. Physical therapists work with people across the lifespan to optimize movement and improve health. Physical therapists are responsible for examining and evaluating patients/clients, the development and implementation of intervention programs, patient education and supervising other health care practitioners. In addition to patient care, physical therapists may also serve as administrators, teachers, researchers and consultants. Program Highlights Advantages of earning a D.P.T. at SLU include: - Direct admission to the program as a freshman - Undergraduate transfer and post-baccalaureate transfer are both possible - Opportunities to pursue additional curricular goals such as minors, including interprofessional education, certificates and study abroad programs - Physical therapy pro bono clinics - Diversity of clinical education sites - Highly qualified and accessible faculty - State-of-the-art laboratories and clinical equipment Curriculum Overview SLU's PT curriculum is divided into the pre-professional (freshman-junior years) and the professional phase (senior year-second post-baccalaureate year). Progression to the professional phase of the program provides a seamless entry from foundational coursework to practical labs and clinical experiences. Once accepted into the program, a student will progress through the entire program without needing to reapply or take a graduate entrance exam, provided the student meets the program's academic and professional behavior standards. During the professional phase, students enroll in coursework specific to the physical therapy profession and complete 38 weeks of full-time clinical experiences. Students begin their clinical experiences in the spring of their senior year. Elective courses in the physical therapy curriculum and clinical exposure help students gain advanced knowledge and skills in specialty areas. In addition to the PT curriculum, students are required to complete a minor. Upon graduation, students must pass the National Physical Therapy Examination to obtain a license to practice physical therapy. Clinical and Research Opportunities SLU's program in physical therapy is affiliated with more than 250 clinical sites locally, nationally and internationally. The faculty and clinical staff provide clinical services at a variety of locations including the Saint Louis University Physical Therapy Clinic at Student Health, the Physical Therapy Clinic at the Health Resource Clinic, SSM Health Saint Louis University Hospital, consultative services to Fusz Pavilion for Senior Jesuits at Jesuit Hall and the SLUCare Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Clinic. Careers Graduates from SLU's PT program enjoy employment in a variety of settings, including hospitals, outpatient clinics, long-term rehabilitation facilities, collegiate and professional sports, schools, patient homes and fitness centers. Physical therapists typically work in full-time positions and receive benefits. The 2020 median annual wage of physical therapists was $91,010 per year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Specific salary depends on location and experience level. Graduates of our Doctor of Physical Therapy program report a 100% employment rate within the profession within one year of graduation.
