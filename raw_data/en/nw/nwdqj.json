This goal is being accomplished by gaining better understanding of the biology underlying lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms and applying this knowledge to improve the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. Program Aims: - Discover the Genetic and Cellular Origins of Lymphomas and Leukemias - Develop Novel Methods of Diagnosis and Biomarker Monitoring of these Diseases - Develop New Therapies Program Directors Program Directory Testing CC-486 (Oral Azacitidine) Plus the Standard Drug Therapy in Patients 75 Years or Older With Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma This phase II/III trial compares the side effects and activity of oral azacitidine in combination with the standard drug therapy (reduced dose rituximab-cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [R-miniCHOP]) versus R-miniCHOP alone in treating patients 75 years or older with newly diagnosed diffuse large B cell lymphoma. R-miniCHOP includes a monoclonal antibody (a type of protein), called rituximab, which attaches to the lymphoma cells and may help the immune system kill these cells. R-miniCHOP also includes prednisone which is an anti-inflammatory medication and a combination of 3 chemotherapy drugs, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine. These 3 chemotherapy drugs, as well as oral azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Combining oral azacitidine with R-miniCHOP may shrink the cancer or extend the time without disease symptoms coming back or extend patient's survival when compared to R-miniCHOP alone. Stanford is currently accepting patients for this trial. Stanford Investigator(s): Intervention(s): - drug: Cyclophosphamide - drug: Vincristine Sulfate Eligibility Inclusion Criteria: - Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Ann Arbor Stage IIX (bulky), III or IV. Participants with DLBCL transformed from follicular lymphoma (FL) rearrangements are also eligible. Participants with DLBCL that arose from prior CLL (Richter's transformation) are not eligible. - As defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), eligible lymphoma subtypes include the following: - DLBCL, not otherwise DLBCL, germinal-center B-cell type B cell lymphoma - EBV+ DLBCL, NOS - DLBCL associated with NOS NOS - Follicular lymphoma grade 3b - Participants must have staging imaging performed within 28 days prior to registration, as follows. Positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) baseline scans are strongly preferred; diagnostic quality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast-enhanced CT, or contrast-enhanced MRI scans are also acceptable if PET-CT is not feasible at baseline. Note: PET-CT will be required at end of treatment (EOT) and progression for response assessment. All measurable lesions (longest diameter >= 1.5 cm) must be assessed within 28 days prior to registration. Tests to assess non-measurable disease must be performed within 42 days prior to registration. - Participants with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infection are eligible providing they are on effective anti-retroviral therapy and have undetectable viral load at their most recent viral load test (must be within 26 weeks prior to registration). Participants with known HIV must have a CD4 count checked within 28 days prior to registration, but may proceed with therapy regardless of CD4 count. - All participants must be screened for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) within 28 days prior to registration. Participants with known HBV infection (positive serology) must also have a HBV viral load performed within 28 days prior to registration, and participants must have an undetectable HBV viral load on suppressive therapy within 28 days prior to registration. Participants found to be HBV carriers during screening are eligible and must receive standard of care prophylaxis. Participants with active hepatitis B (HBV viral load > 500 IU/mL) within 28 days prior to registration are not eligible - Participants with a known history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have an undetectable HCV viral load within in 28 days prior to registration - Participants must have a Zubrod performance status of 0-2 - Participants must have adequate renal function, as demonstrated by a creatinine clearance, calculated by the Cockcroft and Gault formula, of >= 30 ml/min that was obtained within 28 days prior to registration - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =< 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 2.5 x IULN (within 28 days prior to registration) - Total bilirubin =< 2 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN), unless due to Gilbert's disease, hemolysis, or lymphomatous involvement of liver (within 28 days prior to registration). Note: If total bilirubin is elevated, and direct bilirubin is subsequently performed (within 28 days prior to registration) and resulted to be =< 2 x IULN, the participant will be considered eligible - Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1000/mcL (within 28 days prior to registration) - Platelets >= 75,000/mcL (within 28 days prior to registration) - Hemoglobin (Hgb) >= 8 g/ dL (within 28 days prior to registration) - If there is a documented lymphomatous involvement of the bone marrow, bone marrow function within 28 days prior to registration, as evidenced by: - ANC >= 500/mcL - Platelets >= 50,000/mcL - Hemoglobin (Hgb) >= 8 g/ dL - Participants must have a left ventricular ejection (LVEF) fraction >= 45% as radionuclide (multigated acquisition scan [MUGA]) ventriculography within 56 days prior to registration - For the duration of the study treatment period and for at least 4 months following the last dose of study drug, male participants must agree to use effective contraceptive methods during sexual contact with a female of childbearing potential (FCBP) and must agree to refrain from semen or sperm donation during the same timeframe. Effective contraceptive methods include a history of vasectomy, use of hormonal contraception or an intrauterine device (IUD) by the female partner, or use of condoms - A FCBP is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months) Exclusion Criteria: - Participants must not have known lymphomatous involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) - Participants must not have active inflammatory bowel disease (such as, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), celiac disease (i.e., sprue), prior gastrectomy or upper bowel removal, or any other gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the study drug and/or predispose the subject to an increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity - Participants must not have received any prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or rituximab for treatment of the newly diagnosed DLBCL except for the pre-phase treatment (within specified dose range) that may have either started before or may start after registration to S1918. Inhaled, nasal, and topical steroid use is allowed. Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or antibody therapy for an indolent lymphoma prior to transformation is allowed.
