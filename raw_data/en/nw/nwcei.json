Culinary herbs are generally used for seasoning and garnish. Herbs used for crafts are usually grown for their aromatic qualities and used to make potpourri. Because there can be adverse health effects, the Oregon 4-H Herb Project does not address nor encourage growing herbs for medicinal use. Herb plants may be grown for their leaves, stems, roots, or seeds. For a 4-H exhibit, often the part of the plant you display depends on its intended use. In general, how you display an herb depends on the part of the herb plant most commonly used. General Guidelines 4-H members are encouraged to research and choose any culinary or craft herb(s) they would like to grow. 4-H members must grow the herbs themselves. You can exhibit your herbs in three ways: 1. Fresh-cut 2. Dried 3. Potted Each exhibit must include an exhibit tag and an explanation card . Please refer to the fair book for specific fair classes. Plan ahead, and plant herbs so they will be at their peak at exhibit time. Fresh-cut herbs Leaves Fresh-cut herbs are grown for their leaves. Exhibit them with their stems in a container of water. Remove leaves below the water line so they do not rot. Leaves should be fresh and have no blemishes, bruises, or insect and disease damage. If necessary, rinse very gently in cool water. When more than one stem is required, trim stems evenly, and select for uniform size. After herbs flower, the essential oils change, affecting the flavor or scent. So, many herbs are best harvested and exhibited before they flower. To prevent early blossoming, keep the plant pruned. Flowers Some herbs are grown for their flowers. The blossoms should be fresh, of uniform color and development, have no soil on them, and have no 4-H 2335 $ March 2007 $ $1.00 Lynette Black, Extension 4-H youth educator; Judi Peters, Extension 4-H youth educator, both of Oregon State University; and Gail Lee, 4-H horticulture judgeAn herb is (1) a plant that has a fleshy stem as distinguished from the woody tissue of shrubs and trees, and that generally dies back at the end of each growing season; (2) any of various often aromatic plants used especially in medicine or as seasoning. \u2014New College Edition of the American Heritage Dictionary2 Select and Prepare Herbs for Exhibitinsect or disease damage. Exhibit fresh-cut flowering herbs as you would other cut flowers. (See 4-H 231, the Oregon 4-H Flower and Ornamental Grower's Handbook, for how to exhibit fresh-cut flowers.) Remove leaves below the water line so they do not rot. Seeds Harvest herbs grown for their seeds when they have a mature, full head of seed that is still slightly greenish-brown (so the seeds do not fall off). Avoid over-mature, shattered seed heads. Tie the stems loosely together, and exhibit them on a paper plate, not in water. Roots Roots are usually harvested in the fall, winter, or early spring. Clean them soon after harvest by shaking off as much soil as possible, then washing them under running water. Exhibit roots on a paper plate, not in water. Dried herbs Harvest herbs for drying when they contain the maximum amount of essential oils, which provide the flavor and scent. For leafy herbs, this is usually when the flower bud just begins to open. Harvest herb flowers just as they reach full flower. Harvest seed heads when they change from green to brown but before they drop. Rinse gently if needed, and pick off dead or discolored leaves. You can dry herbs on the stem. Gently remove the leaves and/or flow - ers after drying. Or, if you use a screen, you can remove the leaves and flowers before drying. Potted herbs Refer to the fair book for specific requirements for exhibiting potted herbs.
