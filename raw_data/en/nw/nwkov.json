Life is hard enough without the extra stresses on both your body and your mind that a hormone imbalance can cause! Let's get this sorted once and for all sister, let's nourish our beautiful bodies and embrace a lifestyle that promotes vitality and wellbeing. Naturopathically formulated after 25 years of holistic care in clinic Balance Me has been created for women of all ages who are looking for a natural solution to balance their hormones and feel their best again. By assisting in the removal of any excess hormones via the liver and bowel, Balance Me supports your adrenals for energy levels and liver detoxification resulting in improved sleep and a balanced body temperature. It works to improve memory and concentration, allowing you to feel more in control, centered, calm and relaxed. KEY DIFFERENCE - Instead of including every possible herb that can help with all of the different menstrual dysfunctions, we decided to use the herbs that will remove the drivers of the disfunction instead. So we have supported the adrenals and therefore energy levels during the day and sleep quality at night with Rhodiola. The nervous system is being supported reducing anxiety and hot flushes (if applicable) with Zizyphus. To clear out the excess hormones and toxins from the liver which reduces the build up and the actual imbalance - and to also enhance clarity of mind and memory we have added Rosemary. Finally supporting the endocrine system itself and allowing your hormones to be in balance again with Chaste tree. By taking this approach we are resolving the disfunction that creates the imbalance from happening if the first place, negating the need for all of the other herbs in 98% of cases. This is a very unique approach to hormone wellbeing that is based on whole body medicine. Retuning to the roots of herbal medicine to always support the organ, systems and body as one. At Raw Medicines we understand that you are not just a hormone that is out of balance, its your whole body that has been thrown out creating these conditions.
