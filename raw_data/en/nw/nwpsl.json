This page contains everything you need to know about contrabands in the game, including how and where to use them. Energy Converter Callisto Credits, the currency in the game, is used to purchase [gear upgrades](/wikis/the-callisto-protocol/Best_Upgrades), ammunition, and Health Injectors at the many UJC Reforge Stations scattered throughout Callisto. You can find these credits throughout the game from numerous sources: - Dropped by dead enemies - Scattered randomly - Inside Loot Crates, boxes, and lockers - By selling contrabands in the Reforge Contrabands, such as Energy Converter, are the bulk of where you can get Callisto Credits. There are three types of contraband you can find in the game: - Energy Converter and its pristine variant sell for 100 and 200, respectively. These are the most common and usually found early in the game. You'll still find them in lesser numbers in the later chapters. - Decoder and its pristine variant sell for 500 and 750, respectively. These contrabands tend to drop from Security Robots. Your first opportunity to get one of these is in [Chapter 3: Aftermath](/wikis/the-callisto-protocol/Aftermath), for killing the lone Security Robot before the vent entrance. You can also find decoders in random storage or supply rooms that contain Loot Crates. - CPU Printer and its pristine variant sell for 1000 and 1500, respectively. These are by far the most valuable contraband in the game and are either dropped by powerful enemies/bosses or inside Loot Crates in the secret rooms. Both the Two-Head in [Chapter 6: Below](/wikis/the-callisto-protocol/Below)and [Chapter 7: Colony](/wikis/the-callisto-protocol/Colony)will drop one CPU Printer upon death. Early in the game, where your inventory space is limited to 6 slots, we recommend selling all of them at the Reforge whenever you get a chance. Selling them will make inventory space if you need them for ammo, heals, or more contrabands.
