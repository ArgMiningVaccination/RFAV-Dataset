Xylazine The AVMA has been working with members of Congress and stakeholder groups to address the increasing threat of illicit xylazine to public health while maintaining veterinarians' access to this important drug. This month, the Combating Illicit Xylazine Act w as introduced into Congress, culminating months of work by the AVMA, congressional offices, and many important stakeholders. The AVMA fully supports this bill's provisions which would equip law enforcement with additional tools to stop illicit xylazine tra fficking while maintaining veterinarians' ability to use xylazine in its current prescription status. If it becomes law, the legislation will make the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, or possession of illicit xylazine subject to Schedule III penaltie s under the federal Controlled Substances Act. Illicit use of xylazine includes any use, or intended use, in people and would address any diversion of xylazine from veterinary sources. At the same time, the legitimate veterinary uses would remain under the ir current prescription status. For full details, read the AVMA's latest blog . Multiple states have considered legislatio n relating to xylazine this session. Two bills that would schedule xylazine were introduced in Illinois : IL S.B. 2089 which would add xylazine as a Schedule I controlled substance and provide for penalties for the knowing manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to manufacture or deliver the drug, and IL H.B. 3873 would schedule xylazine as a Schedule II controlled substance.

The Board of Pharmacy is issuing enforcement waivers to make it clear distributors/manufacturers of xylazine do not have to 4 | P a g e State Legislative Update - March 2023 meet DEA -controlled substance requirements to ship the drug into Ohio. In addition, veterinarians will be provided lead time to take inventory, establish controlled drug security and record keeping, and obtain a Board of Pharmacy Terminal Distributor of Dangerous Drugs (TDDD) license if they do not already have one. The Ohio Veterinary Medical Association had encouraged a delay in state scheduling to allow for federal legislation on xylazine to be enacted. Rhode Island RI S.B. 738 / RI H.B. 5922 would designate xylazine HCL as a Schedule V controlled substance. A new law in West Virginia (WV S.B. 546 ) designates xylazine as a Schedule IV controlled s ubstance. ************** Animal Abuse | Cruelty State Link Summary of Proposed Bill or Regulation Status Delaware DE S.B. 71 Would create immunity for anyone who, in good faith, reports suspected animal cruelty to the Office of Animal Welfare.
