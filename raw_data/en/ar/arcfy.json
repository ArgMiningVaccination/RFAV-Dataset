Gibson, MD, PhD, is Director of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Center, Director of the Pediatric Pulmonary Fellowship program, and attending physician at Seattle Children's Hospital; he is a Professor in the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine. He earned his MD and PhD at Washington University in St. Louis. He completed pediatrics residency training and a fellowship in pediatric pulmonology at the University of Washington. He is committed to high-quality, multidisciplinary patient care, small group teaching, research and the acquisition of new knowledge. His primary research focus is on early events in the pathogenesis of lung disease in CF, with a focus on the risk factors for and the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infections in young children with cystic fibrosis (CF). As a co-principal investigator of the university's CF Translational Therapeutic Development Center, he has been lead and co-investigator for several phase I to phase III clinical trials involving novel antimicrobial agents, anti-inflammatory compounds and modulators of ion transport. Dr. Gibson is also director of the clinical core of the university's CF research development program with the goal of catalyzing collaborations between local basic and clinical investigators. - - Dr. Gibson has been our favorite doctor since the day we met him. There are many great doctors on the CF team but we always request Dr. Gibson and we are extremely bummed if he is not available during our necessary times. He has been my daughter Emma's preferred doctor since she was three. She is now sixteen. He always listens to our concerns and is good at explaining difficult issues. We love his positive spirit and outlook on life. He makes long visits more bearable. Thanks Dr. Gibson!!! - Dr. Gibson was very kind, honest and thorough with his daily visits to my 3 year old daughter who had been admitted to Children's with a pneumothorax. We really appreciated the time he spent in explaining what was happening and what we could or could not expect. - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date SEATTLE TOP DOCTOR - 2022 Seattle Magazine 2022 Seattle Top Doctor -
