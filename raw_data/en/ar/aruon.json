Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data Everyday religion : observing modern religious lives / edited by Nancy Ammerman. p. cm. Includes United States of America on acid-free paperForeword Peter L. Berger Anthologies tend to be uneven. This one is not. It opens with pieces by three international stars of the sociology of religion\u2014Nancy Am-merman from the United States (who also served as the convener andeditor of the team of contributors), Grace Davie from Britain, andEnzo Pace from Italy. And each of the chapters following this open-ing salvo makes an excellent contribution to the topic of the volume:the way in which contemporary religion, refusing to be conned toformal religious institutions, penetrates everyday life. This is a bookthat should be of interest not only to academic scholars of religionbut also to a much broader public in which there is today a growinginterest in religion. Much of the sociology of religion has dealt either with the afore- mentioned institutions\u2014that is, broadly speaking, with the internalcondition and the societal role of churches\u2014or with survey data cov-ering the beliefs and behavior of large populations. Obviously, bothprocedures have yielded important insights. But what both have in common is remoteness from much of what constitutes the reality of religion in the lives of many people. Of course churches, synagogues, and other religious organiza- tions continue to play an important role in contemporary society. Butmuch of religious life takes place outside these institutional locales. Tolimit the study of religion to these locales would be like, say, studyingpolitics by only looking at the activities of organized political parties.As far back as 1967, in his influential book The Invisible Religion , Thomas Luckmann insisted that sociologists must be attentive to reli-gious phenomena that are \"institutionally diffuse.\" Probably this has always been the case. There is much evidence that even in the heyday of \"Chris- tendom,\" when supposedly the Catholic Church reigned supreme in Europe,there was a turbulent religious life outside the walls of the impressive Gothiccathedrals (the archives of the Inquisition provide some good evidence). But to-day this diffuse religiosity is particularly salient. In much of the world onends more and more people who explicitly dene their religious position asbeing at some distance from their background tradition\u2014\"I am Catholic,but . . .\"\u2014\"I happen to be Jewish \"\u2014\"I am not religious, but I am spiritual.\" Putdifferently, there is a lot of religion that cannot be studied by looking under\"churches\" in the Yellow Pages of the phone book. Survey data on religion are also useful, especially if one can compare them over extended periods of time. But by their very nature surveys force respondentsto make choices between categories designed by researchers who very com-monly are remote from the social milieus of the respondents and consequentlyare prone to misinterpret the responses. For example, scales of \"orthodoxy\" oftenleave respondents baffled as to where they should place themselves. Also, peoplewho ll out questionnaires have been known to ddle with the facts. Thus it hasbeen shown that, in regions of America where churchgoing has a positive status,people exaggerate their own church attendance. Conversely, in highly secularizedEurope, people may understate their religious beliefs or practices. Survey dataabout a phenomenon as complex as religion give a very abstract picture\u2014that is,a picture remote from the actual reality of people's lives. As against these distortions, the present volume provides rich data on how religion is experienced by living human beings in their actual lives. Perhaps surprisingly, what emerges is a picture of great vitality and inventiveness. Inaddition to this valuable contribution, the volume also helps to develop a num-ber of other central themes in the sociology of contemporary religion. The demise of \"secularization theory.\" Here is yet another nail in the cofn of the theory, dominant some decades ago, that equated modernity with a de-cline of religion. Or, in a somewhat more moderate form, it asserted that reli-gion has become largely \"privatized\"\u2014that is, has been forced from the publicsphere and has become, so to speak, an activity carried on in private by con-senting adults. To be sure, both secularization and privatization are empiricallyavailable phenomena, albeit very differently so in different countries and pop-ulations. But they are far less pervasive and progressive than previously as-sumed. Much of the contemporary world is full of powerful explosions of reli-gious fervor, and much of this fervor has important social and politicalrepercussions. The present volume provides evidence of both. The importance of religious \"pluralism \"\u2014that is, the coexistence of differ- ent forms of religious expression in the same social space under conditions of(more or less) civic peace. Again, this is something that has existed in earlierperiods of history\u2014for example, in the late Hellenistic era, along the Silk Roadof central Asia, in Mogul India, in Hohenstaufen Sicily. But some basic featuresvi forewordof modernity have made pluralism a much more widespread, indeed global, phenomenon\u2014urbanization and mass migration (making more and morepeople rub elbows with others holding different beliefs and practicing differentlifestyles), the spread of literacy and higher education, the media of mass com-munication (from radio to television to the Internet)\u2014all of these have madeknowledge of alternate religious possibilities more generally available thanever before. This means, quite simply, that religion has increasingly become amatter of individual choice\u2014what Robert Wuthnow has aptly called \"patch-work religion.\" Individuals may indeed make \"orthodox\" or \"fundamentalist\"choices\u2014many do\u2014but these too are choices, lacking the taken-for-grantedquality prevalent in much of earlier history and thus susceptible to later revi-sions. Again, the present volume contains rich data about the reality of reli-gious pluralism. Both secularization and pluralism have been unduly exaggerated by theo- ries of modern religion. Often the exaggeration has to do with the social loca-tion of the theorists. Thus the theory of secularization referred to earlier hasbeen a projection of the European situation to other parts of the world where itturns out to be inappropriate. Conversely, a recently formulated \"new para-digm \" in the sociology of religion, which centers on pluralism, inappropriatelygeneralizes from the American experience, which is not replicated elsewherein the same way. The comparison between Europe and America (more pre-cisely, between Western and central Europe on one hand, and the United Stateson the other)\u2014both containing societies in the vanguard of modernity\u2014is ofparticular importance for the sociology of contemporary religion. This is yetanother theme to which this volume contributes signicantly. The majority of the contributions deal with America. But there are very in- teresting discussions of religion in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, andSpain, and of the place of religion in what Peggy Levitt calls \"transnationalism \"(the increasingly widespread phenomenon of migrants moving back and forthbetween countries). Both the differences and the similarities of religion on thetwo sides of the Atlantic are important, and both contain secularity and plural-ism, though in different mixes. Europe is more secularized, both in terms ofthe condition of its churches (Catholic as well as Protestant) and in terms of in-dividual beliefs and practices. American churches are generally in better shape,and religious belief and practice is more robust (especially in the burgeoningcommunity of evangelical Protestantism, which has no European analogue).But there are also important similarities, especially in the availability of plural-istic options\u2014the French sociologist Dani\u00e8le Hervieu-L\u00e9ger (who is not repre-sented in the volume, but who has been a close collaborator with Grace Davieand Enzo Pace) has written about what she calls religious \"bricolage\"\u2014looselytranslatable as \"tinkering,\" as when a child puts together and takes apart a Legoconstruction. This refers precisely to the phenomenon that Robert Wuthnowhas called \"patchwork religion.\"foreword viiPut simply, America is more religious, Europe more secularized. But both continents are confronted with the social and individual challenges of plural-ism. Thus, indirectly, the comparison is very relevant to what the Israeli sociol-ogist Shmuel Eisenstadt has called \"alternate modernities.\" There is indeed amodern reality of secularity. But the United States provides a vibrant case of asociety that is both thoroughly modern and strongly religious. This has inter-esting implications far beyond the Western world. The chapters collected in this volume were originally presented at a con- ference convened by Nancy Ammerman and sponsored by the Institute onCulture, Religion and World Affairs at Boston University, supported by a grantfrom the Pew Charitable Trusts. As director of the Institute, I take great plea-sure that the institute could be instrumental in helping to produce this volume.As Ammerman discusses in her concluding chapter, the volume also opens upa fascinating agenda of further research.viii forewordContents Foreword, v Peter L.

Ammerman In the rst century of sociology's history as a discipline, the reigning concern was explaining the emergence of the modern world. Theo-rists and researchers tried to understand the transformation of soci-eties from tightly knit and relatively local villages into the complex,urban societies that were appearing then. 1The cultural, political, and economic changes that came to be known as modernization have pre-occupied the discipline, and from the beginning we have known thatwe could not understand those changes without also understandingwhat has happened to religion. In his brilliant analysis of the begin-nings of modernity, Max Weber envisioned a trajectory from Calvinistshopkeepers to heartless capitalists: The Puritan wanted to work in a calling; we are forced to do so. For when asceticism was carried out of monastic cellsinto everyday life, and began to dominate worldly morality, itdid its part in building the tremendous cosmos of the mod-ern economic order ....B u t victorious capitalism, since it rests on mechanical foundations, needs its support nolonger ....I n t h e eld of its highest development, in the United States, the pursuit of wealth, stripped of its religiousand ethical meaning, tends to become associated with purelymundane passions. (Weber 1958, 181-82) The story sociologists have told about religion in the modern world has been just such a story of mundane passions. Blind faith is re-placed by reasoned investigation, eventually putting the magicians and holy men out of business and eclipsing whatever sense of calling or tradi- tion might have characterized an earlier age. By the middle of the twentieth century, a few theorists had modied that view slightly to predict that particular religious traditions would disappear,while the functions of religion would remain in a variety of value- and meaning-generating social institutions. 2But slowly, over the last quarter of the twentieth century, even that story began to lose its plausibility. It still made sense to theintellectuals whose own journey from village to academy it often described, butit increasingly made no sense of a world in which religious revolutions andspiritual movements abound. 3In the United States, voters concerned about \"values\" and mobilized by conservative Christian congregations appear to havebeen a critical factor in electing one of their own to the White House. Through-out the world, in the highest tech sector of life\u2014the Internet\u2014religion rivalscommerce and pornography for dominance. And religiously based conflictscontinue to structure geopolitics, even as a global economy moves CDs andsneakers\u2014along with Bibles and Muslim prayer rugs\u2014into every corner of theworld. Something is afoot at the beginning of the twenty-rst century thatmany social scientists of the last century would have found hard to explain. Sci-ence, capitalism, and politics are pervasive and powerful in the everyday livesof ever-expanding layers of the world's population. But so is religion. True, many of the historic places of worship are empty, and religious au- thorities have lost legal and cultural power in many parts of the world. Count-ing weekly attenders yields, in many places, a picture akin to the decline thatwas predicted. And asking people about their willingness to cede authority toreligious functionaries\u2014whether in doctrine or fertility\u2014produces a similarsecularizing picture. If the strength of religion is measured by orthodoxy of be-lief, regularity of attendance, and the ability of traditional religious institutionsto enforce their norms, much of the world is very secular indeed. 4 The signals, then, are very mixed. While a few social theorists still argue for an ever-narrower version of \"secularization \" as the inevitable direction of social,cultural, and economic development, 5a broad search has begun for new ways to think about the relationship between religion and society. This book is a contri-bution toward understanding the seeming paradox of religion 's simultaneouspresence and absence in the modern world. While many in the academy assumethat religion is declining or not there at all, commonsense observations suggestotherwise. That disjuncture suggests that it is time for new questions, ones thatboth emerge out of and begin to make sense of what we are observing. This book is a series of \"dispatches from the eld.\" It began with an ex- traordinarily lively conversation, convened in Boston in November 2003. Eachof the contributors to this book brought the insights and nagging questionsthat had accumulated in our years of observing religious people, and we beganto help each other articulate new interpretive frames. We have since read eachother's work, and many of the contributors have helped to shape the introduction4 introductionand conclusion to this book. More than many edited volumes, this really is a collaborative effort. The chapters collected here attempt to let \"everyday religion \" raise critical questions about how we understand the role of religion in society. To start fromthe everyday is to privilege the experience of nonexperts, the people who do notmake a living being religious or thinking and writing about religious ideas. 6 That does not mean that \"ofcial\" ideas are never important, only that they aremost interesting to us once they get used by someone other than a professional.Similarly, everyday implies the activity that happens outside organized religiousevents and institutions, but that does not mean that we discount the influencethose institutions wield or that we neglect what happens within organized reli-gion \"every day.\" We are interested in all the ways in which nonexperts experi-ence religion. Everyday religion may happen in both private and public life,among both privileged and nonprivileged people. It may have to do with mun-dane routines, but it may also have to do with the crises and special events thatpunctuate those routines. We are simply looking for the many ways religionmay be interwoven with the lives of the people we have been observing. In other words, each of us has found a place from which to enter (as much as any of us ever does) a particular corner of today's very diverse social world tosee how religion is being lived there. Our work has positioned us in a variety ofcultural and social locations, and those comparisons proved invaluable. Wewere also acutely aware of the absences in our midst. Most especially, this par-ticular group cannot adequately bring the experiences of people of color into re-visioning the sociological study of religion. We are keenly aware that many ofthe questions we raise may be seen differently in the Southern Hemisphere orby observers of African American culture, for instance. The vagaries of sched-ules and commitments produced a collection of contributors minus those cru-cial voices. This book is a beginning, then, with many more questions to come. Given that religion seems to be a part of the social world we encounter today, we ask,what are its characteristics and dynamics? How does religion operate in the modern world? When and where do we nd experiences that participants de-ne as religious or spiritual? Where do we see symbols and assumptions thathave spiritual dimensions, even if they are not overtly dened as such? Whereare traditional religions present beyond their own institutional walls, andwhere are new religiosities gaining a foothold? Rather than starting with a preexisting denition of religion, each of the contributors to this volume begins with questions grounded in the everydayways modern persons relate to the things they experience as religious or spiri-tual. They ask what makes some social events and individual actions religiousin the minds of the actors and how those denitions are shaped by the variouscultural and institutional contexts in which they take place. We do not assumethat religion is always about \"eternal truths\" that divide the saved and theintroduction 5damned. Nor do we follow rational choice theorists in positing that religion is always about \"supernatural rewards.\"7While these may be good descriptions of evangelical Christianity, our experience in the eld suggests to us that religioussocial reality is bigger than that. Each of these chapters asks readers to take def-initional cues from the wide range of mental, physical, emotional, political,and social realities that can fall within the realm of \"religious\" experience. This theoretical and denitional expansion also implies an expansion in our modes of measurement. Our observations suggest that religion is biggerthan the theological ideas and religious institutions about which typical sur-veys have inquired. Beliefs about the Bible and religious service attendance failto capture much of the spiritual world we have heard about in the eld. Manyof these chapters suggest why we are skeptical about what the surveys have re-vealed; but we are also aware that nascent, less-institutionalized phenomenaare not easy to dene and analyze. We recognize the expedience and the utilityof asking survey questions and employing statistical methods, so it is withsome caution and humility that we begin to point to methodological alterna-tives. Still, these articles demonstrate the enormous gains to be made by givingattention to individual life stories, observations of groups in action, and analy-sis of societies at crisis moments and otherwise listening for the social patternsthat emerge in everyday life. 8 We are interested, then, in describing the social worlds in which religious ideas, practices, groups, and experiences make an appearance. We are inter-ested in describing what religion itself looks like\u2014that is, in developing betterdenitions and indicators. But we are also interested in what we might learnabout the way religion works. This is a book about the social realities of every- day religious life. That means that we take the power of the social context seri-ously. The chapters here invite you to look with us for all the ways in whichparticular cultures and histories provide the materials out of which everydayreligiosities and secularities emerge. The diverse European and American ter-rain they cover should also be seen as an invitation to think about the religiosi-ties and secularities of the people of color and populations in the parts of theworld not included among these dispatches. Religiosities \u2014plural\u2014is, we would argue, the right word, wherever one is observing. Paying attention to everyday experience quickly explodes any as-sumption that religion is always (or ever) one thing, either for individuals or forgroups. Theologians can certainly contend that a religious identity or mem-bership is real only if it is singular and central for the person who holds it, butsociologists should not take that as the last word on what we analyze. Religiontoday is plural (and may always have been). Religious ideas and practices maybe present even when they are neither theologically pure nor socially insulated. That is, plurality and impurity do not lead to religious demise. Older mod- els of secularization predicted that the existence of plural religious authoritieswould weaken the power of any one of them. Without an overarching shared6 introductionsacred world, religion would be subject to critical comparisons that would fun- damentally change its nature.9Choice, in other words, would bring the eleva- tion of individual autonomy over institutional authority and render religiousgroups impotent in the face of the preferences of their mobile and selectivemembers. Because no religious tradition can dene a taken-for-granted world,all religious traditions would suffer. Especially for Europeans, accustomed tolinks between religion and social solidarity, religious pluralism long seemed animplausible, perhaps even dangerous, experiment. The U.S. notion of individ-ual religious choice and commitment seems to many Europeans a pale reflec-tion of the powerful communal memory they have known. 10 But a pluralism of religious institutions has been part of the American sit- uation from the beginning. Historian Jon Butler has noted that by 1760, the de-gree of religious pluralism in the American colonies probably exceeded that inany single European society and equaled the pluralism found on the Europeancontinent as a whole (Butler 1990, 174). If the United States was religiouslyplural in its beginnings, it has become even more so since. Immigration has,in distinct spurts, added new kinds of religiosity to the mix, dramatically sosince 1965. Internal migrations and religious innovation have contributed toAmerican diversity, as well, producing everything from nineteenth-centuryDisciples of Christ and Seventh-Day Adventists and Mormons to twentieth-century Pentecostalism, Scientology, and \"storefront\" churches. 11The result is a bewildering array of religious alternatives. There are between 300,000 and400,000 local congregations belonging to literally hundreds of different reli-gious denominations and traditions. 12Even traditions that originated in reli- giously homogeneous cultures elsewhere in the world have adopted American\"denominational\" styles, recognizing the legitimacy of the others around them(and by implication their own limited cultural power). By 1960, Roman Catholi-cism had found ways to live within American democratic pluralism, and in the1990s Muslims in the United States began their own search for an Americanway. 13As European churches ofcially disestablish, and as increasing religious pluralism becomes a reality on the Continent, chosen religiosities may enterthe European religious vocabulary, as well. Choice is simply present in all the vantage points from which we have been observing religion. This book does not question the power or reality ofchoice, but neither do we assume that people who choose or who mix andmatch are inherently \"less\" religious than those whose lives are shaped by asingle religious trajectory in a homogeneous religious community. None of usdisputes either the reality of pluralism or the way it alters the nature of reli-gious institutional authority. What we do dispute is the notion that this neces-sarily constitutes a fundamental loss of religious presence or power. Each ofus assumes that pluralism is simply a reality, that there are always multiplediscourses and memories and histories\u2014sacred and secular\u2014available to be de-ployed in any given situation. Symbols and meanings from a variety of religiousintroduction 7(and nonreligious) traditions are available to modern individuals. Such \"brico- lage\" or \"hybridity\" may be discouraged by some religious traditions and in-deed may weaken the authority of any one of them, but it does not necessarily weaken the overall presence and influence of religious and spiritual factors inindividual lives or in society as a whole. 14 In saying that we take pluralism as a given, we are not saying that historic religious traditions and institutions should be ignored. Just because peoplehave the power to choose does not mean that everyone will leave their old at-tachments behind. Existing habits and attachments have the considerablepower of inertia in their favor. Studying religion today requires both an atten-tiveness to unconventional practices andan ear for the pervasiveness of tradi- tions. In our observations, we have encountered both seekers and loyalists,dabblers and full-time devotees. We do not assume that simple forms of reli-giosity are on the way to becoming complex or that new ideas will replace old. 15 We are simply curious about the many ways in which new and old (often inter-mingled) appear in everyday religious lives. Taking choice seriously, we should note, does not mean adopting a \"ra- tional choice\" perspective. Most of this book's authors would agree with ra-tional choice theorists that religious actors make decisions about religion inmuch the same way they make decisions about other aspects of their lives, andin many cases that means choosing the best the market has to offer, given whatone is willing to invest. Most of us are skeptical, however, about the degree towhich costs and rewards and market structures are the prime explanations foraction, religious or otherwise. Rational choice models, with their macro-levelsurvey statistics, have attempted to show that a religious free market, with ac-tive entrepreneurial suppliers, provides consumers with more opportunities tond their religious preferences served. The result of religious pluralism, then,is higher levels of membership and participation. Contrary to traditional secu-larization theories, rational choice theorists say religious pluralism is inher-ently good for religion. 16 For the authors in this book, however, pluralism is neither a plus nor a mi- nus, neither a guarantor of vitality nor a harbinger of doom. It is simply part ofthe cultural and structural world in which people are living their lives, a worldthat includes religious realities that are both old and new, powerful and fragile,institutionalized and emergent. We have no theoretical predispositions aboutpluralism beyond the expectation that people will engage in the construction ofa social world for themselves that makes use of the cultural elements availableto them. Asking what is available and how it is used allows us to see things wemight not otherwise have seen. What we have also noticed in our work is that religion has not stayed neatly in the privatized box to which earlier social theory relegated it. 17Those cultural myths about the absence of religion in public life are not to be ignored, but theydo not seem to provide an accurate picture of where and how religion is to be8 introductionfound. Even when religion enjoys no legitimized regulative role, it may never- theless exercise public power. As Jos\u00e9 Casanova has convincingly argued, dis-establishment does not necessarily rob religion of its ability to have an impacton public policy: \"Religious traditions throughout the world are refusing to ac-cept the marginal and privatized role which theories of modernity as well astheories of secularization had reserved for them \" (Casanova 1994, 5). From civilrights leaders to antiabortion activists, religious leaders continue to play a visi-ble public role in the United States and around the world; religious congrega-tions and special purpose groups actively mobilize political involvement; andindividuals often link their political preferences to religious agendas. 18As Casanova points out, the modern differentiation of spheres\u2014public from pri-vate, state from church\u2014neither determines the absolute power of one over theother nor prevents movement of ideas and influence from one to the other. Not only is political life not always secularized, but other domains often ex- hibit spiritual influences, as well. The explorations in this book will provide awindow on the degree to which the worlds of politics and work and health andfamily have failed to become spiritually neutral. That observation is situated inthe more basic assertion that modern life is not as thoroughly compartmental-ized as earlier theorists might have thought. 19Indeed, one might just as well say that work and health are not politically neutral or that family and politicsare not economically neutral. Each domain colors the other. The modern,\"functional\" notion that social institutions operate discretely has become in-creasingly implausible, and we carry that insight into our study of religion. Weexpect institutional boundaries to be permeable, and that allows us to ask howand to what effect. 20 We have no interest in pretending that secular logics have no power or that there are no secular spaces in which religion is absent. The chapters in thisbook often highlight the ability of various forms of secular rationality to shapeeveryday interaction. We do not, however, assume that \"religious\" and \"secu-lar\" are zero-sum realities tightly bounded against each other. We leave openthe possibility that the boundaries between them are permeable. That theoreti-cal openness allows us to see relationships that others might have ignored. Everyday religion, then, may happen in unpredictable places. It may com- bine elements from multiple religious sources. It may be easily measured be-cause its forms are widely recognized, or it may present itself to the observer as aquestion or puzzle whose meaning must be negotiated. Our task is both to en-gage that denitional negotiation and to see what we can learn after we do. As so-cial scientists we are curious about what, but also about where and how and why.From royal funerals to funerals for aborted fetuses, we are curious about whoparticipates and why. From home altars to televised liturgies, we are curiousabout the power and impulse to create something that is sacred. From \"faith-based\" organizations to Internet chat rooms, we are curious about where religionhappens and how it mingles with other aspects of social life. Our curiosity tookintroduction 9us into a wide range of places\u2014some predictable and some not\u2014and what we saw began to teach us new ways to think about religion. This book is both aboutwhat we saw and about how we have come to think about it. A Preview of What We Saw Given that modern religion exists in a pluralist context, the rst part of this vol-ume is devoted to examining what that pluralism looks like and how it works.We travel to England and Sweden, Italy and Spain, as well as to many cornersof the United States. In each case we nd people engaged in a vigorous negoti-ation between old and new, using traditional symbols and inventing their own.Even the most apparently \"secular\" people often perpetuate (and re-create) reli-gious traditions. Churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques play an impor-tant role in the way everyday religion is shaped, even for people who are notin them. Although traditional institutions are themselves being reshaped, itwould distort the social reality we are describing to ignore their continuingpower. Many observers of European religion have done just that, but neitherGrace Davie nor Enzo Pace is convinced that European Christian institutionsshould be written off. Each describes the signicant losses that have occurredover the last two generations, but each also nds surprisingly strong evidencefor various forms of resilience. Davie takes us on a voyage to explore the iceberg of vicarious religion that lurks beneath the tip of sparse church participation. Established religious tradi- tions are still primary purveyors of rituals and symbols that mark the lives of individuals and communities, even those who only seldom participate. Al-though her study draws largely on European experience, others may recognizethis \"vicarious religion,\" as well. Religious symbols and rituals are culturallyavailable both to frame predictable life events and to interpret unexpectedtragedies. Even religious institutions that appear quite weak may neverthelessremain powerful producers of religious culture. The populations of Italy and Spain are no less eager than English ones to construct religiosity their own way. They are no longer inclined to participate inconfession, for instance, and the Church has therefore lost a powerful mecha-nism by which it offered routine moral guidance over everyday life. Pace notesthat \"the meanings Italian and Spanish Catholics attribute to their religiona r e... increasingly disconnected from the Church 's moral authority.\" But that does not mean that Catholicism has disappeared as a cultural and politicalforce in society. The Church is experimenting with new ways of communicat-ing with the population, including the charismatic, media-oriented events thatcharacterized the papacy of John Paul II. In addition, Christian identity is be-ing used in new ways to mobilize political and cultural resistance. At the verymoment that European Catholics are asserting an unprecedented freedom to10 introductionchoose how and whether to engage in Church-sanctioned beliefs and practices, they are also confronted with non-Catholic \"others\" (especially Muslims) whosepresence foregrounds their own historic Catholic identities. Pace asks us tothink about the new ways in which religious and national identities are formedtoday. While the long history of established religion in European societies sets them in contrast with the United States, these religious and cultural realign-ments may not be different in kind from the renegotiations found elsewhere onthe globe. No population is religiously isolated, and few religious institutionscan legally enforce moral sanctions. Yet in the midst of that enormous culturalopenness, religious rituals and symbols, experiences and identities are beingretained, borrowed, and remade. Our dispatches from Europe raise fascinatingquestions about whether and how traditional religions retain their power. In the United States, the population that may most closely rival Europe in apparent secularity is the American Jewish community. And, as Lynn David-man 's chapter explores, American Jewish identities also retain something ofthe mix of religious and ethnic elements that an Italian Catholic might ndnatural. Even those who choose to leave behind traditional religious afliation(\"achieving\" their religious or secular identity) claim their essential Jewishness(an \"ascribed\" identity). Many unsynagogued Jews shape their spiritual and rit-ual experimentation in distinctly Jewish ways, retaining elements of identica-tion and practice\u2014dened in their own ways. Davidman allows us to ask howtraditions remain as points of reference, as sources from which symbols andpractices are drawn. She especially suggests that we ask questions about the re-lationship between a religious tradition and its host culture. Everyday religionmay be shaped as much by the everyday negotiations of living as a minority asby the institutions that seek to carry it forward. That the United States remains a Protestant country is very clear to the Jews who live here, but it is also clear to people who pay attention to the narra-tives and symbols that shape our media culture. Lynn Schoeld Clark turns ourattention to television and lm in the United States, while Mia L\u00f6vheim takesus into Internet discussions in Sweden. Clark and L\u00f6vheim both pay special at-tention to the religious practices of youth and to the way those practices areshaped by the structure of the medium within which they take place, but alsoby the symbols (and antisymbols) provided by the dominant religious culture.Religious traditions provide ways of talking about good and evil, even when thestories are \"twice removed\" into the world of fantasy. These youth have clearlynot left their spiritual sensibilities behind, even as they often view \"religion \" assomething intolerant, unattractive, and to be avoided. Existing religious tradi-tions may not be able to enforce belief, but they often remain powerful produc-ers of categories and symbols that shape the meanings these youth construct.As much as the Internet and broadcast media are global technologies, they alsodraw on individual and local religious work.introduction 11Each of these contributions makes clear that orthodoxy and strictness are by no means the only ways in which religion is present in modern society.Although some traditions thrive by constructing a subcultural enclave, otherssurvive quite nicely without strict rules, high boundaries, or an enclave men-tality. 21Each suggests that vitality may lie as much in flexibility as in apparently unchanging truths. Somewhere between unfettered postmodern wanderingand encapsulated communities lie the realities most of us are describing. Reli-gious institutions and traditions have not disappeared. Rather, plural religioustraditions and autonomous individual choosers have created a dynamic reli-gious culture in which ofcial and unofcial religious ideas and practices areshaped into everyday strategies of action. Those everyday strategies take place not only across cultural and religious traditions but also across the multiple settings in which modern people create alife. We take as a given that work, family, politics, leisure, entertainment, educa-tion, local communities, nations, and a myriad other settings create shifting so-cial contexts with various authorities, rules, and expectations. What we do nottake as given is that religion is necessarily either absent or present in any one ofmodernity's multiple public and private contexts. The contributions in the sec-ond part of this volume take up the questions of whether and how religious andspiritual meanings and practices are crossing institutional boundaries. The quintessential \"modern \" institution, of course, is the nation-state. And what Peggy Levitt demonstrates is that even these boundaries are increasinglypermeable. Not only does international migration increase religious pluralism,but religious transnationalism alters the social space in which people live. Forcenturies, conquering armies have brought religion with them, and conqueredpeoples have devised modes of resistance. The reality of mixed-up religious tra-ditions, born of cultural contact, is nothing new. But today's cultural and reli-gious contact is about far more than either conquest or the occasional strangeror missionary. We encounter multiple religious traditions in any given locationin the world, and migrants move among them multiple times over the span of alife. Migrants of all sorts bring new religious traditions into old neighborhoods;but they also remake their own traditions out of the experience of living acrossnational boundaries. Peggy Levitt's report from the eld describes the religiousworld of these transnational migrants. She writes, \"In the twenty-rst century,many people will belong to several societies and cultures at once, and they willuse religion to do so.\" They will use symbols and practices to root themselves inmore than one place at once, while each of those places will be altered by theirtransnational movement. Levitt's account provides us with our rst glimpse ofthe way religion works in a world of multiple and overlapping identities. Ziad Munson 's work on the American pro-life movement has convinced him that many of the practices deployed by that movement are religious andpolitical at the same time, that the experience of engaging in religious action in12 introductiona political context changes the layers of meaning available to participants across their lives. It may change how they view their church participation noless than it shapes how they view their political options. Symbols travel acrossinstitutional boundaries (although not always without contention), enteringthe narratives that shape action in a variety of spheres. Paul Lichterman 's re-search participants, on the other hand, are not nearly so overt in their use of re-ligious language to describe the voluntary civic work they do. Nevertheless,their subtle signals of mutual membership in a religious community establisha basis for communication and trust that shapes their volunteer activities whilealso suggesting the nature of their relationship with those they serve. Both ofthese chapters look at the constraints and the opportunities for religious pres-ence in \"public\" activities in the United States and suggest the kinds of ques-tions that might fruitfully enlarge the sociological conversation about the influ-ence of religion on public life. The influence of religion on the \"private\" sphere of gender and family has long been taken for granted, but John Bartkowski's chapter suggests that thenature of that relationship deserves the same careful examination we havegiven to religion 's influence elsewhere. Even among conservative groups wheregender and family norms are highly visible religious markers, the story is nota simple one. Rhetoric and practice are related in unpredictable ways. Expecta-tions and practices are carried across multiple institutional lines\u2014from busi-ness and politics to home and church and back again. No less than in politicsor civic life, family and gender shape and are shaped by available religiousvocabularies and practices. A basic assumption of all these students of modern religion is that we need to take seriously both the ability of institutions to produce and enforcepatterns of meaning and action and the ability of individuals and collectives toimprovise and sustain alternatives. That is, we take both structure and agencyas essential elements in any explanation for whether and how religion is pres-ent. Change, throughout history, has been born in the interstices where every-day practice goes beyond ofcial dogma, making both the existing religiousstructures and the emerging practices worthy of our attention. We side neitherwith those who claim religion is declining because some existing institutionsare in disarray nor with those who claim that religion is always best studied asan individual spiritual quest for meaning. The sociological study of religionremains concerned with the intersection of individual and institutional reali-ties, and so the third part of this volume takes up the question of how spiritualand religious phenomena are identied, named, and collectively recognized anddeployed. In the United States, the intersection of institutionalized traditions and in- dividual agency is also visible in a wide array of emerging settings in nearlyevery community. Kelly Besecke's chapter argues that small study and supportintroduction 13groups are only the beginning of the list of social contexts that have provided a space in which modern religious sensibilities are being sustained. Neither a\"disenchanted\" imposition of modern rationality on theology nor a literal as-sertion of faith over reason, the \"reflexive spirituality\" being practiced in thosespaces allows groups of liberal believers to combine enchantment and uncer-tainty into a spiritually informed way to live. Asking questions of structure and agency, of course, also implies ques- tions of power. The negotiation between ofcial religious authorities and every-day practice is often a contested one, and the contest often has to do with issuesand practices surrounding the body. Meredith McGuire's chapter reminds usthat everyday religious practices both use and address our physical bodies, andbodily practices seem often to stretch the limits of ofcial tolerance. Embodiedreligious practices may represent paradigmatic sites of religious borrowingand innovation\u2014and conflict. The very denition of what constitutes religion is part of that conflict (cf. Beckford 2003). Some cultures and institutions powerfully discourage the pres-ence of any apparently religious meanings or practices. By contrast, some reli-gious groups claim exclusive authority over the symbols and narratives avail-able to their participants. And individuals' denition of their own experiencesmay or may not be recognized as religious\u2014either by the culture around themor by the scholars who study them. In the nal dispatch from the eld, Court-ney Bender asks us to consider \"Cathy,\" who describes her experience of meet-ing Jesus on an \"astral plane\" during a Reiki session. Should this be seen as a\"private\" or \"individualized\" religious experience? Each term in that label de-serves a critical look. Why call it an \"experience\"? What makes it \"religious\"?And why do we (and Cathy) argue that it belongs to an individual person? Howdo such categories shape the boundaries of sociological investigations of the re-ligious? Bender reminds us that scholars, too, are part of the social context inwhich religious meanings are contested. No single powerful institution or culture denes the available range of re- ligious beliefs and practices in the modern world. The study of religion, then, isa much more complicated (and interesting) matter than simply measuring agiven set of ideas or counting places of worship and members. At the conclu-sion we return to the basic denitional and methodological questions that haveemerged out of these studies. Given that religion has not disappeared, whereshould we be looking for it? And what should we be looking for? How can webest account for the multiple cultural materials out of which religious individ-uals and collectivities are constructing themselves? How can we recognize thereligious and spiritual elements that may appear across institutional spheres?And how should we respond to the realities of power, including our own, inlabeling anything \"religious\" or \"not religious\"? Recognizing both the culturalpower of existing organizational actors, across social domains, and the agencyof individuals and collectivities in negotiating everyday lives, this book offers14 introductioncritical new perspectives on how modern religion is possible and how social scientists ought to study it. notes 1. For the classic treatments of the contrasts between the traditional and the mod- ern world, see Durkheim (1984), Weber (1947), Malinowski (1948), Marx (1963), and Freud ([1869] 1961). 2. This idea was rst developed by Talcott Parsons (1951, 1964), followed by Bel- lah (1963) and then Luckmann (1967). 3. On this link between context and theory, see Warner (1991). 4. Grace Davie (2000) provides a very careful look at data from the European Values Survey, assessing what they do and do not tell us about the state of religion inEurope. 5. Frank Lechner (1991) makes a very cogent narrow argument, while Steve Bruce's (2002) arguments tend to dissolve into a \"religion is weak, except where it isstrong\" scenario. 6. This reflection on the meaning of the everyday is shaped by the thinking of Norbert Elias ([1978] 1998). 7. Many theorists have identied religion 's uniqueness as a promulgator of eter- nal truths. See, for example, Friedland and Alford (1991) on the \"institutional logic\" of religion and Alexander's (1992) assumption that all religions draw clear lines betweenthe \"saved and the damned.\" Stark (2001) makes similar assumptions about truth, but bases his denition on the ability of religion to provide rewards not otherwise available to human beings (cf., Stark and Finke, 2000). 8. Among the important recent contributions to the effort we are seeking to ad- vance here are the articles collected in Personal Knowledge and Beyond: Reshaping the Ethnography of Religion (Spickard, Landres, and McGuire 2002). 9. This argument is brilliantly articulated by Berger (1969) and just as brilliantly recanted (Berger 1999). 10. This is at the heart of the dilemma analyzed by Hervieu-L\u00e9ger (2000). 11. An increasing literature addresses the religions of the \"new immigrants\" (Ebaugh and Chafetz 2000; Eck 2001; Warner and Wittner 1998). The history of urban black (\"storefront\") churches is described by, among others, McRoberts (2000) and Williams (1974). 12. There are no fully reliable numbers, but the reports compiled by the Glen- mary Research Center provide reasonable estimates (Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies 2002). 13. Sources on recent American Catholicism include Dillon (1999) and Burns (1992). On Islam in the United States, see Jane Smith (1999). 14. Gorski (2000), for instance, argues persuasively that the Reformation 's breakup of the medieval Church led to far stronger religious institutions in each of thenew Protestant territories. 15. That is, we do not envision anything resembling the \"religious evolution \" de- scribed by Bellah (1963). Such schemes seemed always to posit educated westerners asthe \"highest\" form of whatever was being analyzed.introduction 1516. Two of the key statements on the positive effects of pluralism are offered by Iannaccone (1991), and Stark and Iannaccone (1994). An overview of the arguments is provided by Jelen (2002), and a concise summary of the U.S. case viewed through this lens is provided by Finke and Stark (1992). Much of the math on which these modelshave been based has now been discredited. On the methodological flaws, see Voas,Olson and Crockett (2002). And for a historical argument on why both sides are partly right, but mostly wrong, see Gorski (2000). We will return to the more fundamental flaws in this theory in the conclusion. 17. Lechner argues that the separation of institutional spheres is the core of mod- ernization and that the influence of religion is always reduced in that bargain (Lechner 1991). This is at the heart of the lament voiced by Carter (1993) and Neuhaus (1984).On privatization, see also Hammond (1992). Gorski (2000) agrees that differentiation is the core of what secularization means, but skillfully shows why that has not always meant a diminution of religiosity. 18. See also my review of Demerath and Williams on the public \"cultural power\" of religion (Ammerman 1993), as well as their own analysis (Williams and Demerath 1991). The historical importance of religious ideas and organizations in mobilizing social movements is analyzed by Young (2002). 19. The implausibility of dividing \"public\" and \"private\" has been an important insight of the women 's movement. See especially Fraser (1990) for a critique of earlier theories. 20. A more thorough theorizing of the permeability of institutional boundaries is contained in Ammerman (2003). I have also explored its implications for voluntary and charitable work (Ammerman 2005). 21. That \"strictness\" makes for organizational strength has been widely argued, in a variety of forms. See Iannaccone (1994), C. Smith (1998), Finke and Stark (1992), as well as Kelley (1977). references Alexander, Jeffrey. 1992.

The rst concerns the canvason which I have worked, which has widened steadily. I started mythinking with reference to the urban areas of Britain\u2014more speci-cally with reference to the religious situation in Liverpool in thenorthwest of England (Ahern and Davie 1987). I then worked inmore detail on the religious life of modern Britain (Davie 1994), in abook that explored both the beliefs and the practices of British people.In 2000, I published Religion in Modern Europe , which placed the British material within the European context where it rightly belongs.In terms of its patterns of religious life, Britain is essentially a north-ern European society, a point that resonates repeatedly in the para-graphs that follow\u2014not least in the fact that northern Europe repre-sents the part of the world in which the sociological study of religionbegan, and in which the questions about the place of religion in mod- ern society were rst explored. Two years later, I had the opportunity to go further still\u2014more specically to begin the decentering of that world, an enterprise inwhich I (and the eld itself ) have been engaged ever since. In orderto do this, Europe: The Exceptional Case (2002) looks at Europe from the outside rather than from within. It does this through a series ofnon-European case studies (on the United States, Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, the Philippines, and South Korea), asking in everycase what was present in the religious situation in these parts of theworld (almost all of them Christian) but not present in Europe. As the canvas widens, the complexity of the relationships among religion, culture, politics, history, and biography begins to emerge. At the same time, and indeed as part of the same enterprise, I have devel- oped a range of conceptual tools in order to further my understanding of thesubject matter in which I was interested. In the work on modern Britain, forexample, the disjunction between \"belief \" and \"belonging\" became the domi-nant theme, an idea that was taken up in public as well as sociological dis-course, generating both a substantial secondary literature and considerabledebate. 1The notion of \"believing without belonging\" has offered fruitful ways in which to understand the religious life of both Britain and other partsof Europe, not least the need to grasp the many interrelated dimensions thatmake up religious life (religion is not a single sociocultural reality). Ongoingreflection about the current situation, however, has led me to reconsider thisrelationship, utilizing, among other tools of analysis, the concept of \"vicariousreligion.\" It is this idea that will be explored in some depth in this chapter.More than anything else, it represents an increasing dissatisfaction with a wayof thinking that almost by denition pulls apart the ideas of believing and be-longing; it concentrates instead on the subtle and complex relationships thatcontinue to exist between these two variables. In the penultimate section of this chapter, I will indicate (though not de- velop) a further mutation that is taking place in my thinking with regard to thechanging patterns of religious life in modern Europe: a shift from \"obligation \"to \"consumption \" (i.e., a model based primarily on choice) as the principal mo-tivation for religious activity\u2014bearing in mind that at least in its early stages,this shift is entirely compatible with the continuing existence of vicarious reli-gion, indeed it depends upon it. In the longer term, however, a rather differentunderstanding of what it means to be religious is likely to emerge. The precisetiming of these changes is complex and extends beyond the scope of this chap-ter. Happily the essential point lies elsewhere\u2014in appreciating that the toolsand concepts of social science must evolve as the realities themselves mutate.Indeed, many mistakes have been made in the sociological study of religion, asoutworn concepts or theories are imposed onto subject matter that has clearlymoved on but not always in the directions anticipated by earlier generations ofscholars. What Is Vicarious Religion? What, then, do I mean by vicarious religion? The term has been coined in orderto convey the notion of religion performed by an active minority but on behalf of a much larger number, who (implicitly at least) not only understand, but, quite clearly,approve of what the minority is doing. The rst half of the denition is relatively22 tradition dislodged but not loststraightforward and reflects the everyday meaning of the term\u2014that is to do something on behalf of someone else (hence the word vicar ).2The second half is more controversial and is best explored by means of examples. Religion, itseems, can operate vicariously in a wide variety of ways: Churches and church leaders perform ritual on behalf of others; Church leaders and churchgoers believe on behalf of others; Church leaders and churchgoers embody moral codes on behalf of others; Churches can offer space for the vicarious debate of unresolved issues in modern societies. Each of these propositions will be taken in turn in order to demonstrate the fruitfulness of looking at religion from this point of view. That is the task of thepresent section. The following section will deal with the methodological chal-lenges that necessarily follow if the vicarious realities are taken seriously. The least controversial of the preceding illustrations concerns the role of both churches and church leaders in conducting ritual on behalf of a wide variety ofindividuals and communities at critical points in their lives. The most obvious ex-amples can be found in the continuing requests, even in a moderately secularsociety, for some sort of religious ritual at the time of a birth, of a marriage, andmost of all at the time of a death. In many parts of Western Europe, though not inall, 3the demand for the rst two of these diminished sharply in the later decades of the twentieth century. The same is not true with respect to the churches' ser-vices at the time of a death. It is at this point, if no other, that most Europeanscome into direct contact with their churches and would be deeply offended iftheir requests for a funeral were met with a rejection. A refusal to offer either a fu-neral liturgy or appropriate pastoral care would violate deeply held assumptions. Exactly the same point can be made in a different way. In almost every country in Europe it is perfectly possible to have a secular ceremony at the timeof a death; de facto, however, relatively few people do this. 4Much more com- mon is what might be termed a mixed economy funeral\u2014that is, a liturgy in which the religious professional is present and the Christian structure main-tained but lled with a variety of extraneous elements, including secular musicor readings and, with increasing frequency, a eulogy rather than a homily.Princess Diana's funeral in September 1997 offers an excellent example.Churches maintain vicariously the rituals from which a larger population candraw when the occasion demands it, and while that population expects a cer-tain freedom in ritual expression, it also expects the institutional structure tobe kept rmly in place. The need for freedom or innovation can be seen in other ways as well. In a rapidly changing society, new rituals emerge for new occasions, some of whichremain controversial, and\u2014for precisely that reason\u2014outside the mainstreamvicarious religion 23of the church life. The churches' involvement in marking a gay marriage is an obvious example, but so too is a noticeable tendency on the part of some Chris-tians to request a ceremony at the time of a divorce. Normally this is asked forby a partner who remains attached to the church after the divorce has takenplace, and who argues that what began in the sight of God should end in thesame way. Both cases, gay marriage and rituals for divorce, put a certain strainon the institution in that they challenge long-held assumptions about theChristian understanding of marriage and the theologies that underpin this.Both cases, moreover, highlight the degree to which portions of the populationexpect the church to be the repository of ritual, even when that means adaptingto the new life-cycle realities that are part of modern societies. But churches and church leaders do more than conduct ritual: they also believe on behalf of others. And the more senior or visible the role of thechurch leader, the more important it becomes that this is done properly. En-glish bishops, for example, are rebuked (not least by the tabloid press) if theydoubt in public; it is, after all, their \"job\" to believe. The most celebrated, andnot in fact entirely justied, case of a \"doubting bishop\" in the Church of En-gland was that of David Jenkins, bishop of Durham from 1984 to 1994. To alarge extent the controversy turned on a frequently misquoted statement con-cerning the Resurrection. The phrase \" notjust a conjuring trick with bones\" very quickly turned into precisely the opposite, for which the bishop waswidely pilloried. 5Much more interesting for the purposes of this chapter is the fact that it was much easier to gain a reputation as a doubting bishop thanto lose it. The cultural expectation (on which there is no need for the press tocomment) is that bishops believe. When they doubt, something quite clearlyhas gone amiss. Similar pressures emerge with respect to behavioral codes: religious pro- fessionals, both local and national, are expected to uphold certain standards ofbehavior, not least, traditional representations of family life. People who arenot themselves participants in church life want the church 's representatives toembody a certain social and moral order, maintaining a way of living that haslong since ceased to be the norm in the population as a whole. Failure leads toaccusations of hypocrisy but also to expressions of disappointment. 6Such ex- pectations become at times unreasonable, particularly in relation to the part-ners and children of religious personnel; it is hardly surprising that vicaragefamilies come under strain. The pressures on the Catholic priest are different,given the requirement of celibacy, but equally demanding. A nal possibility with respect to vicariousness develops this point further. It is also more provocative. Could it be that the churches offer space for debateregarding particular, and often controversial, topics that are difcult to addresselsewhere in society? The current debate about homosexuality in the AnglicanCommunion offers a possible example, an interpretation encouraged by the in-tense media attention directed at this issue. Is this simply an internal debate24 tradition dislodged but not lostabout senior clergy appointments in which different lobbies within the church are exerting pressure? Or is this one way in which society as a whole comes toterms with profound shifts in the moral climate? If the latter is nottrue, it is hard to understand why so much attention is being paid to the churches in this respect. If it istrue, sociological thinking must take this factor into account. 7Either way, large sections of the British me- dia are, it seems, wanting to both have their cake and to eat it: to point the spot-light at controversies within the church, while maintaining that religious insti-tutions must, by their very nature, be marginal to society. Sociologists cannotafford to make a similar mistake. Such public attention demands that we un-derstand how religious institutions matter even to those who appear not to be\"participants\" in them. Vicariousness also prompts us to ask about the many ways in which popu- lations and their religious institutions are related to each other. My initialthinking in this respect was prompted largely by the situation in the Nordiccountries. A number of Nordic scholars have responded to the notion of be-lieving without belonging by reversing the formula: the characteristic Nordicstance in terms of religion is to belong without believing. 8Such scholars are entirely right in these observations. Nordic populations, for the most part, re-main members of their Lutheran churches; they use them extensively for theoccasional ofces (including in this case baptism and marriage) and regardmembership as part of national just as much as religious identity. More perti-nently for the churches themselves, Nordic people continue to pay appreciableamounts of tax to their churches\u2014resulting, among other things, in largenumbers of religious professionals (not least musicians) and beautifully main-tained buildings in even the tiniest village. The cultural aspects of religionare well cared for. This does not mean, of course, that Nordic populations at-tend their churches with any frequency or necessarily believe in the tenets ofLutheranism. Indeed, they appear on every comparative scale to be among theleast believing and least practicing populations in the world. 9 Two additional features of Europe's religious life lead in a similar direction\u2014 that is, to a better understanding of vicariousness. The rst picks up a point al-ready hinted at in the Nordic situation\u2014that is, the symbolic importance of thechurch building both for the community of which it is part and, in many cases,for the wider public. Few Europeans attend their churches with any regularity;that is abundantly clear. Many more, however, protest strongly when a buildingis threatened with closure. The status quo is simply taken for granted until dis-turbed. Rather more subtle, but equally revealing in this connection, are the re-actions of the wider public if they are asked to pay to enter a religious building.Worshiping communities, burdened by the maintenance of their buildings,often favor entry charges as a way both to generate income and to reduce thewear and tear caused by constant visitors. The wider public, in contrast, resentbeing asked for money on the grounds that such buildings, particularly thosevicarious religion 25that belong to the historic churches, are considered public rather than private space, to which everyone (believer or not) should have the right of access. Theydo not belong exclusively to those who use them regularly. The role of church buildings as public spaces is seen in a very different way in those parts of Europe previously under communist control. In the yearssince 1989, considerable attention has been paid to the reconstruction, in bothphysical and constitutional terms, of the churches in countries where previ-ously they had endured at best an ambiguous legal existence. This has proved ahighly contentious topic. From something close to euphoria in the months im-mediately following the fall of the Berlin Wall, moods have shifted to consider-able disillusionment as the years wore on. Conflict, sometimes very bitter, hasbeen part of the story as disputes about money and power have come to thefore. No one, however, has seriously suggested that the churches should not bethere\u2014hence the struggle to put them back despite the difculties. To concen-trate too much on the fact that in some, if not all, of the formerly communistcountries churchgoing rates have fallen rather than risen is to miss the point. 10 The real questions lie elsewhere. Why , for example, are the churches so impor- tant that they are worth the all-too-evident effort to reestablish them? One reason can be found perhaps in the crucial role of the churches in the moments just before the fall of the Wall. In many parts of Europe, a tiny andundoubtedly inltrated worshiping community had maintained a protected ifsomewhat marginalized public space (including physical space), which be-came available to the population as a whole at the moment of need, and inwhich protest could become explicit rather than implicit (Martin 1996). Inmaking this point, it is important to bear in mind the Lutheran as well as theCatholic countries dominated by communism until 1989\u2014notably Estoniaand East Germany. Both were and remain some of the most secular parts of theContinent. Yet even here the vicarious role was possible, the most notable ex-ample being the Nicolaikirche in Leipzig. 11Vicariousness can, it seems, main- tain itself on pretty slim resources, in the sense that religious institutions re-mained publicly available cultural and political resources, even in situations ofconsiderable legal constraint. The much more visible role of the CatholicChurch in Poland through the 1980s has, quite rightly caught the attention ofa wide variety of observers (Casanova 1994; Osa 1996); it was not, however, theonly way to proceed. With this in mind, I am convinced that vicariousness still resonates in Eu- rope in the early years of the twenty-rst century and will do for the foreseeablefuture. 12As a concept, it is both more penetrating and more accurate than be- lieving without belonging.13It not only goes beyond a simple dichotomy but also points to the complex cultural and political histories that are likely to shapevicariousness in any given society. In the longer term, however, this concept\u2014like its predecessor\u2014may prove insufcient. A whole range of issues need to be26 tradition dislodged but not losttaken into account in this respect, not least an increasingly discernible mutation in the religious lives of Europeans\u2014from what might be called a culture of obli-gation to one of consumption, a point to be developed later. The Methodological Implications Before doing so, it is important to look rather more systemically at the method-ological implications of this way of working. Where, in other words, is the evi-dence for vicariousness, and howdoes it operate in European societies? Such a statement immediately brings to mind Peter Berger's (2002) contention thatincreasingly elaborate, supposedly scientic, methods constrain rather thanenhance the sociological agenda. Is this true in the European case? Bearing inmind the regularity with which the relatively small churchgoing constituencyis measured as if it were the totality of religion in Britain, there are times whenI agree with Berger. Accounting for religion beyond the church pews will re-quire that we \"measure\" in more subtle and creative ways. One thing is certain: you cannot count vicarious religion. Hence its relative invisibility to those who use primarily quantitative methodologies. It istrue that ever more sophisticated survey techniques indicate right across Europe agrowing mismatch between what might be considered the \"hard\" and the \"soft\"indicators of religious life\u2014both in terms of activity (the regular attender ver-sus the nominal member) and in terms of belief (the believer in the creedalstatements of the Christian, or indeed any other, church versus the acceptance that there is probably some sort of God or spirit but nothing very specic). It was these disjunctions in the data that led to the questions about believing andbelonging in the rst place. In statistical terms, it is very much harder to gain apurchase on the elusive but continuing relationship between these two vari-ables, except to note this is far from straightforward. An illustration from the ndings emerging from the most recent investi- gations of the European Values Study will illustrate the point. 14In those parts of Europe where the historic church remains relatively strong (Poland, Ireland,and Italy offer good examples), there is relatively little change in traditional pat-terns of religious life\u2014that is, those which indicate that older people are morereligious than the young in terms of both belief and practice. In these coun-tries, the institution is still able to discipline the beliefs and behavior of signi-cant sections of the population. Hence the corresponding tendency to rebelamong young people. But in the parts of Europe where the institutional churchis weak, something rather different is beginning to occur. Two variables inparticular\u2014a belief in an immanent as opposed to a transcendent God (a Godin me), and a conviction that life continues after death\u2014reveal markedlyhigher levels of assent among younger generations than among the old, exactlyvicarious religion 27the reverse of what might be expected. It is still too soon to know whether these shifts are likely to be permanent, but their simultaneous appearance acrossmany parts of Europe at the very least invites reflection. One explanation lies inthe possibility that the relationship between at least some measures of beliefand belonging might be inverse rather than direct. In other words, as the latterdeclines, the former increase but in innovative ways\u2014new possibilities openup for newly liberated believers. In order to grasp the real nature of vicarious religion, however, altogether different approaches are required. Here an iceberg may provide a helpful anal-ogy. It is easy enough both to measure and to take note of the part of the ice-berg that emerges from the water. But this is to ignore the mass underneath,which is invisible for most of the time\u2014but without which the visible partwould not be there at all. How, though, can a sociologist penetrate more deeplyin order to understand what is going on beneath the surface? One way is to observe societies at particular moments in their evolution when \"normal\" ways of living are, for one reason or another, suspended andsomething far more instinctive comes to the fore: under pressure, the implicitbecomes explicit. Sweden, once again, offers an excellent example in the popu-lation 's reactions to the sinking in 1994 of the Baltic ferry Estonia , with the loss of some 900 lives. The shock for Swedish people, a safety-conscious and peace-loving nation if ever there was one, was immense; with no exaggeration the un-thinkable had happened. And almost without hesitation, Swedish people wentto their churches not only to gather, to light candles, and to mourn privately but also in the correct anticipation that someone (the archbishop, in fact) would ar- ticulate on their behalf (vicariously) both the sentiments of the people and themeaning of the tragedy for human living. This, for Swedish people, is preciselywhat the churches are for and why they should be sustained nancially. The death of Princess Diana in August 1997 offers a second illustration. In the week following the accident, signicant numbers of British people wereinstinctively drawn to their churches. This happened in two ways: rst thechurches became an important, though not the only, gathering point for awhole range of individual gestures of mourning in which Christian and lessChristian symbols became inextricably mixed, both materially (candles, play-ing cards, and Madonnas) and theologically (life after death was strongly af-rmed, but with no notion of nal judgment). More signicant, however, wasthe awareness in the population as a whole that multiple and well-intentionedgestures of individual mourning were inadequate in themselves to mark theend of this particular life, as indeed of any other. Hence, the need for public rit-ual or public liturgy (in other words a funeral), and where else but in the estab-lished church? The fact that Princess Diana had not led an unequivocallyChristian life was immaterial\u2014she, like the rest of us, had a right to the ser-vices of the church at the end of her life. It follows that the churches must existin order to meet such demands, ambiguous though they are.28 tradition dislodged but not lostA third and particularly poignant example of vicarious religion took place in a small East Anglian town (in England) in August 2002. Two schoolgirls,Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, were murdered by a school caretaker inSoham, Cambridgeshire, at the beginning of the school holidays\u2014an episodethat shocked the nation. The reaction of both the families and the communitywas, however, immediate. Once again they turned to the church, personied inthe form of the local vicar, who emerged as the spokesperson both for the imme-diate family of each child and for the population as a whole. The church buildingbecame the focus of mourning, offering both comfort and ritual as the devastatedcommunity tried to come to terms with what had happened. At the end of Au-gust, a memorial service took place in Ely Cathedral. At this point, it was neces-sary to nd a building that offered sufcient space for all those who wanted totake part (the local church no longer sufced for even a ticket-only service). Someform of closure, or at least a moving on, was achieved, nally, as the school yearrecommenced: the school community gathered on the playing eld as the vicar(once again his symbolic role is important) released two white doves into the sky. The crucial point to grasp in terms of sociological method is the need to be attentive to episodes, whether individual or collective, in or through which theimplicit becomes explicit. With this in mind, it is equally important to remem-ber that the examples just described are simply large-scale and often media-hyped versions of what goes on all the time in the life cycles of ordinary people.Individual families and communities regularly pause for thought at criticalmoments in their existence, frequently marking these with some form of liturgy. These are moments when the normal routines of life are suspended, when\u2014to put the same point in a different way\u2014the abnormal becomes nor-mal, in terms of conversation as well as behavior. Birth (baptism) and death arethe most obvious of these events, but conrmation and marriage remain sig-nicant for many; they offer important counterevidence to the collapse of con-ventional religion, though more so in the Lutheran parts of northern Europethan in the British case. If follows that the strength of conventional religiousinstitutions must be measured as much in these individual and collectiveevents as in weekly attendance or creedal assent. Measurement might also be made in media terms. Surely one of the most remarkable events of 2005 can be found in the huge and global response tothe death of John Paul II. And despite their relative secularity, Europeanpopulations\u2014alongside many others\u2014suspended their normal activities tomark this moment, to a truly remarkable extent. In many countries, not leastBritain, the domestic agenda was simply set on one side, while ofcials andsignicant sections of the population participated\u2014directly or via television\u2014in the liturgy that marked the passing of a life. 15Clearly this \"Vicar\" of Rome had touched the lives of many, well beyond the Catholic faithful, represent-ing on a global scale the moral and spiritual aspirations that were embodiedboth in his ofce and in his own charisma. Hence the huge response to hisvicarious religion 29funeral\u2014possibly (give the scale of the broadcast) the largest communal ritual event in the world's history. This too provides a measure of the religious ice-berg that lies beneath the often-secular surface. Possibilities for the Future What, then, of the future? Even if sociologists pay attention to the wider anddeeper range of data available to them, will we nd vicarious religion enduringinto the twenty-rst century, or will it gradually erode to the point of no return?And what factors do we need to take into account in making these necessarilyhazardous predictions? A full account of this question lies beyond the scope ofthis chapter, but two important changes should be noted. 16First, the historic churches\u2014despite their continuing presence\u2014are quite clearly losing their ca-pacity to discipline the religious thinking of large sections of the population, espe-cially among the young. And to the extent that future generations have relativelylittle exposure to conventional Christian ideas or rituals, they will be less likely tomaintain expectations about the church 's role in either their individual or collec-tive lives. Second, the range of religious choice widens all the time as new formsof religion come into Europe from outside, largely as the result of the movementof people. Populations that have arrived in Europe primarily for economic reasonsbring with them different ways of being religious; conversely, European peopletravel the world, experiencing among other things considerable religious diver-sity. The implications of both changes, internal and external, are clear. Taken to-gether, they alter the cultural consensus on which vicarious practice has rested. The same point can be made in a different way. In many respects, a gen- uine religious market is beginning to emerge in most parts of the Continent\u2014of that there can be no doubt. The crucial question lies, however, not in the ex-istence of the market in itself but in the capacities of Europeans to make use of it. It may or may not be the case that an increase in religious alternatives re-sults in an increase in religious activity. 17Either way, however, a progressively more observable trend is taking place both inside and outside the historicchurches: that is, from an understanding of religion as a form of obligation toan increasing emphasis on \"consumption \" or choosing. What until recentlywas simply imposed (with all the negative connotations of that word) or inher-ited (a rather more positive spin) becomes instead a matter of personal choice.I may go to church (or to another religious organization) because I want to,maybe for a short period or maybe for longer, perhaps to fulll a particularneed in my life, perhaps a more general one, but I have no obligation either to attend in the rst place or to continue if I do not want to. My commitment,moreover, may be strong, signicant, minimal, or simply expedient. As such this pattern is entirely compatible with vicariousness: the churches need to be there in order that I may attend them if I so choose. The \"chemistry,\"30 tradition dislodged but not losthowever, may gradually alter, a mutation that is discernible in both practice and belief, not to mention the connections between them. Voluntary institutionshave very different implications to their vicarious equivalents. Hence, for exam-ple, the shift from baptism as an almost universal obligation (at times enforcedby coercion) to baptism as a sign of voluntary membership, or from conrma-tion as a widespread rite of passage for teenagers to conrmation as a sign offull commitment undertaken by individuals of almost any age. Liturgies mutateaccordingly, though some of them more easily than others. 18 The arrival of entirely new forms of religion should be seen in this context. Immigrations into Europe are diverse and include both Christian and non-Christian constituencies. Both are important in terms of the religious life ofEurope in the twenty-rst century. The presence of Islam, however, is of partic-ular signicance, partly because of the numbers involved but also becauseIslam\u2014by its very nature\u2014is acting as a catalyst in the religious life of the hostsocieties. Islam not only offers an additional choice to Europeans but alsoalters the parameters within which choice takes place. More precisely, the exis-tence of signicant Muslim minorities has obliged Europeans to reopen ques-tions that were considered closed\u2014most notably, the assumption that religionis a private rather than public matter in modern European societies. Two exam-ples must sufce: one positive, one negative. It was the Muslim community,more than any other in Britain, that urged the government to include a ques-tion about religion in the 2001 British census. The reason was straightforward:the community wished to be known as Muslims in public life, not as a series offragmented ethnic or national identities. The Christian constituency was quickto follow suit; civil servants rather less so. 19Conversely, the debate surround- ing the wearing of the Muslim scarf in the French public school system hasprompted a strongly secular backlash. Legislation passed in 2004 proscribedthe wearing of any religious symbol in the classroom; in France, religion re-mains rmly in the private sphere (Davie, forthcoming [a]). Hence a complex set of interlocking factors that, taken together, challenge the historical model of European religion: an erosion of the historic disciplines,an increasing level of choice, the shift away from ascriptive forms of member-ship, the arrival of signicant other faith communities, and, in some parts ofEurope at least, a realignment of the public and the private in questions of reli-gion. The impact on vicariousness will be considerable; its survival (or not) be-comes an important empirical question requiring diverse and necessarily flexi- ble methodologies. A Note on the American Case A decade and a half of lecturing in different parts of Europe (both ProtestantNorth and Catholic South) has convinced me that Europeans from all parts ofvicarious religion 31the Continent understand the meaning of vicariousness (an understanding that overrides questions of translation). Once the idea has been put in place ina lecture, the responses come easily, accompanied by ever more interesting il-lustrations. Explaining the concept to an American audience is, in contrast,much more difcult; the idea of vicariousness has far less resonance in theUnited States. This is hardly surprising in a part of the world where an entirelydifferent ecclesiastical history has led to different understandings of the rela-tionship between state and church, and between populations and religiousinstitutions. The church tax system of northern Europe exemplies one rela-tionship (the public utility); the freely given (American) tithe implies a very dif-ferent set of obligations and expectations. 20 That is true. Interestingly, however, in certain understandings of the term, the notion of vicarious religious may also be present in the United States. Onesuch can be found in Herberg's classic text on American religious sociology,Protestant\u2014Catholic\u2014Jew , which refers to vicarious practice in some Jewish communities: \"In Orthodox and Conservative, even in some Reform commu-nities, there developed a curious form of vicarious observance by the rabbi,who was expected to live up more or less to the traditional standards whichwere no longer operative among the members of his congregation \" (1960,192). Clearly this echoes some, but not all, of the ideas set out earlier in thischapter. In discerning the differences, I am indebted to a conversation withSteve Warner, 21who argues there is indeed an American form of vicariousness in some aspects of religious life. More precisely, there is a delegation of re-sponsibility in terms of observance and belief, and in a feeling that religiousprofessionals should speak out (or prophesy) in public life. Conversely, there islittle understanding of the notion of public utility. As Warner notes, Jews of allthe religious constituencies in the United States are likely to understand thatsynagogues have to be paid for by their members ; they should be beholden nei- ther to the state nor to society as a whole. Americans, however, do understand that they want religious institutions to be there in a crisis, no less than Europeans. After 9/11, for example, large sec-tions in the population turned toward some form of religion at least in theinitial stages of the crisis. And whether they were regular attenders or not,American communities, like their European counterparts, were glad that theirchurches (and other religious organizations) were there (Ammerman 2002).Rather similar sentiments can be detected in the memorialization of GroundZero. Whatever is put in place in this part of New York must represent the sen-timents of the American people, not only the families who lost relatives. Withthis in mind, and despite the differences in history, vicarious religion mayprove a useful concept in the analysis of American religious life. Hence theneed for scholars in both places to consider with great care the notion of \"vic-ariousness\" itself, its content in any given society, its implications for method-ology, and the theoretical questions that inevitably ensue.32 tradition dislodged but not lostnotes 1. See, for example, Voas and Crockett (2005), which contains a summary of the major points of contention. 2. Historically, a Church of England parish frequently owned land (known as glebe land ). The income from this went toward paying the expenses of a minister. Often a rector would be appointed, and he received the income from the land. He could ei- ther carry out the duties of a parish priest himself or use some of the income to em- ploy a \"vicar\" to do it for him. The meaning of the term vicar in the Catholic Church is rather different but still has the notion of doing a job on behalf of someone else. 3. Demand for all the occasional ofces remains high in the Nordic countries, Ireland, Italy, and Greece. An account of the occasional ofces in Western Europe can be found in Davie (2000). In terms of marriage, this draws heavily on Dittgen (1994,1997). 4. So-called secular funerals need to be approached with care. It may simply mean a funeral taken by the family without the presence of a religious professional,but still containing a number of religious elements. Not all \"secular\" funerals are taken by a recognized secular ofciant. 5. Shortly after David Jenkins's consecration in York Minster, the building was struck by lightning, an event that was seen by some as a sign of divine displeasure! This episode was given extensive press coverage at the time (July 1984). See also David Jenkins's own account (Jenkins 2002). 6. In Britain, royal divorces provoke rather similar reactions; quite simply they disappoint. 7. A rather similar study of the American debate can be found in Wood and Bloch (1995). 8. One commentator, Anders B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m, put this point even more subtly: what Swedish people in fact believe in is belonging. 9. See, for example, the material produced by the European Values Study (http://www.europeanvalues.nl/index2/htm). A more detailed account of the Swedish case can be found in B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m, Edgardh Beckman, and Pettersson (2004). 10. The best sources of data on the changing situation in different parts of cen- tral and Eastern Europe can be found in the ongoing work of the European Values Study (see note 9), the International Social Survey Programme (http://www.issp.org/ homepage.htm), and the publications emerging from the International Study of Reli-gion in Eastern and Central Europe Association (ISORECEA). Some idea of the scopeof ISORECEA'S work and publication can be found in the list of contributors in a re- cent collected volume (Marinovic Jerolimonov, Zrinscak, and Borowik 2004). Easily ac- cessible English-language summaries of the changes taking place in this part of theworld can be found in Pollack (2002) and Froese (2004). 11. A similar role can still be discerned in the Ged\u00e4chtniskirche in Berlin some ten years later (see Berger 2001, 195). 12. Davie (2000) explores these themes in some detail.13. In this respect I largely agree with Voas and Crockett that \"believing without belonging\" might \"enter honorable retirement\" (2005, 25). I doubt, however, that it willbe allowed to do so (not least for onomatopoeic reasons). It will, I fear, continue to beabused as well as used in the debates that emerge in the twenty-rst century.vicarious religion 3314. See Br\u00e9chon (2002) and Lambert (2002, 2004) for a further discussion of these changes. 15. Including, unbelievably, a royal wedding. 16. These themes are more fully developed in Davie (2005, forthcoming[b]).17. This sentence evokes the ongoing and at times aggressive debate in the sociol- ogy of religion already alluded to in the introduction to this book. Secularization theo- rists argue that religious diversity undermines religious plausibility and is thereforecorrosive of religion more generally. Rational choice theorists claim the reverse: that re-ligious diversity, by its very nature, stimulates growth. The two points of view and their applications in different parts of the modern West (notably in Europe and the United States) are discussed in detail in Davie (forthcoming[b]). 18. A good example of confusion can be found in the debates surrounding bap- tism in the Church of England. Newer versions of the liturgy are clearly predicated on a model of voluntarism and work well for the congregations and families who arethinking in these terms. They are manifestly less appropriate for those still operating under the \"old\" system, for whom the explicitness of the language causes difculties for all parties involved. 19. Good accounts of this episode and its implications for policy can be found in Francis (2003) and Weller (2004). The question was included in the census and, among other things, revealed that more than 70 percent of the population in England and Wales elected to call themselves Christian\u2014a gure considerably higher thanmost people expected. 20. These systems are, of course, mixed in practice, especially in England, where there is no church tax, a certain amount of inherited wealth, and a marked reluctanceto give generously. 21.

The Church 's loss of moral authority, of po-litical power, and of active participants has been described by manyas a profound process of secularization. This chapter will bothdemonstrate the depth of the change and suggest new ways of under-standing it. In spite of recurrent indicators of individualization of be-lief, for instance, in many European countries religion seems todayto function as guardian of the collective identity and memory, even asthose same societies are becoming more multireligious. Focusing theanalysis on European Catholicism and, particularly, on the new roleplayed by the Catholic Church in the public sphere in two historicallyCatholic countries\u2014Italy and Spain\u2014I will develop the hypothesisthat Catholic leaders are accepting the idea that religious power mustwork more and more as communication. They can longer imposenorms, but they can reconstruct a romantic sense of being a society, acollective identity rooted in the Christian pattern of values, projectingunity where there is social, religious, and ideological difference. The evolution of Catholicism in Italy and Spain illustrates changes in the traditional model of authority with the Church 's declining abil-ity to enforce claims to the absoluteness of truth. It also demonstratesthe Church 's attempt to invent a new means of communicating thetruth, as well as new forms of collective and national identity. In ear-lier times, the Church supplied trusted truths, embodied in a set ofsymbols and norms that were tied to collective consciousness andidentity. Today, both the norms and the meanings supplied by theChurch have been transformed but have not disappeared.From Church Authority to Individual Autonomy It is important to begin by recognizing that the majority of people in Italy, and Spain even more so, continue to refer to Catholicism as a meaningful world.Eighty-seven percent of the Italian population continue to call themselvesCatholics, nearly the same proportion (84 percent) we nd among Spaniards.The meanings Italian and Spanish Catholics attribute to their religion are,however, increasingly disconnected from the Church 's moral authority (Diaz-Salazar 1988; Giner and Sarasa 1993; Michel 1996, 2004). They claim a relative autonomy in religious and ethical behavior that is summed up by the following testimony. \"I was there too at the Pope's great get-together at Tor Vergata this summer,\" writes a young man from Turin to an Ital-ian newspaper after World Youth Day, celebrated in Rome as part of the CatholicChurch 's Jubilee for the year 2000. It was a beautiful night with lots of young people from all over the world. There were young people cooking, singing and praying; andthere were those making love, like me and Sylvie, a French girl fromLille. I had met her the day before and when we reached the rally, itwas still daytime. When night fell and it got a bit cold, that's when ithappened. We said we loved each other, that we both had the samefaith, perhaps she more than me, and that we would carry on seeingeach other. We wrote to each other and I once went to Lille, deep inFrance, but I soon realised that she didn 't really care much about me orabout our relationship ....W h e n I was younger, I was in Azione Cat- tolica , the movement for young Catholics, but now I wonder if it makes sense being Catholic if everyone then does as they please. The Popehas very precise ideas on sex and he repeats them at every opportu-nity, but Catholics do the same as everyone else and if it wasn 't so, Iwouldn 't have asked Sylvie to make love that night and now Iwouldn 't be feeling so bad. ( La Repubblica , October 8, 2001, 14) This short account of the experience of two young people at the mass rally held in August 2001 is no different from many other stories that go untold andunnoticed. Despite the many efforts made by the Catholic Church to reawaken reli- gious and ethical consciousness, willingness to conform to the Church 's sexual pronouncements continues to decline. Some crude data will sufce to illustratethe trends. In Italy more than 70 percent of the population declared themselvesin favor of the use of contraceptives, and the fertility rate fell from 2.7 in theearly 1960s to 1.1 in 1995. In 1985, 84 percent of the female population inSpain said they used contraceptives, and Spain has seen a drop in its birthratesimilar to Italy's (Alberdi 1999; Perez-Algote and Garcia 2005).38 tradition dislodged but not lostThese departures from the Church 's moral teachings have also been ac- companied by declines in attendance and belief. Indicators of participation inthe Church have remained stationary over the last twenty years, but by 1992,religious practice among Spain 's under-twenty-four population had plum-meted to 18 percent (Maurice and Serrano 1992). The religiosity of Italians andSpaniards is often found, if at all, outside the walls of the Church. If one canspeak of religious recomposition in Spain, it should be sought in the revival oflocal cults and popular devotion, which enables whole communities to reasserttheir local identity (Albert-Llorca 1996). Only a very small minority are rmly convinced of the existence of just one true religion. In Italy, this number is 32.5 percent (Cesareo et al. 1995), whereasin Spain it is 27 percent (Norris and Inglehart 2004). Six out of ten Italians en-dorse the statement \"I would like there to be a religion based on a few funda-mental common beliefs, which would unite Christians, Moslems, Buddhistsand other believers.\" Among those who believe in God or in a supreme being,but who do not belong to any specic religion, the number who express thissentiment rises to 70 percent. To sum up, it could be argued that the Catholic Church in these two coun- tries is no longer capable of patrolling the symbolic boundaries of its system ofbelief and practice. In predominantly Catholic societies, paradoxically, along-side beliefs and religious practices, which are clearly inspired and influencedby the religion of birth (Catholicism), a relativistic attitude toward that religionof birth is widespread. This way of believing is sufciently prevalent to bedubbed \"the dictatorship of relativism \" by Cardinal Ratzinger shortly before hewas elected as pope. One of the mechanisms by which the Church formerly patrolled its moral and theological boundaries was the practice of confession. The generationsborn in the 1940s and 1950s were told this practice should be carried out on aweekly basis. But today only a very small proportion of believing and practicingCatholics go to confession. In Catholic countries such as Italy and Spain, thisrepresents a profound change. If we examine the reasons given by the intervie-wees in a national survey in Italy, we nd that many of them (almost 40 per-cent) agree with the idea that \"a priest is not needed, it is enough to repentbefore God.\" This weakening of the ties between believer and confessor in apredominantly Catholic society has produced a silent revolution in the heartsand minds of many people (including those who believe and faithfully keep toother traditional religious practices). The unexpected effects of this silent revolution have manifested them- selves over a relatively long period of time and involved at least two genera-tions. The older generation directly\u2014and enthusiastically\u2014experienced the re-forms of the Second Vatican Council. Their children, in turn, were often bornand raised in a family environment where religion was still talked about, but ina liberal, critical, and antiauthoritarian way. The unexpected results have beenthe changing shape of catholicism in europe 39far-reaching. First, there has been a weakening of the ongoing transmission of erga omnes moral models. Ethical teachings drawn up by theologians were no longer translated through confession into codes of conduct applied to people'sconcrete behavior. Second, there has been a gradual deconsecration of the g-ure of the priest\u2014with his power to \"bind and unbind\" and \"pardon sins\"\u2014inexchange for the primacy of the individual believer's conscience in dealing di-rectly with God. And third, there has been a progressive detachment of variousspheres of the life of the individual (moral, economic, political, and sexual) fromthe religious control of the Church. Without engagement with the Church 's\"specialists in the treatment of souls,\" a signicant traditional means of reli-gious communication with the mass of the faithful has been weakened. In the history of Catholic countries such as Italy and Spain, confession has played a central role in the spiritual orientation of great masses of believers.With the loss of this practice, the Church 's mode of communication is less di-rect and specic. As a result, in Italy, the priest is regarded increasingly as a wit-ness to the faith and less as the bearer of holy functions, increasingly as a socialgroup leader and less as the mouthpiece of an eschatological message (Garelli1996, 2001). Over the last generation, then, priests have lost their authoritativerole as confessors, and the Church has lost the loyal moral obedience of itsmembers. From Inclusive Identity to New Alignments The role of Catholicism in countries such as Italy and Spain has never beensolely about individual morality, however. The Catholic religion has alwaysbeen an important symbolic resource in the construction of the collective na-tional identity, as well. For better or worse, it has helped to strengthen the mythof national unity\u2014in Spain, since the Reconquista, and in Italy, since the ori-gins of the nation-state after the Risorgimento in 1861. To paraphrase a well-known expression coined by the Italian philosopher Benedetto Croce, we can- not not call ourselves Catholics . This attitude was widely held and continues to be so. It represents a generally shared symbolic code that goes beyond the bitterand violent ideological conflicts that have afflicted Italy and Spain in moderntimes. This widespread attitude has been the object of political mobilization from time to time. Sometimes it has been used to celebrate the structural embodi-ment of a fused religious and national identity, stronger since its origins inSpanish history, more controversial and contorted as regards Italy. In Spain,since the fteenth century national identity has been based on the idea of pu-rity of bloodstock (i.e., no more Jewish or Muslim blood) and closely identiedwith Catholicism, whereas the birth of the modern Italian nation in 1861 wasstrongly opposed by the Catholic Church. Rome became the capital of Italy only40 tradition dislodged but not lostafter a hard-fought battle with the Vatican. In both countries, however, Catholi- cism came to be used to mark the boundaries, both symbolic and territorial, ofareas of Catholic predominance over against socialist-communist hegemony.The attitude we cannot not call ourselves Catholics is based on a belief system and a socioreligious organization with ramications throughout the whole of soci-ety, a society historically governed and administered by the Catholic Church,with a close correlation between Catholic collective identity and the politicalactivities of the Catholic Church. In a parallel way, the socialist-communist collective identity operated as a \"secular church \" that was encompassing in its own way. For some generationspeople were simply accustomed to blurring the distinction between a religiousprocession and a political meeting in the local square, between holy shrinesand public places, accustomed to seeing priests directly engaged in politics atthe same time that rabid anticlericals were whipping up messianic feelings ofliberation from social or political oppression. During this historical phase, dominated by the modern religious wars, the imagination and the identity of an individual were molded according tothe paradigm of inclusion . In a social system polarized between two opposing blocs, an individual could not help but side with one or the other. Not to do somight jeopardize one's social success. If you were part of a subculture, whetherred(the communists) or white (the Catholics), you belonged to a kind of ex- tended family , each opposed to the other. In each, it was possible to identify with a community and build together a model of society that reflected your systemof beliefs (Pace 1998). The individual was included in a well-structuredrelational system that directed everyday action in the name of different socio-religious cosmologies. Catholicism, in postwar Italy and Spain at least, wasone form of organic cosmology existing in opposition to the other one, that ofsocialist-communist inspiration (Casanova 1985; Duocastella 1967; Perez-Rico1977). For a certain period in modern history, then, it was possible to speak of \"the religion of the Italians\" or \"the religion of the Spaniards.\" The myth of collectiveconsciousness (both national and modern), the social practices it fostered, andthe individual's imagination where it lodged together formed a kind of ideal tri-angle. Religious identity entailed a complex formula with multiple functions. Itcould be used to refer to what is usually termed religion\u2014the religion of theCatholic Church\u2014but also to the secular belief systems spawned by politicalideologies and to cultural identities rooted in organic community subcultures.It is necessary to understand fully the historical signicance of the complex roleplayed by religion in Italy and Spain (albeit with many diachronic and structuraldifferences between the two) in order to grasp the process of change that thesepredominantly Catholic societies have undergone over the last twenty or thirtyyears. Such a period may be short compared with the long flow of history, butfor this very reason it has been convulsive and contradictory.the changing shape of catholicism in europe 41The end of the old organic order is conventionally dated in Italy from the 1974 referendum, which saw a substantial majority (more than 60 percent)vote to approve the divorce law. This was seen as the start of a process of indi-vidualization of belief, as even believing, practicing Catholics, lauding the in-novations of the Second Vatican Council, began to discover that \"obedience isno longer a virtue\" (Milani 1968). For a new generation of communists and so-cialists, the repression of Dubcek's Prague, in 1968, was an equally unsettlingevent. They, too, rebelled and refused to obey their elders. In both cases, thetruth of the respective belief systems no longer appeared absolute; people be-gan to think differently and felt a growing need for independence. This coincided favorably with modern ways of thinking and individualist lifestyles. There was a shift from inclusion , which stratied individuals into two great blocs of collective belief (the two churches ), as people broke away from the meaning networks, which had protected and surrounded them for a consider-able length of time. This shift from stratication to differentiation meant thatfor the rst time there was pluralism within Catholicism (De Sandre 2003;Garelli, Guizzardi, and Pace 2003). Likewise, in the left-wing community, thenew generation \"secularized\" politics, questioning the ipse dixit of communistorthodoxy. New generations sprang up and began to \"run their own businesses\"as regards ethics, politics, and religion. Within this new context, it was also possible to discuss modern principles of separation between church and state and the neutrality and universality ofthe law with regard to religious institutions or groups. In 1984, for example, areform of the 1929 Concordat profoundly changed the relationship betweenthe Catholic Church and the Italian state. The article that recognized Catholi-cism as the state religion was struck out, and there was agreement to graduallyabandon the system of so-called admissible religions (non-Catholic religionsrecognized by the state on the basis of ad hoc political decisions conferringpublic and judicial status). With this reform, the secular functions of the statewere freed from the historical influence of Fascism, which had established aform of limited sovereignty of the state in religious matters. Catholicism and New Collective Identities Over the last thirty years, then, Italy and Spain have disentangled the organicunities that bound religious and political identities together. The result of thisdisentanglement has not, however, been the disappearance of religion from thecollective consciousness, but Italy and Spain have not taken identical paths. InSpain, the end of the Francoist regime and the establishment of a new consti-tution that allowed regional autonomy considerably weakened the links be-tween Catholic identity and national identity. In Italy, a somewhat paradoxicalphenomenon occurred. After the collapse of the Christian Democratic Party42 tradition dislodged but not lost(the most important political party for the Catholics), the Catholic Church was faced, in 1990, with the appearance on the political scene of the openly seces-sionist Northern League (Diamanti 1993). The Church responded by becomingthe champion of Italian national unity. It reformulated (or at least tried to re-formulate) the relationship between Catholicism and the collective memory,seeking to show that the foundation stone of national consciousness is a \"com-mon religious faith.\" The Church tried in this way to transform the politicalunity of Catholics, which it had preached throughout the forty years of Christ-ian Democratic hegemony, into a collective myth of national unity. The myth of the unity of a Catholic nation still constitutes a powerful sym- bol in Italy, but less so in Spain. In Italy, it is used both by the Catholic Churchand by the major political parties, whose leaders carefully avoid questioning itssocial and cultural legitimacy in their public speeches. When the Catholic bish-ops publicly declared their strong opposition to gay marriages and the liberal-ization of articial insemination, for example, the political parties were carefulto align their views accordingly. In Spain, by contrast, after the advent of theZapatero government, the Catholic Church is no longer able to exert a stronginfluence on political decisions. It is as if the myth of the (cultural) unity of aCatholic nation continued to hold sway in Italy, in contrast to the more secularSpanish nation. A parallel gap between the two can be seen in ndings from the World Val- ues Survey (with pooled responses from 1981 to 2001, in Norris and Inglehart2004, 85). The mean frequency of prayer and of religious participation is con-sistently higher in Italy than in Spain. Whereas Italians are closer to Irelandand the United States (between 4.5 and 5.5 on the scale), Spaniards reach only3.5 on average and are closer to Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, Finland, andIceland. The politics of identity is the core strategy of the Catholic Church in Eu- rope, particularly where the Catholics represent the (at least nominal) majorityof the population, as in Ireland, Italy, Spain, and Poland. Many actions by bish-ops, religious movements, and intellectuals are aimed at the reconstruction of(Catholic) identity in a secularized Europe (Davie 2000, 2002; Berger 1999).In various countries, the Church is promoting in the public sphere the ideathat in the new multicultural and multireligious Europe we are losing ourChristian roots. During the debate on the new European Constitution, for in-stance, Catholic bishops waged a campaign for including an explicit referenceto the Christian origins of Europe in the Preamble. Despite many desperate ap-peals by Pope John Paul II, the operation was unsuccessful. There are two basicreasons for the Church 's lobbying in the European arena. First, the bishops areonly too well aware that the number of practicing Catholics has now dwindledto a minority. Second, other religions, which are new to the European panorama,are on the increase in terms of both numbers of adherents and social visibility.The number of Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus, and Buddhists is growing, togetherthe changing shape of catholicism in europe 43with adherents to the Orthodox Churches (Moldavian, Romanian, Ukrainian, Russian) and the new ethno-Pentecostal churches from Africa and Asia. TheCatholic bishops, therefore, are understandably perturbed by the considerablerisk they run of losing cultural hegemony. The Catholic system cannot, of course, return to the old organic order. It must accept the new pluralism within and outside of the Church. Modernforms of religious mobility have multiplied because of individualized belief(Hervieu-L\u00e9ger 1993, 2000); the symbolic boundaries of the Catholic beliefsystem are easy to cross, and authoritative customs no longer exist to regulatethe comings and goings of practitioners. The formerly dominant ecclesiasticalorganization\u2014the Catholic Church\u2014seems prepared to move with the times.Diotallevi and I have developed certain theoretical suggestions for interpretingthe paradox of the Catholic socioreligious situation in Europe (Diotallevi 2001;Pace 2003). Our present hypothesis is that the Catholic Church is learning toact as a symbolic system capable of interacting with a highly varied social en-vironment by accepting its complexity. Instead of trying to reduce that com-plexity and impose stable and denite norms, it has adopted a modern way ofbeing a church, which appears to work better in some contexts than others . It does not work in certain areas of social life (as Weber had pointed out), such as thepolitical, economic, and erotic spheres, where individuals decide with increas-ing autonomy. However, it is still effective in some areas of the community,particularly where the crisis in the welfare state has left gaps in providing as-sistance to vulnerable categories, such as immigrants. It also exerts an influ-ence on the sensitive issues of modern biotechnology (e.g., deciding when lifebegins and ends) and family law (e.g., the notion that only heterosexual couplescan form a family). The current socioreligious situation involves individualization of belief systems, but that does not mean simply the privatization of religion. TheCatholic Church has never ceased (in Italy more than in Spain) to play an ex-tremely important public role (Casanova 1994). In recent times, but in differ-ent circumstances, Italy and Spain have got over the recurrent \"collectivedrama\" that characterized their histories: the ante litteram clash of civilizations (Catholicism vs. communism), which restrained the development of democ-racy. When the religious sphere rid itself of its historical compromise with pol-itics and gained relative independence, individuals gained \"free circulation ofhearts and minds\" from one eld to the other and between the two dominantideological blocs. Secularization triggered a wider process of individualizationon a vaster scale. When it became clear to growing numbers of people thatit was ctitious to imagine God and Caesar, logos and demos, united, bothCatholics and left-wingers were affected. The new generation of left-wingersbegan to represent themselves as postcommunists, while still calling them-selves communists, whereas Catholics began to say, \"I proclaim myself Catholic,but I do as I please.\"44 tradition dislodged but not lostWith this shift, Catholicism becomes what Luhmann (1991) would call a code of symbolic generalization. Individuals claim the nal decision on theprecise contents of this code, increasing the range of conduct that falls outsidethe ofcial system of belief. Generalized Catholic symbols provide a collectivememory but are no longer directly linked to predictable social actions. This new generalized public religious function can be seen in the battles against gay marriage (in Spain) and against articial insemination techniques(in Italy). These efforts represent for the Catholic Church not only a dramaticdefence of the ethical values it sees as attacked by secularism in Europe butalso the test case for measuring whether the Church can use its power of sym-bolic communication to create and extend a consensus around ethical issues.The measure of this new means of communication is not only the ability tomobilize the public around these issues but also the ability to be flexible inlinking Catholic beliefs with many different socioreligious constituencies. A good example is the issue of gay couples. In Spain, 60 percent of the population continues to support the government's proposal to recognize gaymarriages, despite the protest demonstrations by Catholics (led in June 2005,in Madrid, by certain bishops taking a public role for the rst time). In Italy, onthe other hand, nothing of the like has been seen, since no political party of anyelectoral importance has mentioned gay marriages as such. At the very most,they speak in terms of a cohabitation agreement (along the lines of French leg-islation). The difference is by no means unimportant. The question of whetheror not gay marriages should be allowed, in fact, covers a whole range of opin-ions, which do not necessarily coincide with the views of church religion. TheCatholic Church in Italy uses \"yes or no to gay marriages\" as a means of settingup a united front of public opinion that goes beyond the Catholics who go tochurch every Sunday and take part in Catholic associations and movements. InSpain, on the other hand, the \"yes-no\" formula is unable to split the combinedforces of liberals, progressive Catholics, and socialists. In this role, then, the Church seeks to act in the public sphere as the spe- cialist in public ethics. It is also the repository of widely shared values, whichare not necessarily Catholic or with an exclusively Catholic copyright. And itacts as the safeguard of collective memory, even for those who are not great be-lievers and who rarely go to church. Its new communicative authority restsmore on expertise in public ethics than in theology, more on symbolic mean-ings than dogmas to be imposed. Achieving its goal of reconstructing Catholic identity in Europe will re- quire, of course, a more flexible narrative of sociocultural identity, one able tomeet the challenge of the contingency and complexity of the social environ-ment that is deeply transforming European societies. Paraphrasing Sch\u00fctz's(1964) concept of music (music is making music together), European religionmight become a form of communication that shapes social identity but thatwill require the virtuosity of improvisation . To make religion together will requirethe changing shape of catholicism in europe 45the ability to imagine unity among the diversities, sharing a common feeling of belonging among diverse individuals. The real miracles of a religious narrativeare not just the portentous events attributed to a prophet or saint but also, froma sociological point of view, the invention of a mobile tradition . The Church as Virtuoso Improviser of Beliefs and Identities This new kind of tradition began to be seen during the papacy of John Paul II, a charismatic leader who tried to invent a new style of communication that wouldlink the system of believing (Catholicism), on one hand, and the social environ-ment, on the other. He is what we might call a mobile personality . He was able to cope with the modern individualization of belief and imagine a new social sce-nario. We saw in him the power of communicative action and collective disci-pline managed by an extraordinary leader who had the virtue of improvisation (Asad 1993). The virtue of improvisation describes the extraordinary skills of aperson, like a prophet or religious leader, who can extend and influence the pro-cess of constructing and reconstructing a belief system. The case of Karol Wojtyla would require a volume in itself, but here two facts are worth mentioning. The rst concerns the origins of his charisma, thesecond its impact on the media. Proof and recognition of his charisma rstcame about in the town squares of Poland between 1979 and 1989. From thatmoment on, there formed around this gure a new type of following, a veryspecial type of pilgrim: the media, which took it upon themselves to transforma series of pastoral missions into a religious spectacular (Guizzardi 1983). Thepersonality of Pope John Paul II gave rise to an extraordinary combination ofcharismatic morality and a modern spirit of media communication. Its powerwas celebrated in the exceptional public ceremony surrounding the physicaldemolition of the Berlin Wall. As early as 1979 Wojtyla had made it possiblefor us to imagine an event no one thought would ever really come about (theend of the Soviet regime), but which everyone hoped would happen. In otherwords, he had crossed the threshold of the collective imagination and shown usthat a different world was possible. Pope John Paul II went on to invest the yield on the symbolic capital accu- mulated during these events in a new means of communication for the Churchitself: the organization of great collective happenings. These events conveyeda moral and religious message capable of reconstituting a sense of belongingand a Catholic identity, although the message itself was complex. In this case,the medium was the message as never before. In all probability, these large-scale meetings of the world's youth were moments of emotional identication,which do not necessarily convince participants of the specic doctrinal con-tents communicated (as we saw in the testimony cited earlier). Perhaps moreefcacious was the pope's opposition to the second Gulf War. In Spain and46 tradition dislodged but not lostItaly, his outspoken opposition helped to create a collective spirit without equal in other European countries. It was not so important what he actually said;he became a public icon for believers and nonbelievers, Catholics and non-Catholics alike. To some extent, this supports Jos\u00e9 Casanova's (1994) well-known thesis on the public dimension of religions in the contemporary world. From a mobile personality we can expect a mobile system of symbolic boundaries. In other words, a charismatic leader may cross thresholds andboundaries that previously appeared to be impenetrable. Paradoxically, by sodoing he creates a type of language (or communicative strategy) that constantlyquestions accepted beliefs and well-consolidated styles of communication. Itis no mystery that the communicative style used by Pope John Paul II raisedmany an eyebrow in the well-tempered environment of the Roman Curia.Many clergymen were doubtful whether the crowds that gathered were reallythere to listen to his words or only to pay homage to his personality. Neverthe-less, his mobile personality was able to transform what had previously beenunthinkable and impossible into events that could be imagined as possible.His real breakthrough was to overcome the modern view that had relegated re-ligion to the private sphere and attributed a declining role to religion in the lifeof society. In this he succeeded in convincing a good part of European publicopinion. In European society, where the authority of the Catholic Church haslong been in a situation of crisis, charisma has attempted to ll in the gaps andrestore by other means the virtue of obedience. We will see whether the opera-tion has been successful in the workings of the new pope. In this sense, a mobile personality challenges modernity and its limits (Am- merman 2003; Seligman 2000). He is able, in fact, to move and change the sym-bolic boundaries of the belief system. Through the virtue of improvisation, heinvents a new means of communication that, on one hand, mobilizes the sym-bolic resources, preexistent in the system and in its relation with the socioreli-gious environment, and, on the other, transforms the available and receivedpatterns of symbols into a new moral shape. Like the charismatic prophetsWeber (1961) described, however, this experimentation can be risky. A mobilepersonality is characterized by an aleatory impulse: he takes a risk to offer a newdenition of social identity to a people that perceives its own identity at risk. Traditional religious authority, as we have seen, is no longer possible in Italy and Spain. Legal and societal power has been transformed into the moreelusive power of religious communication. The principle of authority hasmoved outward to the relationship between system and environment; it is nolonger based on the code of truth but on personal charisma, in our case KarolWojtyla's charisma. As with any charismatic leader, of course, the problem ishow to replace his personal charisma after his death or, in sociological terms,how to reinvest the symbolic capital created by his charismatic leadership. Through John Paul II's charismatic leadership the Catholic Church tested the possibilities of the power of communication. Instead of invoking the authoritythe changing shape of catholicism in europe 47of Church dogma, can members of the ecclesiastical hierarchy assert them- selves as guardians of the identity and collective memory of an entire people?Can they be seen as the promoters of the civil religion of the nation, particularlyfor those nations that until now have been seen as Catholic? If so, Catholicism might become a means of communication that enables Europeans to imagine thatthe social situation is united when it is actually highly differentiated. The Catholic Church could play the role (as religious actor, among others) of being a reser-voir of European memory. That memory is being contested, however, as Euro-peans are confronting Islam. Increasingly there is a new Other against whichwe are dening ourselves. The Church 's ability to act as a flexible, mobile, im-proviser of symbols (drawing on the reservoir widely available in the culture)implies that it will be a player in the production of new collective identities inItaly, Spain, and elsewhere. What we do not know is whether those identitieswill creatively include Muslims (and others) in European identity or whetherMuslims will simply unite disparate Catholics (and other Christians) in an imag-ined collective unity against a religious outsider. In any case, religious, cultural, and social identity will continue to be shaped and reshaped by the communicative powers of religious leaders. In this sense,it seems to me, a system of belief is not so much a well-dened essence (ares) as it is a mixed, relational, inventive, and mobile process. At any moment, beliefsare challenged both by diffusion from one sociocultural environment to an-other and by the process of individualization. Through the virtuosity of im-provisation, leaders take risks in order to reduce risk, recognizing contingen- cies in order to supply new symbolic resources to those with whom they seek to communicate. Although they cannot impose either moral behavior or collec-tive memory, a considerable range of communicative power is still available tothem. In spite of what looks like secularization, religious symbols and identi-ties remain highly salient in Italy and Spain. references Alberdi, In Identit\u00e9s Paris: La D\u00e9couverte.

It had been the rst snowfall,and it was thirty-two degrees so as we walked through the forestthe branches were covered with ice, and sun was hitting them,and it was like walking through a forest of diamonds. It wascompletely sparkling the entire time. And as we came out ontothe ledge the sky was bright blue and the valley still had all thecolors so it was yellow and orange and my friend and I burst intotears. It was jus t...i t was a time I had a sense that there is something that is so big and so good, you know, and that sensethat is renewed every weekend I go an d...t h e birds, it's just an incredible experience always and it's what lls me and renewsme and I come off the mountain and people say, \"Oh you soundinspired and it is truly inspirational.\" And I think, I guess, if reli-gion were going to play a role in my life, that's what it would need to bring to me. And I think there are pieces of Judaism as I understand it that sort of t with how I think, like how lifeshould be lived, which probably helps to keep that connection. This woman is one of thirty people I interviewed during the fall of 2001. Mostly third-generation Jewish Americans, and all living in theRhode Island area, they had responded to an advertisement in themain local newspaper, the Providence Journal . The ad read, \" Are you Jewish and unafliated with a synagogue? A Brown professor is writ-ing a book on cultural Jews and is seeking to interview people aged twenty-ve and over. All interviewees are guaranteed anonymity and conden- tiality. Please call Professor Lynn Davidman [phone number].\" I received morethan fty calls in response to this ad. I selected thirty of these \"unsynagoguedJews,\" chosen to produce a sample that had an equal number of women andmen and an age range that included people aged thirty to seventy\u2014the ageswhen most American Jews join synagogues, if they are going to. 1 The interview questions were extensive and addressed family histories, in- cluding immigration, levels of religious observance across the generations, re-ligious upbringing and education, respondents' sense of the precise nature ofJudaism (religion, ethnicity, family tradition, and culture), their current identi-cation and its basis, their ritual practices, and the Jewish socialization of theirchildren. Demographically and culturally, the people I interviewed are full partici- pants in the American culture of choice. Nearly all were at least two genera-tions removed from their immigrant forebears; they were largely middle-classcollege graduates who worked in professional capacities. Most had been raisedwithin one of the well-established denominations, although some had beenraised with little or no Jewish identication at all. How they had been raised,however, did not correlate with any systematic differences in their current self-representations as Jews. All clearly afrmed their understanding that religiousassociation and practices are a matter of choice, but they nevertheless tena-ciously held onto and enacted\u2014in various ways\u2014a strong sense of Jewishidentity. They accomplished this sense of self by choosing to engage in a variety of Jewish ritual practices that constructed and represented their own under- standing of the nature of Jewish identity. As I spoke with my respondents, several key issues arose that became the focus of the study: Why do Jews who reject the rules and institutions of Ju-daism nevertheless create practices that echo the forms of the tradition? Whydo people who are clearly choosing how to be Jewish think they have no choiceabout being Jewish? And why does this combination of ascribed identity and choice strike Americans (and sociologists) as so odd? The Inherited Theories To claim a Jewish identity and yet enact that identity in one's own way is tochallenge a long line of thinking in sociology about achieved identities (arrivedat through choices made by an individual) and ascribed identities (characteris-tics with which one is born). In general, the sociological tradition has seenthese two concepts\u2014ascription and achievement\u2014as disparate ways of con-structing a sense of self. Unsynagogued Jews provide an interesting challengeto this conceptual distinction because they indeed consider themselves to beJewish (which they see as an ascribed, ethnic characteristic), but they also make52 tradition dislodged but not lostchoices about how they construct (achieve) a Jewish identity, including the choice not to join a synagogue. From its inception, the founders of sociology presented these concepts of achievement and ascription as oppositional ways of constructing identities,and as a means to distinguish between modern and \"premodern \" societies.They argued that roles and identities in premodern societies were largely amatter of \"ascription,\" whereas roles and identities in modernity are character-ized by \"achievement.\" In The Division of Labor in Society , \u00c9mile Durkheim ([1893] 1997) described premodern societies as being held together by a \"me-chanical solidarity\" born of a sameness that derived from many individuals be-ing socialized to the same ascribed roles and seeing themselves as essentiallysimilar to one another. Modern societies, Durkheim argued, are characterizedby \"organic solidarity,\" whereby individuals who have the freedom to learn dif-ferent roles and develop independent identities are connected to one anothernot by their sameness but through their interdependence. Although organicsolidarity poses a challenge to the strength of the conscience collective , it also car- ries with it the possibility of freedom, since social actors can now choose whatto do and who to be. Georg Simmel ([1908] 1955, 149) followed Durkheim 's lead in contrasting the individualism of modernity with the traditional afliations of a group that\"absorbed the whole [person].\" Simmel viewed people in premodern societiesas being constrained by overlapping social circles, whereas the intersecting so-cial circles of modernity leave people free to become unique individuals. While Durkheim and Simmel are among those who deserve credit for identifying tra- ditional society with constraint and modern society with choice, it was anthro-pologist Ralph Linton (1936) who popularized the terms achievement and ascription as descriptors of the presumed dichotomy between modern and pre- modern roles and identity. In The Social System , Talcott Parsons (1951) followed Linton and highlighted ascription and achievement as one of the ve sets of di-chotomies, or \"pattern variables,\" individuals use to orient themselves in thesocial world. Ascribed characteristics (which people consider to be xed, im-mutable, or inherited) typify premodern societies, whereas achieved character-istics (which \"place the accent on the performances of the incumbent\") are thehallmark of modern societies (Parsons 1951, 111). The \"achievement-ascription \" dichotomy has found its way into the sociol- ogy of religion as well. Peter Berger, whose ideas constituted the dominantparadigm in the sociology of religion for a generation, claimed that religion intraditional societies presented itself to the individual as a preexisting and not-to-be-questioned fact, whereas religion in modernity is characterized by plural-ism, privatization, and the recognition that religion is a social construction. InThe Sacred Canopy , Berger (1967) argued that an awareness of multiple world- views and the accompanying sense that religion is a matter of personal choicewould weaken the hold religion had on modern consciousness.the case of unsynagogued jews 53Although this part of the so-called secularization thesis has now been re- jected by most sociologists, including Berger himself, the notion that religionin modernity is a matter of individual choice has survived the transition to the\"new paradigm.\" R. Stephen Warner, who coined the term new paradigm to describe a postsecularization sociology of religion\u2014especially for the UnitedStates\u2014argued that \"religion need not represent something in which peopleare primordially rooted. Religious afliation in the United States is not tribal\"(1993, 1078). Warner agrees with Berger that in modern societies religiousidentity loses its ascribed, taken-for-granted character; nevertheless, he andothers (such as Neitz 1987) challenge the \"old paradigm \" thesis that pluralismnecessarily leads to a decline in religiosity. In fact, the recognition of pluralismand choice may actually strengthen an individual's religious commitments. 2 Looking specically at religion in contemporary America, Roof and McKinney (1987) have spoken of a \"new voluntarism \" in which individuals feelless constrained to maintain their parents' patterns of religiosity, resulting innew heights of denominational switching, especially among Protestants. Theyalso nd support for the existence of the new voluntarism in individuals' ten-dency to pick and choose their own religious practices and beliefs within a reli-gious tradition and to \"mix and match \" between traditions. This sense of reli-gion as voluntary is further evident in the trend toward viewing religiosity andspirituality as separate from and more important than church attendance. Per-haps the most extreme exemplar of the new voluntarism is Sheila Larson, thewoman described by Bellah and his coauthors (1985) in Habits of the Heart , who claimed to have her own private religion, which she called \"Sheilaism.\" Robert Wuthnow (1988) similarly embraces the view of contemporary Amer- ica as an arena where persons search for individualized meanings they cannotnd in their inherited traditions. Comparing the religious scene of the mid-twentieth-century America that Will Herberg described in Protestant-Catholic- Jew(1960) with that of the present, Wuthnow and his coauthors (1992) de- scribe a shift from ascription to achievement in American religious identities.In a later book (1998), he argues that Americans have moved from a spiritualityof \"dwelling\" in a prescribed religious space to a spirituality of \"seeking.\" Con-comitant with this trend, he suggests, has been a decline in the signicance oftraditional religious institutions and a proliferation of special purpose groups. All these authors present a portrait of contemporary Americans as reli- gious seekers engaging in practices through which they enact their freely cho-sen religious commitments and identities, thereby escaping the limits of as-cription. It is possible, then, to see the new voluntarism thesis as consistent withthe long-standing sociological tradition of associating premodernity with as-cription, structure, and stable identity and modernity with achievement, fluid-ity, and shifting identities. Identity in modernity has become a project throughwhich individuals cobble together a self out of multiple sources through a processthat L\u00e9vi-Strauss referred to as bricolage ([1962] 1966). Contemporary American54 tradition dislodged but not lostreligiosity, then, is an individualistic affair, where no single community denes us. Instead, we draw from multiple sources to construct unique and fluid reli-gious narratives (Ammerman 2003). The irony here is that if people are free to achieve their religious identities from multiple sources, they are also free to employ their sense of occupying anascribed status as an integral part of this project. The traditional dichotomy ofachievement versus ascription may, in other words, be a false dichotomy. Theidea that an individual must choose one value orientation or another implies aview of culture as a uniform, rationally consistent whole. In her oft-cited article\"Culture in Action,\" Ann Swidler (1986) has offered a different conception ofculture, in which culture is best understood as a \"tool kit,\" a set of practical so-cial resources people can use to construct strategies of action. In this view, cul-ture is not a rationally organized set of axioms and corollaries but a series of\"recipes\" that people can draw upon in specic situations (cf. Schutz [1932]1967). The recipe may make practical sense even when it seems logically im-possible. Actually, part of the point is that sometimes the strategies stay thesame, even though the situations have changed. Unsynagogued Jews In contemporary American society, Jews follow a wide variety of cultural recipesin constructing an identity. Most no longer live in enclosed traditional commu-nities in which an ascribed identity would be logical, yet elements of ascriptionremain. Those I interviewed do not belong to communities where Jewish ritualpractice is essential to community membership or maintained through face-to-face interactions; nevertheless, elements of Jewish ritual practice are present intheir lives. The unsynagogued Jews I write about in this chapter are, in fact,structurally situated in a pluralist society that allows them to shift easily be-tween seeing their Jewishness as a matter of choice and seeing it as a matter ofascription. They draw upon various components of the cultural tool kit, someold and some new, to enact a Jewish identity. How is Judaism present in theirlives, in spite of their apparent disconnection from a religious community? Among the ingredients available in the American cultural recipe is, in fact, the presumption of religious choice. To choose to join\u2014or not to join\u2014a syna-gogue is perfectly \"normal\" for an American. Scholars who discuss the NewVoluntarism often put the word New in quotation marks as a way of indicating that there has been a long-standing tradition of voluntarism in American soci-ety (Finke and Stark 1992; Roof 1993; Warner 1993; Wuthnow 1998). Com-pared with Europe, religion in America has always been more pluralistic, morea matter of choice and less a matter of ascription. That this has been the case isa result of the \"disestablishment\" of religion in the United States (Finke andStark 1992), but it is also a product of the Protestant habits that shaped Americanthe case of unsynagogued jews 55religiosity. For Protestants, religious identity has always been conceptualized as a matter of choice. In Protestantism, children may grow up in a particu-lar faith tradition, but when they reach a certain age they are expected to de-cide whether or not to embrace that faith as their own (Wuthnow et al. 1992).The Protestant roots of American society are reflected in the widespreadassumption\u2014by the public and scholars alike\u2014that religion should be an achieved status, something one chooses. Ethnicity, on the other hand, has historically been considered an ascribed status\u2014something into which one is born. The term has especially been ap-plied to rst-generation immigrants in the United States, who were often at-tracted to ethnic communities established by people from their own country.In these communities many traditional cultural features such as language,food, and religious traditions were maintained. Among the generations afterthe immigrants, however, ethnicity has become a word that slides on the slip- pery slope between ascription and achievement. To describe this contemporaryphenomenon, Herbert Gans (1979) introduced the concept of \"symbolic eth-nicity,\" which attempts to describe a new form of identication that is expres-sive rather than inherent and institutionally supported. For Gans, symbolicethnicity represented the evolution of ethnicity from an instrumental necessityinto an \"identity marker.\" The new function of ethnicity, in this view, was togive people a hook on which to hang their identities in an increasingly largeand impersonal society. Building on the idea of symbolic ethnicity, MaryWaters (1990) emphasized the individual and \"optional\" nature of this new eth-nic form. Ethnicity is still an important component of American identity, ac-cording to Waters, but it has become a voluntary, personally chosen identitymarker rather than the totally ascribed characteristic it was for the rst andsome of the second generations of immigrants. In a later essay Gans (1994), using American Jews as his case study, devel- oped the concept of symbolic religiosity as a way to analyze whether this conceptrepresents a distinct form of identication that centers on religion. He concludedthat symbolic religiosity is in the service of symbolic ethnicity and that in the end,for contemporary third or later generations, ethnicity has largely come to replacereligion as the focal point of group identication. His concept of symbolic reli-giosity afrms his and Waters's argument that presumably ascribed ethnic iden-tication is now manifested as a matter of individual choice and allows us to seethat presumably ascribed ethnic identication is compatible with choice. In this chapter I build upon their work by showing that although the unsyna- gogued Jews I interviewed strongly assert the deeply ascribed nature of their Jew-ishness, in enacting this identity they clearly perceive it as something freely cho-sen; their views are thus compatible with the concept of the \"new voluntarism.\" As members of a religious/ethnic group, Jews have always been some- thing of an anomaly in American society. It often strikes Americans as odd that56 tradition dislodged but not lostan ethnic group could be dened by a presumably achieved characteristic such as religious practice and belief. While most other ethnic groups have been de-ned in terms of nationality, Jews have been dened in terms of religion, butone that does not conform to Protestant expectations. Although Protestant con-ventions hold that individuals are not fully a member of a faith tradition untilthey embrace that tradition, in Judaism a person is considered fully Jewish ifhis mother is Jewish. (Among contemporary Reform Jews, patrilineal descentis also recognized as a path to membership in the tribe.) Whereas Protes-tantism sees religious commitment as an individual matter to be worked outbetween an individual and God, Judaism has traditionally emphasized the im-portance of a sense of peoplehood. For all American Jews, identities are con-structed in this intersection of religious and ethnic expectations. Unsynagogued Jews, then, represent an interesting \"test case\" in which to look for choice and ascription, American Protestant voluntarism, and Jewishethnicity. These are people who have clearly chosen not to practice their reli-gion in a traditional way. Given that they have elected not to join a synagogue,these Jews look like \"new voluntarists.\" If they were like Protestants, we mightexpect these nonafliated Jews to eschew religious identity and practice en-tirely, to express some vague sense of identication that carries little content, orto be seekers with beliefs and practices selected from across religious tradi-tions. The question is how their choices may be shaped and constrained by thetradition of ascription that is part of Judaism. Building a Jewish Identity When sociologists of religion look at people who do not belong to religious in-stitutions, they often ask, \"But do they still believe?\" That predisposition, likethe emphasis on religious choice, reflects the Protestant cultural assumptionsbehind most of our theories. For Jews, that is not the right question. Judaismprivileges practice over belief, so the question to be asked of nonmembers isnot whether they believe but whether and how they practice. In the Jewish tradition, what is most important is not swearing allegiance to a specic creed but rather fullling particular ritual obligations, such as observ-ing Yom Kippur (the holiest day of the year), participating in a Passover seder,and celebrating some of the other annual holidays. Throughout the history ofJudaism, halachah (law) took precedence over belief; a religious Jew was dened as an observant Jew, one who accepted the authority of halachah and conformed to its dictates. Commentators sometimes prefer to use the term Orthoprax rather than Orthodox, since what distinguishes Orthodox Jews from others is the extent to which they follow halachic prescriptions about behavior. In the past 150 years,new forms of Jewish observance have emerged, such as those represented by thethe case of unsynagogued jews 57Conservative and Reform denominations. Although Reform Jews do not accept the legitimacy of the halachah , and Conservatives accept it to varying degrees, members of these denominations nevertheless see performing Jewish rituals,rather than professing particular beliefs, as the essential element of being a Jew. Reworking Traditional Practices It is not surprising, then, that the large majority of my respondents told methat they do not believe that Jewish identity hinges upon following or adoptingany particular creed. But it is also not surprising that they sought to performand concretize their Jewish identities through innovative ritual practices, manyof which took their shape from the tradition. Many of the practices respondentsreported involved well-known Jewish rituals, such as having a special meal onFriday night for Shabbat or attending a Passover seder, rituals that are con-ducted at home. They told me that, like most other American Jews, they do notperform these practices in halachically prescribed ways. Unlike many Ameri-can Jews, who might not perform any rituals at all, my respondents creatednew ways to make the practices compatible with their modern lives. Manyspoke quite fondly about rituals (such as Passover seders) they had learned todo with their families, which they wished to hold onto in some way. What is striking about their Jewish practices is that they did not need to at- tend religious schools to learn them, and they do not need to belong to a syna-gogue to practice them. In contrast to the way sociologists of religion haverepeatedly focused on institutional belonging and the practice of \"religion \" in churches, some of the central practices of all Jews take place in the home rather than in any ofcial religious institution. Studying Jews shifts our attentionaway from religious congregations and organizations as the sites of ritual pro-duction toward an analysis of the ways in which religious cultural productionhappens in families. My respondents emphasized that they maintain certainJewish traditions because of the warm family memories they evoke. Women were especially likely to talk about the importance of food in their ob- servance of Shabbat. Special meals were important ways they keep their ethnicidentication alive. 3Two women, for example, specied that they try to keep Fri- day night as family dinner night. Because they are so tired from the week, how-ever, their ritual is to serve pizza rather than the more traditional home-cookedmeal. As Laura, 4a social worker in her fties said, \"We actually have ...a year ago we started the ritual of Chinese food every Friday night, because I was tootired to cook dinner on Fridays. My husband declared, now that my oldest daugh-ter is in college, that he's sick of Chinese food, so now, for the past two weeks, theritual has become pizza.\" Such a lived religious practice continues the historicalnotion that Friday night is very important in Jewish religion. Instead of observingit in the halachically prescribed religious way, with blessings over candles, wine,58 tradition dislodged but not lostand challah (a special egg bread served on Shabbat), they reinvented the evening to satisfy their own contemporary professional schedules and evolving familialneeds. In general, my respondents were most likely to take on ethnic practices that particularly involve memory, family, and historical and cultural traditions.For example, they mentioned studying texts, liking Jewish language, songs,and music, displaying Jewish objects in their home, or holding traditional Jew-ish rituals in nontraditional ways. I heard about conducting Passover sederswithout necessarily reading from the traditional prayer book or even servingmatzo. These unsynagogued Jews freely chose how to practice, but many of theelements they chose were intentionally Jewish. And like other Jews, identitywas measured by practice and not belief. Creating Syncretic Rituals Sometimes the leap between Jewish religious tradition and contemporary prac-tice was more dramatic. Like most American Jews, my interviewees did notperceive traditional Jewish law as authoritative. As we have seen, they feltcompletely free to pick and choose their practices from the traditional (now Or-thodox) halachic system of ritual observances. But unlike many American Jewswhose Jewish identity is not central to their sense of self, my respondents allaimed to achieve a Jewish identity, and to do that they engaged in various formsof innovative ritual practice. Indeed, some even claimed a link between prac-tices derived from other aspects of contemporary culture (such as the New Age),or other religions (such as Eastern traditions), with the ways they constructthemselves as Jewishly identied. Here we see an example of the bricolage thatRoof, Wuthnow, and others have described as part of the New Voluntarism, butrather than renaming the new religious creation, chosen elements are adoptedinto an ascribed identity. Although their practices and rituals were not reli-giously prescribed elements of Jewish traditional observances, it was importantto my respondents to represent their observances in ways that marked them asJewish. Here we should remember Sara's narrative about climbing the mountain on Yom Kippur, a syncretic blend of deep appreciation of nature and observanceof one of the holiest days in the Jewish year. When she said that her appreciationof nature ts in with how life should be lived, she linked this sensibility with\"pieces of Judaism \" that reflected the value of nature. Her use of this phrase ishighly suggestive of Swidler's notion of culture as a tool kit. Here, Sara ex-pressed her understanding that Judaism is not one uniform set of practices andbeliefs but rather a tool kit of value orientations about \"how life should be lived\"that can then resonate with a wide variety of practices. With that tool kit she canby herself construct a meaningful observance of a high holiday.the case of unsynagogued jews 59Thus, I was intrigued that the rabbi's validation was important for her. She recalled running into the Reform rabbi in her community one day in the su-permarket: I knew him because I was taking a class he offered\u2014and I worked in a retirement community and one of the residents there had given metickets for the high holy days. I must have mentioned to the rabbi thathe had done so, because when I saw the rabbi he said, \"I half expectedto see you for Rosh Hashanah,\" and I said, \"Rabbi, I did somethingbetter and I don 't mean to insult you but . . .\" After telling the rabbi the story of her hike in the mountains, she went on, \"The rabbi said, 'I don 't think I can do better than that. And so you have my blessingto do that on any high holiday that you want,' which I thought was pretty neat.\"She had clearly chosen a highly unusual and non-orthodox way to observe YomKippur, but the measure of the value and legitimacy of her practice dependedin part on the rabbi's blessing. Even when they chose to do seemingly secularbehaviors, many of these unsynagogued Jews used a Jewish lens through whichto dene and identify their practices. Sheryl, a single woman in her thirties, provided an interesting example of such religious bricolage. 5In response to my question about whether there are any rituals, of any kind, that are important in her life, she said, I don 't know if you've heard of the book The Artist's Way ; it's a book to kind of help unblock your creativity, and one of the things thatthey recommend that you do is morning pages. When you get up inthe morning, you write three, nonstop, sort of stream of conscious-ness to get all that\u2014it's like a brain dump\u2014to get all that stuffthat's on your mind out onto the page, and I've been doing that. It'skind of odd. I started doing that, and then I was reading the bookabout Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, and somewhere in the bookthey talked about\u2014at the beginning of the month before RoshHashanah\u2014how religious men would get up at midnight and startto pray because that's when their minds would be the most clear.And I realized as I was reading that, I had kind of started my morn-ing papers on the rst day of that month ....I t i s a v e r y weird coin- cidence, and doing them has really made me see a lot more coinci-dence in my life, and I don 't mean necessarily that I believe it's acoincidence ....I continue to do this daily; it's like the Jewish morn- ing prayers. Here Sheryl described an example of a daily ritual practice that she linked with Jewish memory and ritual, although it did not derive from a specically Jewishsource and is in fact related to a practice that only men are commanded to do.She felt free both to take up this ritual and to name it as Jewish.60 tradition dislodged but not lostA Sense of Ascription Even as these Jews who do not belong to synagogues saw the performance of Jewish ritual practices as a matter of choice and reinterpretation, they felt thatbeing Jewish is not optional. A central way my respondents constructed andrepresented their identities as Jews was by insisting that their Jewishness is in-nate and immutable; being Jewish is something one is simply born into. Thereis a hardwired genetic truth to it. They believed, in the words of one respon-dent, that they are Jews because they are Jews, period. They insisted that onsome level they have no choice at all about their Jewishness\u2014at least as an eth-nic, cultural, and historical identity. There is a fascinating slippage here between ethnicity and biology. Many of my respondents started out dening Judaism, for them, as an ethnic or cul-tural identity, but when asked to flesh out what they meant by that, they re-turned to some level of biological essentialism. In my conversation with Mark,I asked, \"Is Jewishness, or Judaism, or being Jewish something you're bornwith?\" He responded, Yes. Well, I think ethnically, everybody's born Jewish. And I think we know about genetics. Certain things are going to have a tendency to bepassed along, like intellect. I mean, we are the people who rst createdthe idea that to be holy you had to be, if you will, cerebral. Or, for an-other example, there are people who have been Cohens [the name forhereditary members of the priestly caste] for thousands of years. Somaybe there is, I don 't know, like a collective spirit. Who is it? Was itJung that talked about that? The idea about collective spirit . . . Barry, in response to my question of whether being Jewish is something one is born with, said, Sure. For me, I have a sense of family, family history, and I would say, Jewish traditions and teachings, although I may not be able to re-cite them all to you now. And in society at large, I think it is an identi-cation that is ethnic. People look at people and think of them asJews, whether they're religious or not, people are thought of as Jewsbecause of the ethnic thing and the cultural things. One particularly sensitive issue in this view of Judaism as an ascribed char- acteristic is the question of conversion. If Judaism is indeed inborn, can a convert ever truly be a Jew? Belinda, a fty-year-old businesswoman, expressed this ten- sion as follows: \"Well, I don 't really think somebody can convert to Judaism .... They can convert to the religion, but they can 't convert to being a Jew, I don 'tthink.\" Cindy, a thirty-year-old teacher, similarly expressed uncertainty about themeaning and nature of conversion as an index of \"real\" Jewish identity. When shetold me that she feels she has \"something in common with all Jews,\" I asked herthe case of unsynagogued jews 61what that was. She replied, \"History, genetics, very specic genetics.\" Clearly, for Cindy, the essence of being a Jew is the ascriptive, ethnic component\u2014being amember of the tribe is a matter of genetic heritage. When I queried her in returnabout whether Judaism is something you are born with, she responded in a con-fused manner: \"Unless you convert. There are some people who convert who aremore religious than me. But they don 't have the genetics and I think that one ofthe important parts of being Jewish is the genetics. And it can get watered down,and then once it's watered down, it's less Jewish.\" The unsynagogued Jews I have been describing appear to be practicing what Gans calls symbolic religiosity and ethnicity. For them, Judaism functioned as asymbolic, cultural, and historical system around which they could center theiridentities. Being Jewish positions them within American society. Highlightingthe genetic dimension of their identities as Jews is a particularly powerful way ofclaiming a link with a great tradition and people, without having to engage in anyparticular religious or other behaviors. Nevertheless, they do engage in practicesto enact this identity and make it real for themselves and others. The Limits of Voluntarism My respondents admitted that they picked and chose the practices throughwhich they performed their Jewishness, but no matter how and whether theyperform any Jewish rituals, this is not what denes them as Jewish. Birth does.They represented themselves as members of a biologically distinct \"people.\" Inthe post-Holocaust era, interestingly, that sense of peoplehood was dened asmuch by their experience of otherness as by any other aspect of being Jewish.Here I mean a deep sense of social distinction rather than simply physical fea-tures. My respondents repeatedly answered questions about the meaning ofbeing Jewish with stories of feeling different from those around them. Karen, aforty-six-year-old reporter, said that being Jewish means \"being set apart fromother people in some ways.\" Elaine expressed the identical sentiment: \"To be aJew is to be a perpetual outsider.\" And Harold told me that part of growing upJewish is that \"it is ingrained in you that you are a minority.\" Given that outsiders often view Jews as having \"made it\" economically and successfully integrated into the mainstream society, why do my respondentscling to this sense of being \"other\"? These are people, after all, who are severalgenerations past immigrant enclaves, speak English perfectly well, and seem to be fully assimilated Americans. What in their experience makes this story of \"otherness\" plausible? In spite of economic and social success, Jews areset apart from the large majority of Americans. They do not celebrate Christmas orEaster, for instance, marking instead the High Holidays or Passover (even ifthey do so in nontraditional ways). Especially in the moments when Christianreligious practice so obviously denes the culture, Jews are outsiders.62 tradition dislodged but not lostTheir sensibility of themselves as \"others\" in America also derives from their awareness (and in some cases experiences) of discrimination and anti-Semitism.Renee, who grew up in the farmlands of Montana, emphasized that her Jewishidentity was strongly dened by her sense of being an outsider. \"I felt I was dif-ferent. There is something about me that is different as is my heritage, my peo-ple, and our history. I was the only Jewish girl in my whole school. I think therewas one other girl who was dark and had a long nose. The rest were all blond andpug-nosed. So I really always felt like an outsider; they were very good at makingme feel that way.\" In this quotation it is obvious that Renee's sense of having theinborn, embodied characteristics of being Jewish was accompanied by a percep-tion of being different and \"other\" from the rest of her community. Her treat-ment by her schoolmates further reinforced this sensibility. Sheryl, a woman who grew up in Connecticut, developed a similar sense of herself as radically different as a child. She declared, I have a huge sense of being different from everyone else. I can re- member my mother saying, when we went to school around Christ-mastime that we could sing the carols except for \"Silent Night\" andone other religious one, because as Jews we could not sing those.And, being in East Greenwich, where there were very few Jews, andnot having a place to go to be Jewish, it was very odd. It made me feellike I belonged nowhere. Because the sense of being different, an outsider, is so central to the way these Jews construct a Jewish identity, many of my respondents described feel-ing most Jewish when they found themselves in non-Jewish environments.There they often took on the role of representative Jew. Rather than gaining aJewish identity by socializing with other Jews, as is commonly asserted in so-ciological arguments, these unsynagogued Jews gained their sense of Jewish- ness precisely in their connections with non-Jews. Being different highlightedthe importance of their Jewish identity. My respondents' most profound sense of otherness emerges when they speak of the Holocaust. Both the depth of its horror and its historical proximityresult in the Holocaust continuing to play an important role in Jewish identity.Perhaps especially for these Jews, who\u2014like so many of the murdered GermanJews\u2014are largely assimilated into secular society, the Holocaust stands as a re-minder of the precariousness of their position. In spite of their assimilation,they tenaciously engage in practices that reinforce their Jewish identities. Many of my respondents perceived the Holocaust as a signicant re- minder that as Jews they are indeed \"other\" in physical and characterologicaltraits. They insisted that if a Hitler or some other anti-Semite rose to power,they would be clearly marked as Jews. The Holocaust has become, then, a sym-bol that provides them with a sense of responsibility to identify as Jews andhelp ensure Jewish continuity. In the face of such a threat they must identifythe case of unsynagogued jews 63with other Jews, proudly proclaiming themselves as members of the tribe. The Holocaust stands as a symbol both of the danger to Jewish survival and of thetenacity of Jewish peoplehood. Being other brings with it both a sense of threatand a commitment to preserve the threatened identity. For example, Susan, asingle professor in her late thirties, linked the Holocaust and Jewish survival indescribing the meaning of her commitment to being Jewish: In my sensibility there is the Holocaust, there is the Inquisition, there are ideas that people died for what I am so that I could be whatI am, so therefore there is an obligation to identify with the idea of apeople or ethnic or racial or religious or whatever kind of group youwant to call it, but you're part of this people, you were born into it. For my respondents the memory of the Holocaust, repeatedly cited in their narratives of Jewish meaning and identity, functions as a way to assert an on-going sense of peoplehood and uniqueness, whether they have chosen it or not. Conclusion Everyday religion is, for these unsynagogued Jews, both chosen and unchosen,drawn from tradition and improvised, ethnic and religious at the same time. Ju-daism as a religion has always been intertwined\u2014in the minds of Jews as wellas in the general society\u2014with the notion of a Jewish \"people.\" Whether andhowever they observe specic religious practices, Jews are attached to each otherin some essential way. American Protestants can fairly readily shift denomina-tions and change their practices, and so do American Jews. Nevertheless, it isharder for Jews to disentangle themselves from the collective aspects of beingJewish. They are reluctant to renounce a sense of attachment to ancestors, manyof whom struggled to remain Jewish in difcult circumstances, to families oforigin, and to a sense of the Jewish people worldwide. Jewish traditions, sym-bols, and myths reflect a sense of historical familism that ties Jewish people toeach other by blood, no matter what religious practices they choose. Perhaps this sense of ascribed ethnicity helps to explain the way these unsyn- agogued Jews make their religious choices. Like \"new voluntarists,\" they feel freeto piece together their own Jewish rituals and identity. They decide which prac-tices to observe; they reinterpret and re-create tradition, and they adopt as \"Jewish \"all sorts of secular and religious practices. They choose how to be Jewish, but notwhether to be. If the new paradigm is taken to entail the notion that contemporaryreligion is not tribal, then my respondents clearly do not t the pattern. I believe that the formulators of the new paradigm have perhaps inadver- tently used American Protestants, the dominant religious group in the UnitedStates, as their model of religion. Most sociological studies of religion, and themethods used to study religion, have been based on assumptions derived from64 tradition dislodged but not lostProtestant theology and praxis. As the dominant religion in the United States, Protestantism has shaped sociological study, often presuming to stand for reli-gion in general. These unsynagogued Jews suggest that questions about every-day religion should pay attention to practice as well as belief and to the compli-cated intermingling of ethnicity and religion that is increasingly commonamong immigrant Americans. For instance, desi(second-generation Indians), like Jews, have religious and ethnic identities that are interwoven. Even as theychoose their ways of being Hindu and American, what might that tell us aboutthe New Voluntarism paradigm as currently formulated? The problem is not with the observations of the new paradigm authors. They are describing real trends in American religiosity. Rather, the problemhas been the tendency within the sociological tradition to characterize achieve-ment and ascription as opposite ways of living in the world. My respondentsshow us that lived culture is not a logical syllogism. It may not be rational forpeople to claim that certain characteristics are innate at the same time thatthey are consciously choosing how to dene them. Nevertheless, the narrativesof these unsynagogued Jews reveal that culture is better understood as the toolkit of repertoires described by Swidler than as the logically coherent packagesof values described by Parsons and others. My respondents are capable ofmoving easily between the discourses of ascription and achievement. Theireveryday religion exists in a world of religious and secular choices, but it is away of being \"religious\" that is shaped both by the particular patterns laiddown by Jewish traditions and by the realities of otherness. It is both chosen and not chosen. This chapter represents one step toward building a theoretical understanding that moves beyond such either-or dichotomies. notes 1.

And Jesus went through tons of tor- ture. That is just really scary. So, watching Stigmata andPassion of the Christ reminds me of religion. \u2014Maria, a multiracial fteen-year-old from an upper-income family who had limited experiences with formal religion How do young people learn about what happens when we die? What do they think of when asked about their religious or spiritual beliefs?For many young people in the United States, religious organizationscontinue to provide a framework for understanding themselves in relation to the world and the place of both God and themselves in it. Yet young people in-side and outside religious traditions, like people of all ages, also inadvertentlydraw upon many other cultural resources that provide shape, texture, and im-agery to what can be highly abstract understandings concerning the religiousrealm and our relationships to it. This chapter explores how popular entertain-ment media, such as lms and television programs, provide one source ofsuch cultural resources for young people's understandings of religion and spir-ituality. It explores the ways in which young people, particularly those with lim-ited religious backgrounds, construct identity narratives of religion with reli-gious stories that are twice removed: originally told and recorded by a religiousgroup (often already removed from their original contexts) to form a core ofunderstandings for that group; then taken out of a religious context entirelyand utilized in the popular media's ctional accounts of novels, lms, and tele-vision programs; and, nally, borrowed by young people from the popular me-dia as they seek to express orally their own understandings and commitmentsregarding religion. Over the last several years, I have been exploring the ways teens draw on nar- ratives from the entertainment media when constructing their own religious orspiritual identities. My research team and I have done close to 430 in-depth in-terviews with teens, members of their families, and people in their friendshipcircles. I have also looked at the media that teens consume, focusing speci- cally on lms and television programs that appeal to teens. 1 For the majority of youth in the United States, participation in traditional religious organizations presumably provides a set of materials for the con-struction of a religious identity. 2But for some teens, religious institutions and orthodox beliefs have little direct impact. These teens would be counted as\"secular\" by many measures, but I am interested in the gray area between the\"religious\" and the \"secular.\" I wanted to pay particular attention to the grow-ing numbers of young people who, for example, might claim that they believein God but do not go to church or temple. They themselves resist the idea thatthey are \"secular.\" This chapter argues that we should pay attention to theways such youth construct beliefs and practices, how they negotiate amongthe ideas and images that come from traditional religious institutions, fromthe stories and experiences evoked by popular media, and from their owneveryday lives. This chapter therefore presents an analysis of the narratives of seventy-one young people between the ages of eleven and twenty who are \"not-so-religious.\"These teens have little or no connection to traditional religious institutions anddo not describe themselves as especially religious, although they are not hostileto religion either. In the larger sample, there are other teens, by contrast, whowere involved in religious organizations and identied themselves with those70 tradition dislodged but not losttraditions in signicant ways. There were a very few who were adamantly op- posed to religion, and a few who not only were not very religious but had too lit-tle to say about the topic to be reviewed here, and thus their stories are not in-cluded in this analysis. The seventy-one teens whose stories are examined werenot-so-religious but nevertheless did talk about the spiritual content of the me-dia they consumed, allowing us to look at how they view religion and spiritual-ity, the secular and the spectacular, in relation to their everyday lives. Thinking about Religion and the Media All cultures provide their participants with a range of narratives and artifactsthat articulate a particular \"structure of feeling\" that captures something of thattime and place (Williams 1961). At a particular moment in history, culturalresources\u2014from the folk to the highly commercial\u2014become part of the taken-for-granted \"strategies of action \" that inform how each of us reacts to life(Swidler 1986). Those cultural resources and strategies of action are given shapeby our gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, labor, nationality, andracial/ethnic background, among other things. But they are also given shape andcontent by a culture's popular media. Media provide an accessible language re-source as people strive to articulate to others what they nd to be meaningful orbanal, good or bad, hateful or compassionate in the world around them. Sometimes, people draw upon the \"language\" of the popular media in ways that are unexpected or resistant to culturally dominant ideas (Fiske 1987). Theymight nd in a lm about a factory worker support for their own beliefs in theimportance of unions, for example, even when the lm itself does not offer anyovert support for such a position and most people would not make a connec-tion between that particular lm and the issue of unionized labor. While theo- retically interesting for the discussion of how popular culture can be inter-preted counterhegemonically, such \"resistant\" readings have been hard to ndin actual practice. More often, people talk about media in ways that are not toofar outside cultural norms, as lms and television programs tend to echorather than subvert dominant ideas (Morris 1990). They have to do so in orderto gain the interest and attention of the paying audience. Media, and popularentertainment media in particular, have an inherent tendency to stay withinthe bounds of the assumptions and beliefs that are taken for granted, or hege-monic, in society. How people choose to talk about the media provides clues tohow they see themselves in relation to the taken-for-granted, or hegemonic,norms of society (Gramsci 1971; Hall 1980). The media therefore become implicit (and sometimes explicit) resources identifying and elaborating what a culture expects of itself. And that includesits expectations about religion. There are historically and culturally denedlimits on the discourses available for talk about the religious\u2014discourses thatreligion, twice removed 71are echoed and reinforced in the popular media. Media participate in dening and reinforcing what can count as religion and what should be seen as outsidethe bounds of religion or spirituality. Media give people stories and examplesthat provide the arena in which this \"boundary work\" can be done. Talkingabout popular media representations of religion and the spiritual gives us awindow on how teens relate to hegemonically accepted views of religion. Lis-tening to how they talk about themes related to ultimate existence and the cos-mos, about stories of the supernatural and paranormal, may reflect back some-thing of the store of religious cultural resources that span the boundariesbetween institutional and popular forms of religious practice. In earlier work (Clark 2003b), I argued that the media\u2014including televi- sion, lm, music, teen magazines, video games, the Web, and more\u2014draw uponand circulate popular religion 's tropes and narratives in recognizable ways. Forexample, consider the popular video games Diablo, Diablo II, and Diablo III. Ineach of these games, teens battle on the side of angels against demons in a strug-gle to decide the fate of all creation. Although traditionally dened religious im-ages are present, so too are images and experiences that evoke and combine witha more amorphous popular spirituality. Players of the Diablo games seek \"sanc-tuary\" in \"shrines,\" for example, but other elements of play are less clearly relatedto Christological ideas. For instance, players learn to cast spells, employ curses,and gain expertise in the martial arts. To make sense of these games, teens there-fore draw upon knowledge from a variety of sources about the supernaturalrealm, because this product itself draws upon many such sources. The genres of horror, science ction, and fantasy (of which Diablo is a part) have long held special appeal among teens. Fantastic stories of the supernaturalfrom the entertainment media are often concerned with the question, \"What ifthese things are true?\" The way these genres raise this \"what if?\" question com-bines the central questions of many world religions with what some might call\"superstition.\" What if there are good and evil forces beyond the control of indi-vidual humans (such as angels, demons, ghosts, or even aliens)? What if beingsfrom the realm beyond can provide assistance to those on earth (such as God,angels, saints, or ghosts of the deceased)? What if humans can harness thatpower from the realm beyond (through prayer, meditation, s\u00e9ances, telepathy,or contact with aliens)? This is part of the appeal shared by early twenty-rst-century popular television, lms, and video game fare as diverse as Touched by an Angel ,The X-Files , Diablo, The Matrix , and Joan of Arcadia . Each addresses the mysteries of the realm beyond and presents a myth that, although ctional,draws upon these important questions in intriguing ways. The \"what if?\" spirituality of popular media both echoes and transcends the more \"ofcial\" accounts of how the world works. An important theme inthis fare is a concern with the insidiousness of evil and the imminent apoca-lypse, a concern that clearly echoes Protestant evangelicalism 's account of thepresent and future. But we also see at work here the postmodern sense that the72 tradition dislodged but not lostmetanarratives of both science and religion should be questioned. Taken for granted in these \"what if?\" stories is the idea that the question is unanswer-able, or at least not denitively so. 3This is a theme that resonates well among some young people in a generation largely dened by its religious pluralismand multiculturalism, a generation introduced to many different ways of see-ing the world and, as a result, a generation in which some are less likely towant to make (or easily accept) sweeping claims of certainty. The beliefs aboutthe supernatural that many associate with the entertainment realm, then, arenot somehow separate from religious traditions and larger spiritual quests. Onthe contrary, the continuing relationship between media and religion afrmsjust how deeply embedded these traditions\u2014both formally and \"popularly\"religious\u2014are in U.S. culture. Of course, in most cases religion, and even the \"what if?\" invoked in the popular media, are not the \"point\" of the story; they are part of the backdrop thathelps to construct the story's myth. To take one example, many saw The Sixth Sense as a brilliant horror movie about the restless undead and the unwanted psy- chic ability to communicate with them, but the scenes in and around churchesheightened the awareness of the alternative that death could be associated withsanctuary and peace. That lm and others like it employ religious imagery todeepen an association rather than to comment on religion per se. There are very pragmatic reasons for the inclusion of references to the \"what if?\" questions in today's teen media, however. Horror and fantasy havelong been protable sources of revenue with the teen audience, and the teen au-dience's signicant buying power makes it an especially desirable market. As anadded bonus for the media industries, young people tend to consume popularmedia texts more than once. Supernatural and fantasy worlds have long beenpopular with those at a particular developmental stage in which they desiremore power than they feel they will ever have. It is not surprising, then, thatthese have become verdant genres in an increasingly demographically nichedentertainment industry, all the more powerful since entertainment is the sec-ond largest U.S. export after defense. Listening to the Teens In the welter of images available to them, what sorts of stories do teens tellabout their worlds? For some teens, the story is one dominated by the presenceof evil in the world. They pick up on what I have come to call the \"dark side ofevangelicalism,\" that aspect of popular culture in which popular religion 's spir-itualism, suspicion, and skepticism toward institutions are expressed throughstories of demons, hell, the devil, and punishment from the realm beyond. I rst began to identify this story in a young woman named Nancy. I met Nancy and her mother, Sarah Donahue, through a mutual friend and thenreligion, twice removed 73interviewed her and several of her friends who were living in Nancy's mother's house. They had all been raised in an environment of nancial and social dis-advantage. Additionally, all of these Anglo-American young people had hadsome experience of interrupted adolescence more or less related to their lowersocioeconomic status. Nancy was a teen mother; Jodie, Carl, and Mickey werehigh school dropouts who had had employment on and off; and Eric had beenincarcerated. At age twenty, Nancy had just graduated from an alternative highschool after having dropped out twice to give birth. Because she still lived inher mother's home and was dependent on her both nancially and socially, herexperience, as well as that of her friends, was closer to adolescence than toadulthood in several ways. All of these youth voiced nonconventional views about religion. All had had some contact with Christianity during childhood, but Nancy, like herfriends Jodie and Eric, had no interest in organized religion today. Several ofthem believed, however, that they had had personal encounters with the super-natural realm. Nancy told a story of having been comforted by what she be-lieved was the sighting of a guardian angel. She also spoke with concern aboutpossible punishment that might await her in the realm beyond. Eric, too, wasvery familiar with the categories of traditional religion and did not completelyeschew them. When Eric was asked the question, \"Can you think of a timewhen a TV program you were watching dealt with religion?\" he nodded enthu-siastically, and said, \" A lot.\" Jodie, who was participating in that particular in- terview, agreed, mentioning Warlock as one movie with religious themes. Eric then added that Spawn , in his words, \"deals a lot with religion.\" Spawn , he ex- plained, is a very graphic and violent program in which, he said, \"a guy diesand makes a deal with the devil that he'll come back.\" When asked how it dealtwith religion, Eric replied, \"It deals with the negative aspect. There's a lot of evilstuff in it. It deals with evil, and hell, and Satan.\" In a later interview, whenJodie was asked what television program was most like her own beliefs, shereplied, \"It would have to be The X-Files . Because, no matter what anybody s a y s... I've seen everything that everyone's compiled together about aliens. There's no doubt in my mind that we are not the only intelligent life. AndX-Files , it's just\u2014God was a higher being. How do we know he wasn 't an alien? OnX-Files , Mulder, he would say something like that, 'How do we know God's not an alien?' \" Jodie, when asked about her beliefs, spoke of alien abductionsand spirits of the deceased. But she also spoke about God as understood in amore traditional framework. \"I gotta say if there's a God, he's very cruel,\" shesaid. \"If there is a God, then why doesn 't he like me now?\" Here were beliefs that seemed clearly rooted in entertainment, existing side by side with claims that seemed to reference religion in more traditionalways. And the story they wove together was one in which demons play at leastas large a role as angels, where God is absent or cruel. A total of fourteen teensin the overall sample of seventy-one not-so-religious teens brought up these74 tradition dislodged but not lostkinds of stories when they were asked about religion in relation to the media. This group of teens seemed to view religion and the realm beyond in terms ofthe supernatural and the spectacular more than the spiritual. Nevertheless,their emphasis on evil in the world sounded very much like opinions expressedby teens with strong commitments to conservative Protestantism. Both groupstold stories about the reality of evil, and both had the sense that participating inevil in this world\u2014or even just participating in bad behaviors\u2014might result incosmic consequences in the next. Despite these religious resonances, these teens seemed drawn to the \"dark side\" more out of a desire for titillation than out of religious fear. They were ap-proaching stories about the supernatural largely out of a desire for entertain-ment rather than for religious, cosmological, or existential information. Theseteens apparently were not very interested in religion at all. They were more orless \"secular,\" in that their primary concerns were with what Giddens (1991)has called \"practical mastery\" in their day-to-day lives. These teens are not self-consciously assembling and articulating a set of religious practices as \"modernmystics\" (Bender, this volume) or as \"seekers\" (L\u00f6vheim, this volume; Roof1999; Smith and Denton 2005). The fourteen teens in this category might bet-ter be referred to as the \"not-seekers.\" Yet what is interesting to me is that rather than distancing themselves from all things religious, these teens articulated a mix of views, freely incorporatingthe importance of \"nature,\" an interest in fate, a \"what if?\" view of aliens, refer-ence to Zen or God as \"energy,\" and even citing basketball as a spiritual practice. At the same time that they were asserting that they were not interested in reli- gion and were not spiritual seekers, they seemed determined to construct nar-ratives of themselves as at least not not-religious or spiritual, either. There were other not-so-religious teens who could be characterized as \"not-seekers\" who formed a sort of mirror image of the \"dark-siders\" in theirattraction to the \"light\" side. These teens, like those drawn to the \"dark side,\"were also not very interested in religion and had little contact with formal reli-gious organizations. Yet they liked angels and spoke with enthusiasm aboutprayer, God, morality, and the Bible, and as such voiced the \"moralistic thera-peutic deism \" that Smith and Denton (2005) found to be common among bothreligious and not-so-religious teens. These young people talked about theirviews using elements drawn from television programs like Touched by an Angel and Seventh Heaven and generally did not reference the same horror or afterlife-related elements cited by the \"dark-siders.\" Some of these teens claimedthat they were spiritual, although not all did so unequivocally. There were sev-enteen in the sample of seventy-one who spoke in this way. Amber Vincent was one teen who articulated the \"light side.\" Like Nancy Donahue, she grew up in a home with a single parent. And similar to Nancy,she went to church only rarely and had little interest in religion. She nevertalked with her friends about anything related to religion or spirituality andreligion, twice removed 75said that if she received an e-mail that had some reference to Jesus Christ\u2014 even if it was a joke\u2014she would delete it immediately, as the reference itselfwas a turnoff. Occasionally she attended a Lutheran church with her cousins,but once when she went to a different Protestant church with a friend, shefound that \"they totally dissed other people's religions,\" and she decided shewould not go back to that church. Although religion did not play much of a role in Amber's life, she did iden- tify herself as \"very spiritual,\" noting that she prayed every morning and nightand had read books on self-development. \"I've always been seeking a higherlife, growth, understanding,\" she noted. She had read what she described asChristian books on self-development as well as those from \"other philoso-phies.\" She described her religious beliefs as consistent with some of the basictenets of Christianity: \"I believe in, like the Christian theory of Jesus and stuff.But I just don 't believe in everything they think is right ....I believe if you're a bad person, you won 't go to heaven. And I believe there is a heaven. So,y e a h... you should be a good person.\" When asked about whether or not she ever sought out anything spiritual in television or in the movies, she noted that she was a fan of Charmed , a fantasy television program centering on young women with special powers of witch-craft who often employed those powers to act as guardian angels for thosearound them. \"It's a show about witches, and you're relating it to spirituality?!\"her stepmother asked her incredulously when Amber mentioned Charmed . \"Yeah,\" Amber replied defensively, \" 'cause it is [related].\" Unable or unwillingto articulate how Charmed related to spirituality, however, Amber went on to talk about her fascination with the religions of ancient Egypt and with theHolocaust. It may be that the connection between spirituality and Charmed had to do with the positive use to which supernatural powers were put in theprogram, or the fact that many episodes focus on female empowerment andovercoming obstacles, or something else that related spirituality to the vaguelypositive message so central to that popular teen program. In other discussions of Charmed , Amber took a nonchalant approach to this line of questioning, noting that she would enjoy reading about how others re-lated the program to religion or spirituality, but would not pursue the matter anyfurther. As is true with interviews, it is difcult to say whether or not her \"fasci-nations\" with religious systems and the supernatural realm actually translateinto anything beyond entertainment-related interest. In that sense, her stancetoward religion may be more similar to Nancy's than at rst it appears. Amber Vincent differed from Nancy Donahue, however, in one signicant way: whereas Nancy's life experiences were colored by the economic difcultiesshe had faced, Amber led a life rich with privilege. She divided her time betweenher mother's and her father's upscale homes that were replete with well-appointedfurnishings. When she was sixteen, her father had purchased a new sports car for76 tradition dislodged but not losther so that she could begin to drive herself to the exclusive high school she at- tended. Amber had not encountered many difculties in her life, taking her priv-ilege in stride. Like the teens drawn to the \"dark side,\" Amber and other \"lightside\" teens seemed to believe that there was a relationship between religion andthe afterlife. Yet the \"light side\" teens tended to discuss this more in terms of re-wards in heaven than punishment in hell. Unlike those who spoke of the \"darkside,\" these teens seemed comforted by a sense of security when they spoke of therealm beyond. It is not possible to discern conclusively whether these views of religion, and the use of popular culture's narratives to discuss them, correlated with so-cioeconomic factors. It was not unusual to see this relationship in the inter-views conducted for this study, but taking a \"dark side\" or \"light side\" view wasnot predictably related to economic background. The quotations from Ninaand Maria that opened this chapter illustrate \"dark side\" views from two verydifferent teens. Clearly, however, the \"light\" or \"dark\" views that young peoplearticulated did seem to echo their parents' beliefs about and experiences withorganized religion. It is worth noting that several of the teens who most clearlyarticulated either \"dark\" or \"light\" views had parents who had had some in-volvement with conservative Protestant or Catholic Christianity, traditions withvivid representations of eternal rewards and punishments. In spite of their broad appropriation of religious ideas, light-side teens like Amber do not seem to be interested in institutional religion. They are con-vinced that religion is \"conning\" and intolerant. Several of these \"not-seekers\"voiced the importance of tolerance for persons of different racial/ethnic groupsand religions. Like many of the Internet participants L\u00f6vheim describes, theydene religion in terms borrowed from the Enlightenment as the opposite of open-minded and tolerant (see L\u00f6vheim, this volume). In rejecting \"religion,\"then, these teens are taking their cues from a cultural narrative shaped by an-tagonism between Christianity and Enlightenment philosophy. That these light-siders and dark-siders are inadvertently operating with motifs largely dened by Christianity is further supported by the fact that noneof the Jewish or Muslim teens tell their stories this way. Some of them are par-ticipating in their own traditions and using those traditions to narrate theirlives. But the others who were less committed to their home traditions re-sponded to media images of the supernatural in ways quite different from theteens who freely mix media spectacle with Christian mythology. They were part of the several other patterns that emerged in the conversa- tions with teens about religion and media. There were twenty-one teens whowere not at all interested in religion, the spiritual, the spectacle, or the super-natural. These might be termed the true secularists . A few of these teens noted that they were turned off when they saw Christianity in popular media, and afew found afrmation in the media for their secularism. Two teens spoke ofreligion, twice removed 77conversations they had had with friends about Jody Foster's secular scientist in the lm Contact , for example. But for the most part, these teens were not inter- ested in religion at all, rarely noticed any reference to religion or spirituality inthe media, and never talked about the topic with anyone. Some even expressedthat they were appalled or found it humorous that others believed in a super-natural realm or God. We might not be surprised to nd \"true secularists\" among teens who have little actual contact with organized religion, but their views are remark-ably similar to those voiced by a distinct subset of teens who are involved inreligious participation. Twelve teens who were being forced to go to church,temple, or mosque seemed to be having negative experiences there. In a fewcases, the interview itself had been viewed by the parents as an opportunity toengage the young person in a conversation about his or her irreligious choices,and, not surprisingly, some teens therefore resented having to participate inthe interview altogether. Many in this group chose to say little about religion,offering views that ranged from a shrug of boredom to mild annoyance at theirparents' choices to downright hostility about all things having to do with reli-gion. Some of these teens might nd some meaning in their faith tradition inthe future, but it seemed that several were on their way to becoming \"true sec-ularists\" as adults. Finally, there were a few teens who come close to being seekers. Only three teens could be grouped here. All of them happen to be Anglo-American fe-males, over fteen, and from relatively affluent backgrounds. For this group,religion was not of great concern, but they were interested. They wanted to ex-plore alternatives to what their parents believe, or do not believe, and had takensome initiative to engage in alternative religious practices or had begun to in-vestigate doing so. Like the teens drawn to the \"dark side\" or the \"light side\" ofthe supernatural world, these teens shared an interest in what might be possi-ble in the realm beyond. They were willing to entertain the \"what if?\" questionsand enjoyed programs and lms that were open to this kind of exploration.They, however, had taken more interest in seeking out information about reli-gion than the not-seekers who similarly voiced \"light\" or \"dark\" views. Understanding Not-So-Religious Teens Religious and spiritual, supernatural and spectacular\u2014the images supplied bypopular entertainment media draw on a wide array of cultural sources for amultitude of motives. There are images borrowed from traditional institutionalreligion and stories that borrow from \"superstitions.\" There are narratives thatmirror Christian theology and spaces for postmodern speculation\u2014all aimedat a teen audience that is imagining \"what if?\" This is the cultural languageavailable as teens make their own sense of the world.78 tradition dislodged but not lostAre these not-so-religious young people \"secular\" because they do not par- ticipate in formal religion? Previous survey research might have classiedthem as such. Is the alternative to call them \"religious\" or \"spiritual,\" althoughmany would eschew those labels? Just what do they tell us about how we denereligion in a culture saturated with fantastic stories? Why do so many of themfreely and energetically explore the \"what if?\" world of the entertainment me-dia? And why do many of them seem to resist giving an utterly secular accountof themselves? Why is it that the teens I interviewed who were only marginallyinterested in religion used recognizably religious discursive categories whendiscussing their beliefs? First, it seems undeniable that many of these not-so-religious teens inhabit a world that is widely open to stories that go well beyond what Enlightenmentscience would allow. They are, in some sense, spiritual. For those open to thisworld of spirit and fantasy, what they appropriate from the media is very likelyto be shaped by and mixed with traditional Christian images. Young people,even those at some distance from particular religious traditions, pick up on thefact that there is some relationship between these backdrop representationsof the ctional supernatural and what they have learned about \"religion,\" beit theirs or someone else's. Even without any institutional religious connection,these teens share in a world of Christian symbols and stories. What we do notknow is how such tacitly held religious beliefs might be mobilized in politics orother cultural arenas. Because people like these teens are typically counted assecular, we miss the ways in which fragments of religious beliefs, stories twice removed, may still have effects. What we also miss is their negotiation of what it means to be secular. For some teens it means to be tolerant and enlightened. But for others, somethingabout being secular is worth resisting. Many of these not-so-religious teens notonly articulate their views within the themes and discourses of ProtestantChristianity but also adopt a cultural equation between \"religion \" and \"moral-ity\" (Ammerman 1997). Teens, like those of other ages, implicitly associate sec-ularism with immorality. They seem to understand what surveys show\u2014thatatheists tend to constitute the least trusted category on social desirability scales.Thus, teens who claim interest in beliefs that are not consistent with organizedreligion, as well as teens who claim no interest in organized religion itself, mayuse religious language and images as means of identifying themselves as goodmoral people. Despite their decline in cultural authority, Christian religious institutions still lay claim to a hegemonically dened understanding of morality\u2014one thatoften reinscribes white middle-class experiences as normative. Because reli-gion and morality are closely entwined in U.S. culture, it may be impossible toseparate the two in any discussion of self-identication with religion or spiritu-ality. Regardless of what one thinks about the plausibility of religious, spectac-ular, or supernatural stories, disassociating oneself from them is difcult.religion, twice removed 79We have here a paradox. Young people want to self-identify as moral, so they lay claim to religious discourse. Yet because of the decline in the culturalauthority of religious institutions, the discourse they claim comes to them\"twice removed\" in the fantasies of the entertainment world. Many feel no needto self-identify with religious institutions but freely experiment with stories andideas that bear vague resemblance to the narratives they might hear if they did. This paradox suggests signicant gaps in the ways researchers do their work. We need to create research instruments that open up the boundary be-tween the religious and the secular. We need ways to assess the spiritual, thesupernatural, and the role of the spectacle (or commodied culture) in extend-ing the hegemonic aspects of Christianity in Western culture. Hegemony al-ways rests on what is assumed to be true, what we may therefore have ignoredin the past. For many researchers new questions and new methods may alsomean recognizing the extent to which our own presuppositions are shaped bythat same culture. Examining the cultural work being done by not-so-religiousteens has allowed us to leave some of those presuppositions behind longenough to explore questions of the religious, the secular, the spectacle, and thespiritual in the specic historical, cultural, and ideological contexts in whichthey are unfolding today. notes 1. In other publications, I have explored how parents have approached the media as a potential resource as they seek to inculcate their faith tradition into the lives of their children (Clark, 2003a). In this chapter I want to explore further what I think is probably the primary contribution of my rst book to the debates of secularization:contradictions that emerged as young people who were not very religious in the tradi- tional measures of attendance, participation, beliefs, or practices nevertheless con- structed narratives of their beliefs and practices in ways that borrowed from both tradi-tional and popular religion, sometimes in surprising ways. 2. According to Christian Smith and Melinda Lundquist Denton in Soul Search- ing: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of American Teenagers , three-quarters of U.S. teens between thirteen and seventeen years old are Christian, divided evenly between Protes-tant and Catholic. Their nationally representative telephone survey of 3,290 English- and Spanish-speaking teenagers between thirteen and seventeen found that faith was an important matter for about half of U.S. teens, and not particularly important for theother half. Interestingly, however, Smith and Denton found that even among teenagers for whom faith was important, many young people had difculty articulating both the substance of their beliefs and the relevance of those beliefs upon their actions. 3. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard (1984) has argued that since World War II, we have wit- nessed an \"incredulity toward metanarratives,\" which might include those of both sci- ence and of religion. There are no more universally accepted truths, he argues, nor arethere objective places from which one might evaluate one claim to truth over another.Whether or not Lyotard's arguments for the postmodern condition are as universal asclaimed, it seems clear that it is no longer possible to assume that one body of experts,80 tradition dislodged but not lostsuch as scientists or theologians, might be said to agree consensually on \"truth.\" Nor is it possible to imagine that pronouncements of \"truth \" from such groups would be automatically afforded legitimacy among a majority of those in the United States. references Ammerman, Nancy. 1997.

A corol-lary, of course, is that if families, religious institutions, and culturesbecome too fragmented, individuals would have difculties ndingreligious meaning. Although this basic pattern still retains explanatory signi- cance, studies of religion in late modern society 1show that the situ- ations in which young people grow up, as well as the religious be-liefs and practices that they encounter, are increasingly complex andshifting. Young people's lives are shaped by daily interactions withdifferent ways of understanding religious symbols and practices.Media, popular culture, and interactions with family members andpeer groups present an unprecedented variety of lifestyles and back-grounds. In this situation, religious conventions based on the tradi-tional beliefs and practices of institutionalized religion seem boundto crumble, even become obsolete. In this chapter I will discusshow such conventions\u2014despite these anticipations\u2014neverthelessemerge in discussions of religion on the Internet among youngSwedish people, and how they may affect their construction of reli-gious meaning.Attitudes toward Religion in Sweden Sweden is often categorized as one of the most secularized and postmodern countries in the world (Pettersson 2000). If there is a \"test case\" for the break-down of traditional modes of religious socialization, this would be it. A recentsurvey aiming to map \"the religious Sweden \" (Skog 2001) 2showed that during a regular weekend around 5 percent of the population engage in religious ac-tivities supplied by organized religions. 3The survey conrms that the supply of religion is largely dominated by institutionalized Christianity, especially theLutheran Church of Sweden and the other ofcially recognized Swedish de-nominations. These institutions have a long historical presence in Swedish so-ciety, 4and they still provide 80 percent of all activities during regular week- ends. The activities they supply, however, are consumed by a tiny proportion ofthe population, and the number of people who agree with traditional Christianbeliefs is correspondingly small. About 20 percent believe in the existence of apersonal God, and less than half of these believe in Jesus Christ or that theBible is the word of God (Botvar 2000). Thus, the number of people who rep-resent \"traditional religion \"\u2014that is, whose religious life is expressed in insti-tutionalized religious beliefs and practice\u2014is clearly a minority group in mod-ern Swedish society. The religious life of the majority of the population is still scarcely explored. We know that a few of them join religious groups that present alternatives tochurches and denominations. In addition, immigrant religions such as Islamor Buddhism and new religious movements gather a few\u2014a mere 5 percent ofthose who regularly take part in organized religion (Skog 2001). Some studiespoint to an increasing interest in a more broadly dened supernatural realm,not least among young people (cf. Sj\u00f6din 2001), and a majority of these peoplehave some sort of belief in a spiritual dimension or a \"force of life\" (Botvar2000). A few studies have used interviews and observations to explore theempirical reality behind these numbers (cf. Bromander 1998; Reimers 1995;Hamberg 1989). They indicate that experiences and events that evoke tran-scendent meaning for these people are handled through an individually con-structed, loosely organized, heterogeneous mixture of beliefs and practices of-ten referred to as being \"religious in my own way.\" Two key elements in this\"personal religion \" are that religion is supposed to be kept a private thing, and that everybody has the right to believe in their own way as long as it does not in- terfere with other people (Hamberg 1989). Still, institutionalized religion seems to matter, even for people who are \"religious in my own way.\" Around 85 percent of the population remains mem-bers of the Church of Sweden, and a majority of these attend at least occasion-ally. Primarily, they turn to the church for family celebrations and in nationalcrises. As argued by the Swedish scholar Anders B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m (2000), traditional,84 tradition dislodged but not lostinstitutionalized religion represented by Christian churches still functions as an \"arena\" for handling existential concerns and collective values. Through rit-uals and diaconal work, religious institutions can provide a meaningful contextfor experiences of changes in life, connecting these experiences to somethingtranscending the individual (see also Davie 2000). Studies of young people's attitudes toward religion show similar tenden- cies of a strongly declining yet lingering signicance of traditional religion. Al-though the numbers are decreasing, around 40 percent of teenagers still havecontacts with Christian churches and denominations through conrmationclasses (Sj\u00f6borg 2001). Church attendance and belief in traditional Christianteachings are, however, less frequent among the young than in older segmentsof the population. Young people are no less likely to believe in the existence ofa transcendent being or sphere, and some studies even claim to detect an in-creasing interest in religion among young people (cf. Sj\u00f6din 2001; Hagevi2002). However, young people's ideas about the transcendent are more in linewith the immanent, individualistic values and of being \"religious in myown way\" (Sj\u00f6din 2001; Bromander 1999). Ironically, the concept \"religion \" seems to be closely associated in young people's minds with \"traditional\" and institutionalized religion, especially the(Christian) \"Church.\" Kerstin von Br\u00f6mssen 's study (2003) of how pupils talkabout religion in a multicultural world shows how young people separate theirown beliefs and lives from this \"religion \" (cf. Sj\u00f6din 2001). Especially amongethnic Swedish teenagers, \"religion \" is described as premodern, antiscience,infantile, and enforcing beliefs (von Br\u00f6mssen 2003, 343). Religion is a \"sys-tem \" that limits their possibilities of self-realization and free choice. If religionis to have any meaning for them, it has to come from \"within.\" Religion is alsoused as a category for distinguishing themselves from people of other ethnicbackgrounds (340). Approaching Tradition in Modern Religion\u2014in Theory These studies show how the meaning of religion in Sweden seems to be con-structed in a tension between \"traditional religion \"\u2014largely dominated by be-liefs and practices upheld by institutionalized Christianity\u2014and \"religion inmy own way.\" This personalized religion is formed around individual needsand rights, but it still keeps a somewhat paradoxical relation to \"traditional reli-gion \" (cf. Pettersson 2000). In this tension, conventions of what religion \"is\"and how to be \"religious\" are formed. These conventions may not have the sta-bility of the \"unied system \" shared by those who \"adhere\" to the church, asposited in Durkheim 's classic denition of religion ([1912] 1995, 62). However,they do not seem to be shattered and ambivalent enough to set the concept ofreligion totally \"adrift from its former points of anchorage\" (Beckford 1989,virtually boundless? 85170). Rather, it seems as though the personal mix of beliefs and practices de- scribed as \"religious in my own way\" becomes religious not just because it ful- lls functions of constructing existential meaning and organizing life. It is alsoseen as religious because it is related to beliefs and practices that have beengiven a religious meaning by a tradition and a collective of believers. Being \"re-ligious in my own way\" is thus constructed through negotiation between ele-ments that imply a more institutionalized tradition and the needs and circum-stances of an individual's daily life. As exemplied by the young people in vonBr\u00f6mssen 's study, the meaning of religion must also be negotiated against theclaims of other, competing discourses such as science and religious traditionsother than Christianity. This understanding of how religion is conceived in late modern Sweden ts Nancy Ammerman 's (2003) discussion of religious identity as constructedin the intersections between \"public narratives\" and individual \"autobiogra-phies.\" The former are publicly constructed and shared \"accounts\" of belong-ing and meaning that are attached to groups, cultures, and institutions insociety. \"Religious narratives\" are those that invoke the \"co-participation oftranscendence or Sacred Others\" for making meaning of individual lives andsocial relations (Ammerman 2003, 216). In discussing how these narrativesform social interaction, Ammerman describes how symbols and practices inwhich experiences of the transcendent have been institutionalized, throughparticular religious institutions and traditions, become carriers of religiousconventions also in other settings. Thus, religious identities are both \"struc-tured and constructed,\" patterned by existing scripts andimprovised according to individual needs and experiences (215). This linking of religious tradition with modern expressions of religion is also discussed by the French sociologist Dani\u00e8le Hervieu-L\u00e9ger (2000), whoargues that religion as a form of meaning making is distinguished by the con-nection between individual meaning and the \"legitimizing authority of a tradi-tion \" or a particular \"chain of belief \" (82, 83). 5As she points out, however, modern society implies a fundamental reworking of the individual's relation totradition (165-67). The legitimizing authority of the tradition is now more thanbefore a matter of individual choice and degree of commitment, and the waysin which a tradition can become \"invoked\" can appear limitless. Thus, reli-gious traditions are subjected to ongoing construction and reconstruction byhuman subjects. Still, the history of the tradition or \"narrative\" can have thepower to structure how it will be used\u2014if not by explicit control, then by moreimplicit rules and sociocultural mechanisms (cf. Ammerman 2003, 222). Both of these approaches represent an understanding of the place of reli- gious tradition in modern individuals' lives that I nd fruitful for studying howyoung people understand the meaning of religion in their own lives and relationsto other people. In order to understand more of the interplay between individual86 tradition dislodged but not lostmeaning making and religious traditions described in these approaches, how- ever, we need to look into the conditions of specic situations or sites. In the fol-lowing sections, I will describe how young people negotiate conventions about\"traditional religion \" in discussions that take place on the Internet. I will focus onhow these can structure, but also be reconstructed by, these young people. The Internet as a Challenge to Traditional Religion The Internet can, for several reasons, be an interesting case for such a study.This global network of computers gives us unprecedented possibilities to in-teract, independent of the limitations of time and space. The amount and di-versity of information made available though the Internet, and the anonymityof communication through text and digital images, challenge not only geo-graphic boundaries but also the conventions and norms for meaning makingand social interaction formed through local tradition. Much of the rst wave ofscholarly literature on this subject focused on the possibilities opened up bythe Internet to transform such conventions. In the case of religion, the Internet (or \"cyberspace\") was depicted as the epitome of the \"spiritual marketplace\"(Roof 1999). Instant access to all known and yet unknown forms of religionwould severely challenge religious authorities and forms of worship based ontradition; and computer-based interaction would break down stereotypes anddivisions based on the \"traditional\" religious conventions and norms used inface-to-face interaction (Zaleski 1997; O'Leary and Brasher 1996). Thus, newforms of religion would emerge, together with increased tolerance and dia-logue between people of different faiths (Brasher 2001). Much of this optimistic, early research was based on surveys and observa- tions of Web sites, offering broad reflections on the overall phenomena of reli-gion online (Campbell 2003; Dawson and Cowan 2004). Few studies providedmore detailed analyses based on long-term observation of online interaction inreligious discussion groups, news groups, or chat rooms. Later studies havesuggested that online interaction can provide new opportunities to strengthenand develop religious beliefs, as well as supplying new forms of community,not least for those (like religious minority groups) for whom this possibility islimited in the local context (Campbell 2001; Fernback 2002; O'Leary [1996]2004; Berger and Ezzy 2004). While these studies have tended to focus on users within a certain reli- gious tradition, and who interact in relatively separated online contexts (suchas e-mail lists or specic news groups), the study that is to be discussed herefocuses on discussions of religion in a different setting. During the year 2000I followed discussion on religion on a popular Swedish Web community foryouth. Here, thousands of young people from different backgrounds logged onvirtually boundless? 87daily. During the time of the study, the Web community I will refer to as \"the Site\" had more than half a million members.6Anyone could register as a mem ber of the Site through submitting a nickname and an e-mail address. Data such asgender and age were optional. Members had access to a personal Web site,a system of instant messages, and groups to discuss subjects ranging fromlollipops to Jesus. Any member could form a discussion group at the Site, andrules and norms for interaction where basically up to the users to decide. 7 This diversity of users and opinions, and the absence of explicit control by authorities such as religious institutions, teachers, or parents, made the Site aninteresting place to study young people's negotiations of the meaning of reli-gion. How would the lack of overt authority impact their \"talk\" about beliefsand practices? Would the diversity of users mean new opportunities to enterinto dialogue with peers of different faiths and to rethink the kind of opinionson \"traditional religion \" described in previous studies (cf. von Br\u00f6mssen2003)? How would the anonymity provided by text-based discussions impactthe possibility to question the meaning of these conventions, in comparisonwith experiences in life off-line? The study consisted of observations of interaction on the Site, a close analysis of the interchange of messages in eight groups focusing on either Christianityor new religious phenomena such as modern witchcraft, magic, and Satanism.In addition, I interviewed fteen male and female users between eighteen andtwenty years of age about their experiences of the Site. These interviews were con-ducted in the local contexts of the informants. 8 Negotiating Religious Tradition Online\u2014in Practice When the informants described previous experiences of discussing religionwith peers, they often referred to the kinds of ideas about traditional religion(often equated with the \"Church \") as have been found in previous studies. Allof them, in turn, expected to nd different perspectives on religion on the In-ternet. However, my analysis of the discussion groups showed that typical con-ventions for describing traditional religion were salient on the Site, as well. Asseen in this posting, Christianity was frequently described as the opposite offreethinking: Boosh: 9 The bible is a book about war s...i f you take away all bible refer- ences to conflicts, then your bible will become pretty thin. Drop thechurches, synagogues and mosque s... let people think for them- selve s... free-thinking ...h e h e...t h e enlightenment yes then people started thinking for themselves and not the churches for88 tradition dislodged but not lostt h e m...t h e n t h e y 'll understood that why, this is wrong there is no g o d... you got to think for yourselve s... think my little childre n... I know its har d... but try anyway. Although the groups on Christianity were presented as forums for Christians to share their faith among themselves and with \"seekers,\" the groups oftencame to be dominated by erce debates between \"believers\" and \"nonbeliev-ers.\" The polarization between these groups was clearly based on shared un-derstandings of Christianity shaped by conventions about traditional religion.The \"believers\" defended the validity of the Bible, an almighty God, and Chris-tian norms in the life of modern individuals, whereas \"nonbelievers\" criti-cized the authority of these beliefs and ascribed to the \"believers\" attributessuch as stupidity, rigidity, and lack of independence. The \"nonbelievers\" eitherdisassociated themselves from all forms of religion, basing their argumentson reason and scientic facts, or advocated a more individualized religion,based on religious freedom and individual experience. These participants of-ten identied with religious traditions that have come to represent alternativesand opposition to Christianity, such as neo-paganism and Satanism. The polarization between these groups continued throughout the period of study, even though there were occasional attempts to challenge the stereotypeof \"believers\" that prevailed. As exemplied in the following excerpt from oneof the groups, Christians sometimes tried to expand or nuance the conventionsabout \"traditional\" authorities, beliefs, and norms: Emmi: Haha, I think I prefer hell before heaven.

In this exchange, Maria's attempt to challenge the convention of \"traditional reli- gion \" as incongruent with \"individual choice\" is responded to by a reinforcementof the same convention. A similar strategy was also used by other Christians, asin this excerpt from a later discussion: Maria: sent by Sven ...I guess that you didn 't pay attention when you wrote your contri- bution, at least I hope so! It actually says in the Bible that all of uschristians shall go into the world and make allpeople disciples. That's like our mission!

If you do that he shall also forgive you.90 tradition dislodged but not lostThen you will also live forever. And you should try to follow the com- mandments of the bible and also try to carry out the missions there!!I don 't want to be to fuzzy, 'cause this is not fuzziness there is oneway: heaven orhell there's no place to be neutral!!! Choose the right side, even if it's more narrow and harder to walk! Also in this posting, conventions based on traditional Christian dogmas about the authority of God and the Bible are used to restore \"fuzzy\" boundaries be-tween the \"nonbelievers' \" and the \"believers' \" understandings of the individ-ual's right to choose in religious matters. The more Christian informants, likeMaria, attempted to resist conventions about \"traditional religion,\" the morethey became caught in discussions that rather reinforced such conventions. Discussions in the groups focusing on magic, witchcraft, and Satanism were somewhat less dened by point-counterpoint assumptions about whatcharacterizes religion. Much of the interactions consisted of a constant inflowof questions and suggestions about how to become a witch or magician. But onthe other hand, discussions also turned to questions about which practices andauthorities were more valid than others: Jodi: Hi I would like to learn magic. I believe in most of the stuff in thatarea. I can tell fortunes by pendulum, dices, runes and interpretdreams that come through but I'd like to learn magic. ifyou would like to teach me send a mess. Thanks. Bastard: Blaaaa all of you who want to be taught: dthere's things like librariesor books noone can teach you magic. It's so damned indenite andnoone can know magic, that's a thing you feel. Get out in the woodsand get to know it instead see the beauty of all things. Stop all damnedblaaah I'm tired as hell now so I might seem whining and dainty Chrone: I don 't agree at all. Magic can very well be \"taught.\" In many systemsit is seen as downright dangerous to practice without a teacher. Iagree that you need to learn to \"feel,\" but if you cant discuss thosefeelings with someone there's not going to be any development.Splendid isolation is not always strength (...) Individualism is im- portant in itself, but it is through interaction with other people thatour consciousness grows. Compared with the Christian groups, this diversity of standpoints about reli- gious beliefs and practices seemed to present better opportunities for an openand egalitarian dialogue between participants representing different ways ofbeing religious. However, even in these groups conventions about traditionalvirtually boundless? 91religion affect the discussions. First of all, conventions about the intolerance and hierarchy of Christianity were used to distinguish and assert the beliefsand values of alternative religious traditions by contrast: re: . . . surely the more serious among us have no problem with thechristian image of go d... since pantheism and polytheism are two fundaments of wicc a...w h a t bothers me is that many christians seem to have a problem with our image of the higher power s... Furthermore, conventions of \"traditional religion,\" with its presumed adher- ence to religious authorities, became a negative benchmark for dening moreor less authentic ways of using these new religious traditions. Experience andindividual choice emerged as such contrasting authentic criteria. However, in discussions between younger users, often referred to as \"wannabes,\" and those who presented themselves as more \"experienced practi-tioners,\" these alternative criteria also became means for creating hierarchiesand expressing conflicts. \"Wannabes\" were accused of lack of experience, andassociated with popular versions of these new religious traditions. West-girl: Flor a... Just a quiet thought Flora, what do you think is the greatest differ-ence between yourself and the \"VeckoRevyn 10-witches\"? I'm not ask- ing this as an insult but am interested in your way of thinking. Flora: West-girl The greatest difference is that I do not label myself. I'm neitherwitch, magician or whatever they use to call themselves. I am me,and I am interested in magic: studying and practicing. FurthermoreI have studied some different forms of mysticism for years, I don 'tclaim to know everything (a bit like Socrates perhaps ;) and do not be-long to the group who want to move objects by the power of the mind or \"throw curses\" at people. In short I may have reached somepersonal maturity with regard to my interest. :) In the midst of dening what constitutes authentic practice, these young peo- ple were also negotiating the nature of religious authority. As participants moved from wide-open religious exploration toward more serious commitment to a set of religious practices, this sort of banterwas less satisfying. Lugh and Aurora were among those young people whobecame members of the Site in order to nd a context where they could shareexperiences and ideas with like-minded people and eventually develop amore profound or \"serious\" identity as a Wiccan or Satanist. They reactedstrongly toward attempts to take on authority and scold the younger92 tradition dislodged but not lost\"wannabes.\" Still, according to Lugh, both of them eventually felt that the di- versity of individual versions of the traditions expressed on the Site madediscussions too fragmented and disrupted. They wanted more \"profound\" ex-changes, and nally they both left the Site for a more specialized and moder-ated online forum. This ambivalence about the value of explicit leadership and shared focus on core beliefs echoes conventions about traditional religion. Familiar dilem-mas remain, even in young people's use of alternative religious traditions toform \"religion in my own way.\" While such elements might be attractive for anindividual faith to grow more \"serious\" and stable, they are often avoided be-cause of their association with \"traditional religion.\" The Ambiguity of Online Interaction My analysis of interaction on the Site brought out certain features that seem toexplain why online communication came to reinforce rather than destabilizeconventions about and divisions between traditional religion and \"religion inmy own way.\" First of all, the form for communication played a part. In thesediscussion groups, postings were limited to a maximum of 500 signs. Severalof the informants described how this pushed them to be more brief and frankthan in spoken words. Some of them liked this, but they all recognized how itinhibited nuances and increased the risk of mistakes and misunderstandings.The lack of additional, complicating cues to a person 's identity, like seeingChristians with tattoos or playing in secular rock bands, seemed to contributeto the use of stereotypes about people of other faiths. 11 This seemed to be exacerbated by the transitory character of the groups. The constant entry of new members with various interests and intentions in-terrupted discussions and made them fragmentary or repetitive, as the sameissues and debates returned over and over again. Thus, communication throughbrief text-based messages did not seem to leave enough time and space for in-formation that could make participants reconsider their understanding of eachother's identities and intentions. Nor did it encourage encounters where moreprofound exchanges could take place. Second, the lack of overt religious authorities and norms for interaction by moderation seemed to lead to a struggle for control over the group's discourse.In this struggle, new structures of authority developed in which certain userscame to dominate. These \"insiders\" were frequently present and were skilledin text-based discussions. They also used certain strategies to control the dis-cussion, including formulation (the interpretation of another person 's state-ment in a way that takes control of its meaning), critical comments, and irony(cf. Fairclough 1992, 234-36). Because most of them were \"nonbelievers,\"virtually boundless? 93these strategies seemed to suit their critical and distanced attitude to religion, but\u2014as shown in the following excerpt\u2014made it difcult for other people tochallenge them or introduce a different agenda: God's Love: I'm tired of people making fun of me, I'm going to drop this discus-sion with you guys now, we are not getting anywhere anyway, every-body just gets irritated (including me). (...) Stirner: God's Love So when you cannot answer our arguments, you don 't want to stickaround anymore? God's Love: Stirner Ok, I will, against my principles =), make a contribution against your weird attack! I haven 't said that I quit because I can 't answer your ar-guments! If you check out my earlier contributions, I say that's all Ihave been doing: answering arguments. And what do I gain by that?Let's just face it, you hate christians, will always do it, and I'm not go-ing to hang around being some damned sounding board for yourbullshit! Conditions for interaction on the Internet can result in polarizations rather than dialogue between individuals with different understandings of religion.The potentially \"open \" space of the Internet, where conventions and cues thatstructure face-to-face situations of interaction become ambiguous, also intro-duces new forms of authority, along with elements of insecurity and risk. 12As Maria's experience shows, the risk of becoming misunderstood, criticized, orscolded was considerable. In this situation, the safety of conventions based onexperience in other contexts can become preferable to experiments with newmeanings. Stirner's reflections, as one of the \"insiders,\" also show that the per-sistence of these conventions supported the interests and position of the domi-nant users: \" . . . we hope that the discussions will start agai n... and that's why we don 't try to break every Christian that enters the groups, or every stupidatheist. 'Cause if they start discussing with each other perhaps interestingthings will be happening.\" Indications of Reconstructed Conventions The main tendencies in these Internet exchanges, then, were toward the ironicreinforcement of conventional denitions of what constitutes religion. Still,there were also examples of how interaction at the Site made the informants re-consider the meaning of conventions of traditional religion for their own andother people's identity. Such reflections were, however, primarily expressed by94 tradition dislodged but not lostinformants who found ways to overcome the challenges and risks of dis- cussing religion on the Site. One of the crucial points seemed to be whether theconditions of a particular site gave users a sense of trust and control, ratherthan enhanced insecurity. 13Certain resources seemed crucial to developing this trust and sense of control. The rst concerned the means to be a frequentpresence in the groups. Informants who had regular access to a computer oftheir own and a high-speed connection to the Internet were more likely to havethis experience. In the world of Internet communication, the ability to get one'swords on the screen is the most basic component of power. Secondly, infor-mants who were well skilled in expressing themselves through written textwere better able to avoid misunderstandings and stereotyping. In addition to these matters of skill and resources, it seems that the most powerful members of the Site were also most able to risk change. Stirner wasa convinced atheist, but the fact that his views on religion were supported bythose who dominated the discussion groups gave him a secure position at theSite. For him, interactions online eventually led to a revised opinion of Chris-tians and friendship with one of his former opponents: . . . I've also gained more respect fo r...t h e more secular part of Christianity. Svirk and people like him. For people who have reflectedon this and, well, for some reason accept god's existenc e.../ /...b u t that accept other people's opinion about this and do not try to adjustreality in order to t the bible. I respect these people so much more,and so I don 't look upon Christians as a homogeneous group in thesame way as before. In addition to power, resources, and skills, outcomes were also dependent on an individual's attitude about the religious tradition of his or her choice.Those who, like Maria and Lugh, based their faith on a specic tradition, foundit more difcult to adopt the strategies that were common among the dominantusers. For them, the tough, ironic, and distanced attitude of the \"insiders\" wasnot congruent with core values of Christianity or Wicca, respectively. Their reli-gious commitment to values such as kindness toward enemies or tolerance fordifferent views was ill suited to interaction on the Site. Maria and Mona both as-pired, for instance, to create more dialogue between people of different faiths: Mia: How do you look upon your own position in these groups that you're a member of? Maria : I...t h a t would be, trying to create not a sense of community but someho w...a bit more understanding between atheists and Christians. But Maria's explicit Christian identity meant that she faced resistance when try- ing to act in this way. Mona, on the other hand, who refrained from associatingvirtually boundless? 95herself with a specic tradition but rather looked for commonalities between different religions, was able to act as a moderator and promote tolerance be-tween different opinions in the groups: Mona: ...T o discuss religion is not unnecessary at all, sure we will never be able to convert each other, but isn 't really what we want either, is it?On the contrary we learn to understand each other and to accept eachothers beliefs, which according to me is the best we can do. Becausethat is how you avoid war, not by abolishing things. These examples show that when discussing possible reconstructions of re- ligious conventions on the Internet, we need to take into consideration howdifferent individuals are equipped with different resources that impact theirability to handle its risks and promises (cf. Slevin 2000, 115). The need for ac-cess and verbal skills shows how online interaction is connected to economicresources and competences earned in the individual's life off-line. And the dif-ferences between Mona, Stirner, and Maria underline how conventions den-ing religion in a society play a part, as well. Religious identities that correspondto conventions of \"traditional religion \" and \"my own religion \" in life outside theInternet may face less resistance than identities that blur those lines. Ironically,in this way the use of tradition may allow individuals to make use of online in-teraction for creative reflection. Conclusion The Internet has been described as the \"epitome\" of transformations of tradi-tional religion in late modern society. The analysis in this chapter of how youngpeople negotiate the meaning of religion on the Internet shows that the condi-tions for these kinds of transformations are more ambivalent than anticipatedin early studies. Discussions on the Internet might be \"disembedded\" from thetangible forms of institutions and authorities that uphold conventions aboutreligion in a certain country. However, the ambiguity that follows the absenceof such traditional structures does not automatically make these conventionsand norms obsolete. The discussion in this chapter makes clear that \"virtual\"interactions on the Internet cannot be neatly separated from many of the con-ditions of daily life outside the Internet. Those conditions determine who hasthe access and skill to participate, and those factors help to set the terms of thedialogue. The cultural conditions of daily life also supply participants with con-ventions about religion. Constructions of religion online, then, are the out-come of a complex interplay between the conditions for interaction in a partic-ular site, individual resources, and the nature of different religious traditions96 tradition dislodged but not lostor \"narratives\" in a society. Thus, the construction of religion, even in the tran- sient sites of late modern society, not only is a question of individual choice ina \"spiritual marketplace\" but also is negotiated in social interaction that isstructured by religious authorities and conventions, no matter how institution-ally weak. This study of young people negotiating religion in cyberspace can,hopefully, contribute to a further understanding of how religious tradition isconstructed and reconstructed in other contexts of late modern society. notes 1. Throughout this chapter I will use the concept \"late modernity\"in referring to the decades following the Second World War, in accordance with the understanding of these as a radicalization of tendencies of modernity (rather than a shift into a postmod- ern condition) advocated by, for example, Giddens (1991) and Forn\u00e4s (1992, 18). 2.

New buds softened the stark winter branches. Businessowners swept the sidewalks and arranged their fruits and vegetablesas I walked along street after nearly-empty street. Fathers sleepwalkedthrough their Saturday morning ritual of taking the baby out to thelocal coffee shop so their wives could get more rest. Early spring inNew York, comfortingly predictable. But New York is never just about the familiar but about surprise as well. I was on my way to a memorial service for the Reverend Pan-durangshastri Athavale, or, as his followers called him, Dadaji, theleader of the Swadhyaya movement in India, who died in November2003. The leaders of the Swadhyaya Parivar or \"Swadhyaya family\" inLowell, Massachusetts, who I befriended while working on this proj-ect, had invited me to attend the ceremony. As I made my way over tothe Jacob Javits Convention Center, I noticed the many little prepara-tions under way that I would have missed had I not had \"tickets.\" Carscrammed full with large extended families hurried to nd spaces inthe neighborhood parking lots. Dozens of yellow school buses trans-ported Swadhyayees from all over the region to the convention centerdoors. And groups of followers, wearing name tags written in Gujaratipinned to the lapels of their winter coats, were being shepherded overto the gathering from Penn Station. While New York woke up andgrew busy with shoppers, tourists, and antiwar protesters, the curtainwas rising on an important yet barely noticed sideshow.It was a wonderful, enlightening performance. By the end of the day, more than 10,000 mourners from all over the East Coast would pay their respects. Arepresentative from the New York City mayor's ofce, who attended a specialcommemorative ceremony in the afternoon, declared March 20 Dadaji's dayon the city's calendar. All through the month of March, Didiji, his successor,presided over similar events in Chicago, Toronto, Los Angeles, and other NorthAmerican cities where there are also large Swadhyaya communities. Similar gatherings, also below the radar screen of most Americans, happen regularly around the country. When Americans tune into these events, they of-ten do so against the backdrop of September 11. Through that lens, foreign-bornHindus, Muslims, Buddhists, and even Evangelical Protestants and their native-born offspring are often seen as a threat by those who fear religion 's expandingrole in American society and its increasingly diverse character. A careful look at how migrants 1are changing America's religious land- scape reveals a much more complex story about the United States and theworld at large. The fact that Swadhyaya leaders had the strength and power toorganize an event at New York's main convention center attended by localpoliticians attests to how well this community is integrating itself into theUnited States. At the same time, by participating in Swadhyaya, its membersremain strongly attached to India. They also form part of a global religiouscommunity, with chapters in the United Kingdom, Fiji, South Africa, Trinidadand Tobago, and anyplace else that Indian emigrants live. Through religion,Swadhyayees belong to several countries and to a global religious communityat the same time. Groups like Swadhyaya call into question fundamental assumptions about nations, immigration, and religion. In the twenty-rst century, many people willbelong to several societies and cultures at once, and they will use religion to doso. Being part of the United States and maintaining ties to other countries andother communities around the globe are not incompatible. 2Instead, guring out how to do this, making seemingly contradictory loyalties and cultural expecta-tions t, and using religion to do so, is the daily task of increasing numbers. Thinking Outside the Nation-State Container Maintaining multiple identities and living lives that cross national boundariesis hard to grasp. Most people take for granted that the world has always beenand always will be organized into sovereign nation-states. Most governmentssee the causes and solutions to their socioeconomic woes as located inside theirborders rather than acknowledging they are produced by people who live cross-border lives. But such a view is short on history. Market capitalism, imperialand colonial regimes, the antislavery and workers' rights campaigns, illegalpirating networks, and religions have always crossed borders.104 religion \" out of place\"Assuming that social life automatically takes place within a nation-state container blinds us to the way the world actually works. Capturing these dy-namics requires trading in a national lens for a transnational one. This opticjettisons the assumption that the nation-state is the natural, logical containerwhere social life takes place and begins instead with a world with no set bor-ders and boundaries. It asks why particular kinds of boundaries arise in partic-ular historical contexts and assumes that these processes happen simultane-ously in several settings and at several levels of social experience. It does notdeny the continuing importance of nation-states or the fact that states continueto regulate many aspects of life. Nor does it argue that everything is producedby factors operating outside national borders. Indeed, in many cases, suchforces play only a small supporting role in the story. Understanding contemporary social experience requires taking into con- sideration the kinds of cross-border factors that may be at play. That means ask-ing how individuals and groups actually organize themselves, and differentiatethemselves from others, without assuming, a priori, that they are organizedinto nation-states. Understanding religion and migration demands going be-yond comparing one country to another. Instead, it requires mapping, withoutpreconceived notions, the networks of individuals and institutions that emergeand how they operate. Using a Transnational Lens to Understand the Migrant Experience What is gained by using a transnational lens to understand the migration experi- ence? Two \"bookends\" bracket twentieth-century U.S. immigration. Nearly 1 mil-lion immigrants arrived annually during its rst decade, as well as during the last(U.S. Department of Homeland Security [USDHS] 2004). These \"new\" immi-grants come from different parts of the world than those who preceded them. Inthe early 1900s, the top ve sending countries were Italy, the Soviet Union, Hun-gary, Austria, and the United Kingdom; a hundred years later, they were Mexico,the Philippines, China, India, and the Dominican Republic (USDHS 2004). These trends dramatically are altering U.S. demography. Whereas in 1900 most of the foreign-born came from Europe\u2014more than 8 out of 9 million(USDHS 2004)\u2014in 2003, nearly 54 percent of the 33.5 million foreign-bornwere from Latin America. 3In 1900, just over 120,000 foreign-born residents were from Asia (Gibson and Lennon 2001). In 2002, there were 13.1 millionAsian-born people in the country, 4representing a more than eightfold increase in less than forty years (Lott 2004). New immigrants are moving to places where newcomers have not tradi- tionally settled. In 1910, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston were thedestinations of choice. Eleven out of the twelve most popular places to settleredefining the boundaries of belonging 105were located in the Northeast or Midwest, whereas today they are in the Sunbelt or the West.5 Although most migrants still move to large urban centers, there has also been a dramatic shift toward settlement in smaller cities, suburbs, and rural ar-eas. Other migrants move farther off the beaten path. Between 1990 and 2000,the number of foreign-born in the South and Midwest grew by 88 and 65 per-cent, respectively. Much of this growth took place in small-town locales thathave not traditionally seen large immigrant populations. Whether they arepacking poultry in the Carolinas or raising cattle in rural Nebraska, migrantsare diversifying areas that previously knew little heterogeneity. 6 At the same time, many immigrants retain strong, enduring ties to their countries of origin and to other places where their fellow emigrants have set-tled. 7They still invest, express their political interests, and seek spiritual guid- ance in their countries of origin while they put down strong roots in the UnitedStates. Those who engage in regular economic and political activities are fairlyfew in number. Recent work by sociologist Alejandro Portes and his colleagues(2002, Guarnizo, Portes, and Haller, 2003) revealed that routine involvementin economic and political transnational activities characterized only 5 to 10 per-cent of the Dominican, Salvadoran, and Columbian migrants they surveyed.But many more were \"periodic\" transnational activists who took part in home-country affairs when there were elections, economic downturns, or natural dis-asters or during important life-cycle events. Using a transnational optic to understand migration reveals several impor- tant things. For one, sometimes migration is as much about the people who staybehind as it is about those who move. In some cases, the ties between migrantsand nonmigrants are so strong and widespread that migration radically trans-forms the lives of individuals who remain at home. Actual movement is not re-quired to participate across borders. People, money, and social remittances\u2014theideas and practices that migrants send back into their communities of origin\u2014 permeate the daily lives of those who remain behind, altering their behavior andtransforming notions about equity, gender relations, morality, and what statesshould and should not do. The religious and political groups they belong to alsobegin to operate across borders. What happens to those in the United Statescannot be separated from what happens to those who remain in the homelandbecause their fates are inextricably linked. When a small group is regularly in-volved in their sending country, and others participate periodically, their com- bined efforts add up. Taken together and over time, these activities constitutea social force with tremendous transformative signicance that can modify theeconomy, values, and everyday lives of entire regions. Looking at migrants and nonmigrants in a transnational context also re- veals the many layers and sites that make up the social elds that they occupy.The relationship between Salvadoran villagers and their migrant family mem-bers in an urban neighborhood in Los Angeles is not just a product of these106 religion \" out of place\"narrow, local connections. It is also strongly influenced by ties between the Sal- vadoran and the U.S. states and between the U.S. and Salvadoran nationalCatholic churches. Ties to Salvadorans living in Europe and Mexico also affectthese dynamics. Similarly, a complete account of the religious lives of Brazilianimmigrants in Massachusetts must go beyond the connections between spe-cic congregations in Boston and Brazil and locate these ties within the thick,multilayered web of links between national denominations in the United Statesand Brazil. Transnational social elds, then, encompass the many sites of mi-grant and nonmigrant connection. They also include the many levels of cross-border ties that emerge in response. 8 Finally, seeing migrants and nonmigrants as occupying the same social space also drives home that becoming incorporated into the United Statesand sustaining strong ties to one's homeland are not at odds with each other.Rather, the migrant experience is more like a gauge that, although anchored,pivots back and forth between sending and receiving country, with differentorientations at different stages of life. Migrants do not trade one membershipfor another. Instead, they change where they devote their energy and resourcesin response to elections, wars, economic decline, life-cycle events, and naturaldisasters. By doing so, they contradict the expectation that newcomers will ei-ther fully assimilate or remain entirely transnational and that, instead, they willcraft some combination of the two (Levitt and Glick Schiller 2004; Morawska2003). A transnational gaze is both a perspective and a variable. It assumes that \"here\" and \"there\" are strongly linked. The analyst must then empirically studythe actual ties that emerge between the home and host country and what theirimpacts are. In many cases, home-country influences are of little importance,whereas in others, excluding them from the story renders it dangerously in- complete. Redrawing the Religious Map Using a transnational optic also brings the lived religious experience into sharper, more accurate focus. Without acknowledging the transnational char-acter of social experience, we fail to recognize many of the ways in which reli-gious experience actually works. Religion is one of the principal ways thatmigrants stay connected to places beyond where they settle. By doing so, theytransform religion and culture in the United States and around the world. Amer-ican religious pluralism and the globalization of religious life have become partand parcel of the same dynamic. Some migrants introduce new faith traditions to the United States. Others ex- pand what had been relatively small religious communities. Still others belong totraditions with long histories in the United States, thus necessitating a negotiationredefining the boundaries of belonging 107between the old and the new. In each case, these processes are often connected to and influenced by the activities of coreligionists around the world. 9 This is an age-old story for Catholics, who have had lots of practice incor- porating newcomers, and who use many of the same strategies today withBrazilians and Vietnamese that successfully transformed earlier Irish and Ital-ian immigrants into American Catholics. But many mainline and evangelicalProtestant faiths are also experiencing an influx of immigrants at a time whentheir native-born membership is declining (Machacek 2003; Warner 2005).These flows grow out of missionary work done in Latin America and Asia dur-ing the 1900s. The descendents of those who converted are now bringing theirown version of Christianity back to the United States and asking to practicetheir faith alongside their denominational brothers and sisters. New and oldmembers have to invent ways to pray, learn, and pursue social change together.Their views about how to do so are often quite different, and there are no obvi-ous referees to resolve the disputes. The compromises they ultimately agree onare a major catalyst for religious change. Other immigrants belong to global religious movements that unite mem- bers who happen to be living in the United States with fellow believers aroundthe world. Charismatic Catholics, for example, belong to small communities ofprayer and fellowship created to give members a more meaningful faith expe-rience. Immigrants and travelers are encouraged to participate in worshipgroups wherever they are, which is easy to do, since many groups observe thesame rituals. Because the visitor encounters the familiar, she feels at home wherever she worships. The Tablighi Jama'at is one of the largest transnational Islamic movements, which originated in northern India and is now believed tobe comparable in scale and scope to Christian Pentecostalism. Its membersparticipate in missions that travel around the world urging Muslims to wakeup, be faithful, and return to the correct practice of Islam (Bowen 2004; Ga-borieau 1999). Diverse Su orders have been maintaining ties between newplaces of residence and their centers since the tenth century (Bowen 2004;Eickelman and Piscatori 1990). The globalization of the sacred, then, occurs on many fronts. Migration- driven changes run parallel to connections arising between members of globalreligious communities and social movements that are not related to migration.In one scenario, migrants use religious institutions to maintain ties to theirhomelands. In a second, individuals form part of religious multiethnic organi-zations and movements that connect them to coreligionists locally and globally.Their primary identication is not to the nation but to the global religious com-munity. Both types of global religious connection create and are created by theother (Bowen 2004; Kahani-Hopkins and Hopkins 2002; Levitt 2004). Not just the cast of religious characters changes through migration, but no- tions about what religion actually is and where to nd it change as well. The sepa-ration of church and state is so rmly embedded in the American psyche that108 religion \" out of place\"most Americans treat religion and culture as more distinct than they actually are. Many new immigrants come from places where religion and culture go hand inhand. They cannot sort out Irishness from Catholicism, Indianness from beingHindu, or what it means to be Pakistani from what it means to be a Muslim. Faithguides the way they live their everyday lives, with whom they associate, and thekinds of communities they belong to, even among those who say they are not veryreligious. Their ideas about tolerance and diversity are shaped by experienceswhere states actively regulate religious life and where expectations about relationsbetween \"us\" and \"them \" are quite different from those in the United States. As a result, many immigrants bring a much broader understanding of what religion is and where to nd it to the table. The sacred and the spiritualspill over into the workplace, the schoolyard, and the neighborhood. Whenpeople adorn their refrigerator doors with \"saint magnets,\" hang cross-stitchedsamplers with religious teachings on their walls, light candles in honor of theV\u00edrgen, or decorate their rearview mirrors and dashboards with photos of theirgurujis, they imbue the quotidian with the sacred. When a Latino family cele-brates its daughter's fteenth birthday or a Hindu son invites his elderly fatherto live with him in the United States, they are performing religious as well ascultural acts (Ammerman 1997; Hall 1997; Orsi 1999). For some newcomers,then, American values are, in part, religious values. And these values are madenot just in the U.S.A. but in Latin America, South Asia, and Africa as well. Migrants also bring different understandings of the meaning of member- ship in a religious group. In some cases, membership entails worshiping in aparticular congregation, where the theology, leadership, and fee structure areclearly established. But many migrants do not feel a sense of belonging to anyone congregation. They are comfortable worshiping at whatever church, tem-ple, or mosque is close by. Their faith does not depend on their ongoing partic-ipation with the same members of their faith community. Furthermore, religion does not stay inside the walls of ofcial religious buildings. Private, informal religious rituals often reveal much more about thechanging nature of religious life than what goes on at the church or at the tem-ple (Diaz-Stevens 1994). When a Muslim silently says her prayers while stoppedat a trafc light because there is no place nearby to pray, she is transformingIslam in America. When a traveler crosses himself before the plane takes off, heis expressing his faith whether or not he ever attends Mass on Sunday. Just as the walls of religious buildings are permeable, so are the boundaries between faith traditions (McGuire 2003; Tweed 2002; V\u00e1squez and Marquardt2003). Many migrants come from countries where religious life has alwayscombined elements from several faiths. Much of Latino Catholicism, for exam-ple, integrates indigenous, African, and Christian practices, implicitly givingfollowers permission to be many things at one time. Many of the Brazilian andIndian immigrants I met saw no problem with belonging to several religiouscommunities simultaneously because all the pieces t under the broad umbrellaredefining the boundaries of belonging 109of Christianity or Hinduism. For these individuals, boundary crossing or com- bining elements from different faiths is the rule, not the exception. The Ameri-can context, with its uniquely open and individualistic religious marketplace,also encourages such religious shifts. Increasingly, Americans switch denomi-nations to nd the brand that brings them the most spiritual satisfaction (Finkeand Stark 1992; Roof 1999; Wolfe 2003; Wuthnow 1989). Similarly, religion does not obey political or ethnic boundaries. The Cru- saders resurrected Christianity in the range of dominions, kingdoms, andprincipalities that had been claimed by Muslims. Similarly, Incan, Mayan, andAztec traditions were forcibly absorbed into Hispanic Catholicism. The Britishspread Anglicanism to the four corners of their empire. Even the birth of themodern nation-state system has not required God to use a passport. There are1 billion Catholics around the globe\u2014only slightly less than the population ofChina. India's 966 million population is only slightly bigger than the world-wide population of 900 million Sunni Muslims (\"Religious Bodies\" 2003). TheCatholic Church has the most highly articulated, widely recognized system oftransnational governance, linking its members through its national confer-ences and social movement chapters around the world. But smaller denomina-tional groups like the Baptist World Alliance and the International Swaminarayan Satsang Organization also have administrative structures with a global reach.These engender a sense of global religious membership that complements,competes with, or supersedes national membership. These changes in religious demography are transforming the balance of power within global religious institutions. At the last decennial convening of the Anglican Communion, for example, third world bishops challenged thetraditional authority of English and American prelates and their positions onhomosexuality, abortion, and the ordination of women. The center of politicalgravity in Roman Catholicism, dominated until only recently by Italian prelates,is slowly shifting as more and more cardinals from Africa, Asia, and SouthAmerica are appointed to positions of power. Finally, religion endows followers with symbols, rituals, and narratives that allow them to imagine themselves in sacred landscapes, marked by holysites, shrines, and places of worship (Richman 2005; V\u00e1squez and Marquardt2003). Some individuals imagine these spaces as easily coexisting with the ac-tual physical and political geography. For others, the religious landscape takesprecedence over its secular counterpart. What happens in Bombay, London,Johannesburg, Fiji, and Trinidad is what matters most to some Swadhyayees,who think of these sites as the boundaries of a sort of Swadhyaya \"country.\"Minarets, crosses, and sanctuaries are the salient landmarks in these imagi-nary terrains rather than national monuments or historic structures. Religionalso transcends the boundaries of time, by allowing followers to feel part ofa chain of memory, connected to a past, a present, and a future (Hervieu-L\u00e9ger2000). That is why Cubans in Miami, writes religious studies scholar Thomas110 religion \" out of place\"Tweed (1999), bring their newborns to be baptized at the shrine that they built to their national patron saint. By doing so, they induct their children into animagined Cuban nation with a past in Cuba, a present in Miami, and a futurethat they hope will take place once again in their homeland. Religion, then, is the archetypal spatial and temporal boundary crosser. Many faiths tolerate and even encourage the idea of belonging to several groupsat the same time. Their proclivity toward syncretism makes combining reli-gious elements and crossing borders the norm rather than the exception (Beyer1994, 2001; Casanova 1994; Robertson 1991). Something Old and Something New But, some will rightly argue, this is an old story. Economic production, politics,and social movements have always crossed borders. Immigration and religionin the United States have always been part of larger global processes. Religionhas never been tied to the nation-state in the United States in the way that it hasin countries with \"ofcial\" state religions. In fact, this is the third wave of \"reli-gious accommodation \" between immigrants and the native-born. The previoustwo, involving the incorporation of different kinds of Protestants, followed bythe incorporation of Catholics and Jews, were each global in their own ways. This third encounter, however, differs from its previous incarnations in several important ways. The rst is the greater diversity of faiths and the natureof global religious communities. According to sociologist Jos\u00e9 Casanova, con-temporary world religions have four common features. First, religious identityis voluntary rather than ascribed. Individuals choose the religious communitythey wish to belong to, and the individual is responsible for his or her ownfaith. Second, global religious communities are in large measure imaginedcommunities (Anderson 1991). The media and technology enable people tothink of themselves as part of a community of followers across the globe whothey have never met. Members of the Muslim Umma or of the Scalabrini orderof priests feel a sense of connection to one another. Furthermore, each worldreligion is characterized by a comparable set of internal divisions. Most Chris-tian denominations, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, and Judaism all have prose-lytizing, reformist, and puritanical arms. Finally, the West is no longer the ref-erence point against which \"the rest\" dene themselves. Rather, global religiousinstitutions dene themselves in relation to each other. Second, new communication and transportation technologies allow people to participate in places other than those where they live in fundamentally differ-ent ways than before. It is true that the nineteenth century was also an ageof rapidly advancing technology. Migrants had the benet of steamship andtranscontinental railway travel, international mail and news wire service, andpublishing houses to stay connected across borders. The current age of jet planeredefining the boundaries of belonging 111travel, instant messaging, and Internet highways, however, makes these con- nections cheaper, easier, and more intimate than ever before. Unlike earlier mi-grants, who had only photographs and letters to \"make sense\" of their familymembers' lives, today those who remain behind can actually see and hear whatgoes on in the Church and in the neighborhood around it (Van der Veer 2001). Third, earlier and contemporary migration experiences differ because most eastern and southern European migrants in the nineteenth century left with-out a clear sense of belonging to a particular nation-state. They departed eitherfrom colonized territories, as in the case of the Irish or the Polish, or fromstates in the process of consolidation, such as Italy. They tended to feel a greaterafnity toward their sending province or region than to the nation as a whole.Many only began to think of themselves as Italian or Polish after religious lead-ers called them that when they were in the United States (Glazer 1954). Furthermore, immigrants in the early 1900s were under much more pressure to naturalize and become \"good Americans\" than they are today. And,in some ways, it was easier for them to do so. The U.S. economy afforded low-skilled, non-English speakers many more opportunities. Settlement houseworkers, educators, and progressive reformers devoted themselves to teachingimmigrants English, the principles of citizenship, and allegiance to Americaninstitutions. The government endorsed \"one-hundred percent Americanism \"campaigns designed to suppress foreign cultural and political differences thatmight nurture anti-American sentiments. Most Americans wholeheartedlysupported President Woodrow Wilson 's infallible test for proper hyphenatedAmericans who might retain \"ancient affections but whose hearts and thoughtsmust be centered nowhere but in the emotions and the purposes and the poli-cies of the USA.\" Churches played, and continue to play, an integral role in the incorpora- tion process, but the way they do so has changed considerably. Consider thecase of the rst waves of Irish immigrants compared with their contemporarycounterparts. The Irish arriving in the late nineteenth and early twentieth cen-turies helped create the U.S. Catholic Church. They worshiped at nationalparishes, established to help newcomers make the transition from their ownsending-country worship style to a more \" American \" style of practice. Irishpriests, who never intended to go home, accompanied them. Because familiesoften migrated together or were reunited once they arrived in the UnitedStates, attending Mass and participating in parish life were natural spring-boards toward host-country incorporation (Dolan 1992). Today's \"new\" Irish join well-established Catholic parishes that are pur- posefully transforming themselves into multiethnic institutions. The Irish arejust one of many new Catholic constituencies that, in contrast to their prede-cessors, must now adapt to rather than create the religious landscape. In fact,by 2010, Latino parishioners are likely to be the majority group among allCatholics (Cadena 1995). This dramatic demographic transition, also evidenced112 religion \" out of place\"to a lesser degree in the changing face of Church leadership, has pushed the Church to be more tolerant of enduring national diversity. By appropriating na-tional patron saints, such as Mexico's Virgen de Guadalupe and the DominicanRepublic's Virgen de Altagracia as icons of global Catholicism, the Churchmakes an important statement about who its members are and its willingnessto accept their different worship styles. The social climate in general is alsomore tolerant of ethnic diversity\u2014indeed, for some people, remaining \"ethnic\"is part of being a true American. The Transnationalization of Religious Experience America will always be an overwhelmingly Christian country. Those who settledenitively in the United States will always outnumber migrants who livetransnational lives. But changes in migration and religion, albeit at the mar-gins, are on the rise and are important harbingers of the future. More andmore migrants will live transnational lives, and they will use religion to do so. This signals important changes for how religion is actually lived and orga- nized in the United States and how it should be studied. For one thing, na-tional religions are increasingly transnational. Which groups are representedat America's religious table, and what they bring to the conversation are, inpart, a function of forces operating outside our borders. What people actuallybelieve, the rituals and practices they engage in to express those beliefs, and theorganizational settings in which they enact them, are all transnationally in-formed. Religious life in the United States and in the homeland are increas-ingly interconnected. So, when upper-middle-class Pakistani women worship alongside men in the United States and tell their relatives about it, some of those in Karachi as-sert their right to continue praying at home, while others also want to attendcommunal prayers and worship with their male counterparts. Similarly, thecustom of organizing large-scale, all-day prayer and study sessions among cer-tain Gujarati Hindu communities has been exported to the United States andrefashioned to t with people's work schedules, the climate, and greater dis-tances between where they live. Home- and host-country beliefs and practicesmutually shape and reshape each other. These activities take place within organizations that are themselves transna- tional. In some cases, religious organizations become like transnational cor-porations, with highly developed, hierarchical institutional architectures. Inothers, religious groups work more like informal networks, forming partner-ship with other groups around specic projects before linking up with anothergroup on another initiative. In still others, individual religious practice isdriven by religious social movements, such as the multitude of charismaticChristian groups, and connects members around the globe. Whatever the form,redefining the boundaries of belonging 113this means people are embedded in institutions that cross borders and are therefore exposed to a constant dose of ideas, practices, and identities from var-ious sites and sources. Another way to think of this is that religion lends itself particularly well to expressions of transnational belonging. Religion works differently than ethnic-ity or nationality. Its message of transcendence, codication and ensuing porta-bility, and socialization of subsequent generations, to name a few, makes reli-gion a fertile arena for multiple memberships. If transnational belonging is thewave of the future, religion is likely to be its principal stage. In either case, the boundaries of religious pluralism and the forces that create it are clearly expanding. Like lived religion, some of the forces shapingnational religious pluralism are also transnational. Religious practice in theUnited States both nourishes and detracts from homeland religious diversity,just as sending-country religious life both narrows and expands the U.S. reli-gious panorama. Thus, Brazilian immigrants to the United States both intro-duce and export back an ever-expanding repertoire of Protestant possibilities,and migrants from Gujarat State carry a range of Hindu approaches to their fel-low immigrants (and the native-born) and import a transformed version of re-ligious practice back to India. Taking stock of these dynamics means looking for religion in different places than those where it is traditionally studied. It means seeing the religiousin the cultural. It means going where people actually practice their faith andnoticing its spontaneous, informal incarnations. It means studying religion at home, at a community meeting, or on a mountaintop or beach. It means trac- ing out the layers and sites of the transnational web of religious experience andrecognizing that they are interconnected nodes of the same dynamic. Some people worry when migrants are loyal to two nations. They liken dual membership to polygamy, saying that you cannot be married to two coun-tries at the same time. That religion engenders multiple loyalties makes it ex-tremely suspect. So many acts of terrorism and violence have been perpetratedin the name of God (Bromley and Melton 2002; Ellens 2004; Juergensmeyer2000; Stern 2003). Al Qaeda as well as Hindu, Christian, and Jewish groupsespouse versions of faith that leave little room for argument. But this is religion at the margins, rather than religion of the masses. Rather than posing a threat, strong transnational religious interdependencerepresents an opportunity. Instead of precipitating a \"clash of civilizations,\"transnational migrants build bridges across cultures. They carry ideas, intro-duce skills, and redistribute wealth. Like the Pakistani mosque-goers men-tioned earlier, they are translators\u2014teaching people in the United States aboutIslam and exporting a more liberal version of what it means to be Muslim backto Pakistan. Like the Gujaratis, they are negotiators\u2014guring out how they canreconcile the conflicting demands of Hindu and U.S. values by still meetingtheir aging parents' expectations about lial respect and taking their children to114 religion \" out of place\"soccer practice at the same time. Like the Brazilians who noted, \"Your last name isn 't going to get you a job in the U.S.,\" they are change catalysts who de-mand equal treatment for all at home. By doing so, they extend the boundariesof the collective good beyond our national borders to include those in theirhomelands. What constitutes right and wrong, tolerance and fairness is transnation- ally, not nationally, determined. Fighting poverty, sickness, or pollution is notjust an American project. In countries like India, Pakistan, Brazil, and Ireland,as well as the United States, most of the people are concerned about raisingtheir families, helping their communities, and being able to live safely and se-curely in a place where the system works. These are dreams we all can agreeon. Throwing the religious baby out with the bathwater is no longer an option. notes 1. I use the word migrant purposefully throughout most of this chapter to capture the idea that these transnationally oriented individuals are both immigrants and emi- grants at the same time. 2. For examples, see Glick Schiller (2005), Levitt (2002, 2003, 2004), and Morawska (2003). 3. Only 13.7 percent were from Europe (Larsen 2004). 4. This gure includes \"race alone\" or \"in combination \" (\"in combination \" indi- cates that the respondent checked off two or more races). There are 11.6 million Asiansin the \"race alone\" category. 5. Nine out of 12 of the most popular destinations are located in the Sunbelt or the West, bringing migration patterns of the foreign-born and native-born more insync with each other (Spain 1999). 6. The three states that experienced more than a 200 percent change in the foreign-born population from 1990 to 2000 were Georgia, Nevada, and North Car-olina; many midwestern states saw at least 100 percent change (all gures from Mal- one et al. 2003). Dalla and her colleagues (2005) discuss the \"browning\" of Midwest meatpacking communities, where Hispanic and Asian migrants have responded to re-cruiting efforts by meatpackers to ll labor-intensive and unpleasant positions in the industry. 7. For an introduction to transnational migration scholarship, see Basch, Glick Schiller, and (2001); and Vertovec (2003). 8. World-Polity theorists and neo-institutionalists argue that there is a universalis- tic or global level of cultural and organizational formation that creates and strongly in-fluences states, business enterprises, groups, and individuals. More and more, actorsdene themselves and their interests in response to the global cultural and organiza-tional structures in which they are embedded (Boli and Thomas 1999; Meyer 2003).redefining the boundaries of belonging 115Some, however, see global cultural production as an encounter between the global and the local. Instead of conceptualizing the global as macro-level political and economic forces that stand in opposition to local cultural elements, they explore where and how the global and the local meet, and the ways in which power hierarchies, as well as rela-tions of reciprocity and solidarity, shape these encounters (Appadurai 1996; Gupta and Ferguson 1997; Hannerz 1992; Ong 1999). 9. Although the vast majority of new immigrants are Christian (80 percent), in- cluding large numbers of nondenominational evangelicals, there are also signicantnumbers entering the country who are Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist. Jasso and her colleagues (2003) found that 17 percent of immigrants who were admitted to the United States in the summer of 1996 expressed a religious preference other thanChristian, Jewish, or none at all, more than four times that of the overall U.S. popula- tion (4 percent). Barry Kosmin, leader of the ARIS project, points out that the in- creased diversity of sending countries has changed the religious makeup of Asian mi-grants. Between 1990 and 2001, the proportion of the Asian American population who are Christian has fallen from 63 percent to 43 percent, while the percentage of those professing Asian religions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, etc) has risen from 15 per-cent to 28 percent (Kosmin 2001). See also polls by Gallup (Newport 2004), the PewResearch Center on the People and the Press (2004), and Barna Research Group (2004) that indicate anywhere between 5 and 11 percent of Americans belong to non- Christian faiths. references Ammerman, Nancy. 1997.

A simple question, but one that has spawned countless debates among scholars and thelarger public alike. Religion is typically thought of as somethingunique and important. Religious events are understood to be locatedin special places set apart from ordinary life, places like churches,temples, mosques, and synagogues. Even when we nd religion out-side these venues, we expect it to be different from everyday activity,easily delineated from other domains of life. A prayer session in apublic park, for example, is something much different from a pickupbasketball game in the same location. Indeed, an important criterionfor when an event or experience is typically deemed religious is itsdetachment from the normal, mundane activities of day-to-day life.This conceptualization of religion in scholarly thinking is of courserooted in Durkheim 's ([1912] 1995) absolute separation of the sacredand the profane. Today, the common advice to \"set aside\" time tomeditate or pray in many religious traditions reflects the view that re-ligion is something set apart from the ordinary and everyday. How, then, do we make sense of situations where the line be- tween the religious and the nonreligious is unclear? What do wemake of a political speech made at a religious funeral, for example?Or a sacred song sung by a public school choir? These kinds ofevents are noteworthy, and often controversial, precisely because theychallenge the imagined boundaries between the religious and publicspheres. Does a political speech at a funeral service, as occurredwhen Minnesota senator Paul Wellstone died in 2002, render theevent a political one? Does it diminish the religious meaning of theevent? Is a high school concert that features sacred music, as hundreds do an- nually across the United States, thereby a religious event? Does such music vi-olate the boundary between religion and political institutions when performedin public schools? Questions like these are not new, and they are subject to almost constant debate by clergy, politicians, and lawyers. They are also questions that scholarshave taken up in earnest. A common structure of academic inquiry in the so-cial sciences consists of examining a social phenomenon and then explainingwhat that phenomenon is really about. Thus we have studies of tastes in food being really about cultural capital (Johnston and Baumann 2004); working- class racism being really about declining social status (McVeigh 1999); debates over abortion being really about controlling white female sexuality (Beisel 2004). In the same mode, a demonstrably political speech at a religious serviceor explicitly religious music at a civil concert is taken as evidence that every-thing is not what it appears\u2014that the event itself is really about something else. This chapter suggests that the search for an underlying, \"authentic\" mean- ing behind a particular event or social experience leads us astray in under-standing the relationship between religion, politics, and motivation. The spheresof religion and politics, although rightly kept analytically distinct, are often em-pirically intertwined. Sometimes this is due to the conscious interweaving ofthe two by religious or political leaders, but, more important, it occurs becausethe very denitions of religious and political activity are porous and shifting.What counts as \"political\" or \"religious\" changes for individuals through time and across different social situations. The difculty in locating and dening a clear boundary between the two is more than an analytic inconvenience; theblurring of religious and political spheres is a key source of change in the mod-ern world. In particular, contemporary social movements rely on the adaptabil-ity and mobility of symbols and meanings across the boundaries of these twodomains in their efforts to achieve their goals. This chapter analyzes the relationship between religion and the contempo- rary pro-life movement in the United States in order to develop this idea further.Many view the pro-life movement as a virtual adjunct to religious institutions\u2014a movement rooted organizationally in churches, populated by activists withdeep religious commitments, and supporting a moral position derived from thetheology of conservative Catholic and fundamentalist Protestant traditions. 1Re- ligion isimportant within the pro-life movement, but it is not nearly as encom- passing as this conventional wisdom suggests. Both politics and religion \"hap-pen \" within the pro-life movement, and the relationship between the two\u2014andhow each affects the other\u2014is one of its most interesting aspects. This analysis draws on data from a more general study of mobilization within the pro-life movement. In-depth, life history interviews were conductedwith eighty-two activists in four locations: Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Charleston,South Carolina; the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota; and122 religion \" out of place\"Boston, Massachusetts. Activists were identied using snowball techniques, with a focus on including a wide range of ages, religious backgrounds, degrees of in-volvement, and types of commitment. Interviews were conducted in a semistruc-tured format designed to collect detailed information about the participant's per-sonal biography, relationship to the pro-life movement, involvement in othersocial movements and political and civic organizations, beliefs about abortion,and relationship to religious institutions and ideas. Interviews typically lasted be-tween two and four hours. 2 Personal Grief and Political Statements My interview with Kimberly, a thirty-one-year-old married homemaker in Min-neapolis, was typical of many interviews I had had with pro-life activists in thestudy. We were at her home, sitting on a large screened porch as she described herinvolvement in a local independent church. About an hour into the interview Iasked her if there had been particular moments in her life when her religious faithhad grown or changed in any way. She responded by sharing with me an extraor-dinary account of her experience with a life-threatening pregnancy the previousyear. She described the events in detail over the course of the next ninety minutes.Kimberly became pregnant soon after her marriage two years previously. Unbe-knownst to her or her doctor, however, it was a tubal pregnancy that ruptured andcontinued to develop in her abdomen, outside of the uterus. Ultrasounds andother tests failed to detect the problem for almost four months, as she experiencedexcruciating pain and became increasingly incapacitated. The pregnancy was -nally terminated in emergency surgery that she credits with saving her life. After relating this story, Kimberly produced a thick yellow-flowered photo binder. The binder contained dozens of pictures of the unborn child that hadbeen recovered from the surgery, dressed in a stocking cap and blankets used for children born prematurely. The composition of the pictures was the same as you might nd in any picture book for a newborn, including pictures ofJeremiah (the name Kimberly and her husband gave him) being held by Kim-berly in her hospital bed, husband at her side, pictures of relatives with Jere-miah, and pictures of hospital staff who had helped her through the ordeal.Both she and her husband are smiling throughout the album, like proud par-ents would be in any baby picture book. None of this appeared at all disconcerting or incongruous to Kimberly, the two of us sitting on her porch, drinking lemonade, looking at pictures offteen-week fetal remains. She told the story as a religious story, in response toa question I asked about her religious faith. As Kimberly explained: I knew that He knew Jeremiah since the day that he was born. He knew that he wasn 't in the womb, and that his days were ordained.when a funeral isn 't just a funeral 123And I think the sovereignty of God helped both Jim [Kim 's husband] and I cope with that loss. Because God knew. He knew that his dayswere going to be as many as they were. He knew that he was going tobe outside of the womb. And actually I've seen God use that a lot too.We had a memorial service, and one hundred people came, and wedid a graveside burial and stuff for him. The issue for Kimberly is not one of politics. She normalizes and makes sense of her pregnancy experience through her religious faith. For her, the loss of apregnancy\u2014even in the fteenth week\u2014is no different than the loss of ayoung child after birth. Treating the tragedy in this way was her way of copingwith what happened. It included not just taking pictures to show to others butalso holding a memorial service to publicly mourn their loss. The resulting fu-neral service was, for her and others, a deeply religious event. These kinds of memorial services occur regularly within the pro-life move- ment. Activists understand the events as necessary rituals for reconnecting withGod and one's faith. \"It does become a religious issue; it does become a faith is-sue,\" explained Nicky, a thirty-seven-year-old woman in Charleston. She de-scribed a funeral she once attended for an aborted child: \"They had a wholechurch service in this huge Catholic church. It was a sunny day and they had thebaby in a little tiny silver casket. The casket was up at the altar, but the churchdoors were open and a woman just walking by saw that little casket and camein.\" The woman who entered became an activist in the movement after attend-ing the service\u2014and confessing to the priest that she had once had an abortion.For Nicky, this is conrmation that God makes a purpose for everything: \"Thisis what I mean about the sovereignty of God and God's economy of things. Ifyou could only have eyes to see, I think people would see these things happenevery day.\" Funerals within the context of the pro-life movement are religiousevents in every respect. They frequently take place in sacred spaces such as achurch; they are presided over by regular priests, pastors, or other clergy; andthey incorporate all the same symbols and rituals (casket, sacred songs, eulo-gies, etc.) found in a usual funeral. Most important, people attend them asfu- nerals and are affected in the same way they would be at any other such service.People cry at funerals for aborted children; they comfort each other; they pray toGod and sometimes question God. In other words, these services are deeplymeaningful to many; they are genuinely and profoundly religious events. It would be naive, however, to conclude that religion (and coping with grief ) is allthese funerals represent. After all, I learned about such services, and attended several, in the context of interviewing pro-life activists\u2014peoplewho are part of a social movement that has, at least in part, explicitly politicalgoals. Nicky's description here hints at a more instrumental purpose for suchservices beyond their religious meaning: they serve to recruit people into thecause. The open doors and the \"tiny silver casket\" caught the attention of the124 religion \" out of place\"woman walking down the street. Such funerals are often organized and man- aged by movement leaders, even if the actual event itself is led by a clergyman. Funeral services are important to the pro-life movement because they pub- licly establish the humanity of the fetus. They are a ritualized demonstrationthat an unborn child is no different than any other human being, whose lossshould be mourned through the symbols, rites, and emotional displays of a fu-neral. Such services are also important because they are an opportunity formovement organizations to draw large numbers of people to an event and at-tract media attention. Activists within the movement devote considerable time and effort to making these funerals possible. One student I spoke to in Boston was part of a campaignto scour the garbage cans of area clinics that performed abortions, believing shecould locate fetal remains that might be used in funeral services. Others work onrelated events, such as setting up mock graveyards in public parks and collegecampuses. Fund-raising for movement organizations lies behind all these efforts,including the staged funerals. In the Twin Cities, Pro-Life Action Ministries israising money to establish a permanent Chapel of the Innocents to rememberaborted children. Its June 1999 newsletter describes the chapel this way: At the beginning of this year, through the generosity of two families, we were able to purchase the property next to the Robbinsdale abortu-ary. Our plan is to use this as a memorial chapel to the aborted ba-bies. We intend for it to be a place of prayer, where Christians fromall denominations can come and offer prayers for an end to thekilling of defenseless babies by abortion. We are also setting aside anarea as a memorial to the aborted babies, keeping alive their memorythrough pictures, plaques, and other memorials. We envision this asnot only showing the reality of what abortion is, but also as a meansof healing for those who have been involved in abortion. The last line of the newsletter description recognizes the dual nature of the chapel. On the one hand, the organization is quite clear that it intends thechapel to serve a political purpose\u2014that of \"showing the reality of what abor-tion is.\" On the other hand, it also intends to create something that serves thereligious purpose of repentance and rejuvenation\u2014a \"means of healing forthose who have been involved in abortion.\" Thus, these same funerals andother services that hold such deeply religious meaning also hold obvious andexplicit political meaning as well. The Polysemy of Experience So are these funerals and other kinds of services and memorials ultimately reli-gious events or political events? Even the cursory description I have given thuswhen a funeral isn 't just a funeral 125far suggests the question is a futile one. Pro-life movement funerals have im- portant elements of both religious and political spheres. Most important, theyhave both religious and political meaning for those who are involved. Theevents are polysemous ; they have multiple\u2014and in some cases competing\u2014 meanings. This concept of polysemy is not new to anthropologists or literarycritics; it is a concept with an established history in these disciplines. 3The socio- logical study of religion, however, has largely ignored or explained away the factthat religion in the modern world frequently overlaps other spheres of activity. 4 This long-standing blind spot in the literature has been reinforced by market-based conceptualizations of religion that see a religious market provid-ing religious goods to consumers (Finke and Stark 1992; Warner 1993; Ian-naccone 1994). Such a conceptualization keeps Durkheim 's ([1898] 1975) pre-sumption that modern religion is something essentially private and personal.Anytime religion is observed outside the private and personal, therefore, itcomes as a surprise and is analyzed in terms of how and why religion hascrossed an important and clearly delineated boundary. What happens empirically, however, is more than simply religion being in- jected into \"other\" domains, or religion providing a cognitive or affective over-lay for \"other\" (read: public) issues. Events, experiences, and entire social situa-tions can rightly be a part of multiple domains simultaneously. Activity withinthe pro-life movement frequently takes on this polysemous character. Eventsare not really political with a religious veneer or vice versa; instead, they are ir-reducibly political at the same time as they are irreducibly religious. This is nottrue only of funerals but also of other movement events, including demonstra-tions, vigils, statehouse rallies, fund-raising campaigns, and ordinary organiza-tional meetings. Prayer, for example, is a common ritual in many religious traditions. It is also a common feature of most pro-life events. Prayer at pro-life events repre-sents more than simply a marker that the people involved hold a religious faith;it is an integral part of their efforts to end abortion. Many see prayer as a bonade tactic for achieving the goals of the movement. Rosaries for Life, a pro-lifeorganization in the Twin Cities, does nothing else besides pray outside of abor-tion clinics. Prayer for many activists is action intended to have very this-worldly consequences. They expect prayer to lead to a real, measurable changein public policy or a decline in the number of abortions. \"I would say prayershould be the beginning, middle, and end of any kind of serious approach tothe abortion issue,\" one activist in the Twin Cities told me. Another in Bostonbelieves that one day the movement will be able \"to pray the abortion clinicsout of business.\" Still another reasoned that it was prayer that led to the fall ofthe Soviet Union, and so too would prayer be the strategy that ultimately willend legalized abortion. Prayer in these cases does not simply justify socialmovement activity or give it meaning; it isthe social movement activity. The act of prayer in such cases is simultaneously a political and a religious act. 5126 religion \" out of place\"The polysemy of social movement events occurs in situations more mun- dane than funerals or even prayers at a rally or protest. The vast majority of thetime activists spend on movement activity is spent in meetings\u2014organizationalmeetings, board meetings, planning meetings, fund-raising meetings, envelope-stufng evenings, and so forth. As in any social movement, activists spend anenormous amount of time just among themselves, discussing the abortion is-sue and exchanging ideas, beliefs, and experiences. The similarity between thiscoming together of activists and the gathering of the faithful in Christian tradi-tions is not lost on those who are involved. \"To me it's fellowship,\" said Jean, aforty-six-year-old Baptist in Oklahoma City, in describing a recent pro-lifeevent. Others talk about social movement activity being all about \"neat Chris-tians,\" \"communing with other Christians,\" or \"standing lovingly together.\"What constitutes gathering of the flock in a religious sense and mobilizing so-cial movement activism in a political sense is blurred even in these ordinarymovement gatherings. Polysemy in the social movement events described here can also be viewed from the other direction: seemingly religious events that also carrying a strongpolitical meaning for those with \"ears to hear.\" This is often as much in the ab-sence of a gesture as in its presence. A Catholic priest in Charleston explainedto me that the religious views expressed by many clergy in the area were af-fected by political pressure and the desire not to make religious services \"con-troversial.\" The religious sphere is thus not an island in the social landscape;just as it regularly overlaps with everyday life, so too do politics and other social domains affect what is considered appropriately \"religious.\" Similarly, civil religious observance can also be political argument. Henry, a fty-six-year-old Anglican in Oklahoma City, was incensed as he explained tome that the Oklahoma City Memorial\u2014which pays tribute to those who died inthe 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building\u2014contains only 168 chairsrather than 171. To him, the failure to include chairs for three unborn childrenwho died in the building represents a political statement in what is otherwisesacred, religious space. The Power of Ambiguity So what does all this mean? My argument thus far has been that religion doesnot exist in a discrete, tidy social box. The religious domain frequently overlapswith other aspects of social life. Events and experiences in the social world takeon multiple, yet equally genuine, meanings. Understanding religion todaythus requires that we take account of this polysemy and the complicated waysin which religious beliefs, rituals, experiences, and expectations overlap otherdomains of life. But why is this important? Why does it matter that the religiouslandscape is considerably more complex than the way in which we typically viewwhen a funeral isn 't just a funeral 127it? The blurring of the religious and the political is not simply a scholarly curiosity or a problem of classication or typology. The polysemy of social situ-ations, and in particular pro-life social movement events, is a key concept inunderstanding social change. Put simply, the very ambiguity we face in classi-fying events as religious or political is a basis for the power such events have tobe transformative. Most obvious is the simple leverage religion provides to political mes- sages. By having a religious as well as a political meaning, activists invoke thesacred and transcendent in their advocacy for legislative or constitutionalchange. In some cases such leverage is actively sought by activists, who instru-mentally use religious language, imagery, and rituals to establish movementactivities as meaningful to a religious constituency. This is the kind of leveragepro-choice advocates have repeatedly identied and decried in the pro-lifemovement for the last several decades. Far more common, however, are ac-tivists who themselves move easily between political and religious meanings indiscussing the abortion issue. Many activists freely discuss politics and religion interchangeably when addressing abortion, suggesting that they see little difference between thetwo. When asked if abortion should be illegal, Danny, a teenage activist inCharleston, put it this way: \"The issue is should the child be able to be killed andat what age. Who are we to legislate when a child deserves to die or not? We'renot God. We're not omniscient. We don 't know these things.\" Danny movesseamlessly between his ideas of what should be legal and his ideas about God. For him, the overlap between the political and religious meaning is self-evident and natural. Others are more explicit about making the case. \"This is America,you know,\" explains Dominique, a forty-eight-year-old Baptist in OklahomaCity. \"The foundation of the country is built up on the word of God. And if theConstitution is built up with the Ten Commandments, and 'Thou Shalt NotKill,' they should stop it [abortion]. They should make it illegal.\" Here, too, Do-minique is moving easily between politics and religion, the U.S. Constitutionand the Bible, but in doing so she also makes the case this is the way we ought to be discussing the issue; that discussion of amending the Constitution isa reli- gious discussion because our politics are built on a religious foundation. Other activists acknowledge that such overtly religious arguments for legal change may be disadvantageous. They themselves see abortion in primarily re-ligious terms but draw on political meanings to leverage their appeal. \"I thinkthe pro-life message can be portrayed and should be portrayed without as muchof the religious bent,\" says Mariah, a twenty-six-year-old activist in Boston.\" A lot of people don 't have that same foundation ....B u t I mean it's a kind of basic civil right to have the right to life.\" Here Mariah draws on the politicalcurrency of civil rights language to advocate for a moral position she readilyadmits is, for her, tied principally to her religious faith.128 religion \" out of place\"Others see a legal ban on abortion not just as an end in itself but also as a way to draw people's attention to the moral problem of abortion. Richard, afty-seven-year-old in the Twin Cities, put it this way: \"My perspective on law, ifanything happens legislatively or congressionally, is as an educational func-tion. We sometimes forget that the law has an immensely important role toplay in educating people. And I would value a law primarily for its educationalfunctio n...a s t o this is what is important for society, this is what we should value in society.\" Richard's perspective is one in which political changes willserve as a moral guide to people, not simply as the legal enforcement of moral-ity. It is a view that seeks to use the political sphere to leverage changes in thereligious sphere. Polysemy also gives the pro-life movement the opportunity to aggregate multiple identities and multiple meanings in the same activities. Here the is-sue is not that individual activists reject the division between politics and reli-gion, as in the cases of Danny, Dominique, Mariah, and Richard. Instead, ac-tivities can have much different meanings to different participants involved inthe same social situation. For some participants, an event may be a political act;for others, the same event may be almost entirely religious. It is not necessaryfor everyone to accept the same package of meanings. The pro-life funerals described earlier hint at how this aggregation works in practice. For some, such funerals are staged political theater, designed with spe-cic political goals in mind. Others, however, experience these memorial ser-vices as primarily or even exclusively spiritual events. The funerals held for two children of Norm Coleman, a current Republican U.S. senator from Minnesota, provide a good example. Coleman and his wife lost two of their four childrenshortly after birth due to genetic problems that are routinely detected duringpregnancy. In both cases, the family chose to carry the affected pregnancies toterm, care for the children as long as possible, and hold funerals and mourntheir deaths. The Coleman family made these choices on the basis of stronglyheld religious beliefs rooted in his wife's Catholic faith. These personal eventshad little to do with Norm Coleman 's political career. Indeed, during this timeColeman was a well-known Democrat in Minnesota for whom opposition toabortion was not a winning issue. In fact, he believes his personal beliefs aboutabortion and opposition to the pro-choice Democratic platform played a role inhis 1993 defeat in the St. Paul mayoral race. \"I mostly feel great sadness aboutthe issue,\" he explained to me in 1999, adding that \"abortion diminishes us all.\" The funerals for the Coleman children were religious rituals that helped be- gin the healing process for family and friends after an enormous loss. The ser-vices were more than this, however. Many people took a political meaning awayfrom these funerals, perhaps because of Norm Coleman 's status as a public g-ure. I spoke to several activists in the Twin Cities who saw the actions of theColeman family as moral conrmation of their political views about abortion. Inwhen a funeral isn 't just a funeral 129other words, they interpreted the funerals as politically important irrespective of how the Colemans themselves might have interpreted them. Patricia, a fty-ve-year-old activist in the Twin Cities, invoked one of the funerals when I asked herwhether there were any circumstances under which abortion should be legal: I was at the [Coleman] funeral, it was at the cathedral, it was the most beautiful, holy Jewish/Catholic funeral to say good-bye to this beauti-ful baby, and the baby was gorgeous .... This baby was born dying, but they don 't regret that. They don 't regret not saying, gosh weshould have chopped that baby in pieces so we didn 't have to put upwith a dead baby, or a baby that was dying. They all felt so good toknow that that baby felt loved from the moment of conception all theway through to the moment of death. And that's the way we pro-liferslook at things. For some, the funeral was primarily\u2014and perhaps solely\u2014a religious or spiri- tual event. The meaning it held drew on ideas of loss and grief and faith andGod. For Patricia and others who attended, however, the event was politicalproof that abortion is wrong and should be illegal. The meaning for her was, atleast in part, political. In these cases, not everyone takes away the same meaning from the event\u2014not everyone sees both its political and religious implications. From theperspective of a social movement, however, unanimity of purpose among par-ticipants is not necessary; not everyone must agree on a single unied inter-pretation. The diversity of meanings leads to greater participation and a greaterpotential impact. 6It is common, for example, to nd Catholics praying the rosary in front of women 's clinics during abortion protests. Their understand-ing of the situation is reflected in the explanation by Helen, an eighty-two-year-old Catholic in the Twin Cities: \" At the noon hour, after we nished our meal,some of us would go to the Ford Parkway [women 's clinic] and pray the rosarythere. And others could opt to stay in the church and be in the chapel there,we'd pray the rosary there. Fifteen decets for that purpose.\" Helen and manyothers like her have little or no connection to pro-life organizations outside thechurch. They know how to say rosaries, and they understand rosaries outsideof an abortion clinic as simply an extension of rosaries performed in a chapel. Those involved in such prayer seldom talk to the more boisterous protest- ers at the clinics; indeed, they nd such direct action at best distasteful.Nonetheless, they are part of the social environment that is created by the pro-life movement outside of women 's clinics around the country. Despite theirmuch different attitude toward action at the clinics, they contribute to the over-all protest simply by being there. The overall protest is one in which some en-gage in activity that looks political, while others engage in activity that looks re-ligious. Some will derive political meaning from one or both kinds of activity,whereas others will derive religious meaning. The blurring of the boundaries130 religion \" out of place\"between these two meanings aids the pro-life movement by making different kinds of action possible and multiple kinds of meaning plausible. Changing Meanings, Changing Minds Different interpretations and differing meanings do not always stay separate. Pol-ysemy in social movement events can also lead to outright conversion of an indi-vidual's understanding of the abortion issue. This is perhaps the most interestingimplication of the overlap between religious and political meaning. Polysemy in-troduces both ambiguity in social situations and multiple nodes of meaning thatcan cross-fertilize one another or be used by religious or political entrepreneursto change peoples' denitions of the situation. A person who attends a pro-life fu-neral with a religious understanding of the event might come away from the ex-perience with some of the political meaning also embedded in the memory. Atleast as intriguing is the opposite possibility\u2014that some might be engaged inpro-life movement practices as a committed political activist and through his orher activism come to discover the religious meaning of those same activities. My data show that this process does occur in the pro-life movement. Some people who get involved in a religious event come to realize the politicalimplications of the activity. This was the case for Fred, a fty-two-year-old inCharleston, who rst attended a \"Chain of Life\" event that he learned aboutthrough his church. \"The object of it was to stand there and hold hands and pray,\" he explained. \"I thought it was to eventually have a chain of people across the state.\" He originally participated with a primarily religious under-standing of the event. Soon, however, his interpretation became increasinglypolitical. First, it was the many signs that other participants were holding,signs with explicitly political messages (e.g., Overturn Roe v. Wade Now!) andothers linking the religious to the political (e.g., God Is Pro-Life). Then helearned more about abortion, and in particular late-term abortions, from oth-ers who were involved in the event. Although originally a religious participant,Fred was won over to a more political interpretation after he began talkingto and forging relationships with others. This change reverberated throughmany of his volunteer activities, as he began to take an interest in the pro-lifemovement and regularly attend pro-life rallies and other political activities. We are accustomed to thinking about ways in which a person 's religious faith might lead him or her to become politically involved in the pro-life move-ment. What has received far less attention is the fact that the same process alsoworks the other way. If religious and political meanings overlap in socialspaces, there is no reason experiences originally understood as political mightnot take on religious meanings for some. In fact, several of the people I spoketo were committed secular activists in the pro-life movement before nding re-ligious signicance in their movement activity. Linda, a fty-two-year-old activistwhen a funeral isn 't just a funeral 131in the Twin Cities, had long ago dismissed the relevance of religion to her life when she rst became involved in pro-life activism. Indeed, the religiosity sheencountered in the movement made her uncomfortable: I was real embarrassed to be with people who would say, \" 'God bless you.\" I mean, I thought that was something you said when somebodysneezed, but not when you said good-bye and \"God bless you.\" Thatwas just kind of foreign to me; my family didn 't talk like that. And in thepro-life movement I started meeting evangelical Christians who wouldtalk about what the Bible says, and I never knew what the Bible said. Linda went from this position to a newfound religious faith rooted in her re- peated involvement in pro-life political activity. \" All of a sudden I thought, myGod. My God!\" she explains. \" And I got down and I had this conversation, peoplecall it a conversion experience, and all of a sudden I realized that God loved mejust the way I was.\" Linda's religious faith is important to her today, and she is anactive participant in her new church. She has continued her pro-life activism, butit has taken on a much different\u2014more religious\u2014meaning than it had before. Linda's experience is not unique. In fact, almost one in ve of the activists I interviewed came to their current religious faith either contemporaneouswith or after the beginning of their involvement in the pro-life movement. Theconnection between religion and activism is more dynamic and causally morecomplicated that the conventional view of the pro-life movement suggests. Ac-tivists who participate in the polysemous discussions, meetings, events, andcampaigns of the movement are not simply influenced by religion; they arealso simultaneously reinforcing the vitality of religious faith in their own livesand in their social worlds. In doing so they change their religious commit-ments or, in some cases, create them where they never existed before. The reality of religion in the modern world is that the distinctions between the religious and nonreligious spheres are not nearly as clear as we typicallyexpect. The issue is more than one of denition. Social movement activity canbe both religious and political at the same time. This fact changes the layersof meaning available to social movement participants and can lead to thestrengthening of their political or religious identities not only within the move-ment but in the rest of their lives as well. The power of religious practice to af-fect political action and\u2014less frequently acknowledged\u2014the power of politicalaction to change religious faith both lie in the polysemy of social experiences. Conclusion One important implication of this argument is that human agency in effectingchange can be located in the spaces where multiple meanings overlap, where132 religion \" out of place\"actors actively manipulate, manage, control, and/or influence events in order to affect how a situation is understood by others. The manipulation, modication,and synthesis of meanings need not always be conscious attempts to exercisepower, however. Another implication of this argument is that many social situa-tions require negotiation and experimentation with multiple meanings by thosewho are involved. Polysemy creates conditions that are especially pregnant withthe possibility of new meanings and new potential patterns of action. Another way to think about this idea is that meaning is unevenly distrib- uted among actors in a particular situation. We cannot know, as an observer,what any situation \"means.\" By insisting on a sharp line between religiousand nonreligious meanings, we miss the myriad ways in which the domain ofreligion regularly overlaps with other domains of life, and thus the ways inwhich each domain affects the others. In missing this overlap, we also misshow individuals interact with their environments and with each other in waysthat can change both themselves and the larger society. Sometimes a funeralis much more than just a funeral. In the case of the pro-life movement, reli-gious rituals and political activism are at times irreducibly one and the samething. Taking the polysemy of social events seriously reveals that the religious do- main is not limited to private beliefs and worship set aside in specially desig-nated churches, synagogues, mosques, and temples. Instead, religion is intri-cately intertwined with every other social domain, including the public square,personal relationships, the economy, and the academy. Recognition of poly-semy in many different situations also affords us the possibility of clarifyingthe mechanisms by which attitude change takes place, the relationship be-tween beliefs and behavior, and the possibilities for individual agency withindifferent sets of social structures. In other words, the overlap between religionand other social domains is more than a story of how the world is more com-plicated than we generally allow for; recognition of the layered meaning ofeveryday action actually provides us with a hook to improve our conceptualiza-tion of religion and our models of the larger social world. notes 1. Some of the most well-known statements of this perspective include Luker (1984), Blanchard (1994), Ginsburg (1989), and Jacoby (1998). 2. Complete information on the study's methodology and sample is found in Munson (2002). 3. For the most part, however, the term polysemy in its anthropological and literary usage carries a connotation of bringing a subversive or oppositional meaning to socialsituations. No such connotation is warranted here; by labeling social events polyse-mous, I mean only that they carry more than a single valid meaning as understood byparticipants.when a funeral isn 't just a funeral 1334. An important exception is Karen Fields's (1985) work on the Watchtower movement, which sparked my rst thinking about polysemy. 5. Interestingly, previous major studies of the pro-life movement hardly mention prayer at all (Maxwell 2002; Jacoby 1998; Luker 1984; Ginsburg 1989). Ginsburg doesdiscuss the importance of prayer in the movement but sees it as serving a solely sym- bolic purpose. 6. The social movement literature on framing generally assumes that movements are associated with a single, unifying frame (Evans 1997), but there is some empiricalevidence to suggest that in fact large grassroots movements require managing multi- ple meanings and frames for multiple audiences (Munson 1998). references Beisel, Nicola, and Tamara Kay. 2004.

In 1996, leaders of the Urban Religious Coalition in Lakeburg,1a midsize, midwestern American city, were dreading a cascade of hu-man fallout from the historic welfare policy reforms that were aboutto become law. A service and advocacy network of fty local congrega-tions, Urban Religious Coalition wondered how to respond to thenew times. No one thought churches could or should \"take over\" so-cial services as government responsibilities shrank. Coalition leadersdid say from the start that religious people had civic responsibilitiesto the community at large. How would religious people act on thoseresponsibilities? Coalition leaders envisioned one scenario in whichneighborhood \"clusters,\" alliances of congregations, would dedicatethemselves to the well-being of neighborhoods where people espe-cially vulnerable to the new policies lived. Park Cluster was the rst of these neighborhood alliances to ma- terialize. It gathered representatives from eight, mostly white andmiddle-class, religious congregations: Episcopalian, Lutheran(ELCA), United Methodist, Presbyterian (USA), a Friends meeting,and a Unitarian fellowship. Park Cluster focused on the low-incomeblack, southeast Asian, and Hispanic Park neighborhood that manyLakeburgers knew mainly from television crime reports. Very few, ifany, Park residents attended Cluster churches. Very few, if any, Clus-ter members had other reasons to visit the Park neighborhood, whoselocation across a six-lane highway from most of Lakeburg's middle-class neighborhoods only accentuated its social distance from Clustermembers' daily lives. During the rst two years of the Cluster, members and other volunteers from Cluster churches tutored Park kids in after-school pro-grams and led nature walks. They supported neighborhood social workers andthe Park Neighborhood Center by serving dinner and cleaning up at the annualSoutheast Asian festival, the Christmas party, and other events. Having started with these direct-service projects, the Cluster increasingly took on small-scale community development efforts. It tried to create new pub-lic resources for the neighborhood, consulting with neighborhood leaders, resi-dents, and county services staff. It planned to cosponsor a \"parish nurse\" for theneighborhood, and it pooled money for an \"eviction prevention fund\" for resi-dents about to lose their apartments. Frequently members discussed how to getPark residents involved in Cluster projects as agenda-setting partners ratherthan subordinates or clients. Eighteen months into my study, Cluster memberswere judging these projects to have been successful, if frustrating and slow-going. The parish nurse began working in the neighborhood, the Cluster wasinvited to seats on the Park Neighborhood Center steering committee, and Parkresidents began attending and speaking at the Cluster's monthly meetings. As a sociologist, I was studying the Cluster because I wanted to under- stand how religious people enter civic life and what they do there. There aremany kinds of civic action one could ask about, but I wanted to study religiousgroups reaching out and creating ties across big social divisions. Would agroup like Park Cluster cultivate broad ties in the wider community, as promi-nent theorists have expected? 2A variety of social scientists, policy scholars, and theologians\u2014Theda Skocpol, Robert Putnam, Robert Bellah, Mary Jo Bane,Brent Cofn, Ronald Thiemann, and others\u2014argue that religiously basedgroups have a potentially large role to play in strengthening social ties in soci-ety at large. 3None advocate that the United States become a \"Christian nation.\" They simply argue that, given American culture and history, there are widelyshared religious traditions that can help people create broad social bonds. So Iwanted to know whether or not religion helped Cluster members carry outtheir projects. I had thought I would hear members talking about their work in Christian terms, at least once in a while. Here were white church people doing commu-nity service in a neighborhood whose most vocal leader, the neighborhood cen-ter director, promoted black separatism and sometimes scorned white out-siders. Wouldn 't Cluster members invoke religious symbolism to steel theirown commitment to a difcult cause? Cluster brochures called the group \"faithin action.\" I assumed that I would hear people say they were acting on thatfaith. I listened and waited. After eighteen months of Cluster meetings, I counted a total of ve in- stances in which Cluster members afrmed a religious basis for action\u2014inmostly jocular or indirect ways at that. In one instance, a member quipped thatthe Cluster needed to act on the \"Christianity which comes out of our mouths.\"138 religion \"out of place\"She must have meant this guratively, as self-deprecating criticism of well- meaning volunteers, since Christian expression very rarely came out of any-one's mouth. Another time, a fund-raising professional and new member ofthe Cluster said half facetiously that the Cluster ought to do for the neighbor-hood what \"Jesus would do\"; in the meantime, she suggested, the Cluster coulddo some fund-raising. There was one Methodist pastor's remark that God hadput him in the place of working himself out of a job: if his efforts to strengthenthe Park neighborhood succeeded, he would happily nd some other line ofwork. And another member proposed at a committee meeting that the Clustershould take a \"servant\" role, among others. For Christians and Jews, servant-hood is a common metaphor for one who carries out God's will, especially byhumbly caring for others. And the Cluster started its monthly meeting witha prayer exactly once during my study. The Cluster puzzled me in light of studies that show church-based ac- tivists and volunteers using rich, nuanced religious language, participating inrituals that energize them and stir newcomers to the cause. 4Cluster members seemed capable of referring to religious teachings when I asked them to in in-terviews. Their brochures referred to Cluster members as \"people of faith.\" Butmembers did not sound religious at meetings; they did not sound driven byreligious teachings. Were they really a secular group whose churchgoing mem-bers simply drew on familiar religious motifs once in a while? It seemedunlikely that their rare and casual forms of religious expression would help ex-plain why they took up challenging community development goals in a neigh-borhood situated across huge social and cultural chasms from them. Beyond \"Why\": Asking \"How\" Often we assume that a group's religious character is interesting because reli-gion influences the group's goals, or its success in meeting them. Sometimeswe treat religion as a basic status characteristic, like gender or race. Othertimes we treat it like a fundamental worldview that shapes everything peopledo. In either case, religion is treated as a causal variable, even if it is an invisi-ble one. We ask whygroups do what they do, why they succeed or fail, and be- cause we assume that religion is by nature a motivator, we wonder if religion isthe cause of the action we observe. I learned, slowly, that there are other questions to ask. We learn a lot when we ask how community groups use religious idioms. How do group members wear their \"hats\" as religious people? Do they all look like the pro-life activistsZiad Munson describes in chapter 7? If we grant that religion may be a regularpart of public, community life in the United States, less privatized than classicsecularization accounts would expect, 5we need to know more about how it is present, what people are actually doing with religion in the civic arena. Thecommunicating religious presence in civic life 139same religious beliefs may look different when brought to life in different places (Becker 1999; Lichterman 2005). In everyday community life beyond themass-mediated world of skirmishes over abortion, gay marriage, and Ten Com-mandments displays in courthouses, religious expression circulates in differentways\u2014sometimes very quietly. We cannot always know how religious, as dis-tinct from secular, expression would look or sound. I observed and participated alongside Park Cluster for nearly two years. The Cluster was one of nine church-based community service groups andprojects in a larger study (Lichterman 2005). The groups and projects weremostly mainline or mostly evangelical Protestant, and all were responding, indifferent ways, to welfare reform or racial antagonisms. Over three years, Iwatched to see how they created, or failed to create, relationships across social,religious, and political divisions. I listened to how they articulated group proj-ects in religious and secular terms, rather than assuming religion always waspresent just because my subjects were churchgoers. Using Park Cluster as itsmain case, this chapter offers what I will call a communication perspective onreligion, which sensitizes us to the different things people do with religion incivic life. The chapter follows my shifting focus from \"why\" to \"how.\" A Communication Perspective on Religion As Nancy Ammerman (2003) points out, it has been common sense to assumethat religion gives people an unchanging core identity that denes the personin all social settings whether we see and hear the identity or not. This com-monsense view of religious identity reflects the self-understanding of some re-ligious people\u2014that religion is something that is always there\u2014 but we can learn a lot when we listen to religious communication in particular settings in-stead of identifying it simply as \"there\" or \"not there.\" Listening closely, welearn more about how a religious influence on action might work. Once we seeand hear the different things people do with religion, we can better understandhow religious expression might complement or inhibit different kinds of civicaction. Then we are in a better place to come back and ask \"why.\" Communicating Goals in Religious Terms Rather than study religion as silent values or beliefs we impute to people, somesociologists are probing the explicit religious communication we can hear inpublic arenas. Recent studies show us religiously based volunteer or activistgroups using elaborate, emotionally compelling religious discourses to frametheir goals of social justice or compassion. If language gives us the categoriesthat make individual thought and choice making possible, as sociologists of re-ligion have insisted, 6then these compelling discourses are part of the answer140 religion \"out of place\"to why low-income parishioners participate in risky campaigns to pressure cor- porations or government ofcials to act for justice, or why volunteers keepcoming back for the hard work of building new homes from the ground up. 7 We can use the communication perspective on religion to ask \"why,\" and thatis what I was doing at the outset when I expected that the power of religiouslanguage would help to explain why Park Cluster committed itself to commu-nity development over the relatively easier work of charity. Nearly everyone in the Cluster supported the increasing investment in community development projects. Yet their mixed vocabulary of motives couldhave supported a variety of goals. In private interviews toward the end of mystudy, and in group brochures, members described the Cluster's work our neighbors build their community,\"among others. There was a very loose relation between these religious and secu- lar terms, on the one hand, and the emerging, specic goals of the group, on theother. The religious discourse I heard in interviews or read in brochures wouldnot explain the Cluster's choice of actions much better than the very scanty reli-gious talk at meetings. Only one member ever quoted, in an interview, a biblicalpassage that afrmed anything specically like community development; andonly one Cluster member ever referred to a denominational initiative that closelycomplemented community development. In fact, it did not seem as if religionreally mattered in this group\u2014because I was assuming religion would matteronly if it was directly relevant to whythey did what they did. Then I pushed the communication perspective further. I tried to think more about \"how\" people communicate religion, bracketing for the time beingthe question of their particular goals. I recalled, as students of urban churchlife would point out, that religious people and groups have a distinctive pres-ence in civic life. 8That religious presence can wield its own kind of symbolic power over other groups as well as group members themselves. Constructinga religious presence and dening goals for action are two different kinds ofsymbolic work, each with its own potential effects on collective action. 9We need conceptual frameworks that help us appreciate each, separately. Communicating Religious Presence: Who We Are and to Whom We Are Relating Communicating religion involves signaling identities and relationships. As so- ciologists remind us, all public groups, secular or religious, construct their iden-tities in interaction. Group identities are not simply natural or self-evident. 10 And as social historian Margaret Somers argues, identities are an integral partof collective action. Groups must know who they think they are if they are goingto plan and act together (Somers 1994; Somers and Gibson 1994). Throughsymbols and stories, groups communicate to themselves identities that makecommunicating religious presence in civic life 141some kinds of collective action meaningful and other kinds hard for a group to imagine at all. Taking a similar, communication approach, social network schol-ars such as Harrison White and colleagues are understanding social networksas clusters of relationships with stories andsignals that organize those relation- ships and distinguish them from other clusters (White 1992; Mische and White1998). A group like Park Cluster may use religion in crafting the stories and sig-nals that tell members and outsiders who the Cluster is and how it relates toother groups. This sort of identity work would be overlooked, however, if we assume that acting religiously must mean pursuing goals in line with explicit theologicaldictates. Recent scholarship has been pointing out that religion includes notonly theologies or formal teachings\u2014the \"belief systems\" we often access withsurveys of private opinion\u2014but also everyday practices and identities throughwhich people live religion, beyond as well as inside congregations. 11These are expressions of religious presence, too. One need never say a word about belief, for instance, yet send the signal that one is a religious participant, and that signal has consequences. In Ameri-can civic life, a person known to be a practicing Christian or Jew may enjoy oth-ers' respect or trust\u2014or engender mistrust\u2014because of the meanings othersassociate with being religious. The fact of having a congregational identity at allmay help local religious leaders of different faiths trust one another enough towork together (Warren 2001; Wood 2002). Municipal ofcials sometimes payattention to local religious leaders by virtue of those leaders' social identities as religious people, apart from their particular beliefs (Demerath and Williams1992). Religious identity sends signals inside as well as between groups. Socialwork scholar Ram Cnaan and his colleagues (2002) argue that many Americanreligious congregations share a \"norm of community involvement,\" regardlessof their faith tradition. Americans learn, in other words, that being a memberof a religious congregation means being someone who should get involved with other congregants in community service (cf. Ammerman 2005). Returning to Park Cluster, we can ask now whether and how it may have been communicating religion in spite of what seemed like theological silenceat meetings and a mixed vocabulary of motives in brochures and private inter-views. That a group of mainline Protestants did not talk much about faith wasnot completely surprising. Other researchers have characterized mainlineProtestants as less accustomed than other Protestants to using explicitly bibli-cal or Christian language in settings outside church (Davie 1995; Cuddihy1978). By listening more carefully, we might hear Cluster members expressingreligious presence in the way they talked about their identity and their relation-ships with other groups, even without explicit afrmations of religious belief. In the next sections I show how Park Cluster communicated religious presence in the way members talked about the group's own identity and its142 religion \"out of place\"relationships with other groups. Then I compare my ndings with the reli- gious communication I heard among different organizations in the largerstudy. Strikingly, the Cluster was the only group that was succeeding at rela-tionship building on its own terms. How might this relate to the Cluster's com-munication of religious presence? This is not a question about program suc-cess or failure\u2014my study lacks the sort of carefully matched religious andsecular groups to make that assessment possible. I cannot estimate how muchreligious language about identity and relationships aided the Cluster's successif it did so at all. But I can suggest something about the way religious commu-nication complemented civic action. As scholars and citizens alike continue to wonder what can strengthen civic connections between groups separated by so-cial inequality or cultural difference, 12we all might benet from a bigger pic- ture of how civically engaged people do things with religion. Religious Presence: The Case of Park Cluster Communicating Identity and Connection The Cluster's brochure identied it as a religious group. It called members \"people of faith \" and put the motto \"Faith in Action \" on the front. What did\"people of faith \" mean concretely? One other group in the larger study identi-ed itself as \"people of faith,\" too. But that group did not expect members torepresent congregations. Cluster members, in contrast, constructed their iden-tity as an alliance of churches. They constructed the Cluster's religious identityin relation to a larger civic \"map\" 13of Lakeburg, and for most members, the Park neighborhood they envisioned on that map was a collectivity , not simply an aggregate of needy individuals. Two explicitly religious terms contributed to the Cluster's sense of itself and its connections on this map, even though the terms received very littleelaboration at Cluster meetings. One was the notion of a parish. When UrbanReligious Coalition leaders had envisioned congregational \"clusters\" workingwith and advocating on behalf of low-income neighborhoods, they had talkedof a cluster's shared neighborhood as its \"parish.\" Cluster members used theterm, too. A Park Cluster brochure referred to the Park neighborhood as part ofa \"common parish \" for Cluster churches. The implication was that the Clusterwould act as a religious group serving a collectivity as a whole. The churcheswere as much as three miles from the Park neighborhood, but with this reli-giously based notion of civic responsibility, they drew a boundary around theirshared neighborhood that included Park. It was in this context that the Clustercalled the public health nurse it cosponsored for the neighborhood a \"parishnurse.\" Although parish nurses usually are based in a congregation and servecommunicating religious presence in civic life 143the congregants, the Cluster's parish nurse was not afliated with any one Cluster church and served the Park neighborhood\u2014the Cluster's \"parish.\" This terminology puzzled me at rst. On the one hand, Cluster members made a point of telling me they did not intend to recruit people to theirchurches, but on the other hand, they identied themselves with a parish. I soonlearned, however, that \"parish \" signaled that they were church-based people exer- cising a sense of social responsibility toward a neighborhood as a whole\u2014notthat they expected others in the neighborhood to take up their religious faiths.Speaking from a particular group identity is not the same as promoting that identity to an audience. Cluster members never expounded upon the neighbor- hood as a \"parish \" at any length. They did not articulate a theology of the parish.But their written materials referred proudly to the \"parish nurse\" and to theneighborhood as a \"common parish.\" They were signaling quietly that the Clus-ter had a religious source for its sense of connection to a neighborhood. The other religious term I heard was social ministry . Nearly two years be- fore my study began, some Cluster members had met with outreach staff fromthe statewide council of churches. Council staff people presented a \"social min-istries grid,\" a set of questions meant to help volunteers in church-based ser-vice programs think about their role in the wake of welfare reform. Derivedfrom the social gospel of early twentieth-century mainline Protestantism, \"so-cial ministry\" calls Christians to bring about God's kingdom on earth by chal-lenging unjust social structures. In this meeting with the council staff, Clustermembers had developed questions to ask themselves about how they presented themselves in the Park neighborhood: Were they \"partners\" with the neighbor- hood, or was their relationship one of \"givers and receivers\"? Did they relate toexisting neighborhood groups? Did the Cluster's agenda setters include repre-sentatives of the community? During this study, these questions occasionally surfaced. Members did not use the grid to discuss what goals the group should pursue. Rather, it was a re-minder of the group's identity, a way of drawing boundaries on a larger social map . The questions said more about whom to bethan what exactly to doin the neigh- borhood. In the two years between the meeting with the church council staffand the group's transition toward community development goals, they carriedout many direct-service volunteer projects. During one especially heated discus-sion, a member referred to \"the social ministry grid\" to support her argumentthat the Cluster should relate respectfully to the neighborhood, no matterwhether it did direct-service volunteering or other kinds of projects. She in-structed the group, to general approval, \"we are not 'givers and receivers' butpartners.\" Like the notion of the common parish, \"social ministry\" was a subtletag of religious identity and connection, in relation to the Park neighborhood. During my eld observations, Cluster members never elaborated a theology of social ministry. Although Mark Warren (2001) found community activistswho said they drew on the Bible to create a \"theology of housing,\" I found the144 religion \"out of place\"Cluster's religious language spare, infrequent, and seemingly muted. Even though it might be tempting to conclude that the Cluster was really a seculargroup that simply happened to have begun with church volunteers, that wouldnot be true to the identity they were communicating. If they were \"really\" secu-lar, we would have to ask why each edition of the group's brochure bothered tocall the group \"faith in action.\" It would be unclear why members used reli-gious tags such as \"parish nurse.\" We might wonder why they consulted with astate religious council instead of a community organizing outt. And why didno one but self-identied members and representatives of churches ever jointhe Cluster? Religious identity, even in groups that begin as church-based initiatives, is not something we should take for granted. If the Cluster no longer wished tosignal that it was religious, it could easily have avoided religious terms alto-gether. A program for \"at-risk\" teenagers in the larger study started as a churchvolunteer-based project, sponsored by the Urban Religious Coalition, but neverused religious terms to describe its purpose at all. The teen project director toldme that it made no difference whether or not her volunteers happened to comefrom churches. The religious identity of the Cluster, in contrast, seemed salientto members, but not in ways that a focus on religiously driven goals wouldilluminate. Comparing Terms of Connection Comparing Park Cluster with the other groups in the larger study reveals inter-esting differences in the ways religious groups use religious or secular idiomsto articulate connections beyond the group. Park Cluster was the only groupthat consistently used a religious term for civic connections that it valued . The other Lakeburg groups either did not use religious terms for the ties they weretrying to create, or used religious terms for the kinds of ties they did notvalue, or else switched from religious to secular language when relationship buildingbecame frustrating. The Humane Response Alliance (HRA) was a coalition of church volun- teers and social service and advocacy group leaders who wanted to create newconnections between churches, food pantries, and county agencies. At monthlymeetings, members, including the county social workers who attended, alwaysidentied themselves as \"people of faith.\" They did not, however, use religiousterms for the new relationships they wanted to build in Lakeburg. HRA's di-rector liked to call the project \"reconnecting the caring community.\" HRA par-ticipants were religious people but were not reaching out in a way one neededto comprehend in religious terms. The Justice Task Force wrote position papers and created educational workshops about the corporate interests driving welfare reform. It put on theworkshops at Lakeburg churches, and members of the task force identiedcommunicating religious presence in civic life 145themselves as churchgoers, but rarely if ever did they characterize their goal of consciousness-raising in religious terms. The leading member called the taskforce a group of \"prophets\" on occasion, and other members agreed. But theydid not usethe term prophet to gure out how they should connect with Lake- burg congregations. The Task Force would switch to a more obviously religious language of compassion the few times they talked about reaching out to wel-fare recipients or administrators who had the unenviable job of enforcing apolicy they themselves might not support. The group never dwelt upon com-passionate caring, though, and some members seemed embarrassed to be dis-cussing it at all because they thought that would divert their steadfast, criticalfocus on social-structural relationships. Relating compassionately to individu-als was notthe kind of connection the group set out to make. Adopt-a-Family was a service project that paired mostly evangelical church volunteer groups with former welfare-receiving families. The groups aimed tosupport families whose household heads were making the transition to paidwork. They offered to babysit the children while mothers went to look for workor bought phone service for a family, helped an older son who was applying fora license to study for the driving test, or accompanied mothers to doctors' ap-pointments. At an orientation meeting, volunteers learned that they shouldserve the families with \"Christlike care.\" No one could miss that the groupsidentied themselves in explicitly Christian terms. I noticed, however, thatthe more the volunteers talked about their awkward, difcult relationships withthe families, the more they switched from a Christian language of compassion- ate servanthood to a much more secular language of \"cultural differences.\" The terms of Christian servanthood seemed unsatisfying to frustrated, white, andmiddle-class church volunteers trying to create personal relationships fromscratch with low-income African Americans. Members said at rst about them-selves that they needed to \"up our compassion levels\" in order to keep relatingto the \"adopted\" families. But as the efforts wore on, I heard more and moreabout \"cultural differences\" and less about the call to Christlike care. As Table 8.1 shows, Lakeburg groups did not all use religious idioms to de- scribe their connections, even though they were religiously sponsored groups.Park Cluster used a religious idiom of connection consistently. Its bridge-building efforts made sense inside a religious story of caring for a \"common parish.\" In Adopt-a-Family, the only other organization that gave religious lan-guage a big place in its relational repertoire, \"Christlike care\" made less andless sense when the receiving individuals did not respond as expected. These observations enlarge our understanding of what religious people do or do not do with religion in the civic arena. Scholars of civic life often havecited Tocqueville's claims ([1835] 1969) that religion would make Americansmore other-regarding and help them create broad social ties. But all the groupsstudied here could be called other-regarding, and yet they entered the civicarena very differently and had different experiences there. Adopt-a-Family was146 religion \"out of place\"a case in which religion seemed not to help civic actors create enduring bridges of any kind. Neo-Tocquevillian pronouncements on religion 's civic value arenot specic enough to be very useful. The religious terms identied in Table8.1 are neither examples of rich, emotionally powerful religious discourses ofsocial concern nor examples of elaborate, theological rationales. To understandhow religion enters the civic arena, we have to listen closely to how a group's re-ligious language enters the terms of identity and relationship, as well its talkabout its goals. In the Cluster, religion worked in a quiet, mundane way. Mem-bers used only a spare bit of concrete religious language and imagery as theydid their bridging work. It is tempting to come back to the \"why\" question and suggest that Park Cluster's way of communicating religious presence helped it to reach outboldly and stick with its projects. Of the four organizations described here,Park Cluster had the most success achieving its goals and building the bridgesit set out to build. We need more comparisons before saying why the Clustersucceeded and how much religion contributed to success. Following the com-munication perspective, though, it would make sense to propose that if reli- gious groups are trying to create civic relationships as religious groups , they may be more successful if they can tell a \"story\" that makes relationships valuable inreligious terms, apart from justifying the goals\u2014strengthening health care,lessening homelessness\u2014that they are pursuing. Otherwise, the work may notseem so meaningful or compelling. Sociologically speaking, religious groupsidentify with an ultimately sacred sense of duty, set apart from other kinds of obligation. If a group denes its actions as responding to God's calling, it maybe less inclined to get invested in relationships with people who are not part ofa common religious \"story,\" though it may see those relationships as good onnonreligious grounds. communicating religious presence in civic life 147 table 8.1.

The cases caution us against assuming thatself-identied religious groups must always be using religious idioms for what-ever they do. Two broader and perhaps counterintuitive lessons also emergefrom the case of Park Cluster. First, a religious language of social connectiondoes not necessarily threaten relationship building between diverse groupsthat do not share the initiating group's religious afliation. And second, simplereligious terms can articulate a commitment to social solidarity\u2014in this case,supportive relations between churches and a neighborhood as a whole\u2014that isdifferent from either the compassionate care or righteous struggle we usuallyassociate with religiously motivated efforts. As sociologists move beyond simple versions of the privatization thesis and listen closely to religion in everyday life, we nd that people weave reli-gious communication into civic action in a variety of sometimes surprisingways. Small signals sometimes carry signicant meanings. Listening closely toreligion 's different roles in civic interaction is essential before we can ask howmuch and in what specic ways religion matters for different kinds of civic ac- tion. Rather than issue blanket endorsements of \"faith-based\" (usually Judeo-Christian) civic groups, we need more nuanced and useful observations of howindividuals and groups use religion to stake out places for themselves and oth-ers in civil society. notes Arguments in this chapter are adapted from Lichterman (2005), especially chapter 7. 1.

Bartkowski Ramsey and Melissa Rogers have a problem, one not uncommon in American homes. Ramsey and Melissa nd themselves having dis-agreements about money. Who should make the decisions about howthe family's income is spent, and how should household purchases beprioritized? Who should handle the family's bookkeeping and bill-paying responsibilities? These are just some of the questions thatbedevil couples in many homes. Ramsey and Melissa are no different.And yet, while the couple's struggles about nances are typical, theyare hardly mundane. Ramsey and Melissa are both evangelicalChristians, and their marriage is anchored in their shared religiousconvictions. Ramsey and Melissa's dilemma is introduced here, and taken up again later in this chapter, as a means for reconsidering a series ofimportant questions situated squarely at the nexus between religionand family life. First, how do religious couples seek to balance the de-mands of secular concerns and sacred convictions? What happens in homes when deeply held religious ideals collide with powerful ele- ments of our secular culture such as individualism, consumer capi-talism, and changing ideas about gender? Second, how are everydayhousehold practices negotiated in light of the religious convictionsthat couples hold dear? Are religious beliefs straightforwardly inte-grated into domestic life, or are efforts to marry faith with family lifefraught with difculty?This chapter seeks to shed light on these questions. To do so, I analyze marriage and family life through the eyes of evangelical Christian men. Thereis much to be gained by examining the faith-family nexus through the lens ofevangelical Christian men 's marital and domestic experiences. First, given thedistinctively orthodox ideas about religion and family that pervade the evangel-ical world, at least among its most visible spokespersons (Bartkowski 2001),conservative Christian families provide an ideal opportunity to analyze adher-ents' efforts to negotiate between the demands of their religious convictionsand the currents of secular culture. There is a balancing act endemic to the bib-lical imperative that believers should be \"in but not of the world,\" and a carefulanalysis of religious adherents' efforts to navigate this razor's edge can tell us agreat deal about how their faith influences their home life and vice versa. Second, a focus on evangelical Christian men is needed to round out more than a decade of ethnographic research on conservative religious women. Priorresearch has revealed that women afliated with conservative religions are notsuffering from false consciousness. 1Whereas it was sometimes previously as- sumed that conservative religious women were dupes of the patriarchal faithswith which they afliated, careful ethnographies have revealed such women tobe thoughtful and articulate in discussing their religious convictions, strategicin their motivations for afliation, and capable of crafting gender and religiousidentities marked by fluidity and nuance. Regrettably, much less is known about conservative religious men. In much of the work on conservative religious women, men afliated with ortho-dox faiths amount to little more than an \"absent present.\" 2Given the male- dominated character of evangelical Protestantism, conservative Catholicism,and Orthodox Judaism, conservative religious men lurk in the background ofsuch studies as arbiters of patriarchy against which women adherents strategi-cally and sometimes subversively dene their identities. Despite the under-standable attention paid to such women, the question nevertheless remains:Do conservative religious husbands conform to the authoritarian model ofmale household leadership that one would assume goes hand in glove with ad-herence to a patriarchal faith? How are conservative religious men 's ideologiesand practices concerning family life informed by their religious convictions,and how are these convictions in turn shaped by secular culture? To explore these linkages between faith and family, I analyze the stories that evangelical Christian men tell about themselves, their wives, and their families.I begin with the premise that narratives are \"storied\" in two senses. First, narra-tives are vital for organizing everyday experiences and imbuing life with mean-ing. Narratives enable storytellers to convey important cultural cues about whothey are and who they are not, and to explain why certain courses of action aretaken while others are averted. Experiences can be narrated, and hence ordered,in many different ways. Some narratives employ the logic of similarity, as is thecase with analogies that highlight the bridges connecting various standpoints154 religion \"out of place\"and experiences. Other narratives draw on the logic of distinction and thereby underscore boundaries between different types of people and experiences.Thus, some narratives employ bridging discourse, while others reflect bound-ary work. Yet other narratives are predicated on the logic of transformation.Transformation narratives often begin with a problematic (dilemma) that leadsto an awakening (epiphany) and ends with a resolution (denouement). In ana-lyzing the stories that evangelical men tell, I pay attention to how the logics ofsimilarity, distinction, and transformation are employed, and ways in whichthese narratives shape household interactions in families of faith. A second characteristic of narratives is their \"storied\" (i.e., layered) quality. Like stories in a building, narratives often feature a variety of competing motifsand invite diverse interpretations. Thus, while narratives are an attempt to im-pose meaning and order on complicated experiences, they are ineluctablymarked by contradictions, tensions, and ironies. In this chapter, I seek to un-pack the layered logics woven into the stories that evangelical men tell abouttheir home life. I do so not to suggest duplicity in those whose stories I recounthere but instead to highlight the dynamic and complex character of culturalunderstandings about religion and family. In short, this chapter uses narrative analysis to explore the connections and contradictions between faith and family. I use in-depth interview data collectedfrom twenty evangelical men to examine these issues. While survey data high-light broad trends and general tendencies, interview data permit a more ne-grained analysis of the nuances and negotiated character of family relationships. The men interviewed for this study were all afliated with the evangelical men 's movement, Promise Keepers (PK). 3They were interviewed in 1998. Al- though men were asked about their involvement with PK, they were also askedabout the general influence of faith on their marital relationships, and it is the lat-ter constellation of questions that is the subject of analysis here. Because I seek toplace the complexities of evangelical men 's marital experiences at the center ofthis analysis, some of what follows features lengthy quotations. With other workhaving rendered broad portraits that compare conservative Protestant men withtheir nonevangelical peers (Wilcox 2004), I opt here for analytical depth that ex-amines complexities embedded in men 's stories of faith and family. Strength and Sensitivity: The Layered Logics of Faith and Family What words come to mind when one thinks of the typical evangelical husband?Head. Patriarch, Authority. Thanks to Focus on the Family, the conservative Christian organization that champions male \"headship\" in Christian house-holds, but also to feminist organizations that decry such edicts as a throwback tonineteenth-century authoritarianism, these images of the evangelical Christianhusband are etched into the American social imagination. Does this principle oflinkages between faith and family 155headship govern the relationships between the men that I interviewed and their wives? In a word, no. To a man, my interviewees' narratives integrated traditional ideas about gender difference, popular in evangelical family discourse, with notions ofmasculine sensitivity rooted in the New Man ideal that has pervaded secularAmerican society in recent decades (Wilcox 2004). The New Man is sensitivelyattuned to the needs of his wife and children rather than egocentric, willing toexpress his emotions openly rather than stoic, and governed by the sensibilitiesof egalitarianism and partnership rather than domineering. In dening thehusband's role in the family, evangelical men stitched together progressive no-tions of male tenderness and expressiveness with more traditional notions ofmasculine strength. By melding traditional and progressive ideals, construc-tions of the \"good Christian husband\" in such narratives are layered. Moreover,such constructions utilize the logic of distinction by contrasting the goodChristian husband with what might be called his \"heathen \" (i.e., non-Christianand self-centered) counterpart. (I use the term heathen as a thumbnail descrip- tion for the archetype of the non-Christian husband to which many of my in-terview subjects referred. To be sure, they did not use the word heathen .) My interview with Steve provides an excellent example of the antinomies of evangelical masculinity within the home, and of the boundary work used to dis-tinguish Christian husbands from their non-Christian counterparts. Throughoutour interview of more than two hours, Steve was not content to have me askingall the questions. When it came to discussing the connection between faith and marriage, Steve peppered me with questions. In one barrage, he queried: \"What i s i t...t h a t t h e Bible says that God wants a man to do what to his wife? What is [it that] he challenged [pause], commanded him to do to his wife? What is hisresponsibility?\" Following a long pause that disclosed my obvious reluctance torespond, Steve proceeded to answer his own questions for me: To love his wif e...M a n i s supposed to love the wife as Christ loved the church and gave himself to God. So sacrice. We're supposed tosacrice for our wives. Those are the three things that we're supposedto do. We're supposed to love them. We're supposed to sacrice forthem. That's just two things. And the third thing is [pause], let's see.Love, sacrice [pause]. And we're supposed to be courageous. Why doyou think he told us to be courageous all through the Bible? Not onetime [in the Bible] did God tell a woman to be courageous. But allthrough the Bible [God said to men]: Be courageous. \"Joshua, becourageous.\" All the guys in the New Testament. God commandedthem to be courageous. In short, Steve argues that a godly husband must exhibit love for his wife and must be willing to make sacrices for her. Yet he must also demonstratecourage. Love and sacrice mesh quite closely with the New Man ideal. New156 religion \"out of place\"Men are expected to exhibit emotional expressiveness and communicativeness, contrary to the traditional norm of masculine stoicism and insensitivity. NewMen are supposed to be other-centered and self-sacricing rather than narcis-sistic or selsh. Curiously, though, Steve leaves the third component of being a good husband\u2014that is, courage\u2014ill dened at this juncture of the interview, otherthan saying that God continually told men in the Bible to be courageous. Ipress him on this issue. As Steve denes it, courage is manifested not in manlybravado. Rather, it is manifested when men exhibit enough backbone to choosefamily commitments over secular distractions such as careerism and recre-ation \"with the guys.\" In this sense, courage circles back to love and sacrice.Moreover, it is here in the narrative that the archetype of the heathen husband,designated by the reference to \"most men,\" enters the fray. Steve explained: [A husband is] supposed to love her [his wife] as Christ loved the church and died for her. And we're supposed to die for [her] and sacri-ce [ for her]. Most men, if they had set a date or something on Satur-day to go to the mall to shop with their wives and all of a sudden allthe guys get together in their business and they're having a golf tour-nament and they need him to win this golf tournament, what do youthink he's going to do when these two things meet? Most men [are go-ing to say], real important.\" Youknow, instead of saying, \"No, guys. I told my wife I would go do this.\"They won 't sacrice for their wives. They sacrice for themselves anddo what they want to do. And when they do that, that tells the woman,\"I love myself and what I want to do more than I love you.\" And so that's the reason most divorces are occurring. . . . Most marriages bust up for one reason: unforgiven sin. Unforgiveness. They either gotmad at each other and they went on .... [Or] the husband never was courageous. [He never] went before his wife and said \"I was wrong.I hurt you. I broke my wedding vows to you. I didn 't honor you in thissituation.\" And when you deal with a person that you love and you tellthem, \"Honey, I blew it, I was wrong,\" that helps to bring back the re-spect. But most men are macho and they can 't admit they're wrong.And, you know, [they think] that means I'm weak. And yet the womanwants to see that he can admit that. Because if you do admit that anddo come ask to forgive me, that means you do love me. According to the layered logic found in Steve's narrative, men need to be both sensitive and strong. Steve resolves the apparent contradiction betweenthese otherwise competing characteristics, thereby building coherence into hisnarrative, by arguing that good Christian husbands must place masculinestrength (courage) in the service of marital sensitivity and humility. Thus,courage is measured by a man 's willingness to embrace his family obligationslinkages between faith and family 157even when such a decision is not popular with his friends and colleagues\u2014\"the guys,\" who serve as the out-group against which the good Christian husband isdened. Moreover, courageous men are willing to \"face up\" to their mistakes andare \"man enough \" to ask for forgiveness when they have offended their wives. Servant-Leadership: Refashioning Patriarchy for a Posttraditional World When asked about a husband's role in the family, most of the men I inter- viewed invoked the concept of servant-leadership, a term that is predicated onan apparent contradiction. A husband both is a servant to others in his familyand provides leadership to them. Here again is a layered logic that melds pro-gressive ideas with more traditional notions. Yet, among most of the men whomentioned this term, servant-leadership in the home entails responsibility forother family members rather than authority over them. The husband is ex-pected to \"lead\" in serving other family members and in ensuring that theneeds of his wife and children\u2014rather than his own wishes\u2014are a priority.Servant-leadership is a cultural tool that evangelicals have crafted in the wakeof feminist critiques of the patriarchal family. Such critiques have come fromsecular feminists, as well as their evangelical counterparts (Bartkowski 2001;Manning 1999). Moreover, servant-leadership reflects an attempt to steer amiddle course between traditional evangelical ideas about husband headshipand the secular, postfeminist New Man ideal that champions gender egalitari-anism. In what follows, I describe how this middle course is navigated by evan-gelical men in the context of their marital relationships. Matt's denition of this concept was typical in underscoring that servant- leaders are rst and foremost involved in their families. What is particularlyinteresting in Matt's commentary is his argument that a husband's nancialprovision for his family does not give him a pass on involvement in familyactivities upon arriving home from his paid job. Matt described his perspectivein this way: The best leader is a servant-leader. If you lead in serving, then [pause]. It's just like that phrase, you can 't outgive Go d... Bartkowski: So leadership does not necessarily entail decision-making au- thority in the hom e...? Not as much, although I think men need to be involved in decision making. [I am] not saying they don 't. It's coming home prepared toget involved. Men have this concept a lot of times that they're thebreadwinner and when they come home they deserve some rest. Af-ter all, they're bringing home the supplies, the very necessities of lifefor all the people that are there, and they should be served by them158 religion \"out of place\"since they are supplying their needs. But that's backward. Those people\u2014your wife, your kids\u2014have also been through a day. Maybenot rough in the same way that yours was rough, but they've beenthrough it. You should come home just as you are expecting to beserved, willing to serve them. [A husband should be] asking, \"What'sthe rst thing I can do to help?\" rather than, \"How can you help me?\" In Matt's home, these thoughts are not idle musings. Matt's convictions on this score have been translated into action in his relationship with his wife,Becky, and his son, Will. Having previously invested himself quite heavily inhis career, Matt now sets aside a specic amount of time\u2014what he calls a\"minimum requirement\"\u2014for Becky and Will each week. Matt's minimum re-quirement strategy for family involvement ensures that he is present in thehome and connected to kin. Matt explained: The scriptures say that our wives are sanctied by the washing of the word [Bible]. If we would honor that promise and actually share theword of God lovingly with our wives, that would actually sanctify her.I've seen that. That promotes a oneness that we shared when we weremarried that I didn 't realize that we had gotten away from with mylong hours at work. It has also promoted the fact that I need to behome more often, you know. I need to spend more time at home.I now have a commitment of a minimum amount of time that I willbe at home. I'm not going to commit to do anything else if that mini-mum hasn 't been met. In Matt's case, then, the neotraditional concept of servant-leadership gives way to progressive family practices. It is worth noting that servant-leadership is not dened in the same way by all the men that I interviewed. Sociologists assert that cultural tools can be usedin diverse ways even among persons sharing similar group afliations (Swidler2001), and evangelical Christian men are no exception. Although Matt's deni-tion of servant-leadership stresses the servant side of this concept, a few menplaced a comparatively greater emphasis on its leadership dimension. When Irst asked Hal about a husband's role in the home, he was quick to identifyservant-leadership as its foundation. However, his initial denition of this con-cept lacked the softer shades found in many other men 's responses: \"We [hus-bands] should be the leader of our home. You'll nd many homes where thewoman runs the house. She's the leader of the house. She takes charge anddoes this and that, right? But that's not God's plan.\" As Hal provided more detail about the nature of servant-leadership, his rhetoric tacked (i.e., moved back and forth) between the traditional and the pro-gressive. Initially, Hal enlisted the logic of analogy by comparing family life tothe workplace and military, both of which operate on the logic of hierarchy andlinkages between faith and family 159authority. These analogies, of course, lend a brazenly patriarchal cast to Hal's understanding of marriage. Yet, in shortly thereafter referencing the need fora husband to have a \"servant's heart,\" Hal wove self-sacrice and altruism intohis narrative construction of the good Christian husband, ultimately ending ona softer note than the one on which he began. Hal said: The man is to be the leader of the home and to make the nal deci- sions. Now, if we love our wives as Christ loved the Church [and was]willing to die for it, what does it tell you about what decision youought to be making ?...P u t i t into practical terms, and it's this. First thing we have to realize is that marriage is not a fty-fty relationshipat all. It's a hundred-hundred relationship. Anything short of thatdoesn 't work. So, in the decision-making process, somebody alwayshas to be able to break the tie. I don 't care if you're in business, in thearmy, in a marriage. If you're in any relationship, somebody has tohave the ability to break a tie in doing that. Now if we enter into thatsituation, both of us with servant's hearts, then I'm here to please youand bless you. Then my decision, though it's my decision to make,my decision is going to be in favor of you, rather than in favor of me.That's the difference. Bartkowski: So, the husband, say, acting as say the leader, or the servant- leader, will opt for his wife's decision? That's what Christ would call him to do. That's what Christ would call him to do. To make a wise, good decision. He would always give cre-dence and try to bless and honor that which his wife and childrenwould want to do. Interestingly, not all the evangelical men interviewed for this study relied on the concept of servant-leadership to describe the husband's role in thefamily. When a husband's role in the family is not predicated on servant-leadership, it is organized around men 's spiritual leadership in the home. Likeservant-leadership, spiritual leadership entails responsibility for the welfare ofother family members. Yet, spiritual leadership denes (and delimits) men 'srole within the family in sacred, religious terms rather than in terms of generaldecision making. A husband is a \"priest\" of sorts in his family. Phil's remarks provide a good illustration of the perspective embraced by men who advocate the spiritual leadership perspective. When asked about thedistinctiveness of his role in the family, Phil highlighted spiritual responsibili-ties that fall squarely on his shoulders: What I really do is I pray more. I pray more for my kids and pray more for my wife. I am the spiritual leader of the house. So anything thatgoes on in the house has to follow what the Bible tells us is true. I leadprayer sessions in the house. What we're doing is just doing the things160 religion \"out of place\"that Jesus tells us to do. You know, love your neighbor as much as you love yourself. . . . I have a responsibility to be the church leader of thehouse. Whether or not I accept it or not, the Bible says it's there. I'msupposed to be the one who is in charge of the spiritual well-being ofthe household and by that [I understand that] I need to be leading thefamily Bible studies, praying for my wife and children. It is noteworthy that Phil says that decisions made in his and wife Janice's family are predicated on \"what the Bible tells usis true\" rather than solely on what Phil thinks is best. Phil and Janice have faced some difcult decisionsduring their decades of marriage. Most recently, they have had to make a seriesof choices about whether or not to let their young adult son, who had developeda drug addiction that he is now trying to overcome, move back in with them.Although they did not initially agree on the conditions under which such anarrangement would be acceptable, they ultimately negotiated a solution thatwas workable for both of them. Male family leadership, whether or not it is pre-ceded by the word servant , entails sensitivity, negotiation, and compromise. Struggle and Transformation: The Dynamism of Faith and Family Men 's leadership, or servant-leadership, in evangelical homes is not a static en- tity. It requires an ongoing balancing act in which strength is counterbalancedby sensitivity, and it entails a great deal of striving, falling down, and chartingnew courses on the heels of failure. Thus, a holistic understanding of the faith-family nexus in evangelical families entails interrogating the process wherebyhusbands learn to balance the antinomies introduced into domestic life by sec-ular pressures and sacred values. To explore this process, we return to the story of Ramsey and Melissa Rogers, the narrative that was rst raised at the opening of this chapter. Theirs is a narra-tive structured by a temporal sequence that moves from struggle to negotiationand ultimately to resolution. Ramsey's account of their difculties with family -nances underscores the dynamism that characterizes the relationship betweenreligion and domestic life, while also demonstrating how the concept of the goodChristian husband creates both struggles and opportunities for men. Ramsey, a restaurant manager, has a sharp mind for business and nance. He is very \"number oriented\" and has prided himself on his responsible nancialmanagement. As Ramsey told me during our interview, he was \"able to countevery penny\" with the budgeting scheme that he employed. When Ramsey andhis wife, Melissa, got married, he was excited about taking on the family nances.With an outstanding track record of having never bounced a check and an arrayof money management strategies at his ngertips, he felt eminently qualied forthe task. However, soon after marrying Melissa, Ramsey was presented with alinkages between faith and family 161scenario he did not anticipate. Melissa proposed that Ramsey relinquish the man- agement of their nances to her. Ramsey states that this change \"was kind of astruggle the rst month or so,\" even though Melissa, like Ramsey, was \"numberoriented.\" Why was it a struggle? \"Because of pride,\" replied Ramsey. If Ramsey was so concerned about Melissa managing the family nances, why did he agree to it? Although he does not say it in quite these words, itseems that this situation presented Ramsey with an opportunity to make a sac-rice for his wife and, in so doing, to communicate his love for her. Ramsey isquite clear that he lacked trust in Melissa, at least in this domain of their rela-tionship. And he claims that his trust in God was not adequate. When I askedthe motivation for the change of nancial management, he stated: Well, because she wanted to do it. And once we got talking [about family nances], she wanted to be a part. You know, this is her talenttoo, and she wanted to be part. I think God was using me and usingthat as an opportunity. We're talking about the rst three or fourmonths of our marriage. I had to say [pause]. I had to turn aroundand trust my wife. And then again I had to turn around and trustGod to make sure my wife was going to handle it. Thus, Ramsey had entered his marriage proud\u2014or, more accurately, prideful\u2014about his nancial management skills. Despite Ramsey's anxietyabout having Melissa oversee their nances, he could not justify denying herthe opportunity to do so without seriously considering her request. Of course,if Ramsey was a staunchly traditional (read, hard) patriarch, he could simplyinsist that family nances are a husband's domain. Money is men 's business. End of discussion. But that was not the case. Herein is a critical difference be- tween hard patriarchy and its \"soft\" counterpart (Wilcox 2004). Whereas hardpatriarchy means that husbands need not explain the logic behind the deci-sions they make, soft patriarchy holds men to a different standard\u2014one com-posed of love, sacrice, and courage in the face of adversity. And, indeed, it took considerable courage for Ramsey to relinquish control over the family nances. As Ramsey went on to explain, his wife's method ofnancial management was not as foolproof as his own. But, here again, the pri-mary challenge in his eyes was not the development of a perfect nancial record-keeping system but learning the larger lesson of trusting his wife and God. Now [after Melissa took over the nances], she [pause] we bounced a couple of checks and there were times that I wanted to blow mystack, because I never bounced a check in my life. I'm very careful oneverything. But I had to trust her. She wanted to change banks, andwe went round and round. And I just said, \"Okay, God, I'm going toput my faith in you.\" It might cause a little strife, but I trust her andnow she handles all this. I mean, we still communicate about it, but162 religion \"out of place\"she knows exactly what she's doing. I don 't even look at the bank ac- count. I get my weekly allowance or whatever. I say, \"Honey, can Ihave twenty dollars? I need a twenty.\" And she doesn 't have any prob-lem with that at all. Bartkowski: Is that hard for you, ever, to ask for the allowance or to turn over the responsibility? It was at rst, but now it's not. It's because, I guess you could say, I went through a transparency where I broke down the wall of pride inmyself and I trust my wife ....I t was a struggle at rst, but God did a work in me on this to where I trust her with it and we're doing greatabout it now. I don 't mind an allowance no more. Sometimes sheturns me down, but I can try. [Laughs.]. Ramsey's narrative is quite revealing about one evangelical husband's struggles to put his faith into practice in the home. Ramsey's faith helped himto identify the source of his and Melissa's disagreements about family -nances, that is, his pride concerning money matters. His religious convictionsalso indicated the proper course of action needed to resolve this problem,namely, greater self-sacrice on his part and a stronger sense of trust in hiswife. Ironically, the family's patriarch has relinquished control over the house-hold nances and now receives an allowance from his wife. God \"did a work\"on him. And, as evidenced by the wide smile on his face as he nishes tellinghis story, he and Melissa have never been happier. Conclusion There is much to be learned about the relationship between faith and familyfrom the stories that evangelical Christian men tell about their marriages. Mostspecically, we learn something quite valuable about the effects that a patri-archal faith can have on family life. While scholars continue to debate thetheological veracity and social implications of biblical references to headship(Blankenhorn, Browning, and Van Leeuwen 2004), there is mounting evi-dence that traditional gender ideologies in evangelical homes often give rise toprogressive practices. As demonstrated in other work (e.g., Bartkowski 2001;Wilcox 2004) and augmented in this study, the male \"leadership\" said to per-vade evangelical families is a peculiar form of patriarchy. It is a patriarchy inword coupled quite often with the practice of partnership. The larger questions, of course, are why traditional ideologies give rise to progressive practices in conservative religious households, and what this paradoxtells us about the relationship between religion and family life. To begin, then,why are traditional ideologies coupled with progressive practices in the homes ofmany conservative religious couples? There are likely several underlying factors.linkages between faith and family 163First, as discussed convincingly in Gallagher and Smith 's (1999) analysis of gender narratives articulated by conservative Protestant men and women, thetraditionalist markers of \"husband headship\" and \"male family leadership\" sym-bolically distinguish evangelical marriages from their secular counterparts.Through such boundary work, evangelical couples are able to dene their familyrelationships as different from those of the secular mainstream (Smith 2000;see also Gallagher 2003). Thus, the subjective identities of evangelical husbandsand wives, and the collective identities they create as Christian couples, aremarked as \"other\"\u2014separate and apart from \"run-of-the-mill\" American mar-riages. The good Christian husband is a far cry from the heathen husband.Given the fact that many secular marriages today are governed by utilitarian in-dividualism and self-fulllment, evangelical couples take pride in swimmingagainst the tide and seeking to create an ethos in which marriage is a sacred en-during obligation not reducible to the fancies of the individuals in the relation-ship. In this sense, evangelical marriages are rooted in a communitarian ethic inwhich self-sacrice is valorized and divinized (Bahr and Bahr 2001). Second, the boundary work accomplished through the retention of a patri- archal ideology has practical consequences. By most measures, conservativeProtestant husbands and fathers are more emotionally connected to their fami-lies and more involved in household activities (e.g., Bartkowski and Xu 2000;Wilcox 2004). When the rubber meets the road in evangelical homes, symbolictraditionalism typically gives way to pragmatic egalitarianism (Gallagher andSmith 1999; see also Bartkowski 2001). In fact, survey research has shown that evangelical couples are no more traditional than their secular counterparts in the practice of household decision making (Denton 2004). This counterintu-itive nding may result from the peculiar denition of male leadership in evan-gelical circles. Evangelicals seem increasingly inclined to dene leadership notas decision-making authority but as servanthood (Bartkowski 2001, 2004;Wilcox 2004). The economy of gratitude that governs most secular householdsin which partners keep track of favors owed and privileges taken is transformedin evangelical homes into a economy of responsibility in which each spouse isencouraged to \"outserve\" his or her mate (Smith 2000; see also Bartkowski2001, 2004). The end result of this culturally distinctive orientation towardmarriage is the integration of husbands and fathers into the domestic realm in away not seen in secular homes, despite the pervasiveness of the New Man ideal. There is also a broader lesson for scholarship focused on the intersection of religion and family life to be taken away from these narratives. Scholars woulddo well to be as attentive to the contradictions, incongruities, and ironies thatmark the faith-family nexus as they are to its more intuitive, coherent connec-tions. A great deal of sociological research on the influence of religion on familyrelationships has shown that faith powerfully shapes ideologies and practices inthe domestic realm. Where family life is concerned, religion matters. And yet,164 religion \"out of place\"\"faith \" does not always behave in a predictable fashion. Oddly enough, rhetori- cal vestiges of religious patriarchy can foster the practice of egalitarian family re-lationships, at least in circumstances such as those featured here. Religiouswords take on new meanings in everyday practice. Social actors, even those whoshare a common religious afliation, may use the tools of their faith in diverseways to solve the dilemmas presented to them by family life. In the end, thecomplex and even contradictory linkages between religion and family presentscholars with challenges that are at once exciting and daunting. notes 1. The earliest qualitative research on conservative religious women was Judith Stacey's Brave New Families (1990), followed thereafter by a series of studies, including Kaufman (1991) and Davidman (1991) (both focused on Orthodox Jewish women); Grifth (1997) and Brasher (1998) (focused on evangelical women); Manning (1999)(comparing evangelical Protestant, Orthodox Jewish, and conservative Catholic women); and Bartkowski and Read 2003 (comparing devout evangelical and Muslim women). More recent work has charged that the latitude for identity negotiation en-joyed by evangelical women may be overstated in earlier ethnographic accounts (Inger-soll 2003). 2. The phrase \"absent present\" is Derrida's, and is connected to his concept of \"trace,\" which is best understood as \"the word under erasure in writing\" (Ritzer 1997).The trace of men in ethnographic texts on religious women consists of authorial repre- sentations of conservative religious men as the locus of patriarchal authority without any sustained interrogation of this construct. While it is indeed true that many posi-tions of leadership are reserved for men in conservative religious traditions, the com- plexities and contradictions associated with male leadership are left largely unexplored. 3.

Does Scripture support his contention? A: Absolutely not. To contend that Adam and Eve\u2014and the story of their fall into a constant state of sin eventually terminated by death\u2014are simply gurative allegory would contradict the whole of Scripturein a devastating manner. This question and answer appear at the beginning of an article en- titled \" Adam and Eve: Fact or Fiction,\" by Hank Hanegraaff, knownto Christian radio listeners as the \"Bible Answer Man.\" Every day,Hanegraaff 's answers to questions like this one are broadcast onmore than a hundred radio stations throughout the United States.Hanegraaff 's answer to this question continues by citing Biblepassages in support of the theological importance and historical ac-curacy of the Adam and Eve story. He concludes that the literaltruth of the Adam and Eve story is a necessary article of Christianfaith. So you see, if you cast aspersions on the historical record surrounding Adam and Eve, you must also question the in-spiration and authority of the Bible, the genealogical andarchaeological accuracy of Scripture, the problem of sin,Christ's vicarious atonement, salvation by the grace of Godalone, and much more. What you end up with could hardlyqualify as Christianity! 1Hanegraaff 's argument is grounded in his religious faith, but its terms are embraced by people with very different commitments. In a debate entitled \" Athe-ism vs. Christianity,\" Frank Zindler, editor of American Atheist magazine and di- rector of American Atheists Press, echoes Hanegraaff 's logic on every point: The most devastating thing though that biology did to Christianity was the discovery of biological evolution. Now that we know thatAdam and Eve never were real people the central myth of Christianityis destroyed. If there never was an Adam and Eve there never was anoriginal sin. If there never was an original sin there is no need ofsalvation. If there is no need of salvation there is no need of a savior.And I submit that puts Jesus, historical or otherwise, into the ranksof the unemployed. I think that evolution is absolutely the death knellof Christianity. 2 For Hanegraaff, Christian faith is in conflict with, and more fundamental than,scientic history, so he urges his audience to reject the theory of evolution. ForZindler, science is both more compelling than the Adam and Eve story and amore reliable source of truth, so he urges his audience to abandon Christianity.The two men agree, however, on two points: rst, the stories of Genesis andthe story of evolution constitute conflicting descriptions of historical fact; and,second, acceptance of the scientic story requires a rejection of Christianity.Although many Americans might not be able to restate the precise logic ofHanegraaff 's and Zindler's arguments, these two points of agreement are partof our national lore. The evolution versus creation debate is a familiar trope inAmerican culture, as are its symbolic relatives, science versus religion and faithversus reason. Against this cultural background, Lakeside United Methodist Church, a large downtown church in a small midwestern city, houses adult educationcourses with titles such as Faith and Reason and Reading the Bible Intelli-gently, which feature conversations such as the following: Alistair : We try to make the Bible answer our questions, without thinking about the questions the writers had in mind in the rst cen-tury. An example of that is people reading Genesis to nd out aboutevolution. That wasn 't what the writers of Genesis were asking or thinking about. The fundamental message of Genesis is \"behind this universe is God,\" which I believe very strongly. Dan: It doesn 't bother me that the Bible doesn 't answer scientic questions because science can 't and doesn 't try to answer the deeperquestions of life and suffering and death. Alistair : Yeah, it's not a slap at all to say it doesn 't answer scientic questions, because it's asking more profound questions. Science is170 producing everyday religious livesonly one, modern way of knowing, and we try to hold the Bible up to it as if the Bible was about that way of knowing, as if the questionsthe writers had in mind were scientic ones. What if instead, wethink about the poetry of these stories? Alistair and Dan are not trying to effect a compromise between scientic and religious worldviews; neither the legitimacy of science nor the importance ofthe Bible is called into question by this conversation. Rather, these men 's as-sertions are best understood as challenges to a deeper literalism that underlies the assumption that science and religion must conflict. In the face of literalistreligion and literalist science, they seek a third way, a different kind of wis-dom. This chapter is about people like Alistair and Dan\u2014people who practice what I call reflexive spirituality . Alistair, Dan, and others like them look to reli- gion for wisdom and meaning and reject literalistic approaches to religion thatthey see as preventing the possibility of the profound. They embrace the meth-ods and discoveries of science, but they reject the assumption that the truthsthat can be found by science are the only\u2014or even the most important\u2014truthsto be found. I borrow the concept of reflexive spirituality from Wade Clark Roof(1999), who uses it to describe an intentional, deliberate, self-directed ap-proach to the cultivation of religious meaning. To be \"reflexive\" means to \"stepback\" mentally from one's own perspective and recognize it as situated in anarray of other possible perspectives. To be reflexively spiritual, then, is to main-tain a constant awareness of the ever-increasing variety of religious meaningsavailable in the modern world and to seek spiritual wisdom by intentionally butcritically assimilating those meanings into one's own spiritual outlook. Roofdescribes reflexive spirituality as a way modern individuals bring religiousmeaning into their personal lives; for him, it is primarily an individual form ofpersonal religiosity. Here and in other work, I take the concept in a different, more cultural di- rection. Elsewhere I have argued that reflexive spirituality is a cultural lan-guage, a way that people talk with each other about transcendent meaning(Besecke 2001). It is not, therefore, personal so much as socially situated inconversation. Nor is it concerned only with individual growth and develop-ment. The discourse of reflexive spirituality represents a cultural project aimedat bringing an enhanced sense of transcendent meaning into the highly ration-alized context of the modern United States. This project requires, among otherthings, the identication and criticism of cultural patterns that inhibit tran-scendent meaning; reflexive spirituality, then, is a language of cultural criti-cism as much as of personal meaningfulness. Reflexive spirituality's cultural critique is directed at a collection of patterns I gather under the label literalism . This broad societal literalism shows up both inside and outside of religion and so ts neatly neither a \"religious\" box nor abeyond literalism 171\"secular\" box. The people that I observed were convinced that literalism con- stricts the range and depth of possible meanings, and so were frustrated by thedominance of literalism in modern American society. They wanted to contex-tualize this literalism as just one interpretive system alongside other systemsof interpretation that might expand the possibilities for meaningfulness. My analysis of reflexive spirituality's cultural critique is based on obser- vation in a variety of settings I studied in the course of a larger project that in-vestigates the cultural possibilities for transcendent meaning in highly ration-alized societies like the contemporary United States (Besecke 2002). In thecourse of this project, I visited places\u2014some more conventionally \"religious\"than others\u2014where people had gathered together to talk, or to hear otherstalk, about transcendent meaning. Some of the \"reflexive spiritualists\" I ob-served were members or leaders of a large urban United Methodist church Icall Lakeside. Some were teachers or members of a suburban interfaith adulteducation center called Common Ground. Some were authors, speaking inpublic radio interviews or at workshops they were leading. And some weremembers of a diffuse \"Spirituality at Work\" movement, speaking amonggroups of businesspeople. In all these settings, I heard similar ways of speak-ing about meaning, similar criticisms of modern culture, and similar tech-niques of retrieving meaning from religious traditions and other traditions ofmodern society. At Lakeside church, meaning was a regular topic both of sermons and of adult education courses. The Faith and Reason group included about twenty-ve people who met for an hour monthly to discuss spirituality and the life ofthe mind. Three adult Sunday school classes, Reading the Bible Intelligently,Theology for the Twenty-rst Century, and Religions of the World, regularlydrew between fteen and forty people. Two key gures at Lakeside were Alis-tair, a retired minister who led many of the adult education courses, andNathan, Lakeside's senior pastor during much of my research. Common Ground is a thirty-year-old adult education center located in four branches in and around a large U.S. city. Common Ground describes itself as\"a study center whose primary focus is on the major religious, philosophical,spiritual, and cultural traditions and their implications.\" Common Ground isan educational nonprot organization, unafliated with any church, that spon-sors year-round adult education classes with titles like The Century's Top FiveReligious Books, Interdependence: The Heart of Buddhist Philosophy, BiblicalPortraits: The Matriarchs, and An Evening with Socrates. Courses typicallydraw about thirty people, and class leaders typically are scholars in elds suchas religious studies, philosophy, history, psychology, mythology, or astronomy;many are professional religious workers such as nuns, monks, or rabbis; someare artists or musicians. The organization itself was the brainchild of Chris, aprofessor of religious studies, and Dennis, an interfaith activist.172 producing everyday religious livesRecent years have seen a multitude of new books on spirituality and mean- ing; I recorded radio interviews and attended public lectures given by such au-thors, sometimes in the course of promotional book tours, and sometimes asinvited speakers. Finally, some of my research focused on an urban organiza-tion involved in the Spirituality at Work movement. Through this organiza-tion 's sponsorship, businesspeople participated in discussions and workshopson topics such as \"Finding Your Calling\" and \"Bringing Your Soul to Work.\" People in each of these settings shared one important demographic char- acteristic: a high level of education. Although I could not vouch for the peoplein attendance at public lectures, it was clear that most of the people I was ob-serving were college educated, and some\u2014particularly those in leadershiproles\u2014had advanced degrees. This apparent association between reflexive spir-ituality and education is striking. Conventionally, scholars associate educa-tional attainment with declining religiosity; the logic, derived ultimately fromMax Weber, is that the critical thought so prized in higher education results inthe deconstruction and delegitimation of traditional religious claims. 3Accord- ing to this logic, the modern Americans I observed should have demonstrateda highly rationalized secularism, rejecting religion in favor of scientic ration-ality. Instead, they developed a sophisticated critique of the broad literalismthat informs both religious fundamentalism and scientic reductionism, cou-pled with exploration of equally sophisticated alternatives. The pages that fol-low will examine both those critiques and the alternatives. The Critique of Literalism In my observations, reflexive spiritualists' critique of literalism was most preva-lent in religious settings, and there it most often took the form of criticizingliteralistic interpretations of the Bible. At Lakeside Church, for instance, PastorNathan used sermons to encourage church members to look beyond literalreadings of scripture for deeper meanings. As he said one Sunday morning: The heart of being a Christian is an event\u2014Jesus' life\u2014and that event's impact, meaning for you and me, and that's interpretation,not description. The Gospels are not so much descriptive as they areinterpretive. If I had had the time and resources for this sermon, Iwould have brought up various artists' paintings of Jesus\u2014we'd seethey'd all be different. In some Jesus would be a blond Scandinavian,in some he would be an Irish shepherd, in some he would have Ori-ental features, in some he would appear as a Middle Eastern peasant.They would all be different. Having seen that, I hope you wouldn 'task, \"So which one is real, what did Jesus really look like?\" Because tobeyond literalism 173ask that question is to miss the reason why the artist painted the pic- ture, which was to say, \"This is the impact Jesus had on me.\" Theartist wasn 't trying to say, \"Here's what Jesus looked like,\" it wasn 't aphotographic attempt. The artist was saying, \"In him I nd the full-ness of my humanity, and I learn more about God. I want to showyou this so that you might nd that too. \"...S o too with the Gospels. The Gospels are not a literal history. They are an interpretation of themeaning of Jesus for the gospel-writers. They were written for reli-gious instruction, not for historical description. The Gospels have anagenda. John is up front about it: \"These are written that you may be-lieve that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing youmay have life in his name.\" The Creeds are saying, \"This is what hemeans to me,\" and that ends with the question, \"What does he meanto you?\" The Creeds are interpretations. Nathan argues that neither Jesus' physical appearance nor scriptural text nor church creeds are to be taken literally. Faith here is about interpretation andmeaning, not photography and history. Similarly, during one Lakeside adult education class, the group discussed Karen Armstrong's book The Battle for God . In the course of the discussion, group members criticized interpretations of biblical stories that treated themas factual descriptions of history. They argued that such stories are better un-derstood as attempts to use the language of mythology to describe internal reli-gious experiences. Bill, who had read the book and was leading the discussion,thought mythological thinking was more powerful than literal thinking andelicited sympathetic commentary from others in the group: Bill: She [Armstrong] says we have not been able to express the expe- rience of the sacred in logical discursive terms, but instead have hadrecourse to mythology, which was never meant to describe history,but rather was an attempt to express internal events. Nonhistoricaldoes not mean untrue. The dearth of myth has led to us having todiscover psychoanalysis. Freud. She says reason represents the outer-most rind of the mind. When I read that, I could see an orange, andyou peel the rind. Angie : The good stuff 's all inside. Bill: She says the fundamentalists have missed mythos as well, they have turned it into logos. Rational philosophy, that's when the literalreading of the Bible began. Helen : Genesis began this many years and days ago, this literalism. Bill: The reaction to the theory of evolution has been, \"We'll prove cre- ation actually happened literally as it says.\" The bodily resurrection,174 producing everyday religious livesresurrection doesn 't have to mean the body is resuscitated. The trinity is a mythical expression, an attempt to describe the undescribable, notan attempt to prove God has three parts. Jess: The logos-oriented tried to put it down as a formula, and that makes it unbelievable. In this excerpt, the group explicitly rejects the literalistic assumption that \"nonhistorical\" is synonymous with \"untrue.\" They reject the language of his-tory as a good way of understanding the Bible, and instead promote the lan-guage of mythology as truer to the transcendent reality that the biblical writerswere trying to convey. While biblical literalism may be the most obvious kind, people I observed outside specically Christian settings found other literalisms equally limiting.Rather than talking about religious creeds or scriptures, people in other set-tings critiqued a broad cultural trend toward closing off meaning. During aCommon Ground weekend retreat, for example, Dennis spoke about the ideaof magic \"properly understood,\" contrasting that with what he called \"funda-mentalist\" notions of magic: There's the holistic, community way of deeper understanding and en- riching life, and the fundamentalist way. The fundamentalist way isto say, \"We have the wrong rock\" or \"Today's Thursday, it should beamethyst.\" Aromatherapy is an egregious example of assertion ratherthan teaching. Some cultures do this in a context, it's a \"Let's explorethe possibilities together.\" We live in a culture where assertion of one-to-one correspondence is all over. In Freudian dream interpretationbooks, you look up a symbol and it says, \"That means this.\" Jungiandream interpretation books are different. Jung says to understand adream you have to \"play the myth onward.\" At another Common Ground event, Peter spoke of the spiritual richness of na- ture. He said, \" Ancient people look at a river and ask what does it mean. Mod-ern people have no idea it means anything; we've lost our capacity to ask.\" In all these examples, people are criticizing strictly literal interpretations of objects and events in the world\u2014the Bible, dreams, rivers\u2014as too simplistic,as concerned only with simple surface correspondences, as focusing on simpledenotation. What excessive literalism obscures, in their eyes, is the possibilityofconnotation ; the symbolic value of the objects, events, and stories of human life; the potential of these objects, events, and stories to reveal deeper, moreprofound meanings. To look at the world literally\u2014to see only apparent, sur-face meanings\u2014is to miss most of the story; by its very nature, transcendentmeaning lies beyond the simple surface correlations that Dennis calls \"one-to-one correspondences.\"beyond literalism 175In rejecting literalistic approaches to religion and the world, reflexive spiri- tualists are also challenging the cultural construction of necessary conflict be-tween science and religion. They point out that this assumption of conflict restson the deeper assumption that religion 's veracity depends on its literal accuracy.This critique applies not only to religious literalists but also to sociology. The\"science versus religion \" trope that pervades American culture is echoed by so-ciological theories of religious modernity that portray religion as necessarily un-dermined by scientic rationality. This construction appears in the work of the-orists of modernity such as Anthony Giddens and J\u00fcrgen Habermas, as well astheorists in the sociology of religion such as Peter Berger. 4All these theorists are drawing on the original work of Max Weber, who argued that scientic rational-ity undermines religion by bringing doctrine into conflict with science and bymaking it impossible to maintain an unquestioning adherence to the total au-thority of religious tradition (Weber [1919] 1946; [1956] 1978). Weber's make it difcult reflexive spirituality's simul- taneous embrace of both scientic rationality and religious meaning. Instead,we must turn toward the work of another group of scholars: theorists in the so-ciology of religion for whom doctrine and traditionalism are not the deningfeatures of religion in society. Robert Bellah, for example, stressed the signi-cance of what he called \"symbolic consciousness,\" arguing that \"symbolic con-sciousness is a way of outflanking literalism \" (1970, 232). Andrew Greeley(1995) has argued similarly that religion constitutes attempts to express throughmetaphor and poetry ineffable experiences of renewal. Robert Wuthnow has ob-served that the modern spirituality movement \"concentrates on that mixture ofspiritual and rationa l...w h ereby the person in modern societies seeks mean- ing in life\" (1998, 5). For these scholars, the strength of religion in modern soci-ety is measured not by the plausibility of its doctrine but rather by its purchaseon transcendent meaning. Symbolic sophistication and resonance are whatmake religion meaningful, not literal accuracy or intellectual monopoly. In theseterms, the conflicts between science and religion, scientic rationality and reli-gious meaning, take new form. The question becomes not whether modern peo-ple believe in the scientic accuracy of religious stories but whether they havethe skills to read religious stories in ways more productive of meaning than sci-entic rationality can be. This is the question that concerns people who practicereflexive spirituality, and the focus of their second critique of modern culture. The Critique of Epistemological Materialism Reflexive spiritualists see modern society as emphasizing only informationthat can be gathered via the ve senses, trusting physical and material realitiesat the expense of spiritual ones. This overemphasis limits the possibilities formeanings that lie beyond what the senses can grasp.176 producing everyday religious livesWithin religious groups, for instance, rejection of biblical literalism did not mean a rejection of spiritual possibilities in favor of scientic explanations.For example, during the Lenten season, Lakeside Church hosted Wednesdaynight discussions featuring a video series called \"Jesus: The New Way,\" onesegment of which discussed the historical veriability of the resurrection ofJesus. Shortly before this Wednesday, Pastor Nathan had given sermons inwhich he criticized approaches to Christianity that emphasized historicalrather than symbolic truth. Since this was early in my research at Lakeside, Iwondered if Nathan 's perspective was shared by others in the church, and soduring the discussion after the video, I asked a question: Kelly : I was thinking about the sermons of the last couple weeks, and Nathan saying that to ask what really happened was to ask the wrongquestion. How does that jive with this? Ellen : I think Nathan 's sermons and this video are both running into the same phenomenon, which is our twentieth-century scienticmind-set, where we consider truth to be what we can observe withour senses, and nothing else can be truth. So Nathan is saying to askwhat really happened historically is to ask the wrong question, and Iagree with that, but this video is saying if we're gonna do that, let's atleast look at the history and the context and see what we can and can 'tknow. So they're coming at the same thing from two different angles. Ellen 's argument is that it is necessary to differentiate what can be known \"scientically\"\u2014that is, through the epistemological materialism of scientichistory\u2014from what must be understood metaphorically. Scientic history hasits value, from Ellen 's perspective, but it does not have what it takes to get at transcendent truths, and so necessarily limits the possibilities for valid tran-scendent meanings. Similar concerns could be heard in less explicitly religious settings. At an event in the wake of the Columbine tragedy of 1999, Common Grounders be-gan to discuss mass violence and the people who commit mass violence. Whenone participant brought up the possibility that chemical imbalances lead to vio-lent behavior, others were quick to bring up the limitations of approaching thisproblem with scientic reductionism: Evan : What about brain research? There are all these physiological things that affect peopl e... Chris : I think of it like a circle, and you can enter the circle at differ- ent places. Sometimes a chemical is an avenue, but I don 't thinkchemical treatment by itself is a solution. Teresa : Chemical treatment might stop a person 's more violent im- pulses, but it won 't solve the violence in society.beyond literalism 177Dennis : We're such a scientistic culture. We take science so seriously, we imagine that it's the nal answer ....I think there's a huge mis- take in the scientistic view that once an organic component has beenidentied, the cause has been found ....T h ere is an organic aspect, but it's a complex. For Dennis, the empirical methods of biological science reveal one part of real- ity, but to rely on their ndings exclusively is to miss most of the complexity ofactual reality. At a different Common Ground event, Peter made a similar comment: \"What we're seeing now is a slow breakdown of the hold science had on cul-ture. People no longer see science as the only way to know. Soon we'll see acongeniality developing. ...r a t h e r than naive realism, material reduction- ism, it's all just objective.\" Ellen 's, Dennis's, and Peter's references to \"sci-ence\" and the \"scientic mind-set\" do not represent a hostility to the scien-tic enterprise itself; rather, these are rejections of what religious historianHuston Smith (2001) has called scientism \u2014a cultural condition in which the methods of science are seen as the only legitimate route to truth. From the perspective of reflexive spirituality, the cultural pattern of scientism inhibitsthe possibilities for meaning and wisdom in modern society, and so must bemodulated. The cultural conflict between religious meaning and scientic rationality depends not only on a literalistic approach to religion but also on this broaderliteralism that Smith has called scientism and I have called epistemological mate- rialism . As the philosopher Paul this broad literalism has cre- ated \"the prejudice that reality is only what is manipulatable\" (1991, 452), a prej-udice that disables the possibility of transcendent truths. He asks that we\"preserv[e ]... beside technological language, which disposes, the language which awakens possibilities\" (1978, 231). People who practice reflexive spiritual-ity ask for the same thing; they embrace scientic thinking as far as it goes, butthey want to place it in a context alongside other systems of thought that offermore resources for the construction of meaning. The conflict, then, is not somuch between science and religion as it is between scientism and the capacityfor meaning. The Critique of Closure Modern culture, in the eyes of reflexive spiritualists, fosters a preoccupationwith answers, with facts, with the already known and the unshakably certain.A society that depends too much on this orientation toward ends producesminds that cannot stay open long enough to fully inquire into the mysteries,178 producing everyday religious livescomplexities, and possibilities of the transcendent. In this way, a preoccupa- tion with closure ends up forestalling the possibilities for transcendentmeaning. 5 In religious settings, this critique of closure often took the form of a critique of fundamentalist Christianity. Lakesiders often associated fundamentalism witha xation on religious answers , describing themselves, by contrast, as more inter- ested in opening up religious questions . Both inside and outside religious set- tings, the critique of closure represented a conviction that greater possibilities formeaning come from living with more questions and fewer answers. Here, for ex-ample, is Common Ground's Dennis, discussing the Taoist document the I Ching : \"The way to phrase questions to the I Ching isn 't \"Should I do this? Yes or No?\" It's \"I'm deeply concerned about this.\" If a person goes to the I Ching look- ing for an answer, they'll nd it frustrating. If a person goes to the I Ching looking for a new way to think about a question, they'll nd it intriguing.\" Similarly, in apublic radio interview, author Donah Zohar described promoting questions overanswers to people in business: We as a culture tend to prefer answers to questions ....A lot of my life is spent lecturing to big corporations about their intelligence andtheir thinking processes, and there too I say, you know, you're far tooanswer-oriented, you stress what's known, what's certain, what's pre-dictable. Go for the uncertainty, go for the questions, go for what youdon 't know. And that opens the brain up and opens the intelligenceu p ....T h e great rabbi Abraham Heschel, one of the great Jewish mystics of the twentieth century, said we're closer to God when we'reasking questions than when we think we know the answers. As these comments suggest, reflexive spiritualists criticize modern American culture\u2014in both the religious sphere and secular society\u2014for overemphasiz-ing answers and so attenuating the possibilities for meaningfulness. Reflexive spirituality's critique of closure applies as well to some of our so- ciological theorizing about religion. Religious pluralism and the uncertaintythat it brings are sometimes seen as both causes for and evidence of religion 'sweakness in modern society. Peter Berger's (1967) influential early work, forexample, portrayed religion as a unied \"sacred canopy\" that provides adher-ents with an unshakeable worldview; the advent of modernity shook up thatworldview and so necessarily threatened religious vitality. Anthony Giddenshas theorized that we are in a state of \"reflexive modernity,\" which \"insists thatall knowledge takes the form of hypotheses: claims which may very well betrue, but which are in principle always open to revision and may have at somepoint to be abandoned\" (1991, 3). Giddens, however, specically excludes reli-gion from his theory, arguing that \"religion and tradition were always closelylinked, and the latter is even more thoroughly undermined than the former bybeyond literalism 179the reflexivity of modern social life, which stands in direct opposition to it\" (1990, 109). In reflexive spirituality, we see people who bring a rational-critical reflexiv- ity to their pursuit of spiritual wisdom. The existence of reflexive spirituality, inwhich both spirituality and ongoing revision are taken seriously, calls intoquestion the assumption that religious \"strength \" can be evaluated by measur-ing the certainty with which adherents subscribe to particular beliefs. It sug-gests, instead, that religion is an active participant in the reflexive project ofmodernity. Resources in the Fight against Literalism: There's More There Than Meets the Eye Reflexive spiritualists engage in a broad-ranging critique of modern culture, but it is not a critique without a vision of alternative ways to understand theworld. In contrast to closure and literalism, they propose metaphorical think-ing; and alongside scientically derived solutions, they seek mystical wisdom. Metaphor The primary resource reflexive spiritualists deploy for making meaning in theface of literalism is a metaphorical consciousness. Across settings, secular andreligious, metaphors were promoted as a gateway to greater wisdom. In an in-terview with author Vincent Crapanzano, public radio host Jean Feraca said,\"We should teach poetry ....T h e ability to make metaphors, after all, is the best antidote to literalism.\" At a workshop for business workers, leader GreggLevoy said, \"To me, part of the key is looking for meaning .... Physical symp- t o m s...F o r example if you have a stiff neck constantly. In addition to treating the symptoms, in addition to treating the symptoms, ask the metaphoric ques-tions. Is there a way in which I feel rigid in my life?\" And at Lakeside Church,a man named Jerry told his Sunday school class: The purpose of good ction\u2014good ction, War and Peace ,Gone with the Wind , not supermarket checkout ction\u2014is to tell the truth. War and Peace reveals truths about human nature. I can go ahead and call the Bible ction, but the purpose of ction is to tellthe truth, and the Bible has great insight into truth, and I can under-stand it better that way. Alongside his critique of literalism, then, Jerry advocates a metaphorical ap- proach to the Bible, an approach he nds more productive of insight and deepmeaning.180 producing everyday religious livesMysticism Reflexive spiritualists also promoted direct experience of the transcendent and emphasized meanings associated with the mystical traditions of assorted reli-gions. The insights of mystics, the practice of contemplation and meditation,and the experience of the transcendent all appeared as sources of deeper mean-ing in modern life. At Lakeside Church, discussion of mystical experience wassometimes associated with the idea of the Holy Spirit. For example, Nathansaid in a sermon, In talking about the Holy Spirit, the church doesn 't begin with a de- nition, it begins with an experience, the experience of Pentecost .... Through the Holy Spirit the routine becomes exciting, the powerlessbecomes powerful, the Holy Spirit brings to life and existence a dy-n a m i s m ....W e must be open to change ....B u t i f w e are open, we'll experience life as we have never experienced it before. Outside specically Christian settings, mysticism was described more broadly. The Spirituality at Work movement, for example, often spoke of \"prac-tices that keep you in touch with your source.\" And the folks at CommonGround spoke of mysticism as the core of all religious traditions, as Peter didduring a class specically about mysticism: \" At the core of all religious tradi-tions is a mystical experience, an experience of unity, of oneness, with the di-vine. And all of us, all people, are meant for that experience ....I t ' s not a ques- tion of faith. It's a question of experience.\" Mystical experience is directexperience of a nonliteral world, direct experience of there being \"more thanmeets the eye.\" Because of this, it serves as another resource for the cultivationof transcendent meaning in the face of a literalistic society. Pluralism As is probably clear by now, reflexive spiritualists embrace religious and episte-mological pluralism. They cultivate interest in and acceptance of a wide variety ofreligious and secular traditions. This openness to a variety of traditions aids theirght against literalism and their promotion of meaningfulness by increasingtheir repertoire of metaphors, meanings, practices, and insights. As Dan said ata Lakeside Sunday school class, \"What I hate is when people hold up a Bible andsay 'It's all right here.' I look and I don 't nd it all there. I like to think it's an openbook and it's in other places together with there.\" Common Ground's Phil usedsymbols from Hinduism and Christianity together to enhance the metaphoricalpotential of each, saying, \"I like the idea of purgatory because I see it as parallelto reincarnation\u2014both acknowledge the ongoingness of life, in which a kind ofcleansing takes place.\" Their pluralistic approach maximizes reflexive spiritual-ists' sources of potentially meaningful symbols, stories, ideas, and practices.beyond literalism 181Social Institutions and Reflexive Spirituality as a Cultural Movement Reflexive spirituality is not only a personal search for religious meaning but also a systematic cultural critique. Reflexive spiritualists aim to draw atten-tion to cultural patterns\u2014patterns I have collected under the broad headingof \"literalism \"\u2014that they see as threatening both to the individual quest to livea meaningful life and to the possibility of a social system informed by wis-dom, reflection, and meaning. Reflexive spiritualists criticize these patterns inthe hope of attenuating their meaning-inhibiting power, and they promote al-ternative approaches to life and to religion that are potentially more produc-tive of wisdom, reflection, and meaning. Reflexive spiritualists, then, are en-gaged in a struggle against literalism both inside and outside of religiousinstitutions, in an effort to expand the possibilities for meaning and wisdomin modern American society. What would it take for this critique of literalism to have consequences not just for the individuals who practice reflexive spirituality but for the broader soci-ety? One asset for a growing cultural movement is the possession of sustainingsocial institutions. Although this chapter cannot offer a full analysis of reflexivespirituality's cultural power, I do want to comment on reflexive spirituality's so-cial location and institutional resources. For the nascent culture of reflexive spirituality to become a socially power- ful movement, it must develop sustaining social institutions, places where itsideas and practices are generated, developed, and shared. One primary institu-tional incubator for reflexive spirituality is the discipline of religious studies.During my research, I heard references to books in religious studies scatteredthroughout reflexive spiritualists' comments, but more central than the booksthemselves was the particular approach to religion that religious studies en-courages. 6The discipline of religious studies promotes a comparative approach to religion that assumes all religions are valid systems of meaning for their re-spective communities; it brackets questions of \"which religion is the best\" andencourages understanding of religious questions and religious symbolism.Since its founding in 1964, the American Academy of Religion has grown to9,000 members who teach courses in virtually every college and university inthe United States (and much of the world). Religious studies scholars provide aprofessional cadre that can generate considerable intellectual resources for theuse of reflexive spiritualists. More broadly, institutions of higher education in general offer indirect cul- tural support to reflexive spirituality. Their programs in the humanities pro-mote systematic reflection on texts, metaphorical consciousness, and pluralisticsensibility. At the same time, however, such institutions also serve as carriers182 producing everyday religious livesof the epistemological materialism that reflexive spirituality rejects. They are often sites for both creativity and conflict. Reflexive spirituality nds some institutional support in the popular book industry, with its increasing attention to spirituality and religion. Collectively,online and store sales for Barnes and Noble, Inc., and Borders Group totaledmore than $8 billion in 2004; Publisher's Weekly estimates that books about reli- gion make up 9.3 percent of the market share of all adult trade books. At thetime of this writing, Amazon.com 's top 200 best-selling books included, amongother titles, A History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity and Islam; The Five People You Meet in Heaven; The Power of Belief: Essential Tools foran Extraordinary Life; Blue Like Jazz: Nonreligious Thoughts on Christian Spiritu-ality; Man 's Search for Meaning; andGod's Politics: Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Doesn 't Get It . 7 Both academic institutions and popular publishing are intertwined with the activities promoted by some churches. Books and speakers nd their wayinto programs offered especially by large urban churches. Such churchessometimes house active adult education programs that provide spaces for dis-cussion and collective engagement with religious meanings and secular soci-ety. Churches, then, are another source of institutional support for the cultureof reflexive spirituality. Reflexive spirituality is also enabled by institutions in the broader public sphere: the public lecture circuit, public radio and television, specialized or-ganizations like Common Ground and those associated with the Spirituality atWork movement, and, in general, any space in which people can come togetherto talk in a rational and open-ended way about religious meanings. Finally, although reflexive spirituality is neither purely individualistic nor unique to Protestantism, it does draw support from the intertwining Americancultural traditions of individualism and (liberal) Protestantism. Suspicion ofinstitutional authority and promotion of individual experience run deep inAmerican culture. From colonial deists to transcendentalists and revivalists, in- dividual reflection and discernment have often been emphasized as ultimately authoritative. In the end, though, what stands out about reflexive spirituality is a relative lack of institutional elaboration. None of the institutions named here arespecically institutions of and for reflexive spirituality. On the contrary, most ofthese institutions are what Victor Turner might call \"liminoid\"\u2014spaces in themargins, \"betwixt and between \" dominant institutions. Some of these institu-tions (e.g., the institutions of the public sphere and the popular book industry)are specically oriented to the creation of culture rather than the establishmentof culture. These institutions are designed to stay \"in between \" the dominantinstitutions of social life, and so represent more of a foothold for reflexive spir-ituality than a stable platform. Religious studies, as an academic discipline, isbeyond literalism 183an unwitting accomplice. It has its own scholarly imperatives, some of which support deep skepticism toward religious meaning and experience. In anycase, the ght against a culture of literalism and the promotion of transcendentmeaning are not its primary goal. Churches are as much battleground aslaunching pad for reflexive spirituality. They house a variety of religious per-spectives, including many that embrace literalism. Even those that do adopt re-flexive spirituality as one of their languages of power often relegate it to themargins, away from ofcial doctrine and away from the pulpit. Reflexive spirituality's lack of institutional establishment corresponds to a similar lack of collective identity. \"Reflexive spirituality\" is an academic label,drawn from sociological theory, not from the eld. The people I call \"reflexivespiritualists\" have no name for themselves. Once, in a United Church of Christchurch after the period of my study, I heard a minister use the phrase \"reflec-tive Christians\" in connection with this approach to religious tradition, but oth-erwise I most frequently heard reflexive spiritualists identify themselves onlynegatively, as \"not fundamentalist.\" To truly develop into a cultural movement, reflexive spiritualists need a collective identity based on something they want to identify with, not some-thing they reject. To sustain such a collective identity, they need institutionsof their own and networks tying those institutions together. At least some wishthey had something comparable to the network created by self-identied evan-gelical Protestants. As Common Ground leader Dennis said during the periodof my eldwork, \"Conservative religious people have mastered the airwaves and the mass media. Liberal religious people don 't even have stationery.\" An organized network would enable reflexive spiritualists to elaborate their cri-tique of literalistic religion and literalistic secularity, to promote their ownmethod of meaning making, and to act collectively in the wider society. Literalism and Meaning in Modern Society In spite of the absence of an organized social movement, reflexive spiritualityis a social reality with a cogent cultural critique. Defying theoretical expecta-tions, these modern people embrace science and religion, rationality and spiri-tuality, in an effort to cultivate a more meaningful modern society. Rather thannding pluralism threatening to their faith, they take advantage of its potentialto enhance the meaningfulness of modern life. They promote mysticism not asa rejection of or escape from modern rationality but as a critical complement toit. They reject both the narrow literalism that measures religious truth in termsof scientic accuracy and the broader literalism that connes truth to the cer-tainty of scientic fact. They nd not weakness but power in uncertainty, andthey cultivate an open-ended, reflexive approach to the pursuit of wisdom thatneither blindly succumbs to tradition nor leaves it behind.184 producing everyday religious livesIn the face of reflexive spirituality, some of the dichotomies that have long in- formed the sociology of religion become less compelling. There is no necessaryconflict between science and religion, or between the broader scientic rationalityof modern secular life and the meaning-providing traditions of religious life.There is no necessary conflict between religious uncertainty and religiousstrength, or between religious pluralism and religious meaningfulness. Instead,the case of reflexive spirituality asks us to consider the limitations placed onmeaning by a broad cultural literalism that dominates our relationships to andunderstanding of the traditions of both religious and secular life. notes 1.

Are spirituality and bodily materiality dichotomous, in tidy bi-nary opposition, as Western categories of thought have suggested inrecent centuries? According to many Western religious teachings, in-dividuals who wanted to enhance their spiritual lives would have toovercome the burden of their materiality, deny their material urgesand concerns, and transcend the limitations (and even the pollution)of the material body. 1This chapter argues, to the contrary, that if we want to understand the full range of religion as practiced and experi-enced by ordinary people in the context of their everyday lives, weneed to be aware of how people's religious and spiritual expressionsengage their material bodies and address their material concerns(McGuire 1990, 2003c). Religion, in this broad sense, is about how people make sense of their world\u2014the \"stories\" out of which they live. We need to take seri-ously not merely the packages of religious narratives supplied by insti-tutions but\u2014more important\u2014 the myriad individual ways by which or- dinary people remember, share, enact, adapt, create and combine the \"stories\"out of which they live . In contrast to religion-as-preached (whether one promoted by a religious institution or one \"preached\" by a spokesper-son for one of the many \"spiritual\" alternatives), each individual'sreligion-as-lived is constituted by these often-mundane practices for re- membering, sharing, and creatively assembling their most vital reli-gious narratives (Orsi 1997). Human bodies matter because thosepractices\u2014even interior ones, such as contemplation\u2014involve people'sbodies, as well as their minds and spirits. Thus, I use the concept of\"embodied practices\" to emphasize those ritual and expressive activities in which spiritual meanings and understandings are embedded in and accomplishedthrough the body (e.g., bodily senses, postures, gestures, and movements). Breathing is the epitome of an embodied practice (Lyon 1994; Mauss [1934] 1973). Although all living persons must breathe, and do so autonomi-cally, our breathing patterns can be profoundly affected by our social, psycho-logical, and religious practices. Pranayama yoga, for instance, is a physical andspiritual discipline that uses control of the breath to effect other changes inthe mind/body/spirit as a whole. One pranayama practice involves regularrhythmic, slow breathing through alternate nostrils, and practitioners hold thatit literally accomplishes physical, emotional, spiritual, and social balance. Pranayama yoga is important for our understanding of embodied practices,not merely because many Westerners have successfully tried this culturally\"foreign \" practice but because it illustrates how the holistic engagement of ourminds, bodies, and spirits in something so seemingly simple and basic asbreathing could be understood as a religious practice. Although an increasing number of religious groups are actively promoting such embodied practices, a vast array of everyday embodied practice is moreimprovised than institutionally organized. Too often, scholars of religion havenoticed only those embodied practices that are done in a \"properly religious\"institutional setting such as a church or synagogue. This conception of religionis too narrow. It prevents us from noticing and understanding the myriad otherpractices by which people live their religions. Furthermore, such a limited con- ception obstructs our appreciation of how central our material bodies are in the core practice and experience of religion. What might we see differently if weconsidered also the ordinary, everyday embodied practices by which individu-als (sometimes privately, sometimes collectively) accomplish their spirituallives and, literally, live their religions? The Historical Marginalization of Embodied Practice Unfortunately, most scholars of religion are limited by an overly institutionalconception of religion. I have argued elsewhere (McGuire 2003a) that we needto realize that our denitional starting points (including key concepts like \"reli-gion \" and \"sacred/profane\") are themselves, social constructions . Denitional boundaries around these concepts were hotly contested throughout much ofWestern history, especially during what some historians call the \"long Re-formation \" (roughly 1300 to 1700 c.e.). During that period, ongoing reform movements among both Catholics and Protestants in Europe and the Americasestablished much of what we have come to recognize as \"religion \" today (Muir1997, 6). Thus, the contested social constructions that dene \"religion \" arethemselves amenable to sociological analysis.188 producing everyday religious livesOne outcome of the \"long Reformation \" era's struggles over denitional boundaries in Western societies was a strong negative evaluation of most peo-ple's everyday religious practices\u2014especially those that involved their bodiesand their emotions. Such embodied practices were important because they werethe means by which people had linked the spiritual realm with their pragmatic,quotidian needs\u2014such as healing, fertility, protection from adverse fortune,and obtaining desired material goods. After the denitional boundaries aroundreligion were recast, the dominant religious groups in Europe and the Americascame to privilege belief over practice. This denitional bias is now so taken forgranted that people commonly refer to religions as \"creeds\" or \"faiths.\" 2 The same boundary contests over what could be dened as \"religious\" re- sulted in the denigration of the important practices by which many (perhaps,most) people literally \"embodied\" their religious expression and experience.These practices came to be disparaged\u2014as marginal (e.g., as \"folk\" or \"popu-lar\" religious practices), as impure (e.g., as \"superstitious\" or overly sensuouspractices), or as downright dangerous (e.g., labeled as \"magical\" or \"pagan \"practices). In the context of increasingly dualistic ideas about the gulf betweenhuman minds/spirits and their bodies, practices addressing human bodies(e.g., for childbirth, healing, or fertility) were particularly suspect. HistorianEdward Muir argues that a key feature distinguishing medieval from modernsensibility is how corporality was linked with ritual practice. He writes, \"It maynow be difcult for most educated, secularized Westerners who live in the af-termath of the great sexual repression and bodily oblivion of the modern age toappreciate fully how Christian Europeans once readily thought in bodily im-ages and habitually juxtaposed sacred and profane bodies\" (Muir 1997, 149). For centuries, subsequently, Western religious authorities have attempted to control adherents' religious practices, especially those addressing the human body, but with less than complete success. People have consistently resisted such control, selecting, borrowing, adapting, creating, and blending diverse culturalelements into their own religious practices. Thus, embodied religious practice isoften an important site of contested authority, dominance, and resistance. 3 Nevertheless, allreligions engage individuals through concrete practices that involve bodies, as well as minds and spirits. We readily recognize those bodilypractices as religious when we think of, for example, Native American religiousexperience (see, e.g., Spickard 1991). In that cultural context, intense bodily in-volvement in practices of drumming, dancing, vision quests, smoking, feasting,sweating, and chanting is completely consistent with a high level of spiritual de-velopment. This stands in stark contrast to the typical picture of spiritual develop-ment among Europeans or Euro-Americans, whose highest levels of achievementare peculiarly disembodied, often purely cognitive and unemotional. Like the Native American, however, Euro-Americans and Europeans do use their bodies in religious practice. They also experience certain body practices(e.g., postures, movements, ways of focusing attention) as more conducive toembodied practices 189spiritual experiences than others. Certain visual images, sounds, and smells sim- ilarly heighten spiritual focus and evoke meaningful religious experiences. Andconcrete physical practices, such as a warm embrace or holding hands around adinner table, promote a sense of connection with a community of others, tangi-bly evoking shared collective memories and experiences. Perhaps it is a modernconceit to think that our religious practices are more \"civilized\" because they areless linked with human bodies than were premodern practices. But there is noreason to believe that modern people ceased experiencing the world throughtheir bodies. Students of modern religion would do well to attend to the way re-ligion speaks not only to the cognitive aspect of adherents' lives (i.e., their beliefsand thoughts) but also to their emotional needs and their everyday experiencesas whole, embodied persons. Human embodiment \u2014the quality of having and being intimately identied with our human bodies\u2014is a basic part of our humanity. Thus, all religionsdeal with embodiment in some way, as they address human concerns aboutbodily health, suffering, birth, and death. In principle, Christian religionsshould be particularly attentive to human embodiment, because of the theolog-ical centrality of Christ's incarnation and, thus, Christ's humanity. That theo-logical theme\u2014important in much late medieval spirituality (see Bynum1986)\u2014has waned, however. Many Christian churches today are uncomfort-able with any practice that treats bodies as anything but profane. Theologicaltraditions, then, may encompass multiple and contradictory teachings aboutthe body, so teachings themselves are far from a satisfactory guide to how ad- herents actually make connections between body and spirit. Both religious authorities and secular sophisticates may denigrate any link between spirituality and human material concerns, but that link has not goneaway. Bodily sickness and pain, childbearing and fertility concerns, the needfor adequate food, shelter, and protection from adversity\u2014these are the mattersthat dominate everyday prayers, even as they are condemned as somehow lessappropriate matters for religious attention than so-called purely spiritual con-cerns. For example, why did my audience laugh when I read them some of theex-votos from a popular religious shrine in south Texas: \"Thanks for your helpin obtaining my . surgery,\" \" . . . for the washing machine a neighbor left behind when she moved,\" and so on? Is it because we consider these material concerns less wor-thy than some \"purely spiritual\" requests? Students of religion simply cannotafford to make such judgments. Noticing Embodied Practices in Everyday Settings What would sociologists of religion notice or understand differently if we wereto reexamine contemporary religious expressions with an eye to embodied190 producing everyday religious livespractices ? What would we see if we looked for people's mundane ritual prac- tices and other everyday expressions of their lived religions, rather than simplyfor indicators of institutional religiosity? Specically, how might we compre-hend embodied practices in today's patterns of spirituality? Interestingly, most scholars who have given serious attention to embodied practices in their research on religion have noticed them particularly in thespiritual lives of people who were going beyond the boundaries of ordinary in-stitutional religiosity. For example, Robert Wuthnow's (2001) interviews withartists\u2014potters, dancers, musicians, sculptors, and so on\u2014produced manycompelling examples of people whose spiritual lives were thoroughly inter-meshed with their artistic discipline. Their mind/body/spirit focus and creativeprocesses were accomplished through deeply embodied practices. Such au-tonomous and independent creative spirituality is, however, distrusted bymany religious leaders who are unable to exercise any institutional evaluativecontrol over it (Wuthnow 2003, 236ff.). The practices through which creativityis developed, focused, and expressed are, thus, nearly always forms of resis-tance to control by authorities (religious and political). Other examples of resistance expressed in embodied practices come from studies of \"feminist\" spirituality (see Northrup 1997; Winter, Lummis, andStokes 1994). Those who consciously choose to create \"feminist\" ritual practicesdo so in opposition\u2014opposition to other patterns of spirituality that have domi-nated their society and their own religious upbringing. Thus, they often engage inembodied practices that ritually transform or sacralize aspects of women 's every-day lives that are disvalued or denigrated in the dominant religious practices. Forinstance, women 's spirituality is particularly likely to sacralize domestic spaceand seemingly profane time, including the physical seasons of a woman 's life. Both feminist and other forms of women 's spiritual practice are more likely to take bodily expression than are institutionally approved religious prac-tices. Noting commonalities among women 's ritual practices in Christian, Jew-ish, neo-pagan, feminist, and traditional contexts, Lesley Northrup suggeststhat is \"a space [modern ritualizing women] inhabit comfortably,bodily. Women use embodied rituals that establish horizontal relationship(hugging, hand-holding, touching for healing) and that require sideways move-ment (dancing, swaying, changing postures) ....[ S uch movement] helps maintain the pervasive mood of spontaneity, openness, social awareness, andflexibility that are characteristic of women 's ritualizing\" (1997, 61). Similarly,women who have consciously chosen nonmedicalized approaches to child-birth, healing, and aging frequently describe those embodied practices as partof their spirituality. 4In both everyday spaces and set-aside ritual spaces, women often link body and spirit. Many religious social activists also engage in embodied practices that serve to express and support their efforts for social change. For example, James Spickard'sstudies of U.S. Catholic social activists identied several specic practices createdembodied practices 191or adapted by activist communities. For members of a Catholic Worker commu- nity, the concrete practice of \"doing soup\" (i.e., transporting and serving soup tostreet people) is an integral part of their house Mass and communion supper (ofsoup) that precede it (Spickard 2005). Although their activist resistance ismainly toward the larger society and its injustices and violence, their practicealso expresses resistance toward their church. Many of the persons Spickard in-terviewed considered themselves good Catholics, but in opposition to thechurch hierarchy's authoritarian practices. One woman, who worked in a peace-and-justice center, explained: What we do when we pray together is the same model that we do [ for] everything else. We pray together collaboratively. We have experience,we reflect on it socially ,... and on most days we are given to do an action around that ....I haven 't been to Mass in a long time. There's a longing in m e...t h e memory of how good it felt to have the sensu- ousness of church. But then I get very angered, because I immedi-ately remembe r... male homilies that had absolutely nothing to do with experience .... [So] I choose to pray with women. And I choose to pray collaboratively. I choose to pray toward action. That's how mycommunity's set up. (quoted in McGuire and Spickard 2003, 146) Popular religious practices, especially those of women, immigrants, and other marginalized people, provide yet more examples of embodied practicesin everyday lived religion. The intensely physical rituals of a Haitian vodoufamily in Brooklyn address deeply felt everyday concerns (Brown 1991). First-and second-generation immigrant women in the twentieth century expressedtheir everyday physical and emotional despair in devotions to Saint Jude (Orsi1996). More recent immigrants, Miami Cubans, intertwine physical and spiri-tual elements of Santer\u00eda with Catholic devotions at the shrine of the Cuban pa-tron saint, Our Lady of Charity (Tweed 1997). Robert Orsi reminds us that popular religious practices are ways by which the sacred regularly touches the quotidian worlds of work and home (see espe-cially Orsi 1997, 2005). Once attuned to such embodied practices, however,Orsi was able to notice similar practices in church-approved instruction, aswell. In the era prior to Vatican II, Catholic teachers (typically nuns) and par-ents consciously taught children habits that, he suggests, literally becameembodied, shaping children 's experience of their material and spiritual worlds,thus sacralizing and making those religious worlds real, tangible, and accessi-ble (Orsi 2005, 73-109). Orsi reminds us that when religiosity as promoted byreligious authorities is incorporated into their followers' everyday lived reli-gions, it most often occurs through identiable embodied practices. It is notonly Catholic forms of popular religion that produce effective embodied prac-tices, however. Colleen McDannell (1995) shows how, throughout Americanhistory, such embodied practices as the wearing of special garments and the192 producing everyday religious livesgiving of religious objects have been important ways by which ordinary Protes- tants, Mormons, and Evangelicals, as well as Catholics, experienced their reli-gious worlds as real and accessible. Although the \"long Reformation \" historically resulted in many popular re- ligious practices being dened as no longer properly \"religious,\" many peopletoday continue to use popular religious expressions to address material con-cerns through embodied practices. Nor do these practitioners t the stereo-types of \"popular religion.\" For example, many highly educated, economicallycomfortable, fully acculturated, nonimmigrant Christians, Jews, Muslims, andpersons of non-Western religious backgrounds turn to popular religious prac-tices to address their need for health, healing, fertility, safe childbirth, and a\"good\" death (see, e.g., the studies reported in Barnes and Sered 2005). 5 What might we see differently if we focused on the ordinary, everyday embodied practices by which people, individually and collectively, literally livetheir religions? Elsewhere, I have examined how contemporary patterns ofspirituality are linked with embodied practices pertaining to food preparationand singing (McGuire 2003c), health and healing (McGuire 1988, 1996), gen-der and sexuality (McGuire 1994; 2003b), and pragmatic material concerns(McGuire 2000). Here, I draw two somewhat different examples of how somecontemporary patterns of spirituality involve embodied practices: gardeningand dancing. Each of these examples further suggests the fruitfulness of study-ing people's embodied practices and not merely the ideas behind them. \"You Must First Have a Body \": Gardening as a Spiritual Discipline During my research on health and healing, I became aware of gardening as a signicant embodied practice in the spiritual lives of many people today. Forthat project, my research assistants and I recorded literally hundreds of narra-tives describing spiritual meanings of health and illness, body rituals for heal-ing and holiness, and a vast array of body symbols. Exemplifying this attentionto the body, one middle-aged professional, a member of an Eastern-inspiredmeditation center, explained, \"We all are given this body only for the purpose oftranscending into another plane of awareness, which does not require a bodyand would not really function with one\u2014you wouldn 't want a body ....Y o u want to eventually transcend this bodily existence, because it is very limite d... but, in order to do that, you must rst have a body .\" He proceeded to link this \"having\" a body with attentiveness to one's body through meditation, bodypractices (e.g., Tai Chi, yoga poses, and breathing exercises), and other mind-body disciplines, such as eating mindfully. The goal of this attentiveness tobody is deeper levels of consciousness, balance, and harmony. According to many healing groups (based on various nonmedical approaches to healing), the physical performance of such body practices accomplishes what itembodied practices 193represents. Body practices make body metaphor a reality (McGuire 1996). Re- spondents from a wide range of religious and spiritual traditions used such meta-phors not just to describe an idea supporting their practices but to try to capturethe essence of the practice itself. For example, one woman described her form ofChristian meditation as \"touching lives.\" Other respondents energy,\" and \"resting in thelight.\" An elderly man described his walking meditation as an efcacious form ofpeace activism. Unlike peace demonstrators, he explained, when he is \"walkingpeace,\" observers would not necessarily know that he was engaging in peace ac-tivism, but they would sense that he was moving from a \"deeply spiritual place.\" For some people, a physically practiced spirituality is also linked with the earth or nature. The embodied practices of gardening were central in the lived re-ligions of several respondents in my research. One woman, the mother of threeyoung children, had built a greenhouse window so she could, in all seasons,grow wheatgrass to extract daily a nutritional juice for her family. She had begungardening for purely practical reasons because homegrown wheatgrass and veg-etables were more affordable and, freshly picked, more nutritious. She alreadyengaged in numerous practices for health and healing, and when she began gar-dening she added several new personal practices, such as saying blessings as sheplanted the wheatgrass plots for the week and again as she harvested. A recently retired man described how his garden had become something of a neighborhood shrine, attracting several visitors daily in summertime.He had begun the gardening project to occupy himself and to please his wife(who complained that the front yard looked \"ratty\"). Since his sense of smellhad been declining, he decided to plant lots of pleasing but strong-scentedflowers\u2014mainly, rose bushes. Because roses reminded him of Saint Mary (adeeply embodied religious meaning, in itself ), he decided to create \"a Marygarden.\" His wife was delighted but insisted: \"No cheap statues.\" So he tookthat as a challenge to nd every \"natural\" way to evoke Mary's presence, with-out having an actual statue (although he still hoped someday to nd one thathis wife would consider tasteful). As he planned a rock \"grotto,\" fountain, andflower beds, he noticed that he always sat on an upended pot in a particularcorner, thinking about Mary's presence, so he put a cement bench there forcontemplating the nished garden. When the roses came into full bloom in hisgarden, he noticed two neighbors sitting on that cement bench. He told themthey were always welcome to rest there, to which the woman responded thatshe already knew she was welcome because she felt so close to the Virgin there.The man himself created a routine of starting each day, weather permitting, onthe bench, contemplating Mary's presence in his own garden. One woman, who described herself as a \"nonpracticing Lutheran,\" called gardening her daily \"worship service.\" 6She had begun organic gardening for her children 's sake, when they were little, but as she got \"into\" gardening, shecame to think of it as a valuable spiritual discipline, requiring patience, hope,194 producing everyday religious livesand \"nurturing love.\" She engages contemplatively in such prosaic practices as preparing the compost. She engages her senses as she meditates, being in-tensely aware of the texture of the compost as she sifts it with her bare hands,yet staying deeply centered. As her commitment to her spiritual practices grew, she had left her high- powered job as an editor at a major publishing house and had moved to a smallerhome in a more rural community. There, her garden had a profound tranquillity,noticeable even to the rst-time visitor. At the time of our interview, she was pro-ducing far more food than she needed, so she gave her produce to a food bank.Her new freelance job meant a greatly reduced income but allowed her to devotemore time and attention to her meditation, her organic garden, and her involve-ment in a healing group. When she spoke of healing for others, she described theactivities of this group. When she turned to her own healing, however, she spokeglowingly of the healing effects of working the soil, connecting with nature, anda near-mystical moment in the rain. In gardening, concrete embodied practiceslinked mind, body, and spirit. For example, she described the spiritual and emo-tional exhilaration of staying \"fully present\" on a warming spring day, whilekneeling with now-arthritic knees and hips to crumble clods of soil lightly over arow of newly planted seeds. For her, soil, seed, body, and spirit are linked in thepractice of gardening. \" 'Til by Turning, Turning, We Come 'round Right\": Dance as Religious Practice and Spiritual Experience This line from the familiar Shaker hymn \"Simple Gifts\" refers to an important part of Shaker spirituality: regular participation in elaborate meetinghousedances for worship. Because they believed that the millennial kingdom of Godwas already present in every detail of their everyday world, Shakers paid atten-tion to those details in embodied practices of work and prayer. Such embodiedpractices resulted in the extraordinary fruits of Shaker labor\u2014not only the aes-thetically pleasing crafting of furniture for which they are still remembered butalso everyday tasks like repairing shoes, sewing clothes, and growing and pre-serving food. Because every detail of everyday living mattered religiously, em-bodied practices included such details as the exact order for getting out of bedand getting dressed each morning (see Andrews 1953). The Shakers' many rit-ual dances were equally precise embodied practices. But dancing evoked morethan spiritual attentiveness. Dancing produced (and was produced by) power-ful ecstatic experiences. In dancing, the entire community experienced the verymeaning of living in the \"New Jerusalem.\" 7 For many Christians of that era (and since!), however, dancing was the op- posite of religious. Indeed, partly as a result of the \"long Reformation,\" manyChristians came to view dancing not only as profane but even as licentiousembodied practices 195and dangerous. Whereas late medieval Christians had regularly celebrated weddings, wakes, and religious holidays with considerable dancing and otherfestivities, after the \"long Reformation,\" most Christian churches tried (withvarying degrees of success) to ban or at least to separate such \"profane\" festiv-ities as dancing from religious celebrations. Some religious groups treateddancing as sinful, in itself, while others treated it as an occasion for sin or, atbest, a distraction from godly behaviors. For instance, a Baptist minister pro-claimed in the early twentieth century, \"Of the 500,000 fallen women in theUnited States, over 300,000 started from the ballroom \" (quoted in Dunning1998, 12). Thus, it represented considerable attitudinal change for many late twentieth-century Americans to come to view dancing as an appropriate litur-gical performance in churches, synagogues, and other religious settings. Whilebringing dance into worship represents a crack in the disembodied facade ofWestern religious traditions, in most instances it is an embodied practice onlyfor the dancers themselves. Others in the congregation are a passive audience,much as they are for the musicians (often, paid professionals) who singand play for the service. An interesting exception, however, is the dance min-istry of an African Methodist Episcopal church in Queens. According to itschoreographer-director, part of the goal for the 300-member group of dancers(men, women, and children) is to engage so intensely the entire congregationthat all of them experience transformation. She explained: People are coming in with issues. They're losing their home. They've lost their job. The bill collectors are coming, or someone needs aheart transplant. We stand in the gap, as soldiers in the army, danc- ing the ght for them no matter what their issues are ....I f [ t h e y are] not [able to leave there changed], we're not doing our job. And thatmeans we have to get out of ourselves so that they don 't see us danc-ing, they see God in the dance. (quoted in Dunning 1998, 12) In that setting, the improvisational dance is an embodied practice that both ex- presses and accomplishes praise and worship, while simultaneously address-ing the real material (and bodily) concerns of the congregation 's members. In my study of healing groups, I encountered one group that used dance as its preferred healing modality. It met in a Unitarian Church, but only a few ofthe regulars were Unitarians. Most of the group considered themselves to be,in the words of one woman, \"deeply spiritual, but not interested in religion.\"They limited their membership to women, so that all could seek healing forphysical, emotional, and relationship problems they might hesitate to bring upin men 's presence. Many of the group's dances and other ritual practices wereopenly \"invented\" for an occasion or need. For instance, for a rape victim, thegroup created a dance sequence expressing fear and anger being transformedinto inner strength and calm.196 producing everyday religious livesOne woman, who was introduced to similar spiritual dance in a predomi- nantly Jewish feminist healing group, had developed a personal spiritual dancepractice that she called \"dancing my life.\" Her religious involvement at her syn-agogue was sporadic, but she put considerable time and energy into her spiri-tual practices, individual as well as collective. Her most important spiritualpractice (usually solo) was improvised dance. Sometimes daily, but at leastonce a week, she identied a theme that had arisen in her life, either recently orrecurringly (e.g., \"being alone,\" \"flying,\" and \"unfolding\"). After meditatingbriefly on the theme, but without planning her actions, she danced to expressthat theme. Often, what evolved in the dance was a complete surprise to her,but she almost always felt like she had expressed, in a satisfyingly integratedway, her deeper feelings and central life meanings. About once a month, shedanced with two of her friends. They informally rotate the choice of themes andmusic or poetry to go with it, trying to keep the theme broad enough that allparticipating can relate to it somehow (e.g., \"Springtime Hope,\" and \"Time-Sickness\"). In bodily movement, they express their connection to each other, totheir own deep longings, and to life itself. Conclusion Each of these kinds of embodied practices reflects andreproduces different kinds of spiritual experiences. In each, the body is integrally present and participat-ing. When gardening is done as an embodied religious or spiritual practice, itis more than a practical means to a desired end, such as a meal. It can engagethe senses, evoke memories and imagination, and reflect a deep connectionwith the natural environment. It can produce an integrated mind/body/spiritexperiential awareness of spiritual truths or religious presence. As an embod-ied practice, dancing can tap emotions and deeply embedded memories. In rit-ual settings, such as the women 's healing group described earlier, these em-bodied practices have creative potential to transmute painful or destructivememories and emotions into sources of emotional support, joy, and vitality. Inother settings, dancing can communicate joy, gratitude, and worshipfulness.Collective embodied practices, such as dancing together, can produce an expe-riential sense of community and connectedness. Without the full involvementof the material body, religion is conned to the realm of cognitions (i.e., beliefs,opinions, theological ideas). Embodied practices\u2014including mundane andseemingly unexceptional activities like dancing, preparing a meal, or holding aflower\u2014can link people's materiality as humans with their spirituality. Lived religion is constituted by the practices by which people remember, share, enact, adapt, and create the \"stories out of which they live.\" And it is con-stituted through the practices by which people turn these \"stories\" into every-day action. Ordinary material existence\u2014especially the human body\u2014is theembodied practices 197very stuff of these meaningful practices. Religious and spiritual practices\u2014 even interior ones, such as contemplation\u2014involve people's bodies and emo-tions, as well as their minds and spirits. People's material bodies come to be linked with their religion-as-lived through both lofty and mundane embodied practices, often ritually restructur-ing their sense of space and time. Bodies matter because humans are not dis-embodied spirits. Individuals' religions become lived only through involving their bodies (as well as minds) and their emotions (as well as their cognitions).An individual's lived religion is expressed through just such embodied prac-tices. But where religious authorities and institutions have excluded embodiedpractices as \"not properly religious\" or as \"impure\" and \"sinful,\" is it any sur-prise that people engage in such practices in other settings? Understandingreligions-as-lived requires, then, that we take seriously the full range of humanreligious practice, not only as we nd it in religious institutions but equally aswe nd it in everyday embodied practices. notes 1. This is not to say that many non-Western religions do not also have some form of denial of the body. Rather, the point is that the social sciences of religion have built uncritically upon assumptions embedded in Western (and particularly European) reli- gious ways of thinking. 2. This denitional bias, privileging belief and cognitive aspects of religion, also became embedded in scholarly discourse, including the social sciences of religion. For example, sociology of religion uses survey instruments that attempt to tap respon-dents' \"religion \" or level of \"religiosity\" by asking them such questions as \"Do you be-lieve in life after death?\" \"Do you believe that the Bible is the literally true word of god?\" and \"Do you believe that using articial contraception (birth control) is sinful?\" Although the anthropology of religion has, historically, been more interested in observ-ing actual religious practices, the eld has only recently become self-critical of the ear- lier tendency to treat non-Western cultures as \"other.\" Thus, \"our\" cultures' religions seemed superior, based on thought and \"pure\" beliefs, in contrast to the \"Other's\" reli-gions that involved strange practices, such as exotic rituals, magic, and superstition. Anthropology has beneted from some decades of recent examination of the historical construction of scholarly discourse and method, especially as biases embedded in ourconcepts have affected our ethnographies themselves (see especially Asad 1993). 3. Clearly, the successes and failures of both the dominant religions in their ef- forts to control and the persons trying to resist that control depend on power and dif-ferential access to economic and symbolic resources. With considerable regularity, the people whose meaningful religious practices have been redened by the powerful as not properly \"religious\" have been the poor, the women, the immigrants, the indige-nous peoples of a colonized land, the \"uneducated,\" the dispossessed. 4. See Klassen (2001, 2005) and Sered (2005) for examples from both Christian and Jewish, highly traditional and extremely nontraditional, as well as eclectic, spiritualities.198 producing everyday religious lives5. The same could be said of persons who engage in nonmedical healing prac- tices and seek alternative (e.g., religious or spiritual) forms of healing, typically in con- junction with medical treatment, but sometimes in lieu of it (see McGuire 1988). 6.

Bender We wanted the touch of the real in the way that in an earlier period people wanted the touch of the transcendent. \u2014Stephen Greenblatt, \"The Touch of the Real\" Cathy Morton1paused for a moment, and I took a sip of my tea, which had gone cold in the hour and a half since we started talking.Cathy was telling me about her spiritual journey, a long and fascinat-ing story that included numerous details, serendipitous encounters,and a good dose of self-deprecating humor. Collecting her thoughts,Cathy smoothed out her jean skirt and resettled into the corner of thecouch. Then she said: Now, where are we? In February of 2000, I'd been doing a lot of reading on reincarnation. All summer I'd read the BrianWeiss books. I said \"OK it sounds good for him, but haven 'texperienced it myself. So, um, [it's] not real for me yet.\"I'm about to take the Reiki master training course.I go to a psychic\u2014just to see what it's like to go to a psychic.And she says, \"I sense that you're going to be involved withOriental energy\"\u2014she got all this stuff right, ok. \"I sense theMerlin presence around you,\" and I said, \"Do you knowwhere I was last summer?\" and she said no, so I had to tellher that I'd been to Glastonbury Tor, because part of thewhole Merlin thing is there. So, she said, that I was going toknow what it was like to be Christed. And I didn 't know what she was talking about. She just said this is going to be really important, andyou know what it is when you experience it. \"OK,\" I said. Taking another breath, Cathy began to tell me about her Reiki master training course. From the beginning of learning this practice of energetichealing, she knew that she was supposed to teach it in addition to practicing it.Because her original Reiki teacher did not teach the master level, she soughtout a new teacher and shortly found herself sitting with several other womenin a Newton, Massachusetts, living room, ready to start the course of trainingthat would make her a master. The teacher started with an \"attunement,\" put-ting her hands on each of the women. During her turn Cathy recalled that she\"felt the hugest amount of heat that\u2014I could never imagine that that muchenergy could be going into one person.\" This was followed by a guided visual-ization during which, she said, each woman would meet her \"Reiki guide\": thespirit who would lead them and assist them in their healing work. Cathy con-tinued: Now I'd been through this before and had never seen, really seen anybody, except for maybe those three Japanese people up on the ceil-ing [she had seen during her earlier Reiki training]. That didn 't reallyfeel like \"meet your Reiki guide\" to me. Plus, it wasn 't real. So, I closemy eyes. And I see Jesus. I see just his outline of his face, and longhair, and beard\u2014and he looks beautiful. Thin face. He looks just likein all the Sunday school pictures. And he's smiling at me. And I go, \"Oh, whoa whoa whoa\u2014that's Jesus. That can 't be my Reiki master. That can 't be my Reiki guide, that's Jesus\u2014he's Jesus!\"So with my consciousness I go, \"Shoo shoo shoo,\" and I try to erasethis picture in my mind. [The teacher] has previously told us, you'll bein a eld and then you'll get up a hill and when you get to the top ofthe hill your Reiki guide will be there. So I say, \"Shoo shoo shoo.\" Itell Jesus to shoo, he can 't possibly be my Reiki guide, and the nextthing I see is, a beautiful eld with waving golden grass, it's late sum-mer, and Jesus is standing out in the middle of the eld and he hashis arms outstretched, and it's like that \"Come to Me\" pose from allthose Sunday school books. And I'm thinking, \"Jesus? This doesn 'tmake any sense to me.\" And then I hear her, the teacher's voice say,there's only three more steps and you'll be there [at the top of the hill]. And I decided in my mind that I wanted the hill I was to climb to be Glastonbury Tor. I chose that on purpose as my imaginary hill.And there are steps on Glastonbury Tor. So I went up the last threesteps, and I looked up. And at that moment I felt myself leave mybody, out of my head. The top of my head opened up, and I wentwhooshing through a tunnel, and I knew I was traveling through time202 producing everyday religious livesand space, just like winds, through the wind, and I'm not processing \"Oh my God, I'm having an out-of-body experience. . . . I'm just like, this is cool!\" I had met Cathy two weeks before this soggy October morning, when I at- tended a mystical arts and talent show held at the Swedenborgian Chapel inCambridge where Cathy gave a talk on past-life regression therapy. I intro-duced myself during the intermission, and she told me with some excitementthat she had already heard all about me and my research from a mutual ac-quaintance. My goal, as I told Cathy, was to understand how people becamespiritual practitioners. I told her that I was particularly interested in the socialnetworks and groups that she and others like her participate in, and where theylearned the practices that they engaged. Cathy told me that she was interestedin this, too, and invited me to her house. Religious experiences took center stage for the people I met during my eld research. By this, I mean that Cathy and others like her placed in the cen-ters of their religious stories and their religious lives complex questions aboutexperience, stories of their occurrence, practices that might hasten their occur-rence, debates about how they could be encountered, and so on. Religious ex-periences were orienting features (and also sometimes disorienting features)within their religious worlds. The centrality of religious experiences caused some fruitful tension in my work and analysis, for, as I had told Cathy, I was studying the social, lived reli-gious experience of modern mystics and spiritual practitioners. My frame wasfocused on daily religious experiences, that is, but it was becoming increasingly clear that their emphasis was often on a different sort of experience, where theemphasis is on (presumably nondaily, nonhabitual) religious experience. This difference in emphasis, which is how I rst thought of it, led to questionsabout the place of \"religious experience\" within the study of lived religion, orwithin any sociological study of daily religious life. And this, in turn, led me toconsider how sociological understandings of \"religious experience\" reproducea set of ideas about the shape and boundaries of sociological inquiry into reli-gion (mirrored and refracted perhaps in distinctions between experience andaccount, or even between spirituality and religion). Encounters with peoplelike Cathy, in short, prompted me to pay closer attention both to the presenceof religious experiences in contemporary mystics' lived realities and to theirabsence within much recent academic research on contemporary Americanreligion. In this chapter I briefly review some of the recent scholarly works on reli- gious experience and argue that this work demands of sociologists more thana \"descriptive\" denition of religious experience. It further requires that sociol-ogists move religious experience closer to the center of the study of religion.Doing so will enable us to view religious experiences as sites of the religioustouching the transcendent 203imaginary, of religious history, and of theology. It will allow us to understand how experiences are constructed and lived in multiple expressions. In the sec-ond half of the chapter, I identify some of the ways we might interpret reli-gious experiences once we have this in mind. I will focus on how history andimagination developed fruitfully within Cathy's experience of \"being Christed\"to create an authentic religious experience. Studying Religious Experience In a recent volume, Martin Jay (2005) states that the numerous proliferating\"songs\" of experience in Western intellectual conversations make it impossibleto fully historicize the concept of experience within a single rubric. He notesthe trajectory of \"religious experience\" as one such song within this multi-voiced chorus, emerging as an identiable \"type\" of experience in the post-Enlightenment period and gaining volume and power in the nineteenth andtwentieth centuries. William James's denition lies within this lineage and isprobably best known to sociologists: religious experience is the \"feelings, acts,and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehendthemselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine\"([1903] 1982, 31). James's denition, like others within this intellectual tradition, empha- sizes that experiences happen, that they happen furthermore to individualswho have not anticipated them happening. They are felt (apprehended) ratherthan cognitively known. All these elements emphasize religious experience asan individual and noncultural (or precultural, precognitive) and bounded event.These elements that make them real also make them, James argues, real only for those who directly experience them. The individual, unpracticed, precul- tural, and affective qualities of religious experiences are not usually notedwithin sociological literature, but these ideas about religious experiences clearlymark the discipline. Emphasis on the individual and precognitive (or noncog-nitive) constitution of religious experience suggests that it is not really the do-main of sociological inquiry at all. Sociologists have, by and large, ceded thestudy of religious experiences to other disciplines better equipped to focus onthese issues, including philosophy and psychology. Other sociologists have focused on the noncultural aspects of \"experience\" to posit a space occupied by true religion, a space that remains fundamentallyimmune from sociological analysis (and reduction). Peter Berger mobilizessuch a denition of \"religious experience\" to mark the proper boundaries of so-ciological inquiries into religious reality. His claims in The Heretical Imperative (1979, 44) that religious experiences are prior to cultural suggestion are one ex-ample of this move. \"Religious experience,\" he argues, \" comes to be embodied in traditions, which mediate it to those who have not had it themselves and204 producing everyday religious liveswhich institutionalize it for them as well as for those who had\" (46, emphasis added). The process through which raw, analytically inaccessible religious ex-periences are translated and domesticated into tradi-tions is \"a constant in human history\" (53-54), further arguing that all religioustraditions and cultures are based on original experiences of this kind. In short,Berger denes experiences as that which are constitutive of real religion, in noway reducible to the traditions and communities into which they are translated,which remain the appropriate settings for sociological analysis. As a consequence, sociologists can study experience accounts but cannot study religious experiences themselves . This has been an extremely powerful ar- gument: even though fewer sociologists might nd Berger's argument fullycompelling in today's academic climate, the distinction between an experienceand its account remains embedded within even recent culturally sensitive stud-ies of religious experience. We can hear this song clearly, for example, in DavidYamane's recent discussion of narrative approaches to religious experience,where he states that the distinction between experience and account is a \"fun-damental fact.\" Sociologists who want to study religious experience, he says,\"must bracket any claims to apprehending religious experience itself and in-stead give our full attention to the primary way people concretiz e...t h eir ex- perience s... through narratives\" (2000, 175-76; see also McRoberts 2004). Although the discipline of religious studies shared this \"fundamental fact\" of religious experience with sociologists for many decades, at this point it is fairto say that philosophers and historians of religion have largely abandoned it.Wayne Proudfoot (1985) argued that while Friedrich Schleiermacher had pre-sented the best possible denition and argument for a precultural, precogni-tive religious experience, it was a denition beset by logical and philosophicalfallacies that could not be internally resolved. Proudfoot's argument has subse-quently prompted religious studies scholars in a number of other subelds toinquire into the historical development of this notion. The growing history of\"religious experience\" demonstrates how deeply embedded it is in multiplestrands of Enlightenment thinking. An idea of individual \"religious experi- ence\" developed as a key component of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century ar-guments about individual authority and autonomy. Notions about individualreligious experience provided protective and apologetic arguments about \"pure\" religion that could remain immune from Enlightenment-era reductionisms.Once naturalized into a taken-for-granted idea, \"religious experience\" played apivotal role in developing arguments for the possibility of a comparative studyof world religions and was likewise mobilized in changing regimes of scienticinquiry. 2 This research destabilizes any claim that religious experience is a funda- mental fact, descriptive of phenomena to which its nonexperiencers do not haveaccess. In addition, this research demonstrates in convincing ways that it is im-portant to study how this historically emerging and now culturally naturalizedtouching the transcendent 205category has shaped both \"academic\" and \"lay\" experience of religious experi- ence. As one example, we can think about how the sociological distinction be-tween experience and account underlies and reinforces many recent discus-sions of contemporary American spirituality. A developing body of researchpays close attention to how communally prescribed narratives and embodiedpractices shape religious experiences and suggests ways to engage how experi-ences are culturally shaped (not merely translated into culture post hoc). 3Still, concepts of a precultural individual religious experience tend to reemerge inscholarly analyses of people who do not have apparent religious communities. To take one recent example, Robert Wuthnow's (1998) study of contempo- rary spirituality includes a discussion of spiritual parvenus that hinges on their\"out of the ordinary\" experiences. Wuthnow states that many people's lives arenot transformed, or even jilted a little bit, by such extraordinary events. Forpeople without a community, these (precommunal) experiences do not propelparvenus to join a religious group or organize their lives differently. In largepart, Wuthnow says, these experiences remind or suggest to such persons thatsomething \"more\" exists (134ff.). 4In Wuthnow's narrative, experiences are rst experienced outside of a religious or cultural worldview and then may (or maynot) be integrated into one. Wuthnow's study is built on cultural nuance and is on the whole a study of spirituality's social construction. The presence of \"religious experience\" withinthis study is, for that reason, all the more notable, demonstrating how deeplyembedded it is within sociological thinking about religion. It continues tomark out territory\u2014not just of what is and is not accessible to sociologists foranalysis but also of what is in fact \"religious\" or \"spiritual.\" Given the claimthat religious experience is a cross-cultural and cross-temporal category, wemight inquire how it likewise reinforces an ahistorical understanding of Amer-ican spirituality and, notably, how it also reinforces the ontological claims madeby mystics and experiencers themselves. For, although the logic of \"religious experience\" remains embedded in con- temporary sociological treatments, it is notably also mobilized in numerousways by people like Cathy Morton. These denitions are not \"merely\" aca-demic. They are thoroughly embedded within the discourses about experiencesthat we scholars encounter \"in the eld.\" With this in mind, we can approachCathy's experience as taking place within, and extending, an intricate, theologi-cally dense set of logics and genres that shape her out-of-body experience. 5 Being Christed Cathy's experience, then, can be seen not only as a narrative of personal spiritualdevelopment and calling that emphasizes her singular, individual encounterwith a being of light but also as a process of construction. If, as Susan Harding206 producing everyday religious lives(2001) says, \"speaking is believing\" for Christian fundamentalists, then speak- ing is experiencing for contemporary mystics. Telling the experience is, in someways, experiencing it: the space where the telling ends and the experiencing be-gins is complicated in Cathy's story by the way the experience \"answers\" ques-tions that might destabilize her experience's truth and validity. The validity ofthe experience is coterminous with the experience itself, at least in the way thatCathy told me about it on this rainy October morning. As such, Cathy's narra-tive, while emplotted, is also organized through several conversations that makethe narrative and its meaning real. As the plot of individual, ineffable experiencecalls attention away from these genres and their social history, it is nonethelessimportant to hear in them the histories and submerged connections that theplot is built upon. By attending to the speech genres that constitute experience, 6 we can listen to how Cathy arrives at an authentic and powerful experience. Cathy thought that being \"whooshed\" out of her head was \"cool,\" but soon her glee transformed into a more profound appreciation. As she recalled: I look up, and there's a man, a robed older man there, with long, wavy hair, a long wavy beard, and he looks just like a picture of \"theancient\" that's in a William Blake watercolor\u2014I don 't even rememberwhich one it is. But it looks just like one of those pictures of one ofthose old, sage philosopher guide people. And my heart leaps rightout of my chest and I go, \"Oh, my God, it's Joseph!\" I don 't know who Joseph is, but my soul knows it's Joseph, and I'm so happy to see him. And he's beaming at me. He stretches outhis left hand as I'm looking to him, so it's to my right, and he, thegesture is, \"Look who I've brought for you.\" And there, next toJoseph and ve times taller than him, is this outline of light. And theoutline has an area where the head would be, and bumps for theshoulders. It's not a person, it's not a body, it's like a being of light. And I'm\u2014and I go\u2014and I move toward the being of light and thebeing of light moves towards me, and I'm just molecules of energyand I understand that at the time, and all my molecules of energy in-termingle with the molecules of energy of this entity of light. And Ifeel like I've died and gone to heaven. I'm like ahhh. And this deepbooming, booming male voice says, \"Welcome home, Cathy,\" and Istart to sob. And now, part of me realizes that my body is in a chair in Newton, in somebody's living room, and that I'm in a room with other women,and I'm sobbing, and that they're all meditating, and I can 't make toomuch noise because I'll disturb them. And part of me just wants to beenveloped in this energy\u2014I'm aware\u2014that's where my main con-sciousness is, up in this cloud of light. And I just want to stay there forever and ever, it's so beautiful. I'm sobbing with happiness.touching the transcendent 207And then, the beam pulls away, and I feel whooshing, going back to my body, because the teacher's saying now it's time to return,you know, you've met your guide. And I was absolutely speechlessfor a long time, absolutely speechless. We had to, we changed loca-tions, we went back to the sofas, and then she said, \"Who wants toshare\" and I said, \"Oh! I want to tell you.\" But I waited. I felt like Iwas just so blown away I didn 't want to upstage everybody. So therst woman said, \"It's interesting because I wasn 't expecting this,but I saw Jesus.\" And then the second woman said, \"That's interest-ing, because I saw Jesus too. Jesus was there. Jesus is my Reikiguide.\" And I'm like, \"Hmm, there's a pattern here.\" So I describehow rst I saw him and then I went up out of my body. And theteacher's eyes are bugging out of her head and\u2014you know, I don 'tthink any of her students had ever reported anything quite like thatbefore. And then the fourth woman said, \"I didn 't see anything.\"And we're like, \"Oh, that's OK, the rst few times we didn 't see any-thing.\" We knew. She's Jewish. Jesus isn 't part of her paradigm. So ofcourse she didn 't see him. I personally now believe that\u2014I mean, what was Jesus doing when he was healing? He was healing with his spiritual energy, hewas somehow channeling divine energy to these people. So I believethat he was a Reiki master too, and that is sort of what he came toteach about\u2014healing with love, and with divine love, it just got twisted around a little bit over the millennia. So I consider him my boss now\u2014my Reiki guide. I have fundamentalist Christian back-ground friends who think I'm going to the devil because I'm doinghocus pocus with Reiki, and they just don 't understand that I'm do-ing Reiki from a Christian perspective. I later realized that that experience of going up to the light and being embraced by it was what the psychic lady had meant by being\"Christed.\" Somehow I had been exposed to that Christ energy,whether it was Jesus\u2014I often wondered afterwards, after readingmore about souls and soul development and now I'm into booksabout people's souls'\u2014the different ways that people describe soulgrowth. Was that my oversoul? I didn 't know what that was, but itwas so welcoming. And I know that when I die that's where I'mgoing. And its like, \"Wow, now I am really not afraid of death.At all.\" And my hospice work took on this whole new dimension. I was able to talk to people and say, look, I've been up to the light, it's won-derful, don 't be afraid. And it seems to really\u2014I mean people haveread it, they have mostly heard of near-death experience\u2014I feel like Ihad a near-death experience without being near death. So, that was208 producing everyday religious livesFebruary of 2000. And that was really, really important to me. And the fact that it was Glastonbury Tor was really really signicant. AndI don 't know if you saw this little statue. [Cathy stood up and walkedover to a small table in the corner topped with a photograph of Glas-tonbury and several small objects and statues.] This is like a littlestatue of Jesus holding, embracing, a baby. And that's what it felt like.And it's all white, too. It's a Lenox statue, and when I saw that I said,\"I'm not into statues of Jesus, but I have to have that.\" Because if youcan imagine as a little baby, being held and just loved uncondition-ally, it doesn 't matter what you've done or who you were, it was justthat amount of unconditional love. So that's one of my special objectson my table. I bought that to commemorate that experience. The Validity of Experience This powerful event marked Cathy's body, her soul, and her perception of theworld. The \"real ness\" of this event is not easily won, however: it becomes realonly as she overcomes her own skepticism, doubts, and scientic view of theworld, views that are, furthermore, ones that she assumes that I hold, as a \"so-cial scientist\" who must be interested, she tells me, in issues of validity. 7Al- though I do not voice such concerns or questions during the interview, Cathyimplicates me in her quest for a valid experience: Cathy anticipates and buildsinto the experience the answers to those (myself included) who might chal-lenge her claims. These answers, however, are built in, presumed, and juxta-posed as multiple ways of knowing, drawing on various senses, on ideas aboutthe relationship of the body to the mind, and on expectations about the linksbetween past and future. To better see and hear how Cathy does this, we can pay attention to several ways that voices, visions, bodies, and \"culture\" circulate in this story. We canlisten and see, in other words, how Cathy builds answers to objections and con-cerns about the validity of the experience. These \"answers\" are not direct (norare the questions), but rather indirect. She answers them while also narratingand in so doing orchestrates others' voices and her own to make the experiencereal once more. Cathy begins this story with an oracular voice, that of the psychic who tells her that she will be \"Christed.\" Cathy takes pains to note that she does notknow the psychic, and that the psychic does not know her. But the psychic getsthings right, Cathy says, and provides a prediction that she will be \"Christed.\"Importantly, the psychic refuses to give Cathy any context for what this mightmean, when it will happen, or what it will feel like. The oracular voice of thispsychic (about whom Cathy says she is skeptical) frames this story and sets upmany of the themes and ideas that will follow.touching the transcendent 209Cathy then tells me about her desire to become a Reiki master and goes to some length to tell me why she arrives at the Reiki teacher's house with noprior contact with the teacher or the other students. No one there knows whatCathy is about, or vice versa. Indeed, her social distance from these womencontinues throughout the rst part of the story, and the narrative she creates ischaracterized by an absence of voices and a dearth of social ties. Not only voicesbut also bodies and connections are missing here: until she nds herself onGlastonbury, Cathy shows herself to be a seeker extraordinaire, following herown path without any assistance or suggestion from others. The absence of social ties and others' voices allows Cathy to tell a story about experience that happens precisely to her, the individual. Indeed, Cathy struggles throughout the experience (particularly as she shoos away Jesus) withthe problem of social suggestion. She is dismissive of the Jesus who appears toher as not \"real,\" but rather most likely an internalized (and possibly pedes-trian or even childlike) depiction of the divine tied directly to her own religiousculture. This Jesus, furthermore, does not speak but merely beckons, in con-trast to the disembodied voice (who remains unnamed) on Glastonbury Tor,who identies her as \"home\" in this astral realm. Notably, the voices of women in Newton arise in the story after Cathy's ex- perience has already happened. At that point the women in the room conrmand bolster the reality of Cathy's experience. The other women 's experienceswith seeing Jesus call to our attention the clear problem that subliminal, sub-conscious cultural categories play in Cathy's experience. Their experiences with Jesus, positioned after Cathy's experience with the Christ, could easily call into question the validity of Cathy's out-of-body experience. Cathy is very clear abouther own suspicions about images and visualizations that she recognizes, aboutthe cultural \"paradigms\" that shape encounters with the divine and even whatwe desire to see. Crucial to Cathy's experience likewise are various understandings of vi- sion, seeing, and their links with believing. Cathy readily understands that shecan will herself into seeing things, and likewise that her own mind's eye, in aguided visualization, will likely be marked by cultural ideas and images thatshe carries with her. These, she says, are not \"real.\" As we learn, in order forCathy's experience to be real, what she sees must be something not easilychalked up to her culture. This is an issue that she engages in several ways inher story. Cathy's deep desire to know the truth and the way the universe works,she suggests early on, makes her particularly susceptible to easy answers, andshe is always on guard, checking whether things are real \"to her.\" She notes, forexample, that while Brian Weiss's books are interesting, they were not \"real\" forher yet. She remains a skeptic as the Reiki session begins: she has no expecta-tion that she will really see anything when the guided visualization happens,and she remembers a previous class in which all she saw were \"three Japanese210 producing everyday religious livespeople\" on the ceiling, whom she waved to but dismissed as \"not real.\" She did not, in other words, have high expectations that this guided visualization wouldbe any different. Cathy's skepticism is so deeply entrenched that when she sees Jesus' face emerge in outline and then in full form, she immediately rejects it. At this mo-ment, however, things begin to change swiftly. It is, after all, one thing to rejectthree smiling Japanese gures on the ceiling as \"not real,\" but it is anotherthing altogether to shoo away Jesus, even given her concerns about his imagebeing merely a result of cultural suggestion. Cathy, however, does shoo himaway, convinced in her mind that she knows better than to be convinced by aSunday school portrait. This is a dangerous game but one that is nonethelessrewarded. After refusing Jesus a second time, \"she\" is propelled forward into arealm where she will encounter a more authentic, pure, energetic Christ, onethat she suggests stands behind the historical Jesus. It is important to note that Cathy's concern about moving past Protestant Sunday school culture is not a purely critical position. In fact, her story, itssummation, and, most important, the voices of the chorus of women who havealso seen the historical, embodied Jesus during their visualization suggest thatthere is truth in all of what Cathy saw, including the Jesus that she met in theeld. Indeed, Cathy's being \"Christed\" did not contradict their encounters withJesus but rather added an extra layer of reality, each story reinforcing the auraof the others (including Cathy's own encounter with the physical Jesus). Evenas Cathy registers a difference between their encounters, within the narrativethese visions of Jesus/Christ work together to conrm her experience, to bol-ster \"their\" visions' reality, and, interestingly, to unsettle the division betweenthe cultural and the real (even as it depends on their distinction). In Cathy's understanding, vision and voice both contaminate and call into question the reality of the experience of being Christed and lead her to a radicalskepticism that is at once both dangerous and rewarded. In a momentouswhoosh, Cathy leaves her body and goes out of the top of her head. No longerconnected to her body and, we soon learn, to the part of her brain that thinksconsciously, Cathy is no longer a skeptic and can only muster the reaction \" this is cool!\" Arriving in the astral plane removes Cathy from a thinking, sentient, skeptical realm and places her in a realm where her soul and her heart lead theway to determining what is real. On the astral plane Cathy no longer wonderswhat is real. Her soul and her emotions now hold authority, and this \"knowing\"eclipses anything that occurs here on earth. As Cathy pronounces, \" Idon 't know who Joseph is, but my soulknows.\" Cathy's soul, described here as a molecular, energetic self, merges with another energetic being seen only in outline. Thisconnection on the astral plane becomes real in part through the juxtapositionbetween the cognitive, cultural, social self that remains in Newton, and the feel-ing, ahistorical divine self that travels and knows something entirely other.touching the transcendent 211Going \"out of body\" is marked by a shift in Cathy's story from studied skepticism to full acceptance of her soul and emotion. This shift, however, isfar from clean, given that the validity of her emotions and her soul's ideas arepresented within the very real body that never leaves the ground. While Cathyleaves her body and perhaps even her \"I\" behind, it is her body that displays theexperience and thus renders it real. This is most strikingly present in the way Cathy talks about her body, of which she remains conscious throughout the out-of-body experience. Cathy'stears bridge two spaces of consciousness. Her holy, astral tears cannot be criedin a realm where she is not a body. Her sobbing in the astral plane is thusmarked not there but rather within her flesh. As such, the astral plane materi-alizes within her Newton-bound body where everyone can see (and even be dis-turbed by) her sobbing self. 8 The messy tangling of Cathy's physical and astral bodies (and energetic selves) is mirrored in the messy and unclear juxtaposition of Jesus as anidentiable body and the nonnamed being who rises up above her and withwhom she intermingles. While Cathy is in the astral plane, no one identiesthe large being of energy as the Christ. Joseph merely points as if to say \"lookwho I've brought,\" and, as Cathy says, it is her soul but not her cognitivebrain that identies this being. The aura of mystery and the inability (or re-fusal) to name this energetic being is further underlined by Cathy's refusal todirectly call this being Christ. Rather, she only refers to the experience as \"be-ing Christed\" and calls attention to her own questioning, after the fact, ofwhat had happened to her. We might note here that much as Cathy's \"soul\"knew who this being was, so Cathy guides those who listen to her storytoward an indirect \"recognition.\" As she does, Cathy becomes a guide who,like the astral Joseph, points those who listen to her toward the unnamed di-vine. She orients me, the listener, toward a position where I might also ap-prehend it. 9 The genres shaping Cathy's experience have less to do with what the expe- rience \"says\" (i.e., about healing, Cathy's role in life, and the message she issupposed to give others) than with its validity. In this story, a valid experienceis embodied and affective rather than cognitive, one that happens presumablywithout social or cultural suggestion, and to an individual in her solitude.Even as Cathy establishes these points, they are nonetheless complicated byher efforts to explain the importance of the narrative itself and, as we will see,to describe what happened on the astral plane. It is, in other words, easier toexplain and describe what is not an experience than what is. Despite the ab-sences that mark the space of experience as both divine and noncommunica-ble (e.g., Cathy's refusal to name the being of light), Cathy nonetheless alsostrives to communicate what happened on the astral Glastonbury, and sheturns to particular images and metaphors as she does so. What can we learnfrom these?212 producing everyday religious livesTheologies of Experience We might begin by asking what cultural sources shape the way Cathy experi- ences this experience as authentic, and through which she imagines and lives aconnection with the divine. All the questioning and skepticism that Cathy voices,and which lead up to her being \"out of body,\" call attention away from the veryspecic images and bodies that appear in the astral plane of Glastonbury. The de-pictions in the rst half of her story stand in sharp contrast to those in the secondhalf. Once she has left her body, she has also left her skepticism. She does not tellus that these images are what \"came to her.\" Rather, she uses the images as onlyclose approximations of what really happened and what she really saw when shewas without the benet (or, we might say, the limitations) of cognition, vision, ora body. Cathy's juxtaposition of the daily and the astral serve to caution those wholisten against focusing too much on the particular images she calls upon to de-scribe Glastonbury, or reading them as mere \"cultural suggestion.\" It is, indeed,not our task to reduce her experience to an account framed in a secondary set ofcultural depictions (that is certainly not my interest here). That said, it is nonethe-less important to note how this shift from the daily to the astral is marked inCathy's story, and what kinds of images and ideas are set apart through it. The images that Cathy calls upon to describe what happens in astral Glaston- bury are particularly fascinating, as they resonate with Swedenborgian and Jame-sian theologies of experience, insofar as they are articulated in Cathy's language,symbols, and genres. Cathy explicitly invokes William Blake, the eighteenth-century poet and artist (most famous for his Songs of Innocence and Experience ) who championed nontraditional spiritual views, including Swedenborgianism. Byway of Blake, she also alludes to the British legend that Joseph of Arimatheabrought the Holy Grail to the \"shores of Albion,\" a story in which Glastonburygures prominently (Bowman 2000). She mentions that \"Joseph \" looks likeBlake's painting of the \" Ancient,\" perhaps grafting Blake's image, Joseph of Ari- mathea among the Rocks of Albion to one of his most famous paintings, The An- cient of Days . In that painting, a male gure bends down out of a ery sun into the darkness, two beams of light emanating from his outstretched hand. Al-though Cathy refuses to describe the \"being of light\" on astral Glastonbury inany other way, these concrete images give shape to what she experiences thereand also situate them within a particular history of experiences. These references themselves thus resonate with a long-standing tradi- tion of religious experiences, developed in the esoteric writings of EmanuelSwedenborg as notions of holy correspondences and human ability to realizethe divine within their own bodies. Cathy's experience lends ballast to LeighSchmidt's observation that contemporary spirituality is marked by a \"notablerevitalization of Swedenborgian mysticism \" (2000, 246). Similarly, Cathy won-ders out loud if she has met her \"oversoul,\" drawing William James's languagetouching the transcendent 213directly into contact with her experience. Cathy's experience is, in these ways, both marked by the tension between \"experience\" and \"account\" and linked toongoing theological and theoretical discussions of how such experience can berelated to others. Such historical arcs and connections are, as we see, often ob-scured by the experiences we hear Cathy and others describe. They provide apicture with the marks of historical connection deleted or erased in order tobetter establish their authentic links with the divine. That Cathy is drawing upon particular, historically embedded theologies of experience is obscured in some ways by the fact that she also participates in amore traditional religious community. For Cathy not only heals with Reiki andchannels out-of-body spirits but also sings in the choir of her mainline Protes-tant church and was until recently its primary Sunday school superintendent.Although Cathy claims the experience of Christ, in other words, she nonethe-less arrives at the end of this experience to identify Jesus as her Reiki master. As Cathy heals sick friends and clients and smoothes over the rougher edges ofbodily death in her work as a hospice volunteer, she relies on a Jesus who isalso fully embodied, and whose touch and unconditional love can be felt in afully embodied, maternal embrace. 10 The Touch of the Transcendent There is much more to ponder in Cathy's experience, and I hope that readerswill hear in what I have written just the beginnings of a fruitful enterprise. Ihope, likewise, that this story and others like it might make a strong case forthe importance of placing religious experiences closer to the center of sociolog-ical evaluation. Religious experiences have rarely been central to our line ofwork, arguably due to the power of people like Cathy to assert that their experi-ence accounts are descriptive rather than inscriptive or prescriptive. In takingCathy and people like her \"at their word,\" sociologists reinforce the projectwherein individual religious experience is viewed as a \"natural\" occurrencewithout its own history. By listening to the ways that religious experiencersrender experiences valid and authentic, however, we can nd in such storieslinks to historically articulated understandings of \"experience,\" and we cantrain sociological attention to the genres that constitute not only experience ac-counts but experiences \"themselves.\" In this approach, both the notion that ac-counts follow experiences and the notion that accounts are all we have arecalled into question: in Cathy's story, we begin to see how account and experi-ence are tied together in complex relation to each other, and to the embodiedcultural and social worlds in which they are experienced and expressed. In other words, this approach renews attention to the theologies that are like- wise embedded in sociological assertions that experiences and their accounts are214 producing everyday religious livesin fact two moments (one sequestered and hidden from view, one available for interpretation). The study of \"religious experience\" is far from the only placewhere scholars make such distinctions or where they matter in scholarly dis-course. But, that said, bringing experiences into the center of our studies callsto our attention the history of religious experience and its own role in shapingour discipline. With these issues in mind, we might, for example, begin to in-terrogate how theologies of religious experience shape the recent turn to \"livedreligion.\" Although I do not believe that the intent of the recent turn to thedaily necessarily excludes the experiential, in some accounts daily life is em-phatically viewed as mundane and ordinary. 11It might be worthwhile to ask where, or whether, there is a place for the transcendent or the divine, in thisstudy of \"daily life.\" In the epigraph that begins this chapter, literary critic and proponent of the \"new historicism \" Stephen Greenblatt counterposes his scholarly generation 'sdesires for a \"touch of the real\" with an earlier generation 's desire for a \"touch ofthe transcendent.\" Greenblatt calls attention implicitly to the numerous waysthat the realhas, and can be, imagined: as a Newton living room or an astral plane, as something accessible to scholars or irretrievably beyond our reach.While Greenblatt's essay brings our attention to the ways that the real as an ob-ject of desire shifts from generation to generation, what continues is an ongoingdesire to grasp, touch, or be touched by the really real and the fully true. In reguring the place of \"experience\" and the transcendent within our stud- ies, we do well to keep in mind that academics' understandings of the real, thelived, and the experienced are, like Cathy's, shaped by hopes and desires. Thischapter presents the very beginnings of an approach that might bring religiousexperiences closer to the center of our work, not as secondhand accounts, not asexpressions of community culture, not as \"really real\" events that stand outsideof time and daily life but rather as intellectually, emotionally, and politically com-plicated sites of wonder and imagination that dynamically shape Americans' reli-gious lives and American scholars' evaluations of the real. Framing experience inthis way, we are better positioned both to learn more about how Americanstouch, and are touched by, the transcendent, and also to add a new chapter toconversations about experience that have powerfully shaped our discipline. notes 1. In 2002-3 I conducted ethnographic research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with people who practice spirituality and claim some form of mystical experience. The interviews I conducted were dense with religious experiences, and experience was a key issue in many of the events, lectures, and rituals that I attended (sometimes withinterview respondents). \"Cathy Morton \" is a pseudonym. I have changed some of thedetails of her story to hide her identity, but otherwise her experience is reproducedhere, as she told it to me.touching the transcendent 2152. This literature is fairly extensive. On religious experience and religious auton- omy, see Taylor (1989). On experience and comparative religions, see McCutcheon (2003), Sharf (1998, 1995), King (1999), and Jantzen (1995). On experience and sci- ence, see Schmidt (2000) and Taves (1999). 3. For example, scholars who study conversion focus on how individuals constitute new \"selves\" by \"rescripting\" experiences, by some measures constituting them as differ- ent experiences in the process (Grifth 1997; Lawless 1991; Cain 1998). Other researchnotes how religious cultures shape bodies, emotions, and somatic expressions (Csordas1990). 4. A strikingly similar description of religious experience arises in Wade Clark Roof 's study of spirituality in the United States (1999, 175ff.). 5. Although I do not fully articulate this history (or, rather, histories) here, a grow- ing body of research attends to how \"spiritual\" experiences are embedded within and resonate with harmonial, theosophical, New Thought, and other theological strains de-veloping in the nineteenth century. See Albanese (1992, 1999), Sutcliffe (2003), and Schmidt (2003). 6. My emphasis in this chapter is not primarily on how the experienced is em- plotted but rather on how narrations are built on and through particular speech genres(Bakhtin 1981) that (in this case) orient a religious experiencer within ongoing, histori- cally changing conversations about an experience's authenticity and its teller's truthful- ness. In other words, in narrating an experience, experiencers like Cathy are simulta-neously required to establish its validity to a range of socially and historically located audiences. In so doing, Cathy embeds in her narrative various rejoinders and \"an- swers\" to those who might question her. Listening to these rejoinders and her choicesof genres helps us locate Cathy within particular theological streams in ways that atten- tion to the narrative as told does not. I have further explored religious speech genres in Heaven 's Kitchen (Bender 2003). 7. This mobilization of a \"scientic\" perspective resonates with the ways scien- tists worked out questions about the relation between religious and \"scientic\" phe- nomena throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In doing so, they con-tributed to developing notions of the subconscious, reevaluations of the relationshipbetween the body and the senses, and \"new\" theological statements about the corre- spondence of heaven and earth (Taves 1999; Schmidt 2000). 8. The mediating role of tears in religious settings and the ways that tears medi- ate between flesh and soul are brilliantly articulated in several articles in Holy Tears (Patton and Hawley 2005). 9. As Proudfoot (1985) notes, the strategy of \"ineffability\" within works like Schleiermacher's and even the early hermeneuticists like Dilthey strove not to explicate the inexplicable but rather to put readers and listeners in a position where they too might apprehend the ineffable. 10. As I write this, I have an e-mail from Cathy open on my desktop addressed to her \"brothers and sisters\" at her church and copied to friends in her spiritual network. The e-mail reports that her family has taken her great-uncle off of life support, and sheasks for prayers for his \"smooth transition from the life of the body to the life of purespirit. [He is] a devout Presbyterian whose faith has been his foundation through many216 producing everyday religious livesrocky paths. I have no doubt that he will be exultant upon his arrival in the 'after' life, as he basks in the radiance of Christ Jesus.\" 11. David Hall (2003) asks similar questions in a review of recent books on reli- gious experience, including Schmidt's and Taves's. references Albanese, Catherine. 1992.

Ammerman Across the pages of this book, we have met dozens of people, all of them thoroughly immersed in the world of modernity. Most are welleducated, many are young, and all live at least part of their lives inhigh-tech, media-saturated environments in Europe and the UnitedStates. They move in and out of social settings that expect differentthings of them and provide them with diverse compatriots and cul-tural cues. Each is putting together a life out of the particular customsand histories available to them, and those histories are anything butsimple. In each case, some form of religiosity is part of the story. Few people in these pages have absorbed an all-encompassing religiousway of life. But few have eliminated religion entirely, either. We beganthis exploration with the hunch that the usual modernization and \"ra-tional choice\" variables were insufcient to explain the space betweentotal commitment and total secularity in which we nd religion today.Along the way we have raised a variety of questions about the shape of that territory. Neither \"exposure to modernity\" nor the range of avail- able choices nor the \"strictness\" of the religious community seems toexplain very much of what we have seen. The people we have met in the eld are more and less attentive to spiritual matters, but what they see and hear and do when they do payattention is often subtly shaped by the institutions that have carriedthe dominant religious traditions in those places. Even intensely \"per-sonal\" mystical experiences are likely to contain signicant strands ofimage and symbol borrowed from the recognized theologies of theday. Existing traditions are by no means the only elements in people'sreligious repertoire, but they are still a powerful presence. Religion seems to have a signicant cultural impact beyond what can be counted by asking indi-viduals what they believe. For instance, English (and Swedish) citizens retain a connection to their churches that is anything but strict. They draw on religious rituals and moralguidance when it suits them, but vicarious religious presence appar-ently remains worth supporting. So long as the churches have somestructure of governmental and cultural support, they may not need de-voted individual supporters to survive. And so long as the churches arethere, a base of religious practice and identity is present in the culture. Italians and Spaniards are embracing individual moral authority and staying home from church (especially from confession), but they stillthink of themselves as Catholic, indeed, perhaps more so than ever, nowthat Islam provides a new religio-cultural alternative in their midst.Spain 's history of connection between Church and politics, however,complicates the picture. How religious, national, and political identitycan be combined varies even among the societies of Catholic southernEurope. And within the Church, the varying powers of religious leadersaffect the degree to which religious experience can be linked to moralpersuasion. Absent legal authority, the Church has a different range ofpowers at its disposal. Many American Jews are Jewish the way Italians are Catholic\u2014 choosing the practices and rules that will shape whatever religious lifethey may have, but tenaciously holding onto the identity itself. Thechoosing may be unorthodox, but it is still Jewish and full of ironies.Practices that are not \"religious\" are nevertheless interpreted with themoral and ritual structures of the tradition as a template. And identity isreinforced not by participation in a religious community but by thepresence of outsiders whose contrasting cultural assumptions bringJewishness to the fore. Religious history and cultural patterns may mat-ter, even if the individual is neither a believer nor a member. Many American teenagers have no such tenacious ethnic tie to a reli- gious tradition, but the stories of Christianity, especially evangelicaltales of good and evil, still supply potent cultural resources\u2014even whentwice removed and ltered through commercial entertainment media.Many teens not only use spiritual images to talk about their lives butalso resist dening themselves as secular. Even among a population farremoved from active religious participation or identication, the reachof American religious and moral culture can be seen. Swedish youth who frequent Internet chat rooms are equally disen- chanted with traditional religion and often have little or no institutionalreligious upbringing or participation. Their equation of religiosity with220 studying everyday religionignorance and intolerance is so pervasive that their more religious con- versation partners have a hard time dening their own faith for them-selves. Again, a particular cultural and institutional history provide theterms, supplying \"religious\" and \"enlightened\" as opposing identities.Religious institutions have cultural power as that which must be re-jected in order to be \"religious my own way.\" Additionally, conversationis structured by the very particular sources of power relevant in the In-ternet world\u2014access to technology and facility with words. The spiritualexplorations of teens, like those of adults, are structured both by thespecic social world they inhabit and by the symbols available in it. Each of these groups tests the outer limits of religion 's presence in modern lives. None conforms to what religious ofcials would like to see in a faithfulmember. They are what some sociologists would call \"free riders.\" They con-tribute little to established religious organizations, if contributions are mea-sured in time and talent and money, and they are not exemplary of the organi-zation 's goals. What we have seen, however, is that they are not beyond the reachof the cultural patterns, the rituals and stories, of the religious institutions intheir societies. Nor are they unwilling to assert their own ability to create spiritualpractices and engage in religious rituals. Religious identities are often main-tained and negotiated in surprising places. When we look for the \"strength \" of re-ligion, we need to pay attention to the everyday places where life is being navi-gated, as well as to the presence of cultural assumptions that keep religion widelyavailable beyond weekly worship services. It means paying attention to individ-ual lives and choices but recognizing the socially embedded patterns in thosechoices. 1 Indeed, the people we have met in these pages have taken religion with them into a variety of places where we might not have expected to nd it. Acrosscultures and across social settings, religious identities and practices are presentin the midst of all the other social demands of everyday life. For instance: Transnational migrants, uprooted from the sheltering world in which their religion of birth made everyday sense, have carried that religionwith them, re-creating it along the way. Neither adopting the religiousways of their destination nor leaving the homeland untouched by theirexperience, these migrants use religious practices and connections tonavigate the journey. Religion is both a medium by which they stay con-nected across borders and a means for establishing a place in a worldthat expects everyone to have a multicultural identity. Religion movesacross boundaries, but not without changing. Pro-life activists carry religion across boundaries, as well. Their uses of ritual symbols deliberately suggest multiple layers of meaning andthereby open up new directions for action. The logics of politics or fam-ily life are not neatly insulated from the logic of religious ritual. Just asstudying everyday religion 221religious participation can suggest political action, so political participa- tion can suggest religious commitment. Neither politics nor religionis a neatly contained variable. Liberal Protestant community activists have no such dramatic religious ritual language, but they too employ their religious identities in theircivic action. Understanding how religion works in the civic arena,though, requires more than attention to theology or assessments of ef-fectiveness. The question is not why or how well, but how. By speakingfrom (rather than for) a religious identity, they gain civic legitimacy, iden- tifying themselves with a respected organization without presuming toimpose that identity on others. By thinking of the neighborhood as a\"parish,\" they obligate themselves to its care without imposing corre-sponding religious obligations on others. In an urban world full of po-tentially contentious differences, it is sometimes possible\u2014thoughdifcult\u2014for a nonprivate religiosity to cross bridges rather than buildbarriers. In conservative Protestant families, the everyday life of the family is likely to be pervasively religious, lled with a biblically infused dis-course of patriarchy and submission. Religious symbols and storiesand authorities weave in and out of the stories men and women tellabout their families. So if we assumed that theology is destiny, wewould expect these families to act in patriarchal fashion, but they donot. Once again, we are reminded of the complexity of everyday life. Behavior and relationships are shaped by the larger cultural environ- ment (in which egalitarian marriages are often the norm), by the multi-ple rhetorics available even within a given religious community, and bythe contingencies of personalities and everyday demands. Each courseof action (religious and otherwise) blends and negotiates the strategiesat hand. Negotiation is perhaps the dominant sociological metaphor for describing this boundary crossing. Faced with institutional and cultural pluralism, mod-ern social actors use religious identities and symbols to make sense of every-thing from migration to family life to politics. In no case are other social reali-ties absent. Economic pressures, legal requirements, political resources, evenindividual skills, are shaping action, but so are religious prescriptions and nar-ratives. To say that meanings and strategies of action are being negotiated is torecognize that there are multiple and overlapping layers, including religiousones, in the modern social world. Not all situations are equally infused withspiritual options, but we would miss important dimensions in everyday actionif we assumed religion 's absence whenever we see secular strategies at work.Across both \"public\" and \"private\" domains, we would do well to ask bothwhether and how religious action may be present.222 studying everyday religionWe would also do well to stretch the very denitions that guide our inquiry, recognizing that \"religion \" is often being produced and reshaped in places be-yond existing institutions. People we have met in these excursions into the eldhave asked us to leave some of our preconceived notions behind. For instance: Those who are \"reflexively spiritual\" intentionally embrace the multi- plicity and openness of meaning they encounter. They do not want sec-ularists to tell them what is true any more than they want religious liter-alists to do so. They are adamantly open to the mysterious and spiritualdimensions of life, and not at all lacking the educational resources tonavigate the modern world. Some are attached to recognized religiousinstitutions, but others are creating alternative social spaces where newways of being religious can be explored. Nor is this a religious sensibil-ity that is likely to stay conned to private spaces, since the meaningsthey seek to construct encompass all of life. Dancers and gardeners may seem unlikely religious guides, but their physically embodied spiritual practices remind us again that religiosityis about more than ideas and memberships. They also remind us thatreligious institutions may systematically blind us to the existence ofpractices that are deemed illegitimate. Their practices, like so many oth-ers we have seen, cross boundaries into the mundane everyday world offood and health to make connections with sources of spiritualwholeness. These are connections much more likely to be made by peo-ple who have been outside culturally dominant groups\u2014not onlywomen but also people of color and people from outside the \"rstworld.\" In many places the everyday world has always been infusedwith spiritual presence and needs no \"re-enchantment.\" Americans who have individual religious experiences have long been taken at their word: that what they are doing is individualized and \"spiri-tual\" rather than religious. But the case of the woman who meets Jesuson an astral plane suggests religious traditions that shape religious indi-vidualism. It likewise reminds us that what we include in that categoryis not only negotiated with powerful traditional institutions, but alsowith scholars who study them. Immediate circles of communicationand compatriots matter, but so do the scholarly \"authorities\" who willdescribe an experience for the world. Beyond Modernity: Asking Questions about Everyday Religion So how will we describe religion? Social science methodologies have typi-cally described individual and collective religiosity in terms of beliefs, member-ships, organizational participation, and (occasionally) experiences and practices.studying everyday religion 223Extraordinary mystical encounters and everyday spiritual presence have been the domain of anthropologists studying \"premodern \" people or historians de-scribing religious virtuosi. The concerns of sociologists and psychologists havebeen shaped both by our theoretical preoccupation with secularization and bythe survey methodology that has been our dominant epistemological technol-ogy. Written surveys almost inevitably ask about things that can easily be put inwords (beliefs and common practices such as service attendance, for instance);and large-scale studies almost inevitably ask only about aspects of religion as-sumed to be widely present (ideas offered by the most dominant institutions,for instance). The object of our study, equally inevitably, becomes that which wecan measure with the technology at hand. These methodologies also privilege religious adherence and institutional afliation as measures of religion 's strength. Such tactics miss, however, reli-gious movements and practices that exist outside recognized religious institu-tions. It also misses the power of deep religious cultural expectations or even oflegal requirements and tax-generated revenue. What we have seen here is thatwhen researchers declare that belief has declined or that afliation is unrelatedto some social outcome, only a very small part of the story is being told. The same can be said about the so-called \"strictness\" debate. Rational choice theorists have used their elaborate economic modeling of survey responses, toclaim that \"high demand\" religious movements are able to generate rewardinglevels of collective religious goods that have an inherent market advantage overthe low-demand habits of liberals. These high demand groups, they say, have the organizational advantage of discouraging free riders and will therefore prevail. 2 Our time in the eld, observing religious groups and interviewing practitioners,however, has lead us to question the sufciency of these market models. What we have seen in these pages is both institutional strength that comes fromsources other than pooled individual commitment and religious strength that ex-ists beyond institutional bounds entirely. Dening strong religion in terms of\"strict\" beliefs and practices leaves much of everyday religion unanalyzed. Stretching the denition of religion does not mean, however, that we have adopted a functionalist stance, looking for whatever it is that provides meaningor belonging, including everything from football to ethnic pride. Each of us hastried to walk a careful line that takes into account two realities. First is the phe-nomenological reality of the experiences we have witnessed or heard describedto us. Phenomenologically, something becomes religious because it is under-stood to be so by those who observe and participate in it. Sometimes the ob-servers and participants readily agree, often because they all share commoncultural assumptions. Other times denitions involve negotiation and con-tention. 3Sometimes the participant is clear about what is happening, while the observer misses the religious dimension. At other times, the observer seessomething of religious signicance, while the participant is not so sure. Every-day practices of healing may be contentious, for instance, and Friday night224 studying everyday religionpizza may be ambiguous. Deciding whether and how either is \"religious\" re- quires the sort of negotiation that goes into navigating a complex modernworld. These chapters suggest that whenever people talk about and orient theirlives in ways that go beyond everyday modern rationality, when they enchanttheir lives by drawing on spiritual language and concepts and experiences, theyare engaging in religious action. 4Not everything is religious (or even spiritual), but when either observer or participant uses that category, social scientistsshould be interested in knowing why and how and to what effect. This micro-level negotiation of meaning presumes the second of the reali- ties we have been describing, and that is the macro-level and public context inwhich it takes place. Denitions of religion exist in cultural, political, histori-cal, and legal contexts that frame what happens in everyday negotiation. Reli-gion is not a private category, however powerful some individual transcendentexperiences may be. The state often denes the limits of religion, and ethnicgroups recognize some behaviors (and not others) as appropriately religious. Agiven culture's history may attach religious signicance to declaring (or es-chewing) a certain political allegiance. What an outsider may perceive as a sim-ple act of citizenship or charity or barbarism may be deeply entwined in a reli-gious tradition that situates that action as part of a much larger sacred story.That is, religious activity is collectively named and has a cultural reality beyondthe representation and assent of any given individual. That leaves open the question of whether any of these things that individu- als and collectives name as religious have anything in common. I am inclinedto think that they do, although I am well aware of the fuzziness around theedges of the category. It seems to me that religious activity is recognized assuch because it has something to do with things that are sacred, transcendent,or beyond the ordinary. 5Indeed, in much of what most people take to be reli- gious, there are assumed to be \"Sacred Others\" (God or gods) at work, and theidentity and history of those gods is collectively recognized and legitimated. 6 Action that is understood as religious action is typically embedded in a storyabout sacred realities and how human beings interact with those realities. 7I do not assume that all human beings are inherently capable of or procient insuch interaction (i.e., \"the sacred\" is not a human universal), but enough are tomake this a kind of human interaction worth the attention of social scientists. Sometimes that interaction is personal and direct, but often it is indirect and routinized. The transcendent character of religious action need not di-rectly involve a relationship with a personalized Divine Other, nor does it re-quire individual religious \"experiences.\" Religious institutions can representand mediate interaction with Sacred Others without individuals having any di-rect encounter of their own. Institutionalized rituals, stories, moral prescrip-tions, and traditions are usually recognized as religious, whether or not theparticipants themselves think a Sacred Other is involved (or even believe Sa-cred Others to exist). Participating in practices that have been handed downstudying everyday religion 225through a religious tradition (lighting Sabbath candles or making the sign of the cross, for instance) invokes religious narratives and experiences, whetheror not the participants understand their own action to directly involve a SacredOther. Religious action, then, becomes religious both because of its implicationof Sacred Others or transcendent realities by some or all of the participantsand/or because of its location within institutions and practices that are them- selves collectively dened as religious. Indeed, these chapters have suggestedthat religious traditions may remain powerful even when \"twice removed\" oroperating in a vicarious fashion. They supply a kind of cultural reservoir evenfor those who do not directly and routinely participate. Elsewhere I have suggested that narrative analysis may provide us with a helpful way to think about religion (Ammerman 2003). That analysis suggeststhat we pay attention to characters, to relationships, to motivations, as well as togenres and to the way a plot unfolds. Like all stories, religious and spiritual sto-ries are richly complex. They are not didactic lessons or moral recipes but arecontingent accounts of how life proceeds from one point to another. They en-compass experiences of body and spirit, as well as mind. Religious narrativesmay presume beliefs about how the world works that vary from the mundaneand scientic to the wishful and fantastical. Some stories may mark the chap-ters of a life with ritual interruptions; others may be more or less explicit abouthow everyday dilemmas are to be resolved. They usually identify the fellow ac-tors who share the story and give some of those actors more voice than othersin telling it. Narratives rooted in religious traditions are also likely to offer some accounts of the way people ought to relate to each other and what their obligations are. The group telling any particular religious story may or may notinclude a set of propositions that are taken to be \"ultimate truth,\" and they mayor may not make unique claims about the nature of reality or the meaning oflife. 8Religious stories can take many different shapes. In addition, because the narratives themselves are multifaceted, partici- pants often play roles that draw on one strand of the story and not the others.That is, a person may recognize moral imperatives that have a transcendentgrounding without ever having a \"religious experience\" or being able to articu-late a set of doctrines about God. Similarly, a person may have an elaborate the-ology but no ongoing participation in a religious institution. Or she may iden-tify as an Irish Catholic, with little connection to the beliefs and practices apriest might say that identity ought to entail. Rather than expecting \"religion \"to come in tidy bundles of well-integrated parts, what we have often seen in thecases in this book are fragments and side plots. Studying religion in today'scontext will require us to pay attention to the story's tangents as much as to theofcial plotline. Just as we should not expect all religious stories to be about \"truth,\" so we should not expect all religious interaction to be based on rewards. The sacredstories in which religious people participate involve relationships (human and226 studying everyday religiondivine) that are full of all the joyous and anxious, mundane and ecstatic mo- ments that characterize any relationship. Religious actors may expect that ei-ther their god or their fellow participants will provide them with rewards, butthey are just as likely to tell a religious story that includes a suffering god whowalks with them through the tough times in life. Recognizing the narrativequality of religious action makes clear just how impoverished rational choiceassumptions are. Human action and relationships of all sorts\u2014religious andotherwise\u2014are about a great deal more than maximizing rewards. The rela-tionship between human and divine is sometimes oriented toward meaning,sometimes toward belonging, sometimes toward desired rewards, sometimestoward communion (or relationship), sometimes toward ecstasy, and some-times toward moral guidance. 9Attempts to explain religious action that elimi- nate that human complexity may explain nothing at all. These dispatches from the eld have pushed us to pay attention to the many dimensions of religiosity, and we have often noted that those dimensionsare not neatly bundled into an identity package. These chapters suggest thatethnic and national identities, for example, may contain religious stories, sym-bols, and practices, but those elements may be loosely interwoven with peo-ple's attempts to sustain or re-create a place in a world of plural cultures. Reli-gious stories may provide identity signals that allow new forms of connectionthat go beyond institutional memberships. They may bridge boundaries by uti-lizing borrowed religious forms, or they may provide a way to claim the legiti-macy of cultural difference (Warner 1997). We should neither expect that reli-gion will always facilitate civic life and democracy nor expect that it will alwaysstand in the way. We should not expect that religious identities will disappearin the face of pluralism, but we should ask how they are constructed and main-tained and what sort of story they tell about difference and otherness (as well aswhat those others say about them). The great modern problem of pluralism, then, tells us nothing very spe- cic about religion. We can expect that most religious action in the world willtake into account that other religious possibilities exist. But what people call re-ligious, how they situate themselves relative to their own cultural traditions andidentities, and whether they welcome the contributions of others are questionsto be asked. Each of those questions begs for serious sociological scrutiny.What sorts of cultural and political and religious institutions engender whatsorts of denitions of religion and of religious others? What sorts of social con-gurations are associated with religious hostility or religious indifference topluralism, with religiously infused hospitality to strangers or spiritual embraceof plural alternatives? Which aspects of religion\u2014physical, mental, experien-tial, relational, spiritual\u2014are most easily communicated or changed or appro-priated in the meeting of cultures? Having noted that modern societies placepeople in the midst of cultural pluralism, there is much more to know aboutwhat religion then looks like.studying everyday religion 227One of the other great \"problems\" of modernity is the differentiation of in- stitutional spheres, the separation of one part of life from another. Althoughthis sort of social complexity is as real as pluralism, we need to disentangle thestructural fact of differentiation from the question of exactly where and howthe boundaries between spheres are drawn. The chapters in this book have al-lowed us to take that question into the world of everyday interaction, askinghow and under what circumstances religion escapes the pigeonholes to whichmodernization theories assigned it. Thinking about the permeability of institutional boundaries has required nothing more (or less) than reexamining our understanding of the nature ofsocial action in the modern context. I would argue (with Sewell) that modernsystems always involve us in multiple solidarities, and that very fact creates thepossibility of permeable institutional boundaries. No institution or group canmaintain its own purity so long as individual actors are members of more thanone group and can import resources and schemas (\"rules\" or categories of un-derstanding) from one to another\u2014a process Sewell (1992) calls transposabil- ity. The rules that tell me who I am at work are not the same rules that guide my behavior at home or at church, but no one succeeds in keeping everythingperfectly separate. Which rules take precedence may be a matter of contention,with some institutional actors weighing in more heavily than others. Sociolog-ical analysis asks, then, which actors and which rules? Importing rules from one place to another also means that human action happens in the space between predictability and improvisation. 10We inevitably categorize what we see (if this is an X, then I do Y) and form habitual responsesto typical situations. What we do is not simply automatic, but it is shaped into\"settled dispositions.\" As we have seen, existing religious schemas have a pro-found ability to produce predictable \"strategies of action \" (Swidler 1986). Butwe have also seen that human actors can invoke those strategies in unpre-dictable ways and unlikely places. No single situation is ever completely pre-dictable, in part because we constantly import rules and symbols from onesituation into another new or unfamiliar one (cf. Bender 2003). If all modern action involves having access to patterns from multiple social contexts, then we should not rule out the possibility that religiously formed pat-terns of action may nd their way into situations outside the religious sphere.The task of understanding the place of religion in modern life is not the taskof documenting the shrinkage (or expansion) of one institution. Our task in-volves, instead, a much more complicated process of attending to the presenceand absence of religious action in all the spheres of society. And rather than as-suming that secular factors always \"trump\" religious ones, we need to assessthe sources of power inherent in both secular and religious patterns of action. 11 The relationship between religious and secular in society is not a zero-sumproposition. More of one does not necessarily mean less of the other, since the\"pie\" may simply expand or contract.228 studying everyday religionAn Agenda for the Sociological Study of Religion Once we move beyond a zero-sum model of one institution squeezing out an- other, we can ask much more subtle questions about the nature of the interac-tion that takes place across those institutional lines. We can look harder at whatsorts of practices, symbols, and forms of authority shape action in any givensector of society. What kinds of social structures make religious schemas moreand less welcome? And what sorts of religious organizational activity producemore and less durable and portable ways of thinking and acting? If there is ac-tive negotiation among the various schemas that might frame action in anygiven situation, what makes religious narratives more and less practical? Whatpowers do religious institutions exercise, for instance, and how do secularagents take more and less effective steps to increase or decrease the prevalenceof religious and nonreligious patterns of action? Our task, then, is to look at thevery particular history of a given society and, indeed, of the sectors within thatsociety. In each, we must examine both the likelihood and prevalence of reli-gious action and the secular competitors and constraints at work. What might that look like? If we disentangle \"society\" into its many differ- ent sectors, while still recognizing the permeability of the boundaries aroundthose sectors, we might, for instance, ask questions about the presence or ab-sence of religious elements in the domain of culture. What combination of re-ligious and secular symbols, images, and categories is available (latent) andused (explicit) in the structuring of time, space, landscape, myth, and story?We might note, for instance, that Christian stories are interwoven with the Eu-ropean heritage in museums, holidays, architecture, and more (often hidingthe brutality by which that cultural dominance was won). The American land-scape and calendar, by comparison, have fewer explicitly religious locationsthat are claimed as culturewide symbols. Still, culture production in the United States includes a wide range of both secular and sacred efforts. Clark's chapter in this book (and other work on reli-gion and media) demonstrates the pervasiveness of religious symbols andthemes, both overt and implied, in the visual images and stories of popular cul-ture (Hoover and Lundby 1997). We do not have to look very far past the elitecritics to see a world of popular culture that is saturated with religious products(McDannell 1995). Even television programs that are not intended to be \"reli-gious\" are used by viewers as occasions for conversation and reflection on tran-scendent questions (Clark 2003). If we accept the possibility that both sacredand secular processes are at work in the production of culture, we can proceedwith a more nuanced examination of the conditions under which differentkinds of stories and symbols gain or lose currency. That will require paying at-tention to the available institutional spaces in which religious cultural experi-mentation takes place and who the agents of that experimentation are. Whatstudying everyday religion 229kinds of stories gain (and retain) resonance in the culture, and how are they produced and distributed? Religious cultural work also takes place, of course, as a culture gives col- lective denition to the individual life story. What are the signicant momentsthat dene who we are, and how are those moments recognized and cele-brated? To what extent do people include in their biography either individualcommitment to a religious tradition or personal spiritual seeking? Religiouscultural resources of all sorts are available to be marshaled in the lifelong proj-ect of creating a life, but to what extent are religious organizations effective incommunicating and persuading a population to use those resources? How arelifecycle events, for instance, constructed in a culture with a long history of anestablished church, where being baptized or buried with a religious ritual wasnot a matter of individual choice? How do the voluntary religious communitiesin the United States exercise influence over individuals, even though they lackthe legal power to compel participation or the monopoly power to expect it?And, in turn, how is the story different where religion and culture are impossi-ble to disentangle, with or without any legal powers of enforcement? The pres-ence or absence of religious and spiritual elements in any given life story is amatter that requires careful attention to all the institutions that vie for a roleand all the particular histories of relationship among them. What organizationsand social settings are available, legal, and compelling at each signicant mo-ment along the way? When we turn our attention from the cultural realm to elements of social stratication and solidarities, we can ask about the degree to which religious membership is more and less tied to political, economic, or ethnic solidarity.To what extent is a person 's place in the social order linked to religious identity,and how are religious experiences and practices differentially present acrosslines of class and power? At least since Niebuhr (1929), American sociologistshave paid attention to these \"social sources,\" but the temptation has been to ac-cept his theological judgment that religion tied to class or ethnicity is not realreligion (which mirrors the Marxian assessment that religion is an epiphe-nomenon of class relations). Such evaluations should not, however, keep soci-ologists from continuing to ask questions about how religious and spiritualnarratives intersect with stories about who belongs where and why. 12 Questions about the nature of stratication and power stand alongside questions about religious links to other solidarities. In any given historical sit-uation, to what extent is political membership tied to religious tradition? Towhat extent does national identity itself encompass religious symbols and ritu-als? Poland's Solidarity movement is a dramatic example of the strength of re-ligious symbols over against an alien (secular) government (Osa 1996). Thebreakup of the former Yugoslavia is a similarly dramatic, if distressing, exam-ple of much the same power at work (Sells 2003). And France's seeming in-ability to tolerate any public religious presence illustrates that nation 's historic230 studying everyday religionequation of secularity with citizenship. By contrast, where religious and politi- cal identities are less tightly coupled, either by choice or by decree (as is thecase in the United States), union members or Democrats may come in manyreligious and secular varieties. That may, in turn, mean that certain kinds of re-ligious public presence are less likely (that the public square is more seeminglysecular) than in other national and political contexts. And in many cases, that may be a very good thing, but that too should be an empirical question. What sorts of religious practices create social bound-aries, and which build bridges? What sorts of legal and military power can belinked to religious membership without signicant repression of minorities?What happens to overlapping identications when the power and fortunes ofone of the groups shift? Pace's chapter suggests that when churches are inleague with repressive and unpopular states, they are likely to suffer whenthose repressive states lose their hold. Whether the ancien r\u00e9gime in France orItaly's traditional political blocs, links to political elites do not always work inreligion 's favor in the long term. A decline in religion may signal more aboutthe unpopularity of political or social elites than about the implausibility of re-ligious beliefs. The link between religious and political identity is more subtle in a place like England, and it has long been contentious in the Catholic countries ofsouthern Europe. Still, in recent years, the emerging European Union has dis-covered that Europeans think of themselves as \"Christian \" (something thatwould hardly surprise Europe's surviving Jewish minority). Throughout Eu- rope the presence of sizable new Muslim minorities is challenging traditional links between religion (or, in the case of France, secularity) and national iden-tity. Will Muslims be treated by the state as an ethnic minority or a religiousone, each with a different set of entitlements? Can one be publicly religiousand a good citizen in secular France? American Muslims face similar chal-lenges, but the long-standing pluralism of American religion and\u2014crucially\u2014its disengagement from political parties and the state make the dilemmas ofAmerican Muslims somewhat less acute. Administratively and constitutionallythe U.S. state may not make religion a relevant category of identity. Expandingdiversity throughout the world is challenging the terms on which diverse cul-tures enter the public debate. In each case, the particular ways in which reli-gion and secularity have been linked to political and national identity will colorthe negotiations. Is religious pluralism seen as a threat to social solidarity? TheFrench sensibility, reflected in Durkheim 's theories, closely links group mem-bership and agreement on what is sacred. But not all histories are alike. Underwhat conditions might societies work out their common identity without a reli-gious consensus? In each of these cases, differing histories have bequeathed differing mean- ings to a declaration of religious identity. Religious identities and other socialidentities are connected in highly variable ways in today's global society, andstudying everyday religion 231the boundaries among all those identities are indeed permeable. We need a much more robust understanding of the social conditions under which reli-gious identities are deployed and the conditions under which they are sup-pressed or ignored. As Gorski has noted, we need a \"comparative politicaleconomy of the religious sphere\" (2000, 160). That implies, of course, further attention to questions surrounding the role of religion in \"public\" life. A good deal of recent research has attempted toanalyze the mechanisms through which religious influence is exercised in apluralist democracy such as the United States, with its tradition of \"separationof church and state.\" 13It seems increasingly clear, as Casanova (1994) argued, that the crucial distinction is between wielding state power and exercising pub-lic influence. The U.S. Constitution has forbidden the former but allowed wideleeway for the latter. A wide range of religiously based public interest groupsroutinely seek to educate both their own members and the larger public onpolicies as diverse as welfare reform and foreign policy; and local congrega-tions often provide a space in which conversations about public issues takeplace. Placing religion in the voluntary sector has had the ironic effect of allow-ing those voluntary religious communities to organize around whatever con-cerns them, thereby often inadvertently training and mobilizing citizens fordemocratic participation (Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995). And, with therelatively weak American welfare state, religious organizations also shoulder aconsiderable portion of the responsibility for delivering needed social ser-vices. 14This means that religious organizations are understood in the United States to be critical players in civic and political life. They are not the only play-ers, but neither are any other sorts of organizations. This freewheeling participation of plural religious actors in political life stands in contrast to many other political systems around the world. On oneside stands the extraordinary suppression of religious belief and participationeffected by various communist regimes; at the other extreme are the religiousrequirements imposed by the regimes in postrevolutionary Iran. By control-ling access to citizenship and to many economic rewards, states can be verypowerful players in supporting or undermining religious identication, partic-ipation, and even belief. Systematic analysis of this interaction between reli-gious and state actors is only just beginning, with the former Soviet bloc pro-viding a fascinating natural experiment. 15 Often closely related to questions of state power is the domain of educa- tion. The presence or absence of religion in schools has often been a matter ofcontention in recent years, and we are woefully ignorant of the actual social dy-namics at work in classrooms and educational systems. To what extent is theknowledge presented to students religion-friendly or aggressively seculariz-ing? 16To what extent are religious practices and holidays accommodated and/or celebrated? How is religious pluralism talked about and experienced?What is the mix of religious schools and nonreligious ones, or does the society232 studying everyday religionexpect its schools to accomplish both religious education and economic and civic schooling? We are beginning to learn something about the education thattakes place within conservative religious communities, 17but careful attention to the role of religion in everyday educational experiences is more rare. TheAmerican phobia about religion in the public schools should not prevent soci-ologists from asking these questions, nor should American ethnocentrismkeep us from looking broadly at the experiences of societies around the world.Understanding the structural and cultural contours of education is critical tounderstanding the nature of religious and spiritual life today. Understanding everyday religion will also, of course, require attention to the relationship of religion to economy. There is pretty good evidence that therhetoric of \"vocation \" is fairly rare today (Scott 1999; Wuthnow 1994). What-ever role Calvinist imperatives may have had in fueling the capitalist revolu-tion, Weber was probably right that capitalism can now propel itself along quitenicely without any religious assistance. But does that mean that there is no re-lationship between spiritual life and economic life, between economic institu-tions and religious ones? How, for instance, do the typical schedules and tech-nologies of working life affect expectations about religious organizations? Arespiritual practices accommodated or encouraged in workplaces? Do religiousorganizations engage in economic activity such as job training, networking,capital accumulation, and the like? Do some religious memberships and iden-tities open (or close) doors of opportunity? Are there \"guilds\" that organize peo-ple with similar religious and economic positions (Jewish architects or Catholic doctors or evangelical CEOs, for instance)? To recognize the enormous power of global capitalism is not to assume that no other social forces are at work.Shedding that assumption, sociologists can contribute signicantly to an en-larged understanding of the places where economic life meets the religiousand spiritual world. Part of understanding the strength or weakness of religion 's overall pres- ence in a society clearly involves attention to all these social spheres. But it alsoinvolves attention to the actions of religious organizations themselves. The rel-evant questions to ask are not just about religious membership and attendanceand budgets. Even high membership and attendance rates may not signal reli-gious organizations that are capable of supporting religious action beyond theirown front doors. More interesting is the question of whether religious institu-tions are robust creators of cultural products (symbols, stories, rituals) that canbe transposed across multiple institutional lines. Do they devote signicant or-ganizational energy to nurturing and teaching their traditions? Are they vigor-ous social communities where bonds of solidarity are created and reinforced?Are they creative mobilizers and networkers? Do they train and support leaderswho can articulate compelling visions? In short, do they cultivate religious re-sources that are maximally portable into the everyday worlds where their mem-bers live?studying everyday religion 233The opposite possibility presents an equally compelling set of questions. How do religious institutions contribute to their own weakness? Does a \"one-size-ts-all\" set of monopoly cultural practices diminish the ability to providecompelling symbols for a diverse modern population? Do religious institutionsinternalize rationalist critiques and scale back their reliance on extraordinaryexperiences and explanations, and what effects does that produce? Do religiousinstitutions internalize modern pleas for tolerance by muting any particularis-tic religious claims they might wish to make? In what ways do those more gen-eralized claims help to construct portable stories, or do they simply disappearamong the pluralist alternatives? Do religious institutions dispense withsolidarity-enhancing activities and encourage members to spend their timeelsewhere? In other words, do religious institutions themselves act as secular-izing agents that strip away the available religious resources that might bebrought to bear in modern life? 18 As these questions and comparisons suggest, there is no one summary measure of secularization or of religious strength. Looking across culturesmakes clear that the relationship between religion and society is not some-thing neatly described by one set of variables. Understanding religion will re-quire attention both to the \"micro\" world of everyday interaction and to the\"macro\" world of large social structures. It will require attention to the wayeveryday habits shape behavior and to the way creative human beings exer-cise agency in setting new patterns. It will require that we look for the every-day intersections among the social domains of modern life and for the waysplural cultural patterns affect each other. Paying attention to how modernpeople identify the religious and spiritual dimensions of their lives will con-tinue to stretch our denitions, but it will also continue to suggest new waysto think about where religion is found and why, how spiritual practices affectlives, and how the particular histories of the world's diverse societies craft thestory of religion 's presence and role. There are indeed many modernities\u2014not just the Western Enlightenment story of religious decline. And there aremany kinds of choices\u2014not just the rational maximizing of rewards. Every-day religion takes place in the fascinating flow of choosing and creating thatconstitutes modern social life. Sociologists of religion still have a great dealleft to study. notes 1. Luckmann (1967) pointed us in the direction of individual, noninstitutional re- ligiosity, as have a long line of writers about individualized and privatized religion,such as Hammond (1992) and Roof (1999). Religion outside institutions is not, how-ever, either private or unaffected by social denitions and cultural patterns. 2. Among the many contributions to the strictness debate are Iannaccone (1994), Olson and Perl (2001), and Marwell (1996).234 studying everyday religion3. Beckford (2003) is right to point out that denitions of religion are often con- tentious, both for practitioners who seek public recognition and legitimacy and for scholars seeking evidence for their theories. 4. Similar arguments about religious practices are also made by Wuthnow (1998, 2001). 5. Berger (1974) argues for a substantive denition of religion that depends on the presence of a socially recognized Sacred Other (although this is my language, nothis). Even Durkheim (1995), the \"father\" of functionalism, begins with the experienceof the sacred in his denition of religion. The notion of a distinct sacred realm is also theorized by Otto (1923). Neitz and Spickard (1990) provide an important recognition that experience is at the heart of what we are trying to understand. 6. Hervieu-L\u00e9ger (2000) denes religion as a way of believing that has continuity and legitimation. I am less concerned about the coherence of the meanings being pro- duced and less willing to restrict religion to what is legitimated, but I concur with herattempt to identify the core phenomenon with ideas and actions that are based in something other than veriable knowledge. 7. I have elaborated this argument on the nature of religious action elsewhere (Ammerman 2003). The following section draws in part on that article. Timothy Nel-son (2005) provides a compelling analysis of religious ritual that takes just this sort of interactional approach. 8. As noted in the introduction, on this point I differ strongly with Stark (2001).9. The multidimensionality of religion was theorized in the 1960s by Stark and Glock (1968), but Stark's recent work has concentrated on the need for otherworldly explanations and supernatural rewards. 10. This, of course, is the basic theoretical position that comes from symbolic in- teractionism (Berger and Luckmann Emirbayer and Mische (1998) point to the human ability to bring past, present, andfuture into play at any given moment and to choose which \"past\" is the relevant one. 11. This is akin to Gorski's (2000) argument that \"secularization \" (the differentia- tion of religious from other institutions) may or may not be related to decreases in in-dividual religiosity. Change at one level does not tell us what will happen at the otherlevel. 12. Some of the best work in this area has been done on the new immigrant churches. One might argue that they dene an ethnoreligious space for their members(Warner 2005). It is often the case that congregations become primary community centers for an immigrant community (Ebaugh and Chafetz 2000). We do not yet know whether this linkage will survive into subsequent generations. We do know that Amer-ica's entrenched legacy of racism makes the black churches unique (Lincoln and Mamiya 1990). 13. See, for example, Wuthnow and Evans (2002) on mainline Protestants, Smith (2000) on white evangelicals, and Smidt (2003) on the clergy. Demerath (2001) pro- vides an excellent comparative study of the issue. 14. On social service delivery, see Cnaan (2002), as well as the important cau- tions voiced by Chaves (1999). 15. Studies of post-Soviet changes include Crnic and Lesjak (2003), Pollack (2002), and the work of Froese (2004a, 2004b, 2005).studying everyday religion 23516. On the history of the secularization of education, see the studies reported by Smith (2003). 17. Some of the most interesting research is actually on home schooling (Bates 1991; Stevens 2001). 18. This is a reality recognized very early by Berger (1969). references Ammerman, Nancy T. 2003. Religious Identities and Religious Institutions. In Hand- book of the Sociology of Religion , ed.
