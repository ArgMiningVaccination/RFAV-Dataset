There was a significant difference between the outcomes, and now we are the proud parents of a baby girl! Thank you for all your assistance and expertise\". \"After 5 years of trying natural and 2 failed IVF's we found Dr Gunter. She worked with myself and my husband for 6 months.

My husband and I had fertility issues, which Dr Gunter assisted us with. Our 2nd IVF took, so thank you!\" \"I was diagnosed with a low sperm count, and we couldn't conceive naturally. Dr Gunter explained that the sample was sub fertile. I followed her treatment for 4 months, after which a second test was done. My sample went from being sub fertile to fertile, with no abnormal forms, and a good count.\" \"I had tried 2 rounds of ovulation induction medications without success. After 6 months of treatment from Dr G, we became pregnant naturally! Thank you for balancing my hormones and making this situation possible! \" Testimonials Gynaecology \"I consulted with Dr Roxanna for extreme exhaustion and low mood associated with PCOS and Hashimoto's.

After 3 months of treatment my cycle returned to a normal range and I feel much better.\" I saw Dr Gunter for treatment of Adenomyosis and Endometriosis after having 3 laparoscopies.

After 2 months of treatment, our daughter's condition significantly improved\". I suffered with sciatica for over 10 years.

A few other symptoms that were troubling me are gone now too.\" Testimonials Food Intolerances and Weight Loss I consulted with Dr R about 2 months ago. I was met with warmth and kindness. She prescribed meds to help me with my weight loss and balance my hormones. I also did a food test and got a meal plan based off the results. 8 weeks later, I have lost 11cm around my waist. I still have another 8 weeks to go and excited for the outcome.\" After Dr's assessment and blood tests, I took the medications and changed my diet and lost 5cm around my waist and 2cm around my thighs in the first 4 weeks. What I like about it is that it isn't a crash diet, it's something I can continue with until I reach my goal weight.\" The food intolerance test really helped me. I was constantly bloated and felt uncomfortable after eating. After doing the test and changing my diet, I no longer have any of those issues.\" Testimonials General Healthcare & holistic Dermatology \"Dear Dr Gunter, I just wanted to let you know that our daughter's skin has improved remarkably. In fact, the eczema around her eyes started clearing within 2 weeks of the changes you recommended. So I just wanted to let you know and say thanks very much for the help, the improvement in her skin truly has been remarkable!\" \"Having a doctor like you around gives us a lot of peace - when life gets a bit \"crazy\" we know that we can depend on your sound advice and expertise. You are very unique in the way you connect with your patients and we were very fortunate to find you. We are still very thankful for helping us with the birth of our daughter, best regards\" \"Thank you for everything you have done for our family, Dr G\" \"You treated me 2 years ago for lung problems and diagnosed me with food allergies. I followed your advice, changed the diet and it turns out a 100% success. For the last 30 years I had every winter a heavy cough. Nothing helped and this winter I had absolutely nothing. So, thanks very much Dr. Roxanna\" What is health? Health can be defined as the state of being free of illness or injury. Better health is central to human happiness and well-being. It is also frequently taken for granted. Is being healthy an active or passive process? Being Healthy is most definitely an ACTIVE process. Being healthy involves steps that a person should take to support and maintain their current health, and by doing so in the present, minimise risks involved in the future. It is also about taking a holistic approach to treating current health problems by correctly improving diet and lifestyle through tailor-made options that are right for your body and using homeopathic and naturopathic medicine to restore the balance/treat the disease.
