Abstract Whenever two or more drugs are being taken, there is a chance that there will be an interaction among these drugs. These interactions may increase or decrease the effectiveness or may cause serious fatal reactions. The likelihood of drug interactions increases as the number of drugs being taken increases. Therefore, people who take several drugs are at the greatest risk for interactions. It is quite common for a patient to seek herbal treatment while taking several prescription medications. Safety has become a major issue reasonably enough, patients want to know about compatibility and possible interactions when taking herbs and allopathic medicines simultaneously. Such specific questions, unfortunately, are often difficult to answer. This review discusses the issue of drug interactions and several ways to avoid them.
