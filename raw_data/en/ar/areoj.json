I can help you clear stuck emotions, fear and pain, so you can live with greater peace and clarity. \"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.\" - Carl Jung I help people uncover and let go of what no longer serves them so they can reach their greatest, unrestricted potential - to then more easily make life choices that are in alignment with their soul's deepest desires and authenticity. Along the spiritual journey we may become uncomfortably stuck in the middle of two realities: the life we currently have and the life we want - where we are vs where we want to be. Self-help books, meditation, and personal development exercises may have helped a lot but have reached a limit. Stagnation sets in, limiting our ability to move ahead and heal further. Recurring patterns and stagnation (which amplifies anxiety, overwhelm, and judging self harshly) are rarely rooted in the physical realms - our everyday experiences or our physical bodies. The root causes are almost always at the energetic and spiritual levels, which informs our physical reality - what we attract into our life experiences and how we react to those experiences. Without addressing those underlying, unresolved energies and issues, we will continue to repeat the same patterns no matter how much we try to deny them. Just by trying to force positive thoughts or inappropriate emotions is not enough. Some of the most influential life forces stem from such things as: unresolved past-lives, spiritual vows, conception/birth dynamics, and defence/survival mechanisms. Such forces are extremely difficult to access or alter on one's own. Stubborn aspects such as denial, self-judgment, and negative self-image also make it very difficult to access certain aspects of our deeper selves. Clients Testimonials I can help you... In addition, you will be able to... Although everyone's outcome from the energy healing sessions are unique, here are some of the tangible results that have been reported from clients: We grow forward when the delights of growth and anxieties of safety are greater than the anxieties of growth and the delights of safety. - Abraham Maslow The energies we hold in our personal fields are like the wind: they can't be grasped or seen, but are a definitive force that can shape the landscape of our lives in erratic ways. My work utilizes intuitive energy healing to release code hidden blocks and facilitates greater spiritual growth. I help people let go of what no longer serves them so they can reach their greatest, unrestricted potential - to then more easily make life choices that are in alignment with their soul's deepest desires and authenticity. Abraham Maslow describes that there are two powerful sets of forces within the human condition: a drive for growth and its opposing force, a drive for safety. In short, this opposing force leads us to defend our current self and to cling to safety out of fear of the unknown. The force of safety keeps us where we are now, clinging to the past and afraid to take chances in order to improve our current conditions (internally and externally). It's your time now. Working with me will help you get to the root of your fears and pain, and help you release the layers of unresolved energies restricting your greater potential and well-being. The healing process... I have unique and personal method that I've honed over many years of practice on myself and successful work with others. Essentially I establish a connection with your Spirit and ask what is at the root of the specific issue(s) you are requesting help with. I perceive answers from various psychic senses, then I make necessary adjustments at the subtle energetic and spiritual levels of your being. I clear each non-beneficial energy (emotions, beliefs, fears and others) as they arise during this process. As a result, this type of spiritual healing work unfolds in layers and generally requires a minimum of 3 sessions to sense a shift. It's like an onion - the more layers, the more work needed and possibly more time to resolve all the issues... sometimes the layers stink and make you cry, but the rewards in the end are so worth it! Most frequent questions and answers [Is your healing work like Reiki?]() Although I have trained in Reiki, I do not use Reiki in my professional practice. My current practice provides much more effective and longer lasting transformation. I use a blend of intuitive and shamanic techniques to remove very specific energy imprints and dynamics from your energy field. These energy imprints might be trapped emotions, cordings with others, limiting beliefs, invasive influences, etc... Your energy field contains all of your personal records. The sum of these records creates your life patterns and dynamics, as well as your response to what happens in our life. By removing the restricting energy imprints you create space in your being and change the tapestry that manifests your life and your response to it. [How does remote spiritual healing work?]() Remote healing is very much like speaking to someone on another continent with a cell phone. There is no physical line connecting the phones, yet the communication is as clear as if there was. I personally find working remotely easier (and have a preference for it), so that my full focus becomes directed to the energetic and spiritual aspects of your being which is non-local and where the unresolved energies are held. By working with me remotely, you can go about your day without trying to fit in another appointment in your busy schedule. We do not even need to schedule a time to do the session by phone or Skype. I just do the work on my own and send you all the notes by email. If you have any questions, you are free to call or email back. [Are there any side effects?]() Some people do experience side effects that last for one to a few days. This could be feeling more emotional, or 'raw' or having vivid dreams. It is part of the processing of the energies and emotions which can be felt as they release from the body. If you've had a history of severe trauma it might best to work in collaboration with a therapist. I do not recommend energy healing for people who have not done previous work for major trauma with a professional such as a therapist or psychologist. You will need to be able to manage the emotions & information that comes up. I am not trained in psychology or counseling and do not offer talk therapy. [When are the sessions done]() I tend to space the sessions 1 week apart, unless your body needs more time processing the healing. When I do my work, I clear large amounts of stagnant energies, which cannot be all processed at once otherwise it would overwhelm the person. Although the work is done as I am doing it, the releasing and reharmonizing happens over 5-7-10 days, usually when the body is at rest during the night. The energy healing also continues to unfold over the following weeks and months. If you are a highly sensitive person, we can do the sessions every second week. [Can I see an example of session notes?]() Every session is widely different, however here is a sample of the notes sent after a session : Lack of forgiveness : and related feeling taken for granted around 17yrs old, unworthiness, feeling lonely, feeling judged around 17yrs old, alone, feeling unseen, belief I am not loveable, birth trauma ( and generated belief I am not worthy of God's Love and related worthlessness, insecurity absorbed from the collective unconscious, will to die absorbed, shock 5k, belief If they really loved me, they would console me) Spirit out of body by 10% caused by a belief I don't have enough security to live the good life and related unworthiness, lack of direction, feeling unsupported, belief I know I need to suffer and related wall around the heart (hurt pride, dread, panic, feeling unimportant, shame, feeling embarrassed, feeling unheard, anxiety, feeling inadequate, feeling alone, heartache, depression, confusion, feeling embarrassed, guilt), belief I am fat and related feeling unaccepted and sadness and underlying belief I am not true and related shame How to work with me... Usually considerable changes are noticed or experienced after 3 to 6 sessions. A minimum of 3 sessions is required to start our journey together, because it puts too much stress on both of us to attempt to clear lots of energy in single sessions. Most people require 6 sessions.
