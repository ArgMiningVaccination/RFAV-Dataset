Aromatherapists: Galina Rogozina, Sarah Bell, Tameeka Banton-Wright Aromatherapy treatments are made up of a combination of techniques adapted to help the absorption of aromatic oils and to promote a feeling of well being. Each treatment given is unique, tailored to the specific needs of the person at that time. The aim is to treat the body on both the physical and emotional level. Aromatherapy means \"treatment using scents\". Aromatherapy is used for the treatment of pain, skin care, alleviation of tension and fatigue and to invigorate the entire body. Essential oils are applied during the aromatherapy treatment and can affect the mood, alleviate fatigue, reduce anxiety and promote relaxation. When inhaled, the essential oils work on the brain and nervous system through stimulation of the olfactory nerves. The essential oils are aromatic essences extracted from plants, flowers, trees, fruits, bark, grasses and seeds with distinctive therapeutic, psychological, and physiological properties, which improve and prevent illness. There are about 150 essential oils. Most of these oils have antiseptic properties; some are antiviral, anti-inflammatory, pain-relieving, antidepressant and expectorant. Other properties of the essential oils which are taken advantage of in aromatherapy are their stimulation, relaxation, digestion improvement, and diuretic properties.
