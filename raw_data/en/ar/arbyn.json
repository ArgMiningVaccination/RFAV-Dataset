We don't actually have a naturopath to defend the profession. You see, if, for example, you are curious what your primary care physician might recommend to you, you can go to the [American College of Physicians](http://www.acponline.org/patients_families/) website, or the [US Preventative Services Task Force](http://www.ahrq.gov/CLINIC/uspstfix.htm) to get an idea of what the standard of care and evidence is for screening, prevention, and treatment. What isn't clear to me is what a naturopathic primary care provider has to offer. Here's my question, and I encourage any and all naturopaths to respond (anonymously is fine): A 65 year old male comes to you for an initial primary care visit. What is your initial approach to the patient? Aside from what you may find on evaluation, what prevention and screening recommendations will you make? One hint: you cannot answer, \"well, it depends,\" because there are certain things that evidence shows should be done for nearly every 65 year old male. Addendum Let's make the clinical facts a bit more interesting and typical. Let's say the patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and coronary heart disease, and had a drug-eluding stent placed in his LAD about one year ago. Today's vitals are significant for a weight of 66 kg, blood pressure of 160/92. His fasting blood sugar today in the office is 230. His LDL cholesterol level is 98. "}
