Today I am going to cover 3 of these natural and readily available substances we normally ingested quite regularly before fad diets and our foods became over-processed. Charcoal or Carbon \u2014 C on the periodic table Charcoal is the remnants of wood burnt at temperatures exceeding 1000 degrees celsius, burning up everything except for a highly porous skeleton of carbon. Once in our body, charcoal actively seeks out toxins and pathogens and then binds to them creating a compound too large to now pass through the microscopic channels in our gut walls. Now that this new compound is too large to be absorbed, it passes through our digestive track safely and is excreted through our stool leaving us unharmed. This natural remedy is so powerful that a piece of charcoal can absorb 200 times its weight in toxic and pathogenic materials.

Many other doctors and scientists over the years have repeated such experiments with similar results. History and modern uses Charcoal is known to have been used at least as long ago as 1500 BC to treat decaying wounds and intestinal disorders by the Egyptians. Many animal species like deer, camels, ponies as well as cats, dogs, and birds have been known to regularly ingest charcoal. Animals have an innate wisdom for these types of remedies. Research shows that activated charcoal eliminates important toxins, including chlorine, chloramine, hydrogen sulfide, phenol, tannins, and small amounts of heavy metals (copper, iron, mercury). There are many toxins in our foods that we aren't aware of that can cause... "}
