[View Our COVID-19 Inpatient Safety Protocols Here](/resources/online-therapy-guide/) Alcohol and drug addiction are serious medical illnesses. Addiction, sometimes called substance use or substance use disorder, doesn't discriminate. It can affect a person of any age, gender, economic or employment situation, race, or ethnicity. It also impacts family and friends of those who are battling with addiction. When you choose treatment at our facility, our first priority is your health and safety. We'll evaluate your current medical condition and monitor your safe progress throughout withdrawal. You may be given medicine to help ease your symptoms or cravings. Our alcohol and drug detox programs offer you the time to heal, both physically and emotionally. We provide integrated, medically supervised care that helps your body adjust to change, while helping your mind learn new ways to cope with the stressors in your life. Recovery looks different for every individual. Your care team will work with you to design a custom treatment plan just for you. Detox helps you discontinue alcohol or drug use and become medically stable. Depending on what substance you use - alcohol, prescription drugs or illegal drugs - and the symptoms you have, you may be given medication to help you through withdrawal and reduce your cravings. You will be admitted to inpatient care and closely monitored by our medical staff, who will assess your physical response to withdrawal to ensure your safety. The length of your stay at our facility depends on several factors. While there's no such thing as a typical detox period, those who are addicted to alcohol or benzodiazepines (such as Xanax, Valium, or Ativan) may require up to ten days. When you are stabilized, you will be encouraged to participate in talk therapy sessions. This may be individual, group, or family therapy, depending on your needs and interests. We offer Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), mindfulness, and motivational training to help you recognize dangerous or negative behaviors and to help you discover new approaches to solving problems. You will also have the chance to meet with peers through support groups like [Alcoholics Anonymous](https://www.aa.org/) and [Narcotics Anonymous](https://www.na.org/). Opportunities to take part in holistic therapies like relaxation, yoga, pet therapy, music, and art will round out your day. Following the detox process and [inpatient rehab](/substance-abuse-treatment/inpatient-rehab/), you may be referred to one of our outpatient programs, where you'll learn productive ways to fill your time and replace old or trigger behaviors. You'll also receive health education and work on strategies to sustain your sobriety. Many people who face drug or alcohol addiction also struggle with other mental illness. During your assessment and throughout your ongoing treatment, we'll work with you to address all of your emotional needs. Sometimes it's hard to say whether a mental illness is the underlying cause of addiction, or if addiction is contributing to other mental health issues. Our goal is to treat the whole person and any mental health conditions you're experiencing. We work to break down barriers to your recovery, whether those are personal, financial, or physical. Your recovery begins with a no-obligation assessment. You can schedule an assessment by phone or chat 24/7. Our facility also takes walk-ins at any time. During your assessment, our team will talk to you about your medical history, substance use history, any symptoms you're experiencing, and other information that will help us develop a customized treatment plan for you. Your assessment will be reviewed by a physician. Following your assessment, we will recommend a treatment plan, which will take into consideration your physical, emotional, and social needs. Your plan may include inpatient or outpatient services, medically assisted treatment, medication management, behavior therapy, and activity-based therapies.
