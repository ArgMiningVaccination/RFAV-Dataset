ATHENS \u2014 Anti-vaxxers and churchgoers are out in force on a warm July Sunday morning in central Athens \u2014 and, for the most part, they are the same people. For the Greek authorities, one of the major sources of opposition to lockdowns, mask-wearing, social distancing and vaccination is influential Greek clerics and the power they wield from the pulpit. \"The church authorities refuse to police the churchgoers, respecting the personality of the faithful,\" reads a sign at the main entrance of Saint Nicholas' Church in the capital. Inside the packed church, you could count the number of people wearing a face mask on the fingers of one hand. The priest, Vasileios Voloudakis, used his sermon to lash out against the government, doctors and church leadership. You may like \"They want to treat the churches the same way they do gyms, but we believe that in here we are in heaven,\" he told the congregation. \"Scientists cannot explain some things, so they prefer to hush it up.\" Voloudakis is ne of the most prominent critics of coronavirus restrictions and vaccines in the Greek Orthodox Church and [has even said ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puCMtKxwBd0)that those who \"alas\" have the vaccine \"will bitterly regret it.\" He has a lot of supporters. \"We stand up to protect human rights, the same rights that have been ratified by Christianity,\" said Maria, a middle-aged woman attending the service with her husband who did not want to give her last name. \"God does not force us to follow him, unlike those supporting vaccination.\" \"I fully trust my priest,\" said Maria Papadopoulou, shortly after receiving Holy Communion. \"I don't want to have an experimental vaccine. My parents are fully vaccinated, but I didn't force them to do so; why should they do this to me? \"They want to divide us and we shouldn't allow that. Everyone should be free to do whatever they think is good for their health.\" he church leadership officially supports vaccination. The head of the Greek Orthodox Church, Archbishop Ieronymos, spent several days in intensive care with coronavirus last November. A month later, he said: \"I would be the first to go and get vaccinated if I had not been sick.\" The archbishop announced he had received the vaccine on May 12. However, several influential archbishops and clerics repeatedly tell the flock not to get vaccinated, while some [refuse to let people into church](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIBAz4qTzW4&t=10s) if they are wearing a mask or have had the jab. Seraphim of Kythira, one of the country's most powerful clerics, is even spreading the conspiracy theory that \"vaccines are a product of abortions.\" \"This product that comes from killed embryos will be injected into our bodies. ... They want to create a metahuman, a mutated man, a man who will be like a robot,\" he said. Government pushback Greece has suffered a sharp rise in cases, mainly as a result of the Delta variant: In late June, average daily reported case numbers were around 400 but that's now jumped some 2,700 a day. Some 44 percent of the country's population is [fully vaccinated](https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-vaccination-live-data-tracker/), slightly above the EU average. But vaccine hesitancy has slowed the country's inoculation drive, with some [experts warning](https://www.kathimerini.gr/society/561408067/kindynos-apo-tin-kampsi-toy-rythmoy-ton-emvoliasmon/) that only 55 to 58 percent of the population will end up getting fully vaccinated, well short of the target of 75 percent. In an attempt to push the numbers up, Greece's government announced mandatory vaccination for staff at health care facilities, as well as health workers. The Interior Ministry has embarked on a campaign to increase vaccination rates in smaller communities, which will involve sending out local officials and more authority-friendly members of the clergy. Earlier this month, Health Minister Vasilis Kikilias and the government's top scientific adviser Sotiris Tsiodras met with the church's governing body, the Holy Synod, to try to engage the clergy in the vaccination campaign. However, the message from the Holy Synod wasn't exactly strong, instead recommending the \"free choice of vaccination as the exclusive and scientifically tested solution to stop the spread of the virus,\" as well as \"vigilance in prayers\" and \"frequent participation in worship.\" There was no mention of taking action against anti-vax clerics. \"We remain [committed to] the search for truth with the Church,\" Tsiodras said after the meeting. On Tuesday, the Holy Synod sent out a circular to be read during Sunday's services, telling the faithful that the vaccine does not contradict what the church says and urges the faithful to follow doctors' orders. The government's efforts continue. The church \"can influence the flock and can talk about its own experience with this invisible enemy, as it has mourned many metropolitans and priests,\" government spokesperson Aristotelia Peloni said during a regular briefing for journalists last week. \"It has the power to influence the flock by calling on citizens, especially those belonging to vulnerable groups of the population, to be vaccinated.\" Even though Greece is officially a secular state, the church wields extraordinary power in politics and society, making it difficult for politicians to interfere in religious matters. Governments traditionally find it difficult to confront priests, who have a big influence on voters, and even the church's leadership finds it hard to tackle individual clerics. \"The government has shown tolerance or even concurrence with irrational voices within the Greek church,\" said the spokesperson for the main opposition Syriza party, Nasos Iliopoulos. \"It is important that within the church there are very strong voices that defend rationality and science. However, the government, with its overall stance and contradictions, does not help to effectively isolate the extremist voices.\" Since July 15, only vaccinated people are allowed inside bars, restaurants, cinemas and theaters. However, no such measure has been announced for churches. \"The measures include only seated in bars ... and only standing in the churches,\" said Socialist Party spokesperson Pavlos Christidis. Regular rule-breaker The church has been a regular rule-breaker since the start of the pandemic. Members of the clergy have never been obliged to wear masks. Churches were among the first buildings in the country to reopen after both lockdowns, even as the rest of Greece remained indoors. Rules that applied to everyone else, like wearing a mask or keeping safe distances, were never really applied in churches. Even a directive to hold Easter services earlier than the usual midnight, because of a nationwide curfew, was disobeyed. In the region of Aitoloakarnania in western Greece, the top local cleric (known as a metropolitan), Kosmas, has called those who are afraid to attend a packed church unfaithful. \"God does not allow you to be infected. God does not infect! It is a holy place, the temple is heavenly,\" [he said](https://www.agrinionews.gr/aitolias-akarnanias-kosmas-maskes-stis-ekklisies-afinei-o-theos-anthrope-moy-mesa-nao-na-molyntheis/). During Easter, thousands of worshipers filled the churches of Agrinio, the region's largest city, which was placed on red alert within days as the number of COVID cases soared. The [same thing happened](https://www.cnn.gr/ellada/story/254990/kalymnos-eythynes-kai-sto-mitropoliti-gia-tin-exaplosi-toy-koronoioy-katalogizei-o-dimarxos) on the Aegean island of Kalymnos. Early in the pandemic, the Holy Synod ruled that the virus cannot be transmitted through Holy Communion. Several priests who used disposable spoons for Holy Communion to avoid transmission of the virus through saliva were suspended. Politicians from the ruling, conservative New Democracy party were [photographed receiving](https://www.iefimerida.gr/ellada/elena-rapti-ego-simera-koinonisa-kai-tha-synehiso) Communion, while [doctors close to Syriza](https://www.iefimerida.gr/politiki/o-giorgos-koymoytsakos-horis-profylaxeis-koinonise-se-ekklisia-toy-psyhiko) have also supported Holy Communion. Last week, thousands of anti-vaccine demonstrators gathered in Greece's two largest cities to protest plans to make coronavirus vaccines mandatory and available to children. Members of the crowd held banners saying \"We say no to the poison\" as well as Greek flags and crosses. Several priests were present at the Athens protest and were filmed [ singing](https://www.news247.gr/koinonia/syntagma-diadilosi-kontra-stin-ypochreotikotita-emvoliasmon-choris-kanena-metro-prostasias.9295347.html) an Easter hymn. \"They want to tell us, the priests, what to say,\" said Voloudakis, who gave the anti-vax sermon at Saint Nicholas' Church. \"The religious leaders who accept this are mainly to blame.\" Just around the corner from his church, the walls are covered in posters from anti-fascist groups, calling vaccination blackmail and vowing to resist, effectively offering Voloudakis an unexpected ally. \"Sabotage the apartheid in health rules,\" read one of the posters. At another rally on Wednesday, thousands gathered in Athens' main Syntagma Square, a crowd dominated again by Orthodox Christians who chanted things like: \"Orthodoxy is alive, we are Christ's soldiers, punishment is coming\" and \"we don't have guns, we have crosses.\" [[email protected]](\"mailto:pro@politico.eu\")for a complimentary trial.
