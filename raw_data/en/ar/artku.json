It has been shown that the dynamics of both models are governed by a reproductive number. All solutions converge to the origin (the disease-free equilibrium) when this reproductive number is less than or equal to the critical value one. The disease-free equi- librium is unstable and there exists a unique positive (endemic) equilibrium ifthe reproductive number exceeds one. Moreover, the positive equilibrium is stable. Our results show that the qualitative behaviors predicted by the model with arbitrarily distributed latent stage are similar to those given by the TB model with an exponentially distributed period of latency. KEY WORDS: Global stability; distributed delay; tuberculosis; mathematical models. INTRODUCTION Differential equations and differential-integral equations have been devel- oped as mathematical models to study the dynamics of disease transmission for many communicable diseases such as measles, influenza, rubella, and chicken pox (see Hethcote, 1976, Dietz, 1979; Hethcote et al., 1981; Lafayette, Indiana 47907-1395. E-mail: zfeng \u0014math.purdue.edu 2Department of Mathematics, 35899. E-mail: huang \u0014math.uah.edu 3Biometrics 1988; Feng, 1994; Feng and Thieme, 1995). The main interest in studying these models is to understand the long-time behavior of the dynamics of disease transmission\u0015whether the disease will die out eventually or will per- sist. A clear answer to this question is practically important to the design of strategies of the disease control. The purpose of this paper is to study differential equations and dif- ferential-integral equations that describe the dynamics of disease transmis- sion for tuberculosis (TB). One of the important features of TB is that a relatively small proportion of those infected go on to develop clinical disease (Smith and Moss, 1994). Most people are assumed to mount an effective immune response to the initial infection that limits proliferation of the bacilli and may lead to long-lasting partial immunity both to further infection and to reactivation of latent bacilli remaining from the original infection. Data from a variety of sources suggest that the lifetime risk of developing clinically evident TB after being infected is approximately 10 0, with a 90 0likelihood of the infection remaining latent (Hopewell, 1994). Individuals who have latent infection are not clinically ill or capable oftransmitting TB (Miller, 1993). The ability of the organism to survive in a latent state and then reactivate many years after the original infection indicates that the tubercle bacillus has enjoyed a long period of coevolution with the human host, a period that has enabled the bacillus to survive in small population groups for long periods of time. The annual risk of developing TB in individuals previously infected with M.tuberculosis who have survived the initial and higher risk period that follows infection changes with the age of the individual. The following annual risks have been estimated: (1) for children, aged 1\u00156, the risk of progression is estimated to be around 0.001648, while for those in the 7\u001512 age range, the risk is about 0.000770 (Comstook et al., 1984); (2) for adults in the 15\u001534 age range, the reported risk of progression is between 0.0008 and 0.0009, while for adults who are over 55 years of age, the risk is reported to be around 0.0010 (Comstock and Edwards, 1975). Since the development of active TB after infection is highly dependent on the infection age, one of the important questions in epidemiology will be, What is the impact of a long and variable latent period on the transmission dynamics of TB. Almost all existing mathematical models for TB assume that the dura- tion of the latent stage is exponentially distributed and hence the models can be reduced into a system of ordinary differential equations. In this article we first give a complete analysis for an ODE model introduced early by Castillo-Chavez and Feng (1997a). We show that there is a global stability switch from the disease-free equilibrium to the positive endemic426 Feng, Huang, and Castillo-Chavezequilibrium when the basic reproductive number passes through the critical value 1. We then develop a model for TB with an arbitrarily distributed latent period, a system of differential equations coupled with an integral equation. Our investigation shows that the second model shares a dynami- cal property similar to the ODE model in the following sense: the dynamics of disease transmission is governed by a reproductive number R0.I fR0 1, then all solutions converge to the disease-free equilibrium. If R0>1, then the disease-free equilibrium is unstable and there exists a unique positive equilibrium which is locally stable. This paper is organized as follows: Section 1 introduces two models of TB\u0015\u0015one with an exponentially distributed latency period (ODEs) and the other one with an arbitrarily distributed latent stage (a system of differen- tial-integral equations). Global stability results of the ODEs are given in Section 2. The model of differential-integral equations is studied in Sec- tion 3. We compute the basic reproductive number and study its role in the dynamics and stability properties of this model. Section 4 details some of our current efforts and extensions including the incorporation of immigra- tion and the effects of HIV. 1. THE MODELS We divide the host population into the following epidemiological classes or subgroups: susceptibles ( S), exposed and infected ( I; assumed infectious) individuals. Ndenotes the total population. Our previous paper (Castillo-Chavez and Feng, 1997a) intro- duced a simple model cis the per-capita contact rate, ;is the average number of susceptible individuals infected by one infectious indi- vidual per contact per unit of time, +is the per-capita natural death rate, kis the rate at which an individual leaves the latent class by becoming infectious, dis the per-capita disease-induced death rate, and r1and r2are427 Variable Latent Periods in Mathematical Models for TBthe per-capita treatment rates of latent and infectious individuals, respec- tively. We assumed that an individual can be infected only by contacting infectious individuals. In the following we let _=;c. We modify the above model by assuming a variable removal rate (instead of an exponentially distributed latency period) from the Eclass to theIclass. Let p(s) be a function representing the proportion of those individuals exposed at time twho, if alive, are still infected (but not infec- tious) at time t+s. Then & p*({) is the rate of removal of individuals from Eclass into Iclass {units of time after exposed. Assume that p(s) 0, p*(s) 0, p(0)=1 and | 0p(s)ds< Then the number of individuals who have been exposed from time 0 to t and are still in class Eis given by |t 0_S(s)I(s) N(s)p(t&s)e&(++r1)(t&s)ds Thus the number of individuals who become infectious from time 0 to t and are still alive and in class Iis |t 0|{ 0_S(s)I(s) N(s)e&(++r1)({&s)[&p*({&s)e&(++r2+d)(t&{)]ds d{ individuals in Eclass at time t=0 and still in the latent class, I0(t) denotes those initially in class Ewho have moved into class Iand are still alive at time t, and I0e&(++r2+d)twith I0=I(0) repre- sents those who are infectious at time 0 and are still alive and in the Iclass. E0(t)a n d I0(t) are assumed to have compact support (that is, they vanish for large enough t). Results on well-posedness given by Miller (1971) guarantee the existence and uniqueness of solutions as well as their continuous dependence on parameters for system (1.2) as a system of nonlinear integral equations. The positivity of solutions can be proved similarly to Castillo-Chavez et al. (1989). 2. GLOBAL STABILITY OF THE ENDEMIC EQUILIBRIUM OF (1.1) The reproductive number R0of (1.1) has been derived by Castillo- Chavez and Feng (1997a) as R0=_k (++d+r2)(++k+r1) and they have proved the following. (1) If R0 1, then the disease-free equilibrium of (1.1) is globally stable. (2) If R0>1, then system (1.1) has unique positive endemic equi- librium. Furthermore, the endemic equilibrium is locally asymp- totically stable. In this section we show the following global result. Theorem \"I}I IfR0>1 and r1++>d,then the endemic equilibrium of (1.1) is globally asymptotically stable . Recall that r1is the treatment rate of latent individuals and dis the dis- ease-induced death rate. Since the treatment period is about 6\u00159 months, r1>1 (year)&1, which should be greater than the value of din the case of TB. Therefore the condition r1++>dis easily satisfied. Through the rest of this section we assume that R0>1 and r1++>d. On our main approach is to exclude the existence of a periodic solution and then, by applying the strong Poincare\u0015Bendixson theorem, to conclude the global stability of the endemic equilibrium.429 Variable Latent Periods in Mathematical Models for TBFrom (1.1) we can get an equation for the total population N: N4=4&+N&dI Here ''}= d\u0012dt.'' System (1.1) is system: (2.2) I4=kV&(k+++d+r2)I It is clear that any nonnegative solution of (2.2) will eventually enter the set 0\u0019={(N,V,I)#R3 +:4 + N V I= So we will consider only the solutions of (2.2) in 0\u0019.

Moreover, it should not be difficult to check that 0is convex. Let0(t)=(N(t),V(t),I(t)) be a nonnegative solution of (2.2).431 Variable Latent Periods in Mathematical Models for TBLemma \"I\"I If 8(t)does not converge to the endemic equilibrium ,then the | limit set of 8 (t)contains a periodic solution of (2.2) . Proof. Let system (2.2) be denoted X4=f(X), X=(N,V,I)T#0 (2.4) then a straightforward 0 0 E&1 f(X) XE, E=\\010+ 00 & 1 is a nonpositive matrix. Hence the lemma follows from the strong Poincare\u0015Bendixson theorem (Smith, 1995, Theorem 4.1). The following lemma is given by Muldowney (1990). Lemma \"I/I Suppose X (t)is a periodic solution of (2.4) .Then the periodic solution X (t)is asymptotically stable if the linear system u*= f(X(t))[2] Xu (2.5) is asymptotically stable ,where for a of (2.2) in 0 ,if it exists ,is asymptotically stable .

Then a direct computation yields that that _>d (2.7) Also from Eqs.

Using Lemmas 2.1\u00152.3 and Theorem 2.2 we can prove Theorem 2.1 by using the same argument given by Li and Muldowney (1995). We provide an outline of the proof as follows. Proof of Theorem 2.1. Let 7be the basin of the attraction of the positive endemic equilibrium X*=( N*,V*,I*) #0. To show that X*i s globally asymptotically stable, it suffices to prove that ( 0\"[(4\u0012+,0 ,0 ) ]) 7. Note that the equilibrium X* is locally asymptotically stable; it follows that 7is an open set in R3.I f( 0\"([(4\u0012+,0 ,0 ) ]) 37, then it is clear that there is an X0#(0\"[(4\u0012+), 0, 0) ])& 7.L e t 8(t,X0) be the solution of (2.2) with 8(0,X0)=X0. Then 8(t,X0)#0for all t 0 and 8(t,X0) does not converge to the equilibria X* and (( 4\u0012+), 0, 0) [note that the435 Latent Periods in Mathematical Models for TBequilibrium (( 4\u0012+), 0, 0) has an unstable manifold pointing to inside 0]. Since X*a n d( ( 4\u0012+), 0, 0) are the only equilibria in 0, from Lemma 2.2 it follows that the |limit set of 8(t,X0) contains a periodic solution X(t) of (2.2) in 0. Moreover, Theorem 2.2 implies that X(t) is asymptotically stable. It follows that 8(t,X0) converges to the orbit 1=[X(t):0 t T] ast\u0014 , Tis the period of X(t). Since X(t) is asymptotically stable and X0# 7, we can pick a point X1#7sufficiently close to X0so that the solution 8(t,X1) of (2.2) through X1converges to 1ast\u0014 . This contradicts the definition of 7. 3. ANALYSIS OF SYSTEM (1.2) The Iequation in (1.2) is a Volterra integral equation if we change the order of integrations as follows |t 0|t 0p*(u)e(r2+d&r1)udu=:a(t&s) (3.1) Therefore (1.2) I(t)=|t 0a(t&s)_S(s)I(s) N(s)ds+I0e&(++r2+d)t+I0(t) (3.2) Let B(t)=_S(t)I(t) N(t) Then system (1.2) the Iequation replaced by (3.2) becomes S4=4&B&+S+r1E+r2I E(t)=E0(t)+|t 0B(s)p(t&s)e&(++r1)(t&s)ds (3.3) I(t)=I0e&(++r2+d)t+I0(t)+|t 0a(t&s)B(s)ds436 Feng, Huang, and Castillo-ChavezThe basic reproductive number in this case is given by R0=_| 0a({)d{=:_DI (3.4) where DI=| 0a({)d{ and a(u) is (3.1). Let DE=| 0p(s)e&(++r1)sds then DEis the death-adjusted mean length of the latent period. The relation between DIand DEis given by DI=1 ++r2+d(1&( ++r1)DE) (3.5) Remark. In the case of an exponentially distributed latent period with a mean length 1 \u0012k, we have p(t)=e&kt, and formulae (3.4) and (3.5) give R0=_D I=\\_ ++d+r2+\\k ++k+r1+ System disease-free equilibrium (S0,E0,I0)=\\4 +,0 ,0+ and has no other constant solution. Since E0(t) and I0(t) are zero for large t, and e&(++r2+d)t\u00140a s t\u0014 , it could be expected that ( 4\u0012+,0 ,0 ) i s a n asymptotic equilibrium of (2.1) as t\u0014 . This is shown by the following theorem. Theorem IfR0 1, then the disease-free equilibrium (4\u0012+,0 ,0 ) of system (3.3) is a global attractor ,i.e., limt\u0014 (S(t),E(t),I(t))\u0014(4\u0012+,0 ,0 ) for any positive solutions of system (3.3) . We need the following lemma to prove Theorem 3.1.437 Variable Latent Periods in Mathematical for TBFor a bounded real-valued )\u0014R be bounded and twice differentiable with a bounded second derivative .Let t n\u0014 and f (tn)con- verge to f or f for n \u0014 .Then f$(tn)\u00140, n\u0014 Proof of Theorem 3.1. LetR0<1. Differentiating the Eand Iequa- tions in (3.3) and using the fact that E0(t),I0(t) have compact supports, we get (for large t) E4=B(t)+|t (3.6) and I4=&( ++r2+d)I&|t +(1& e&+t) Hence N 4 + uniformly bounded on [0, ). Let R0<1; we claim that I =0. Suppose, on the contrary, that I >0. Then there is a sequence tn\u0014 asn\u0014 such that I(tn)\u0014I asn\u0014 . Without loss we can suppose that tn+1&tn\u0014 as n\u0014 (3.9)438 Feng, Huang, and Castillo-Chavezfor otherwise we can choose a subsequence having the property (3.9). Moreover, by definition we have I = lim t\u0014 I\u0019(t) with I\u0019(t)=sup s t[I(s)] (3.10) It follows from the equation for I(t) in (3.3) that I(tn+1)=I0e&(++r2+d)tn+1+|tn an M>0 that B(s) M for all s#[ 0 , ) Hence the convergence of 0a(tn+1&s)B(s)ds M|tn+1 tn+1&tna({)d{ M| tn+1&tna({)d{\u00140a s n\u0014 have |tn+1 tna(tn+1&s)B(s)ds _I\u0019(tn)| tna({)d{ R0I\u0019(tn) (3.13) and (3.11)\u0015(3.13) yield that I R0I Thus we have R0 1, which is a contradiction. Hence lim t\u0014 I(t)=0 (3.14) Now with the use of the Eequation in (3.3) and the fact that I =0, one easily deduces that E =0 (3.15)439 Variable Latent Periods in Mathematical Models for TBFinally, limt\u0014 I(t)=0 implies that B(t)\u00140a s t\u0014 . Hence e&+t)+S(0)e&+t+|t 0e&+(t&s)(r1E(s)+r2I(s)&B(s))ds (S(t),E(t),I(t))=\\4 +,0 ,0+ This finishes the proof. The following result shows that when R0>1, the disease will persist in the population. Theorem /I\"I IfR0>1, then the disease-free equilibrium of system (3.3) is unstable .Furthermore ,there exists a constant ' >0, such that any solution (S(t),E(t),I(t))of(3.3) with I (0)>0 satisfies lim sup t\u0014 I(t) ' We first prove the following lemma. Lemma /I\"I IfR0>1, then any solution (S(t),E(t),I(t))of(3.3) with satisfies lim sup t\u0014 I(t)>0 Proof. Since I0(t) has compact support, we can replace the Iequation in (3.3) by I(t)=I0e&(++r2+d)t+|t 0a(t&s)B(s)ds (3.17) Suppose that the conclusion of the lemma is not true. Then I =0, or limt\u0014 I(t)=0. This also implies that (see the proof of Theorem 1)440 Feng, Huang, and Castillo-Chavezlimt\u0014 E(t)=0. It follows that limt\u0014 S(t)\u0012N(t)=1. Hence there is , and S(t) N(t)>1&1 (3.7), that I4(t)\u00140a s t\u0014 . Whenever I(t) gets close to 0 for large tit will stay close to 0 for a long time. Also, noting that I(0)>0 and I =0, we can sna(tn&s)ds=|tn&sn 0a({)d{\u0014DI, n\u0014 (3.21) Then by (3.20) and (3.21), dividing both sides of (3.20) by I(tn) and taking n\u0014 , we get 1 _DI=R0 But R0>1, a contradiction. Proof of Theorem 3.2. Note that & Mathematical Models for TBFrom Lemma 3.1 and also (3.4) and (3.5)] that \\E+I N+ (3.25), and N 4\u0012(++d), we get I ' This finishes the proof.442 Feng, Huang, and Castillo-ChavezAccording to Miller (1971), an endemic equilibrium of system (3.3), if it exists, must satisfy the limiting system associated with (3.3), which is given by the following set of equations: S4=4&B&+S+r1E+r2I E(t)=|t S*,E*,I*) be a solution (3.26) with I*>0, Variable Latent Periods in Mathematical Models for TBDividing both sides of (3.31) by N* and using (3.28)\u0015(3.30) obtain N*=4R0<_++(R0&1)1&r1DE&r2DI 1 hence if R0>1. It is easy to see from (3.30) that only when R0>1 does the unique endemic equilibrium exist, and it is by by (3.32). The stability of the endemic equilibrium is given in the following result. Theorem /I/I IfR0>1, then the limiting system (3.26) has a unique endemic equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable . Proof. The proof of this result reduces to the study of the local stability of the trivial equilibrium ( X=0) for a Volterra integral equation of the type X(t)=F(t)+|t 0A(t&s)G(X(s))ds (3.33) Let S\u001b=S&S*,E\u001b=E&E*, and I\u001b=I&I*.

To simplify expressions, let z>0 when R0>1. Condition (i) is satisfied. Next we check condition (ii). Note that by (3.39) and (3.40), | H(*)| if we express 0p*({)e&(++r1+*){d{in terms of 0a({)e&*{d{. Using the definition of in Mathematical Models for TBFurthermore, clearly for any =0>0, there is a $0>0 such that [sup t< $0,a n d& { 0. This finishes the proof. The global stability of the endemic equilibrium is expected if certain conditions are satisfied. However, we have not been able to prove this at this moment. The main difficulty arises from the fact that (1.2) is infinitedimensional. Some stability results have been established for epidemiologi- cal models with different structures than (1.2). For example, Stech and Williams (1981) show a nice global stability result for the endemic equi- librium in a model with an arbitrarily distributed immunity period; their result was recently extended by Thieme and van den Driessche (2000) to diseases that cause fatalities. To the best of our knowledge there is no efficient approach so far to handle the global structure of a system like (1.2) except for some monotone systems. This will be our further research effort. 4. DISCUSSION In this paper we have prove the global stability of the endemic equi- librium of an ODE model of Tb that we developed previously (see Castillo- Chavez and Feng, 1997a). We have also constructed a TB model with a distributed delay to study the effect of variable periods of latency on the transmission dynamics of Tb at the population level. These long and variable periods of latency were no considered in our previous paper, as our emphasis there was on the study of resistant TB. The purpose of this paper is to look at the effects of variable (rather than exponentially dis- tributed) periods of latency on the dynamics of TB. Li and Muldowney (1995) have shown the global stability of the endemic equilibrium for the SEIR model. Our basic TB model (1.1) in this article is different from their model. We considered an '' SEIS '' type, with individuals moving back to the Sclass from both the Eand the Iclasses due to treatments, and we proved a similar global stability result for such a model. We also found that the addition of an arbitrarily distributed latency period to the basic TB model does not alter the qualitative dynamics of TB. The disease either dies out or remains endemic regardless of the shape of the incubation \u0012latent period distribution. Blower et al . (1995) have developed a differential equation model with ''two'' latent groups: one group involves those who will develop TB quickly after primary infection, while the second group is formed of those who will develop the disease slowly through endogenous reactivation. Since there is448 Feng, Huang, and Castillo-Chavezonly one group of susceptibles in their model, the ''two-group'' effect is achieved by assuming that some fixed proportion of those who become infected (per unit of time) follows the fast route, while the remaining proportion follows the slow route. The results of the model is this article show that this artificial division plays no role in the qualitative dynamics. The fixed fraction model (referred to by Blower et al ., 1995) actually depends on factors that are not part of Blower et al .'s model and \u0012or the model in this article (e.g., the age of the infected person). Age is relevant factor, but it cannot just be assume a priori that a fixed proportion of individuals in a particular age bracket develops active TB. Contact rates\u0015\u0015 conductive to TB transmission\u0015\u0015are very likely to be age-dependent and the mixing between age classes is nonlinear. Therefore, to study the dynamics of ''fast'' versus ''slow'' TB, one must really use an age-structured model. The analysis of age-structured models, while complex, is not impossible (see Castillo-Chavez and Feng, 1998). Blower et al. (1995) com- pute R0but study the dynamics of their model exclusivity through simula- tions which turn out to be ''typical.'' Our analytical results have confirmed their limited simulations not only for the ''slow \u0012fast'' TB model but also for models where individuals progress toward active TB at ''all'' possible rates. The fact that long and variable periods of ''latency'' do not lead to complex dynamics has been worked out before. For example, Castillo-Chavez et al . (1989) established that long and variable periods of infection for the transmission dynamics of HIV \u0012AIDS have the same qualitative behavior as the dynamics of models with unrealistic exponentially distributed latent \u0012 infectious periods. However, factors such as exogenous infection and heterogeneous contact rates can indeed generate radically dynamics dif- ferent from those given by the class of models discussed in this article. Exogenous reinfection is capable of sustaining TB even when the basic reproductive number R0<1 (see Castillo-Chavez and Feng, 1997b). Com- putation of the reproductive number in this article helps us understand the role that key epidemiological parameters play in the maintenance of TB\u0015\u0015 including the role of the parameters associated with an arbitrary distribu- tion that models long and variable periods of latency. To summarize our perspective, a person infected with TB may develop active TB in a variety of ways. One possibility is that a person may develop active TB as a result of an endogenous infection\u0015\u0015the subject of this article. In this case, there is no impact on the qualitative dynamics of the transmis- sion dynamics of TB. A second possibility is that such a person may develop active TB as a consequence of exogenous reinfection [i.e., acquir- ing a new infection from another infectious individual (Smith and Moss, 1994)]. Our results show that exogenous reinfection can have a drastic effect on the qualitative dynamics of TB (see Castillo-Chavez et al ., 2000).449 Variable Latent Periods in Mathematical Models for TBThe incorporation of exogenous reinfection into the basic TB model (1.1) allows for the possibility of a subcritical bifurcation. Thus, a ''backward'' bifurcation of an endemic equilibrium may occur at the critical value of the reproductive number R0=1, and hence, our system can have multiple endemic equilibria for R0<1. This type of behavior has been observed in recent epidemiological models in the context of sexually transmitted dis- eases (see Hadeler and Castillo-Chavez, 1995). Immigration effects on TB incidence rates have been found in several developed countries. The influence of immigrants from high-prevalence countries on the notifications in a low-prevalence country can be observed in recent data from Switzerland. Undetected active disease in immigrants is a significant sources of infection among uninfected immigrants, as well as for children of immigrant parents born in the new country. HIV also plays an important role in TB transmission. We are particularly interested in looking at the impact of immigration of infected individuals from countries where the prevalence of TB is high on TB dynamics and reactivation of latent TB among the HIV-infected, as well as their effects on disease control programs.
