With natural and potent elements like Zinc, Milk Thistle, Spirulina, Chlorella, Barley Grass, Wheat Grass and a special Fibre & Prebiotic blend, this formula will help you with detox process in your body. + cleanses your body + promotes a healthy immune system + helps maintain healthy body functions + encourages high energy levels on a daily basis KEY INGREDIENTS Zinc is one of the best minerals for flushing toxins from the cells of your body. With a strong antioxidant action zinc works to destroy 'free radicals' in the body, and also helps in removing heavy metals from the body. Milk Thistle is one of the most powerful liver detoxifying agents. The active compound within milk thistle is called silymarin, which is a standardized extract of the milk thistle seeds, and which has been in use for hundreds of years as a remedy for liver problems. Research has demonstrated that milk thistle supplementation helps boost intracellular anti-oxidant glutathione in the liver by more than 35%, thus increasing the liver's capacity for detoxification. Milk thistle also helps protect the liver, thyroid and immune system from radiation stress, as being one of the best defences against the damage that radiation produces. Chlorella and Spirulina algae are potent sources of chlorophyll and trace minerals. Chlorophyll helps purify the blood by binding to toxins and improving the body's ability to bring oxygen to cells. By improving oxygen delivery to cells, it upregulates the intracellular energy production and anti-oxidant systems. Chlorella is especially known for its ability to bind with heavy metals from the body, such as mercury and aluminium, and it also removes other chemicals and pesticides from your digestive tract. Spirulina has an anti-inflammatory effect, boosts immune system, is a great source of nutrients, containing all essential amino acids, B vitamins and dietary minerals, such as iron and manganese, helps remove toxins from the blood and purify liver. Wheat grass and barely grass both help to purify the liver and aid detoxification, improve blood sugar levels and therefore help prevent diabetes. They can also help stimulate weight loss when added to a healthy diet, preventing food cravings and increasing feeling of satiety. Prebiotics are non-digestible fibre compounds that beneficially nourish the good bacteria present in the large bowel or colon. They help your good bacteria grow, improving the good-to-bad bacteria ratio, which has been shown to have a direct correlation to your health and overall wellbeing, from your stomach to your brain. Prebiotics, unlike probiotics, are not destroyed in the body, and are not affected by heat or bacteria. They may be helpful for several chronic digestive disorders or inflammatory bowel disease. The health benefits of prebiotics include increased bone density, strengthened immune system, better-controlled weight and appetite, improved bowel regularity and improved mental health. Prebiotics also make you feel fuller, faster. Therefore, people who are trying to maintain a healthy weight or lose weight could take prebiotics along with meals. Adding BATTERY DETOX supplement to your diet is fast and simple. The mixture is available in two different flavours, sweetened only with Stevia. You can just add it to water, or mix it in a fruit/vegetable smoothie, to enjoy its many benefits. + cleanses your body + promotes a healthy immune system + helps maintain healthy body functions + encourages high energy levels on a daily basis KEY INGREDIENTS Zinc is one of the best minerals for flushing toxins from the cells of your body.
