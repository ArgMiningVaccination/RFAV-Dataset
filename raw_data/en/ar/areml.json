For millions of Americans with eczema, itching andscratching are no laughing matter. But a variety oftreatments can help. \"We call it the itch that rashes,\" says F orrest P. Resnikoff, M.D., a der- matologist at Monmouth Medical Center. \"It startswith a sensitivity of theskin, which mak es it itchy. The more you scratch, the more youirritate the skin, whichincreases its sensitivity .\" That doesn 't mean it's your fault. Eczema is a genuine illness, known as atopic dermatitis to distinguish it from contact dermatitis, in which the inflammation is producedby a single irritant lik e poison ivy . \"With your skin reacts to a number of things\u2014wool cloth- ing and harsh soaps, for e xample,\" says Dr . Resnik off, adding that emotional stress can aggravate flare-ups. A predisposition to eczema runs in families and tendsto be link ed with asthma and seasonal allergies. Eczema begins when certain cells within the skin create inflammation by overreacting to stimuli. The result can be dry, red and flaky patches, often on the neck , inside the elbow and behind the knees. In some 15 percent of cases eczema is severe, and itcan cause embarrassment, bleeding and loss of sleep\u2014especially in children. (Happily, kids often outgrow it.) Though eczema has no cure, these treatments bring relief for most people: For mild cases, apply over-the-counter topi - cal creams such as hydrocortisone. If it doesn't get better, see your family doctor or dermatologist. He or she may recommend a regimen of gentle skin care in which you shun scratchy fabrics and use a mild soap. P at, don 't rub, when you towel off after a bath or shower , and apply a moisturizer contain- ing oil within three minutes. \"Dry- ing can irritate the skin, even if you just air -dry,\" says Dr. Resni- koff. \"When you use moisturizer, the oil becomes a barrier to evapora - tion, helping your skin retain the moisture it needs.\" Use a prescription cream or ointment. \"Traditional therapy has involved creams that con- tain corticosteroids,\" says Dr . Resnik off. \"But their overuse in sensitive areas can cause thinning of the skin, which shows up in stretch marks.\" F ortunately , two new non-steroid products have been shown to be effective: the cream pimecrolimus (brand nameElidel) and the ointment tacrolimus (Protopic). Use more advanced medical treatment. Three other treatments have been used for patients with severe eczema: ultraviolet light therapy, an internal antihistamine such as hydro xyzine hydrochloride (Atarax) to control itching; rare cases\u2014an internal steroid such as prednisone. MLinkHEALTHBECKY HEAVNERSKIN DEEP banish the itch and shed the red Eczema can be a nuisance or a torment, but you can find relief fast fact One person in 10 has eczema at some point in life. Treatment is aimed at relieving symp- toms and protecting organs from the dangers of inflammation. Some people with lupusdon't need medications, or take them onlywhen flare-ups occur; others take them on an ongoing basis. With some immunologic conditions, scientists have identified a particular proteinthat is the culprit and have managed to ren-der it inactive with a specific protein that tar - gets it and binds to it. This advance has not yet been achieved with lupus, so treatmentoften must include medications that suppressthe entire immune system. With the immunesystem's hands tied behind its back, so to speak , even a simple infection can become a serious threat, so doctors must be ever-ready to treat complications. Lupus is a complicated disease, and because there's no cure, patients need tolearn to live with it. If you 're diagnosed with lupus, a support group can provide knowl - edgeable peers who'll share strategies fordealing with the disease day by day (see \"F or Lupus, There's Help\" at left). It's important, too, to deal with your feelings, because emo-tional stress can contribute to flare -ups of the disease. Until science solves the mystery of lupus, small victories must stand in for theone big one. But if it's well managed, lupusneedn 't ruin your life\u2014or even rule it. MYou haven't seen lots of good-news headlines lately about lupus. Scientists still don 't know precisely why people get this inflammatory malady , in which the immune system goes out of whack and attacks the body 's own tissue. There is no permanent cure, and no new lupus drugs have been approved in 20 years. Still, most people with lupus lead active, healthy lives. Research is painting a much clearerpicture of how the disease works. And just in the pastdecade the survival outlook for people with lupus hasbrightened significantly , thanks to improved knowl - edge about how to treat serious complications such as kidney disease. Estimates of the number of Americans with lupus range from 250,000 to 1.5 million. When onlythe skin is involved it 's called discoid lupus; when it affects internal organs (about 70 percent of cases) it's known as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Lupuscan affect either se x at any age, but it 's most common among women in the childbearing years, 15 to 44. Normally , the immune system protects the body by producing special antibodies or proteins thatTAKING CHARGE For lupus, there's help \"October is Lupus A wareness Month,\" declares the friendly voice on the phone at the New Jersey chapter of the Lupus Foundation of America , at 800-322-5816 (www.lupusnj.org).

In people with lupus, antibodies zero in on healthy cells, potentially leading to tissue dam - age and eventual organ failure. Scientists speculate that lupus develops when a genetic predisposition meets up with some sort of environmental trigger, but they don 't know what the trigger is. Common symptoms include aching in the joints, fatigue, fever, skin rashes, sores on the mouth or nose, and a phenomenon called Raynaud's syn - drome, in which the fingertips become discolored due to lack of blood flow . But not all of these symp- toms are present in all cases (see \"Do Y ou Have Lupus?\" on the page at right).Ther e is as yet no surefire diagnostic test for lupus, so the American RheumatismAssociation has developed alist of 11 frequent symp- toms.

If you're having persistentmemory trouble, you should seeyour doctor to find out if a med - ical condition is the cause. (Sometimes, such conditions are reversible.) But many of us for whom nothing serious is wrong still wish we could be better about finding those carkeys or recall ing what we need to pick up at the store. \"Around the late 40s, we all begin to have more trouble remembering things like names,\"says Martin Herman, M .D., a neurolo - gist at Monmouth Medical Center . \"There's a huge amount of research going on about what we call the benign cognitive effects of aging, butnobody really has it pinned down yet.\" But a few practical methods help, and the fol - lowing six are among them. (They 're easy to remem - ber; their first letters spell RET AIN.) Rest. Be sure to get enough sleep. \"Sleep consoli - dates memories, protecting them against subsequent interference or decay ,\" reports University of Chicago scientist Daniel Margoliash in the journal Natur e. Exercise. Regular workouts promote better circula- tion of blood to the brain, and a recent study of mice suggests that they also trigger increased production of a brain chemical that builds and protects the neuronsthat hold memories. (Interestingly , the study found the benefit disappeared if the subjects over-exercised \u2014so work out, but don 't be a motormouse about it.) Tricks. Remember \"Every Good Boy Deserves Favor,\" the acrostic taught in music class to help you recall the notes of the treble clef? Such mnemonicdevices can often help fix an otherwise elusivesequence in your mind. With a little imagination you can create your own. Say , for example, you're going south along a certain stretch of the shore. The sentence \"Sunshine Brings Lovely Beach Days A t All Points\" could help you recall the towns you 'll pass in order: Sea Bright, Long Branch, Deal, Allenhurst and Asbury P ark. Association. It can help to associate what you're trying to remember with a visual hint. \"Sometimes the more absurd it is, the more lik ely you 'll remem - ber it,\" says Dr . Herman. \"For example, you might recall the name of a Mr. Underwood by pictur- ing him in his underwear .\" Interest. Face it: W e remember best what we care about. T o recall something, cul- tivate an interest in it. Memory of names and inci-dents usually involves the temporal lobes of the brain,but if we have an emotional response\u2014say , to that attractive member of the opposite se x who said hi in the elevator\u2014another part of the brain, the limbic system, comes into play , improving our recollection. Nutrition. Alas, the herbal extract ginkgo biloba, long thought by some to have memory -enhancing properties, flunk ed when it was put to the test recently in a randomized study of 219 healthy elderly people. But the jury is still out, says Dr . Herman, on whether vitamin E is a memory-booster. Some research sug- gests that it is, because it contains antio xidants, which may protect the brain against damage from freeradicals, groups of atoms with unpaired electrons. Meanwhile, scientists know that a balanced diet rich in things like fresh fruit and raw carrots\u2014along with such sources of V itamin B12 as fish, meat, milk, eggs and fortified breakfast cereals\u2014can help provide thebasis in physical health for a strong memory.

Putthese two trends together and you've got a big pub-lic-health challenge: How do you help the burgeon - ing cadre of seniors stay active and independent as long as possible? Technology , experts say, will be part of the answer. T oday's engineers are trying to help\u2014andnot just for altruistic rea - sons. Residential care iscostly , and by 2025 seniors will account for two-thirds of the nation's health care budget. There's big money to be saved by finding ways to help them stay healthyand independent longer .

Choose your baby 's name. Sounds obvious, doesn 't it? A surpris - ingly large number of parents have the nursery all painted, but can 't decide on a name. \"Many people wait to see the baby ,\" says Silk . \"They say, 'W ell, I was thinking of Amanda, but now that I look at her , she's a Jane.'\" Remember , though, that you only have about 48 hours to consult visiting grandparents, neighbors and friends about the idealmonik er. It's best to choose a name while you 're still in the hospital, because an electronic birth certificate is downloaded from the hospital to the state's records. If the baby goes home nameless, the parents must write to the state and pay a $25 to $50 fee later on torecord the child's name correctly . 4. Install your car seat in advance\u2014and get help ifIf you and your spouse are about to become parents, you 're getting advice from all sides. But hospital obstetrical nurses say it 's amazing how many new moms and dads nevertheless get thrown for a loop by some aspect of childbirth. So follow these suggestions beforehand: 1. Keep an open mind about pain medication. A first-time mother may be in labor from 12 to 18hours. That's one reason why OB nurses suggest awoman not dismiss out of hand the possibility of anepidural block\u2014an injection of pain medication in the spine. While breathing e xercises and concentra- tion techniques work for some, others need help controlling the pain. And because everyone per-ceives pain differently and every birth is different,even for the same mother , no one can judge anoth- er's decisions on this matter. \" At any time during labor when you just can't handle the contractions anymore and you need anepidural, go for it,\" says Mary P at Silk, clinical director of labor , delivery and antepartum at Monmouth Medical Center . \" And don't beat yourself up about it.\" 2. Take a childbirth course. Many couples think they must be committed to an all-natural birth in order to tak e a childbirth preparation class, but in fact, says Silk , \"everybody should have one.\" The classes offer useful information about hospital facili- ties and procedures, visiting hours and policies and many other pertinent things. Familiarity creates comfort, and such a course will mak e you more at ease with labor and delivery when the momentcomes. Y ou'll find out how electronic fetal monitor- ing tracks your baby 's heart rate before birth, and you'll pick up a bit of the lingo. Y ou may learn, for example, that \"zero station\" means the baby's head has reached the tightest part of the pelvis and thatsurfactant is a medication given to help an infant's BRYAN LEISTERLinkHEALTH you need it. Everyone knows they 'll need a car seat to carry their infant in the car . But too many families fail to buy the correct kind or to install it in the correct rear -facing position. Have your car seat purchased and ready days before your baby is e xpected. Check the package labeling care- fully to confirm that it is appropriate for infants, andmake sure you install the seat properly. If you're uncertain how to do this\u2014and studies show that most car seats aren't put in right\u2014contact your local police. They offer either Saturday -morning classes in car -seat safety or instruction from an offi - cer specially trained on the subject. MGIVING BIRTH what new parents wish they'd known Having a baby? Be sure to heed these four simple tips. Ease labor pains\u2014without delay There's nothing noble about hurting, and now new evidence suggests that women can get faster relief from labor pains. In the past, doctors sometimes heldoff using an epidural block early in labor for fear it would slow the dilation of the cervix. But such delays aren't necessary, researchers conclude in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology . Records from an army medical center gave them the chance to study two groups of women with uncomplicated pregnancies delivering single babies\u2014one group that didn't get early epidurals and another that did. They found that the blocks slowed dilation only from 4 centimeters to 5, with no significant difference in the rest of active labor, and that they did not significantly increase the risk of complications. personal takeRight after your child is born, you'll hear about his or her Apgar scor e. Developed by obstetric anesthesiologist V irginia Apgar in the early 1950s, the score is a quick summar y measure of an infant's health, usually taken at one minute and five minutes following bir th. Your newborn will be rated 0, 1 or 2 for each of five criteria:muscle tone, hear t rate, r eflex ir ri- tability , skin color and br eathing (sometimes r endered, for reasons you can guess, as Activity , Pulse, Grimace, Appearance and Respiration). For example, a2 in the color categor y means a baby is fr ee from paleness or bluishness down to the fin-gertips\u2014a fairly rare status in life's first minute. The total of the five ratings is the Apgar scor e. A scor e of 7 to 10 is usually consider ed healthy , and the five-minute Apgar generally shows impr ovement over the one-minute total. But even a low Apgar score doesn't necessarily mean your baby is unhealthy or abnormal, and the score is not a reliable indicator of conditions like cerebral palsy. Also, you should know that doctors and nurses don' t wait for scor es or arbitrar y time milestones to inter vene\u2014giving oxygen, for instance\u2014if a baby shows breathing or circulatory problems. Alas, there's no known correlation between Apgar numbers and scor es on the SA Ts.A measure of how your baby thrives 60 / October ~November 2004gency or a consultation with a new doctor , you can avoid possibly dangerous drug interactions. Immunizations. It may be too much to e xpect a child to carry index cards. But your home records should list kids' immunizations with dates. Y ou never know when a school or camp may need this information. Diagnoses. Keep records on any chronic conditions. Allergies. It's important to maintain records showing any medications you 're allergic to. If you move or change physicians, you don 't want to be telling your new doctor , \"I was given something that made me break out in a rash, but I can't remember what it was.\" Surgeries. \"Y ou should obtain a copy of the operative report if you have had a surgical procedure,\" saysDavid Gonzalez, Monmouth's director of health infor-mation management services. \" And if a specimen was removed, it is a good idea to get a copy of the pathol- ogy report.\" After any hospitalization, you may wish to retain what is called a hospital abstract\u2014a record that includes your medical history and physical examresults, discharge summary , operative reports and any laboratory, radiology and pathology reports. New Jersey law requires that hospital records on adults be kept for seven years and those on chil- dren be retained until they turn 23. Records are for-warded free to another doctor or hospital, but if you order them for yourself, there is a fee to offset storage, retrieval and reproduction expenses. Maintaining your own medical records is more than a precaution. It also embodies your own role asan active participant in your medical care. \"These days, patients are empowered as part of the team,\" says Dr. Burkett. \"It's a collaborative effort.\" MPatients sometimes think of their medical records as secrets cloak ed in mystery . The fact is that you have a right to obtain copies of your medical records that your physician keeps on file. It's also a good idea to keep copies of some records yourself . In an emer - gency , basic medical information about you might be needed at a time when your doctor's office is closed. \"Copies of your entire medical chart are proba- bly of limited use,\" says Eric N . Burk ett, M .D., vice president of medical affairs at Monmouth Medical Center . \"But it's good to have ready access to key records, say, from a recent hospital stay\u2014such as lab results, imaging studies and consultative reports.\" In your home, you 'll want to store these records in a consistent place you can easily remember. Keep films of X-rays, mammograms and MRIs, as well as blood-test results showing cholesterol levels so you can track your progress in improving these numbers. Even more important is to carry on your person in a handy form\u2014say, on index cards\u2014vital healthcare facts written concisely , in case of emergency . The need for a personal medical record is keenest for people with diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure or other chronic conditions. Patients with diabetes, for example, should monitor their hemoglobinA1c and blood-sugar levels and have those data avail- able at all times. But we can all use a personal med- ical record. It should identify you, your physician and health insurer and a friend or relative to contact in an emergency. It should also include five other items. T orecall them, think of the acronym MIDAS: Medications. Keep a list of all the prescription medi- cines you're currently taking. That way, in an emer-KEEPING THE FACTS AT HAND what medical records should you keep? (hint: think of a "}
