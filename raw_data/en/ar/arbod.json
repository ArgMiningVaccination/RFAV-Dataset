It was held online. The participants had very briefly presented their challenges and recommendations in facilitating vaccination of children. The video will be available soon. Key challenges - After second wave, the narrative that spread was that the third wave would affect children a lot. So when omicron is spreading, many have asked children not to go out. So no one wants to go out even for vaccination fearing exposure. 2. Lack of Awareness is the key. Absence of Dialoguing is the key. Government notifications are one-way conversation. Local administration is not yet meeting families and children. 3. For persons with disability, and elderly, the vaccination centres are not friendly. They are asked to wait for a long time. And crowds are hard to control. Often there is not even water to drink. So no one would like to take children with disability to the centres 4. Supply is still a key thing. Lack of coordination amongst local, district and state administration on demand and supply. 5. Consent letter from parents is a challenge. Many adults have taken vaccine because of its link to Schemes especially MNREGA or the fear of linking. They do not want to consent for their children. Especially when consent letter makes parents responsible for if anything happens to child. 6. The fear of linking vaccination to their ability to bear children is very key for girl children. The myth is very much prevalent and need to be addressed. Adults take risk for themselves but not for there unmarried children. 7. The need for ID card is a challenge, especially among homeless and DNT communities. 8. The need for phone numbers, especially in some places where one mobile phone is used by three to four huts ; or even many adults have migrated with the phones. 9. Linking to schemes was considered as important incentive because then families feel that vaccination is \"useful\" not for health reasons but for preventing certain deprivation. There was also a point that some of the schemes are very basic rights of people; and it should not happen that this lead to their deprivation of livelihood rights. Key recommendations - There needs a mass campaign to say that Omicron is not unusually harming children.; it is not exclusively child-targeting virus. 2. The local administration should ensure that it has door-to-door campaign at these hard to reach areas; and tell the parents that they are in solidarity with the responsibility if any harm happens to child owing to vaccination. Consent letter is an important means to facilitate dialogue; this is not to make families fear vaccination. 3. Linking to Government schemes is unfortunate, instead use those scheme duty-bearers to dialogue with families. 4. Create a separate temporary card for those who do not have adhar or any identity card. Let that card be issued by vaccination centre authority, who could even photograph the person for identification. 5. Awareness activities especially through local drama or WhatsApp based videos; especially focussing on Consent letter; on Menstruation; on Child bearing capacity. 6. Centre should have facilities for disability affected persons. 7. Government should train and sensitise the local health workers immediately on vaccination for children. It could be online training. Urgently needed. 8. Government should recruit volunteers at hamlet level especially hamlets with SC, ST, minorities, with honorarium and alll protective systems to encourage them to make door to door visits. "}
