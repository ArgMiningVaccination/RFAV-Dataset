Myths and Facts about COVID-19 Vaccines Below are myths and facts about COVID-19 vaccination. Bust Common Myths and Learn the Facts MYTH: COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States shed or release their components. None of the vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. contain a live virus. mRNA and viral vector vaccines are the two types of currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines available. Learn more about mRNA and viral vector COVID-19 vaccines. MYTH: Getting a COVID-19 vaccine will cause me to test positive on a viral test. [FACT: None of the authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines can cause you to test positive on ] [viral tests](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html), which are used to see if you have a current infection. If your body develops an immune response to vaccination, which is the goal, you may test positive on some [antibody tests](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html). Antibody tests indicate you had a previous infection and that you may have some level of protection against the virus. Learn more about [the possibility of COVID-19 illness after vaccination](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/how-cdc-monitors.html). MYTH: The ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous. Exact vaccine ingredients vary by manufacturer. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines also contain messenger RNA (mRNA) and the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine contains a harmless version of a virus unrelated to the virus that causes COVID-19. The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine includes harmless pieces (proteins) of the virus that causes COVID-19; they are pieces of what is often called the \"spike protein.\" These give instructions to cells in your body to create an immune response. This response helps protect you from getting sick with COVID-19 in the future. After the body produces an immune response, it discards all the vaccine ingredients just as it would discard any information that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning. COVID-19 vaccines do NOT contain ingredients like preservatives, tissues (like aborted fetal cells), antibiotics, food proteins, medicines, latex, or metals. Learn more about what ingredients are and are not in [Pfizer-BioNTech](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html#ingredients), [Moderna](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Moderna.html#ingredients), [Novavax](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/novavax.html#ingredients), or [Johnson & Johnson/Janssen](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Janssen.html#ingredients) COVID-19 vaccines. MYTH: The natural immunity I get from being sick with COVID-19 is better than the immunity I get from COVID-19 vaccination. COVID-19 vaccination causes a more predictable immune response than infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine gives most people a high level of protection against COVID-19 and can provide [added protection for people who already had COVID-19](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/vaccine-induced-immunity.html#anchor_1635540493225). [One study](/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm?s_cid=mm7032e1_w) showed that, for people who already had COVID-19, those who do not get vaccinated after their recovery are more than 2 times as likely to get COVID-19 again than those who get fully vaccinated after their recovery. All [COVID-19 vaccines ](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html#vaccine-table) currently available in the United States are [effective](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/how-cdc-monitors.html) at preventing COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can offer some protection from future illness, sometimes called \"natural immunity,\" but the [level of protection](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/vaccine-induced-immunity.html#anchor_1635539961239) people get from having COVID-19 may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age. Getting a COVID-19 vaccination is also [a safer way to build protection](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html) than getting sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without you having to experience sickness. Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can cause severe illness or death, and we can't reliably predict who will have mild or severe illness. If you get sick, you can spread COVID-19 to others. You can also continue to [have long-term health issues after COVID-19 infection](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html). Learn about why you should [get vaccinated even if you already had COVID-19](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect.html). MYTH: COVID-19 vaccines cause variants. New variants of a virus happen because the virus that causes COVID-19 constantly changes through a natural ongoing process of mutation (change). As the virus spreads, it has more opportunities to change. High vaccination coverage in a population reduces the spread of the virus and helps prevent new variants from emerging. CDC recommends everyone stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines for their age group: Learn more about [variants](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/). MYTH: All events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) are caused by vaccination. Some VAERS reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Vaccine safety experts study these adverse events and look for unusually high numbers of health problems, or a pattern of problems, after people receive a particular vaccine. Recently, the number of deaths reported to VAERS following COVID-19 vaccination has been misinterpreted and misreported as if this number means deaths that were proven to be caused by vaccination. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. Learn more about [VAERS](/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html). MYTH: The mRNA vaccine is not considered a vaccine. This type of vaccine is new, but research and development on it has been underway for decades. The mRNA vaccines do not contain any live virus. Instead, they work by teaching our cells to make a harmless piece of a \"spike protein,\" which is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. After making the protein piece, cells display it on their surface. Our immune system then recognizes that it does not belong there and responds to get rid of it. When an immune response begins, antibodies are produced, creating the same response that happens in a natural infection. In contrast to mRNA vaccines, many other vaccines use a piece of, or weakened version of, the germ that the vaccine protects against. This is how the measles and flu vaccines work. When a weakened or small part of the virus is introduced to your body, you make antibodies to help protect against future infection. Learn more about how mRNA COVID-19 vaccines work. MYTH: COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips. Vaccines work by stimulating your immune system to produce antibodies, exactly like it would if you were exposed to the disease. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. Learn more about the [ingredients](/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html#Appendix-C) in the COVID-19 vaccinations authorized for use in the United States. MYTH: Receiving a COVID-19 vaccine can make you magnetic. COVID-19 vaccines do not contain ingredients that can produce an electromagnetic field at the site of your injection. All COVID-19 vaccines are free from metals. Learn more about the [ingredients](/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html#Appendix-C) in the COVID-19 vaccinations authorized for use in the United States. MYTH: COVID-19 vaccines can alter my DNA. Both messenger RNA (mRNA) and viral vector COVID-19 vaccines work by delivering instructions (genetic material) to our cells to start building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. After the body produces an immune response, it discards all the vaccine ingredients just as it would discard any information that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning. The genetic material delivered by mRNA vaccines never enters the nucleus of your cells, which is where your DNA is kept. Viral vector COVID-19 vaccines deliver genetic material to the cell nucleus to allow our cells to build protection against COVID-19. However, the vector virus does not have the machinery needed to integrate its genetic material into our DNA, so it cannot alter our DNA. Learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work. MYTH: A COVID-19 vaccine can make me sick with COVID-19. [FACT: Because none of the authorized ] [COVID-19 vaccines in the United States](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html#vaccine-table) contain the live virus that causes COVID-19, the vaccine cannot make you sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Sometimes this process can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal and are signs that the body is building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. Learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work. Accurate vaccine information is critical and can help stop common myths and rumors. It can be difficult to know which sources of information you can trust.

Other Myths and Facts FACT: Currently no evidence shows that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause fertility problems (problems trying to get pregnant) in women or men. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for people who are pregnant, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future, as well as their partners.
