The artisan distilling industry in Michigan is poised to undergo signicant expansion in the next few years resulting in positive economic impact for the state. Challenges for the entrepreneurs entering this business are access to technological expertise and facilities to develop and market products. An additional complication of the distilled spirits industry lies in the regulations governing it. Unlike beer and wine, there is no minimum amount of spirits that can be produced without Federal and State licenses. Furthermore, it is required to have constructed an operational distillery in order to apply for a Federal license. These regulations place the potential new producer in the position that in order to attract investment it is necessary to produce products and show their market value, but to do so,it is necessary to have the investment in a plant to get a license. We work to break this cycle by assisting new entrepreneurs in development and marketing of their spirits in order to attract the required investment for construction of their own facility. Upgrading forest byproducts. Xylose derived from hemicellulose is a low-cost source of substrate for butyric acid fermentation given that extraction could be integrated into current industrial pulp and paper processes yielding hemicellulosic sugars for the fermentation while retaining the properties of the cellulose fraction to be used in the subsequent pulp production. One of the main issues concerning such an integration is that hydrolysis of hardwood hemicellulose releases not only xylose but also acetic acid (up to 40 g/L), a microbial inhibitor. To achieve biologically conversion of xylose to butyric acid, the inhibiting acetic acid must either be removed from the extraction broth or the fermentation strain adapted to tolerate such high levels. This study focuses on the impact of high levels of acetic acid on C. tyrobutyricum fermentation growth kinetics and product yields in order to establish a process with extracted xylose as a substrate without requiring the removal of the toxic acetic acid from the broth. nrecent publications N.

Combined with other experimental and analytical tools, such as 3D x-ray diff raction, new insights on formability and damage nucleation mechanisms are found. This will enable development of optimal material processing strategies to gain more predictable and reliable properties. Three examples follow. Damage nucleation in titanium and titanium alloys. Figure 1 shows computational deformation of a bicrystal that is oriented to enable slip transfer from a prism slip system (blue grain) that is perfectly aligned with a pyramidal slip system (red grain). While uniaxial tension is applied to the bicrystal, the restrictions of the anisotropic slip systems causes the stress state to deviate signifi cantly from uniaxial tension. The left grain sees a stress state closer to uniaxial tesion and the right crystal is closer to biaxial tension. Normal crystal plasticity models allow slip transfer across grain boundaries by all slip systems. When slip is restricted on all except the one that is well-aligned, the magnitude of the stress is actually reduced (color scale on the right) and the shape of the stress tensor changes (glyphs). This provides evidence that more physically realistic deformation at grain boundaries can be installed into larger scale simulations. Microstructural evolution during thermo-mechanical cycling in lead-free solder joints. Accelerated thermal cycling is often done on prototype electronic systems to identify weak links. This causes signifi cant microstructural evolution in solder joints, which leads to cracking and eventual failure. The failure mechanisms were identifi ed using OIM and DAXM measurements illustrated in Figure 2. Clockwise from the top, two cross sections of thermally cycled solder joints show that they originally solidifi ed as single crystals, but after thermal cycling recrystallization took place near the interface with the package on top. The 'red' oriented joint is examined in greater detail, showing the developing crack. The region surrounding the crack has various recrystallized grain orientations (diff erent colors), and surrounding red orientations are separated by low-angle grain boundaries (LAGB). The gold area in the local average misorientation (LAM) map shows higher degree of crystal perfection in recrystallized grains. A subsurface DAXM scan shows internal strains built up along the LAGBs, which attracts the migration of recrystallized grain boundaries. Thus the mechanism for crack growth is identifi ed: (1) Anisotropic thermal expansion of Sn causes diff erent stress states in every joint, LAGB develop within crystals by a continuous figure 1.

Figure 3 illustrates how preferential magnetic fl ux penetration (red arrow) occurs along low angle grain boundaries, and may result from hydride precipitates that form during cooling. Hydrides leave scars when they dissolve upon reheating to room temperature. The hydride scars are misoriented by as much as 10\u00b0 from the surrounding material, indicating that signifi cant local straining occurred, leaving signifi cant dislocations behind. Hydrogen is attracted to defects, so hydrides are markers of where dislocations are found. The relationship between dislocations, low-angle and high-angle boundaries is being examined to determine how their presence can be minimized by the time the cavity is formed. figure 2.

Shaw Lane, Room 3529 nresearch interests ncurrent research The research group of Professor Carl Boehlert is concentrating on understanding the deformation behavior of hexagonal close packed metals, in particular titanium and magnesium alloys, under extreme environments. The environments include a combination of both elevated temperatures and irradiation, and a variety of loading conditions are being used to mimic component use in commercial applications. In situ testing methods have been developed which allow for characterizing the surface deformation behavior during deformation in order to understand the deformation evolution. The work is being sponsored by the NSF and the DOE and a Michigan State University Strategic Partnerships Grant. More recently, Boehlert's group is working on understanding severe plastic deformation processing eff ects on nanostructured zinc magnesium alloys targeted for biomedical implant applications. Below is a brief description of a recent research project performed in Boehlert's group. In situ electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) heating experiments are typically performed to enable the understanding of phase transformations and/or recrystallization behavior as a function of temperature and time. Such experiments have been used to study the microstructural evolution and recrystallization in aluminum, copper, titanium, and steel. Similar studies help explain the microstructural evolution in wrought magnesium (Mg) alloys, in which the crystallographic texture has signifi cant infl uence on the anisotropy in mechanical properties. Rare earth (RE) containing Mg alloys form weaker textures during wrought processing (and subsequent annealing) than conventional Mg alloys. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this texture development in Mg alloys during annealing are not well understood. Therefore, an in situ annealing technique combined with EBSD was developed in order to characterize the microstructural evolution as a function of temperature in a RE-containing Mg alloy, Mg-2Zn-0.2Ce (wt%) (ZE20). The ZE20 alloy studied features a measured composition of Mg-1.9Zn-0.2Ce (wt%). Samples were mechanically polished using silicon carbide grinding papers. To further improve sample surface quality for EBSD, specimens were electropolished using a solution of 30% nitric acid and 70% methanol as an electrolyte and a Struers TenuPol-5 double jet system. Figure 1 shows the experimental setup used for the in situ heating experiments. An EBSD orientation map of a ~100 \u00d7 100 m microstructural patch was initially acquired at 298 K using EDAX TSL OIM Data Collection v6.1 software. The specimen was heated to a target temperature (423 K) and held for ~15 minutes to stabilize the temperature. An EBSD map of the same microstructural patch was then acquired while the sample was held at 423 K. The heating and subsequent EBSD mapping cycle was then continued up to a desired temperature. EBSD maps were acquired at 298 K, 423 K, and at 473 to 598 K with 25\u00b0 increments. Figure 2 shows the EBSD inverse pole fi gure (IPF) map, corresponding texture in the form of {0001} pole fi gures (along the normal direction of the sample), and the grain orientation spread map of the same microstructural patch depicting the microstructure evolution as a function of annealing temperature. During the heating process, new grains appeared during the heating step from 473 to 498 K (Fig. 2). As expected, with new grain formation, the texture intensity in the figure 1. Heating stage used for in situ heating experiments. The sample (not shown) was placed directly on top of the heating element during the experiments.department of chemical engineering & materials science | 5microstructural patches decreased (Fig. 2). However, texture intensity increased slightly during the fi nal heating steps, which included temperatures above 548 K. This was expected to be due to grain growth, where therefore fewer grains were present in the given microstructural patch analyzed. The orientation spread within the grains was less than 1.5\u00b0 in the area analyzed after the 548-573 K heating step, suggesting that the grains were relatively free of strain accumulated during rolling. At 573 K, a completely recrystallized microstructure was observed. nrecent publications H. Liu, M. Niinomi, M. Nakai, X. Cong, K. Cho, C.J.

Electrospinning is a well-established, industrial-scale process producing carbon bers with diameters ranging from 100 nm to over 1 micron and can be engineered with a range of structural, morphological, and surface properties for engineering and control of advanced porous electrodes (Figure 4).

This has broad implications on a number of diseases, since UPR is known to be activated in cancers, viral infection and many other diseases. figure 1.

The group works on a range of interdisciplinary projects that deal with diff raction based imaging approaches, based on both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). While the core research programs in this group deal with advancing the understanding of deformation and fracture in structural metals, collaborative studies have included magnetic multilayer structures, carbon nanotubes, ceramic joining, oxygen sensors, and cholesterol. Characterization of deformation structures using scanning electron microscopy (with H. Mansour, J. Guyon, N. Gey, and N. Malou). Enhancing the performance of metals and alloys used in structural applications requires an understanding of the mechanisms that lead to strength, toughness, and in particular, damage nucleation that leads to failure. For many years these mechanisms have been characterized using TEM, but this approach is limited by the need to use very thin samples with small elds of views. Here at MSU we have been at the forefront in the development of SEM approaches that allow the direct imaging and crystallographic characterization of deformation structures in the near surface regions of bulk samples using electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) (Figure 1). Critical to these studies is the ability to determine crystal orientation with high accuracy (with 0.1\u00b0). While many crystallographic studies in SEM are carried out using EBSD (and we do use this approach extensively), it does not meet the stringent requirements for imaging deformation structures. Rather, selected area channeling patterns (SACPs), historically with spatial resolutions in the range of 10-20 m, are required for setting up imaging conditions. We have developed a new approach for collecting high resolution SACPs, with spatial resolutions better than 0.5 m (Figure 2). While facilitating characterization of deformation structures in ne grain materials, this approach also allows highly accurate misorientation measurements across grain boundaries figure 1 ( left).

Combined with analysis of ECCI image characteristics, this high accuracy technique allows determination of both geometrically necessary and statistically stored dislocations (GNDs and SSDs) in deformed structures. Characterization and modeling of anisotropic deformation in polycrystals (with T. Bieler, C. Boehlert, P. Eisenlohr, and C. Zambaldi). While the mechanisms associated with plastic deformation of single crystals are very well established, the manner in which these mechanisms facilitate the shape changes needed to simultaneously deform the various grains in a polycrystal are not well understood. If diff erent grains cannot mutually accommodate imposed strain, performance-limiting nucleation of void/cracks may develop. This research program is using EBSD and ECCI in combination with plastic deformation simulations to characterize polycrystalline deformation and damage nucleation. We carry out nanoindentation experiments and complementary simulations to (1) determine the critical parameters for simulating plastic deformation in single crystals and (2) quantify how grain boundaries limit the strain transfer from one grain to the next. Figure 3 shows an EBSD orientation map with a series of nanoindentations, along with, along with atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography maps of nanoindentation taken close to and far from a grain boundary. The topography of the indentations is truncated by the boundary, indicating the boundary resists the transfer of strain from one grain to the other. Figure 4 shows a series of simulated nanoindentation topographies in comparison with the experimentally measured topography. As the resistance to slip of the grain boundary increases from a from single crystal slip resistance of o = 1.0 to o = 2.0, the topography in the receiving grain decreases and more accurately reflects the experimentally measured topography. The grain boundary slip parameters are found to change for diff erent classes of grain boundaries. These results are being incorporated in to plasticity simulations of polycrystalline arrays to evaluate if the experimentally measured strains can be accurately matched. ECCI has been used to image the dislocation structures around nanoindents, and compared to GNDs mapped using cross-correlation EBSD, the rst time such studies have been carried out. figure 5.

The U.S. Congress passed the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) seven years ago. Since then, biofuels have gone from darling to scapegoat for many environmentalists, policy makers, and the general public. The reasons for this shift are complex and include concerns about environmental degradation, uncertainties about impact on food security, new access to fossil fuels, and overly optimistic timetables. As a result, many people have written off biofuels. However, numerous studies indicate that biofuels, if managed sustainably, can help solve pressing environmental, social, and economic problems (Figure 1). The scientic and policy communities as well as the general public should take a closer look by reviewing the key assumptions underlying opposition to biofuels and carefully consider the probable alternatives. Liquid fuels based on fossil raw materials are likely to come at increasing environmental cost. Sustainable futures require energy conservation, increased efciency, and alternatives to fossil fuels, including biofuels. Access to high-quality energy sources is strongly linked to prosperity and human well-being. Economies benet when they produce biofuels, a dynamic observed in both developed and developing nations. Indigenous biofuel production increases energy security. Producing perennial biofuel feedstocks can improve water and soil quality, biodiversity, and wildlife habitat compared to landscapes dominated by annual crops. Biofuels can also enhance rural employment and food security. Because photosynthesis consumes CO 2 and because perennial crops can accumulate soil carbon, biofuel production and utilization can be carbon neutral and even reduce net atmospheric CO 2. Thus, low-carbon energy scenarios developed by diverse organizations foresee widespread use of biomass for energy (Figure 2). Biomass provides an average of 138 exajoules of primary energy across these ve scenarios, or about one-quarter of total global primary energy. These scenarios use biomass primarily to satisfy energy needs that likely cannot be met by other renewables. For example, aviation and ocean shipping require liquid fuels and liquid fuels are strongly preferred for long-haul trucking. Biofuels are only one part of a sustainable energy portfolio, but it is highly unlikely that we can achieve a sustainable transportation sector without biofuels. Many materials used by society can be recycled, but fossil fuels cannot. Economic activities based on massive fossil fuel consumption are therefore inherently unsustainable. Extracting and using oil, natural gas, and coal exposes humankind to air and water pollution and to escalating climate challenges. Thus, both economic self-interest and ethical considerations require that we develop sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, including biofuels. Progress toward more sustainable energy sources requires continual improvement in meeting current energy needs while preserving options for the future. For example, biofuels should be integrated with sustainable agriculture and forestry systems. Managing such systems requires ongoing assessment to identify better options. The complete system (feedstock production, logistics, conversion technologies, energy types, coproducts, transport and delivery systems, and engine or power technology) must be compared to alternatives, including fossil fuels.

(doi:10.1093/jxb/erv107)and evaluating sustainability attributes is critical. Stakeholders determine baseline comparisons, consequential eff ects and how tradeoff s, synergies, and targets evolve. Following this approach, a broadly endorsed \"win-win\" role for perennial biomass crops was recently established in the United Kingdom. Biofuels are relevant as the U.S. and other nations develop energy and climate policies. More sustainable biofuel production pathways today allow society to better meet tomorrow's climate and energy goals. Economic and geopolitical concerns are strongly influenced by energy resources. A nation that develops renewable energy options is stronger and more resilient over the long-term. Sustainably deployed biofuels can contribute to solving challenging problems, including food and energy security, climate change and environmental degradation caused by current agricultural and forestry practices. While the desirable outcomes of sustainable biofuel production and use are not guaranteed, they are certainly achievable. In contrast, it is very difcult to see how continued massive reliance on liquid fuels from fossil materials can achieve positive environmental outcomes, especially higher carbon options such as oil sands, deep water drilling, natural gas-to-liquids and coal conversion. Thus, biofuels deserve a closer look. Sustainably deployed biofuels help can help society achieve many \"win-wins\" by supporting important environmental, economic, and social goals.

In our daily life, we heavily rely on the mechanical capacity and integrity of many diff erent materials. For most structural materials of technological relevance, the mechanical behavior is intricately infl uenced by their chemistry (alloying in the case of metals) but even more importantly by their microstructure. The latter is strongly impacted by processing conditions and, hence, can be substantially manipulated through processing. This complexity makes the prediction of the (thermo-) mechanical behavior of existing materials and the design of new materials and their required microstructures for targeted properties a remarkable challenge that is addressed at the Computational Materials Mechanics (CMM) lab by Eisenlohr and his group. We tap into the resources off ered by the High Performance Computing Center (HPCC) and the Division of Engineering Computing Services (DECS) to simulate material deformation with commercial and homemade open-source so ware. In our simulations, we investigate the mechanisms of deformation occurring at mesoscopic scales and connect them to the material microstructure. By this we seek, for instance, to (1) understand basic aspects of plastic deformation in crystals, (2) identify critical confi gurations in polycrystals or multiphase materials that might trigger nucleation of internal damage, and (3) predict the inherently anisotropic behavior of structural materials with complex microstructure at the scale of engineering components. As an overarching theme, we seek to advance the forward modeling and associated simulation methodologies necessary to understand the properties of materials with (complex) microstructure and by that facilitate the solution of the inverse problem posed by the search for a microstructure that meets a given property demand. Examples for ongoing research are: Relevance of grain neighborhood on polycrystalline plasticity. The mechanical response of multiphase metallic materials is governed by the strain and stress partitioning behavior among their phases, crystals, and subgrains. Despite knowledge about the existence of these complex and long-ranging interactions, the experimental characterization of such materials is often limited to surface observations of microstructure evolution and strain partitioning, i.e., ignoring the infl uence of the underlying features. Hence, for the interpretation of the observed surface behavior it is imperative to understand how it might be infl uenced by the subsurface microstructure. We therefore systematically varied the subsurface microstructure of synthetic dual-phase polycrystals and investigated the altered response of a 2D region of interest. The series of high-resolution crystal plasticity simulations are conducted with a fast and effi cient spectral-based iterative scheme for calculating the mechanical response of complex crystalline materials. We could show that the subsurface microstructure up to a depth of about 3 to 4 grains has a dominant infl uence on the observed stress and strain partitioning. Furthermore, this zone of infl uence increases with increasing heterogeneity of the microstructure. This indicates that, especially for complex microstructures, surface observations are hard to interpret at the scale of individual grains when the underlying microstructure (particularly the phase distribution) is not known. Systematic identifi cation of constitutive parameters for crystal plasticity models of non-cubic metal alloys. The integration of computational modeling into process development and design continues to accelerate due the potential shortened development times, cost savings, and enhanced reliability. At the fundamental level, the controlling factors in the mechanical behavior of structural metals are the resistance of dislocations to slip, i.e., the critical resolved shear stress department of chemical engineering & materials science | 19 nrecent publications W.

Thus, in order to accurately describe the deformation, possible damage nucleation, and fracture behavior of the polycrystalline arrays that make up structural components, it is necessary to have a sound model with physical deformation processes involved and accurate values for the adjustable parameters that enter such models. Determining these constitutive parameters is quite challenging for technologically relevant materials of low crystal symmetry, such as Mg-alloys, Ti-alloys, or lead-free solders based on Sn. We are presently investigating a newly developed approach to determine parameters of the constitutive description in a relatively rapid and cost eff ective manner by cono-spherical nano-indentation into a suffi ciently large number of diff erent crystal orientations at the surface of polycrystalline samples. Atomic force microscopy is then used to measure the topography around these indents, which is a strong function of the crystal orientation and the specifi c local activity of diff erent slip systems. Crystal plasticity fi nite element simulation of the indentation process is then carried out with varying constitutive parameters until an optimal match is achieved between the measured and simulated topographies in several diff erent indents on crystals with diff ective spherical indentation geometry causes erent slip operate at diff erent rates and along diff erent strain paths depending on the material location beneath the indent. figure.

The long-term sustainability of human civilization will require non-fossil sources of both energy and carbon in the future as well as the technologies for their eff ective capture, storage, and conversion. Non-food plant biomass off ers an immense reservoir of reduced carbon, which is primarily comprised of the biopolymers contained in the cell walls of plants. The higher order structures of plant cell walls prevent utilization of these carbohydrates due to the \"recalcitrance\" of lignocellulose, and it is noteworthy that this vast resource of reduced carbon is overwhelming used for its existing structural value (as ber and as a construction material) or for combustion rather than for the value of its chemical constituents. Increasing adoption of technologies for the production of biobased fuels, chemicals, and materials utilizing plant feedstocks off er one compelling route to achieve these sustainability needs through the capture and redirection of energy and carbon within the carbon cycle. While these products are beginning to enter the market, much of the promise of these technologies has failed to materialize due to commercialization barriers that are both technological and economic. As such, there is a substantial unmet need for both fundamental and applied research in order to achieve these breakthroughs. Our research at Michigan State University has been focused on addressing fundamental and applied problems associated with the conversion of plant-derived biomass to renewable bioproducts through integrated biochemical and chemical catalytic conversion routes (Figure 1). Unlike the petrochemical rening industry, where processes are designed around feedstock properties, plants can be bred or engineered with phenotypes that are tailored for a desired conversion process. Plants have been bred for millennia to achieve desired phenotypes as food crops, however, research into developing plants with cell walls properties optimized for targeted conversion processes is only beginning and represents an ideal opportunity for collaboration between chemical engineers and plant biologists. The higher order structure of plant cell walls strongly impacts their response to \"deconstruction\" and conversion.

In nature, microbes successfully degrade plant cell walls using a variety of oxidative approaches. These strategies include the release of reactive oxygen species produced by redoxactive metals and metalloenzymes. With funding from DOE, we are investigating applying abiotic catalytic oxidative treatments that mimic certain features of these successful biological approaches (Figure 2) that include alkaline-oxidative pretreatment of biomass in the presence of a homogeneous catalyst. Another research theme is cell wall biopolymer extraction, recovery, and catalytic conversion to add value to lignocellulosic biomass conversion processes. This includes research that seeks to understand how the properties of cell wall biopolymers solubilized during alkaline pretreatments or chemical pulping processes impact their processing behavior and how this understanding can be exploited by solubility-based separations processes to extract more value from alkaline pulping or alkaline pretreatment process streams. Building on this, other work is directed at the catalytic conversion of lignins derived from biorenery and forest products industry process streams to aromatic monomers (Figure 3) as well as understanding the structural features that contribute to lignin reactivity (Figure 4).figure 4.

Recently our research eff ort has centered around Solid-state Ionic Conductors (SIC) and Solid-state Mixed Ionic and Electronic Conductors (SMIEC) as battery electrolytes/ electrodes and thermoelectric (TE) materials. SIC, SMIEC, and TE compounds are all complex materials with a framework-guest structure and unique ionic and electronic properties. The guest atoms in SIC and SMIEC are able to diff use or conduct, while the framework is insulating (SIC) or semiconducting (SMIEC) for electrons, respectively. The guest atoms in TE are rattlers while the framework is semiconducting for electrons. The complexity of these materials calls for techniques known to both crystallographers and non-crystallographers. We are applying a suite of average and local structure and dynamics probes to understand their fundamental structure-property relationships. Ongoing projects include: Structure and dynamics of lithium-stuff ed garnet oxides. State-of-the-art Li-ion batteries utilize organic solvent based liquid electrolytes that usually have limited electrochemical stability and are also volatile and fl ammable. Lithium- stuff ed garnet oxides are a new nonfl ammable solid electrolytes with high lithium ionic conductivities. The framework of the materials is composed of LaO 8 dodecahedra and TaO 6 octahedra. There are two types of cages, tetrahedral (Td) and octahedral (Oh), to host lithium ions. Each Td cage is surrounded by four Oh cages and each Oh cage is surrounded bytwo Td cages. Both the Td and Oh cages are only partially occupied. We are investigating a prototypic series of lithium-stuff ed garnet oxides Li 7-xLa3Zr2-xTaxO12 (x = 0-2).

Wire bonding is a key packaging technology to achieve the electrical and mechanical interconnections between integrated circuit and the metal frame in printed circuit board. Recently, copper (Cu) has gained popularity over gold (Au) as the wire material based on cost reduction and higher performance. Two major intermetallics (IMCs), (CuAl 2) and (Cu 9Al4), are often found in the Cu-Al bonding interface after the as-bonded structure undergoes thermal aging for extended periods of time. Galvanic corrosion for this Cu///Al metallic-intermetallic \"sandwich\" structure, may take place when dissimilar metals are brought into electrical contact in the presence of an electrolyte containing corrosive species. In the service environment, moisture absorbed by the molding compound can dissolve a small amount of halogens (Cl -, Br-) used in the synthesis of molding compound and act as the electrolyte to initiate galvanic corrosion. Several studies have reported that the mechanical failure resulted from the disappearance of and failure occurred at the wire side. The use of Pd-coated Cu wire had shown to enhanced service reliability. It was suggested that the enhanced service reliability maybe due to the nobility of Pd addition, however, no systematic electrochemical characterization has been carried out for each of the entities in Cu(Pd)-Al bonding interface, which is essential to understand corrosion behavior of Cu(Pd)-Al bonding interface. Using open circuit potentials and potentiodynamic polarization measurements systemic investigate were performed on all the undoped/Pd-doped samples (Cu, , ) in diff erent pH, Cl - concentration and temperatures to provide a complete picture of electrochemical behavior needed to understand the service reliability of wire boned electronic packages. Electrochemical characteristic of metals were examined using cathodic and anodic polarization curves. Both E corr and i corr are determined by the thermodynamics (reversible potentials: E(M/Mn+), E(O Tafel constants) of the two half-cell reactions. The addition of Pd increases the cathodic current density by increasing the exchange current density for ORR, and reduces the anodic current density by the induced passivation. This upward shift on the cathodic polarization curve, as well as the downward shift on the anodic polarization curve, led to an increase in the value of E corr. However, the change in the value of i corr depends on the relative amount of shift between cathodic and anodic polarization curves. As shown in Figure 1(a), the upward shift in the cathodic polarization curve was more than the downward shift in the anodic polarization, the value of icorr will increase, which meaning a faster rate of corrosion. This was the case when only small amounts of Pd addition in Cu. To reduce the value of i corr, it was necessary that the amount of downward shift be greater than the amount of upward shift, Figure 1(b). Therefore, a higher amount of Pd was needed to reduce the corrosion rate. figure 1. Determination of E corr and i corr of g using polarization curves.

Aluminum (Al) based casting alloys have been used as light-weighting materials in the automotive industry for decades. Further weight reduction has been introduced in the automotive body construction recently with the use of structural aluminum. However, without modication, most of Al casting alloys have poor ductility, and does not meet the structural application requirement, i.e., at least 12% elongation to failure. Although, the addition of Na or Sr can spheroidize Si cuboids, and the addition of Ti and B reduce the grain size of primary aluminum phase in Al-Si based casting alloys. However, these modications had some drawbacks needed to overcome, such as coarsening with aging as well as fading with repeated melting. Polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxanes (POSS) are silsequioxane-based nano-structural chemicals. These chemicals are cage like structures with repeated monomer units of RSiO 1.5 where Si is the element silicon, O is oxygen and R is hydrocarbon group, e.g., ethyl, isobutyl, phenyl etc. Partial cage-like POSS have the thermal stability in the molten aluminum and the silanol (Si-OH) functionalities form thermodynamically stable Si-O-M bonds with metals (e.g., Al). These nano-sized silanol compounds provide nucleation sites during solidication as grain rener, and also serve as obstacles for preventing coarsening at elevated temperatures for microstructural stability of Al alloys. A4047 and A4047 powders with and without POSS trisilanol added were used to make ingots for metallographic study. Figure 2 shows the optical micrographs of the ingots made of 325 mesh A4047 powders without and with POSS trisilanol addition, respectively. A4047 has a near-eutectic Al-Si composition with primary Al phase and eutectic Si-Al phase. Figure 2 ( left) displays the microstructure of A4047 without POSS trisilanol, which is typical from a slow-cooled ingot with Al dendrite and lamellar Si cuboids. With the addition of POSS trisilanol, under the same casting and cooling congurations, the Si platelets are broken down to very ne spheroidized phase, as shown in Figure 2 ( right ). The microstructure modication with POSS trisilanol added also leads signicant benet in the mechanical property of A4047. Tensile tests were conducted on the tensile bars machined from the ingots. It was found that the elongation to failure had increased with POSS trisilanol addition, with percentage increase from 23% to 250% over the control sample (without POSS trisilanol added). In addition, the ultimate tensile strength did not decrease with the benet of increases in the elongation to failure. Currently we are exploring diff erent approaches for produce master alloys with diff erent Si contents from hypoeutectic to hypereutectic Al-Si casting alloys. figure 2.

The Lira Research group is fascinated by characterizing these relatively common properties for pure components and mixtures, and the way the chemical structure determines these properties. When an alternative fuel is developed and blended with petroleum fuel, what are the cold flow properties? What is the eff ect on the boiling curve? When new chemicals are made from renewable feedstocks, how will they behave in a reactive distillation column? We are also interested in improving modeling of vapor-liquid-liquid equilibria that occurs frequently for bioderived molecules. Phase equilibria measurements. The Lira Thermodynamics Research Facility measures and correlates equilibria (VLE), liquid-liquid equilibria (LLE), a Fisher T-xy recirculating apparatus, a custom P-xy apparatus, and a miniature ebuilliometer. We also have capabilities for density and viscosity measurements. Our phase equilibria measurements support the MSU reactive distillation facility and were vital in development of our process development for diethyl succinate by reactive distillation. We have led a patent on a process to react the sodium succinate salt directly from the fermentation product to diethyl succinate intermediates, bypassing isolation of succinic acid.

Improved association-based models for separations in the bioeconomy. With industrial focus moving to bioderived feedstocks, the need for improved process modeling is acute; conventional models with adjustable parameters do not correlate data accurately enough for extrapolations in temperature or to new compositions. Thus, precise process design for streams with these components requires many experimental measurements and expensive, slow pilot-plant figure 1.

Improved models will greatly enhance the efciency of renewables-based process development. This project is developing improved models that include meaningful representation of hydrogen bonding of oxygen-containing molecules. Popular predictive and correlative models (UNIFAC, NRTL) do not use the correct functional form to represent hydrogen bonding. This work strives to integrate association approaches such as Wertheim's theory together with meaningful spectroscopic measurements and quantum chemical calculations to improve modeling of hydrogen-bonding system.

The Earth is continuously bathing in over one-hundred-million-billion watts of sunlight\u2014several thousand times more than mankind's energy demands. While a multifaceted approach is required to transition away from fossil fuels, solar energy will surely be key to a sustainable future.

This is accomplished by exploiting the excitonic character of molecular and organic semiconductors that leads to \"oscillator bunching\" exhibiting uniquely distinct absorption spectra from the band-absorption of traditional inorganic semiconductors. Next-generation organic light emitting diodes for lighting. An important route to the reduction of green gasses lies in energy utilization. In particular, lighting accounts for about 17% of the total energy consumption in buildings. State of the art white organic light emitting diodes (WOLEDs) are currently poised to make reductions in this consumption rate for lighting as power effi ciencies greater than that of fl uorescent lighting have been demonstrated. However, WOLEDs are currently limited by external quantum effi ciencies (EQE) of ~20% due to waveguided modes and are reliant on precious metal (Pt and Ir) containing phosphorescent dopants. To circumvent these shortcomings we are designing the next-generation devices based on phosphorescent nanostructured and abundant molecular materials. Understanding organic epitaxy. The presence of excitons in organic semiconductors at room temperature distinguish them from traditional semiconductors, providing exceptional opportunities for manipulating energy in a range of structures from light emitting diodes, lasers, transparent photovoltaics, and optical switches. However, control over crystalline order, orientation, and defect formation are crucial to the fabrication and optimization of these excitonic electronics. The overarching goal of understanding organic epitaxy is to explore bottom-up vapor-deposition routes to the growth of large-area organic and molecular crystalline fi lms with enhanced properties.michigan state university college of engineering 34 |Dennis Miller Professor millerd@egr.msu.edu | 517.353.3928 | 428 S.

US Patent 9,090,556 (7/28/2015). ncurrent research The supplementing of America's abundant fossil resources with fuels and chemicals derived from biomass remains important for generation of economic opportunities and for fostering national energy independence. In the laboratories of the Miller group, cutting-edge technology in heterogeneous catalysis and advanced processing is implemented to eff ectively convert biomass and biomass-derived intermediates to chemical products and fuels that compete with petroleum-based products in the current socio-economic environment. The Miller group has examined a number of chemical systems directed at energy and materials production from renewable feedstocks. These have included the catalytic upgrading of biomass platform intermediates, mainly produced in fermentation processes, with the goal of building technical capabilities for the emerging biorenery. In most cases, the overarching goal of the catalytic chemistry is deoxygenation of the biomass intermediate to a product that replaces a petroleum-derived counterpart. Classes of platform intermediates include carboxylic acids, sugar alcohols, linear alcohols, furanic compounds, and other derivatives; because these platform intermediates are typically of low volatility and are less thermally stable than their petroleum analogs, we have developed expertise in carrying out catalysis at mild temperatures under elevated hydrogen pressures in aqueous solution. The ability to design and prepare catalysts, characterize reaction pathways, and monitor chemical reaction kinetics have led to signicant interactions with industrial partners, national laboratories, and agricultural groups. The Miller group has partnered with the MSU engine group in mechanical engineering to produce and test advanced biofuels for internal combustion engines. Moving past today's rst generation ethanol and biodiesel, emphasis has been placed on developing advanced biofuels with enhanced engine performance, high energy density, and storage and flow properties that facilitate their use as direct replacements for petroleum-derived fuels. department of chemical engineering & materials science | 35GLYCEROL ADVANCED Orjuela, C.T.

One column is glass for atmospheric pressure and vacuum operation; the second is stainless steel for elevated pressure studies. Reactive distillation is well-suited for reaction systems that are limited by chemical equilibrium, as the removal of one product by distillation allows the reaction to be driven to completion within the column.

Currently, two main thrusts or our research are (1) investigation of new thermoelectric materials for conversion of heat to electricity; and (2) development of new materials for cryogenic cooling of Peltier devices for space-based applications. The Center for Revolutionary Materials for Solid State Energy Conversion, a US Department of Energy-funded research center led by MSU, focuses on solid state conversion of thermal energy to useful electrical power, both to increase the efciency of traditional industrial energy processes and to tap new unused sources of energy such as solar thermal. Additionally materials with enhanced thermoelectric properties will nd application in high efciency, environmentally benign climate control systems. We are undertaking a broad-based eff ort in semiconductor energy conversion materials utilizing and combining experimental, theoretical, and computational eff orts. A major focus of our eff ort will be in the synthesis of new forms of matter, including both single phase alloys and compounds and composite structures created using nanoscience. Ultimately, by working together in this Center we aim to develop design rules to predict properties of advanced thermoelectric materials, and realize these structures through innovative synthesis and advanced structural as well as chemical characterization. Some examples of current work in our group include: Understanding the relationship between structure and bonding and the thermal conductivity of solids. Good thermoelectric materials have very low thermal conductivity, and if we can understand how to control this parameter, new materials can be designed with improved properties. In collaboration with colleagues in our Center, we have combined state-of-the-art computational approaches with thermal and electronic transport characterization to study the relationship between crystal structure and proeprties of a class of promising semiconductors (Figure 1). We nd that certain types of structural arrangements of atoms give rise to strongly anharmonic lattice vibrations, a key ingredient in determining a material's heat conduction characteristics. We have synthesized these predicted structures in the laboratory and veried the predictions of these computational models. Thermoelectric materials synthesized from earth-abundant sources. We have shown that the mineral tetrahedrite (Figure 2) can be used directly as a thermoelectric material with very little compositional modication. Tetrahedrite, of chemical formula Cu 12Sb 4S13, is the most common sulfosalt mineral on Earth, and its use as a source thermoelectric material could pave the way to large scale and low cost application of thermoelectricity for energy conversion. We have found that the mineral itself can be used directly in a powder processing methodology to synthesize materials with large figure 1.

ZFS is Michigan's largest soybean processor servicing about 2500 Michigan farmers and processing 26,000 bushels of soybean (1.56 million pounds) per day\u2014representing 99% of the soybeans grown in the State. Currently they produce two products namely soybean meal used as animal feed, and oil which is used in food applications. Diversifying the product base with higher value industrial products provides more economic stability and job creation to the Michigan economy. We developed an ozonolysis technology platform to convert the fatty acid methyl esters derived from soybean oil to C-9 diesters and C-9, C-7 monoesters which have industrial applications. The plant oils are being converted into biobased polyols which is used in making flexible polyurethanes for automotive and industrial applications. The soymeal residue remaining after removing the oil by solvent extraction is rich in proteins and carbohydrates. We are developing technology to make rigid polyurethane foams. Figure 2 shows samples: A is reference formulation with no soy polyol; B contains 25% and C contains 50% of soy polyol. Another synthetic strategy being developed is to convert the figure 1. department of chemical engineering & materials science |39soy meal to polyurethane building blocks by eliminating or reducing the use of the toxic isocyanate reagent. Our biobased and biodegradable-compostable hybrid materials technology platform is based on poly(lactide) (PLA) resins derived from plant-biomass feedstock like corn and sugarcane. Funded by NSF SBIR Phase I and II grants, the technology is being commercialized by Natur-Tec, a business unit of Northern Technologies (NASDAQ:NTIC). The company currently supplies biodegradable-compostable bags to global companies such as Levi Strauss & Co. About 76,000 m.t./yr of plastic packaging resins are used for packaging 5 billion garments in South Asia alone (Figure 3), translating to about $200 million in economic value. The group is working towards addressing the major issue of microplastics in the ocean environment. In a recent paper published in the journal Science (February 2015, Vol. 347, No. 6223, pg. 768), we reported that 4.8 to 12.7 million tons of plastics entered into the oceans in 2010 and without any intervention would increase to 10.4 to 27.7 million tons by 2025. The paper shows that reducing 85% of waste from the top 35 mismanaged waste countries would result in a 75% reduction of plastic waste going into the oceans. We are working towards developing and implementing compostable plastics technology in conjunction with composting and anaerobic digestion systems to prevent \"mismanaged plastic waste\" from entering into the oceans (Figure 4).

Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) are a promising green energy technology off ering high chemical to electricity conversion efciencies, the ability to both store and produce energy, and a possible path to transition from today's hydrocarbon-based economy to a CO2-neutral economy running on hydrogen, solar fuels, or biofuels. Unfortunately, traditional SOFCs have been restricted to operating temperatures in excess of 750\u00b0C. To better understand intrinsic SOFC material behavior and reduce SOFC operating temperatures, our group has focused on (a) mechano-chemical coupling in electro-chemically active solids, (b) computationally-led SOFC braze and (c) nano-composite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) electrode enhancement. Some of our recent accomplishments include the publication of most highly cited gadolinium doped ceria sintering aid paper of the last decade, the development of the world's most highly cited nano-composite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell electrode model (the SIMPLE model), and the development of a new in situ, electrode-free bilayer curvature relaxation technique for measuring oxygen surface exchange coefcients as a function of simultaneously measured stress state. Updates on our research can be found at https:/ /www.egr.msu.edu/nicholasgroup/simple.php. Mechano-chemical coupling. Materials capable of quickly exchanging oxygen with the surrounding atmosphere are used in a variety of electrochemical devices such as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), catalytic converters, gas se nsors, solar thermochemical fuel generators, and gas separation membranes. In these applications, overall device performance is often limited by the rate of oxygen exchange with the atmosphere; a process quantied by the oxygen incorporation reaction chemical rate coefcient, k. Unfortunately, large disparities exist in the reported k's of even the most common oxygen exchange materials. For instance, literature reports indicate that there is a 2-orders-of-magnitude variation, a 3-order-of-magnitude variation, and a 4-order-of-magnitude variation in the 650\u00b0C k of CeO 2-x, lanth anum strontium cobalt iron oxide (La 0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-), and La 0.6Sr0.4FeO 3- (LSF64), respectively. Many authors have suggested that some of this k variation may be caused by varying MIEC stress/strain states and/or electrode eff ects. However, electrode-free techniques capable of simultaneously measuring a material's k and stress state have been missing from the literature. To remedy this problem, our group has developed a new curvature relaxation technique to measure the oxygen surface exchange coefcients and stress states of dense, porous, thin, or thick lm oxygen exchange materials. This new, in situ /in operando technique is presently among the cheapest electrode-free techniques for measuring oxygen surface exchange coefcients, and is the only technique yielding simultaneous k and stress data. figure 1.

Schematic of the curvature formation caused by wetting problems during manufacturing, the reduction of CuO during operation in hydrogen, and water vapor formation within the braze. The objective of this work is to design and test new, SOFC-compatible, silver-free brazes forming durable, oxygen and/or hydrogen impermeable protective surface scales. Computational eff orts to identify promising new braze compositions are being led by the research group of Dr. Yue Qi, while the Nicholas Group and the group of Dr. Thomas Bieler are leading experimental studies aimed at characterizing new braze SOFC produced by the inltration and subsequent ring of nitrate solutions have exhibited some of the best low-temperature performance ever reported. Unfortunately, it has been difcult to control the size of nanoparticles obtained via the inltration method. For instance, a survey of the recent literature indicates that 22 studies had inltrated particle sizes ranging from large 100-200 nm, 17 studies had inltrated particle sizes ranging from 50-80 nm, ve studies had inltrated particle sizes ranging from 30-40 nm, and ve studies had nano-particle sizes less than 30 nm in diameter. This inability to control inltrated nano-particle has restricted most nano-composite SOFC cathodes to operating temperatures >>600\u00b0C. Research our group has shown that inltrate particle sizes can either be controllably modulated from 21 to 48 nm through the pre-inltration of nano-ceria, or from 17 to 48 nm by desiccating precursor nitrate gels in atmospheres containing varying amounts of water.

We integrate rational catalyst design and synthesis, characterization and assessment, and modeling and simulation to understand structure-functional relationships. We work on two thrusts of signifi cant scientifi c and societal interest: biomimetic water oxidation to produce hydrogen and organic materials; and transformation of biorenewables to chemicals and high-density liquid fuels. Our eventual goal is to produce materials that are equivalent to those from petroleum- based raw materials. Biomimetic water oxidation to produce hydrogen fuel. The sun provides a clean and sustainable source of energy. However, its intermittency requires development of storage strategies to enable its use on demand. Solar-driven electrocatalytic water splitting, which converts solar energy into chemical energy for storage as fuel hydrogen, can eff ectively mitigate the intermittence of solar radiation. Water splitting consists of two half reactions: water oxidation and hydrogen evolution. Both reactions rely on highly eff ective electrocatalysts. Our work has focused on developing highly eff ective low-cost electrocatalysts for both reactions. We have developed an electrochemical method to immobilize a cobalt-based (Co-OXO) water oxidation catalyst on a conductive surface to promote recyclability and reusability without aff ecting functionality. We have also developed a method to synthesize manganese-based (MnO x) catalytic fi lms in situ, generating a nanoscale fi brous morphology that provides steady and excellent water oxidation performance. The new method involves two series of cyclic voltammetry (CV) over diff erent potential ranges, followed by calcination to increase crystallinity. This work has the potential to open routes for synthesizing and optimizing other manganese-based water oxidation catalysts (Fig. 1). We have investigated the feasibility of incorporating manganese-based water oxidation catalysts into TiO 2 to build a composite photoanode. Results show that the composite photoanode has good activity under ultraviolet (UV) illumination, and that its catalytic performance can be signifi cantly improved by enabling solar energy collection over a wider range of wavelengths. We have also developed a new electrodeposition method to synthesize Ni/Ni(OH) 2 catalysts in situ on conductive surfaces For the hydrogen evolution reaction. The new method involves two cycles of CV over a single potential range. This new inexpensive method involves a single CV scan of two potential ramps ranging from 0 to -1.2 V, and produces a catalytic fi lm with a uniform surface morphology consisting of an evenly-distributed monolayer of spherical walnut-shaped particles. The fi lm is stable, has a much better catalytic performance than traditional cc-Ni HER catalyst or Ni foil. A particularly important contribution of this work is that the new method creates a large number of Ni(OH) 2/Ni interfaces, leading to a catalytic performance that shifts signifi cantly towards that of platinum (Fig 2). Catalytic transformation of biorenewables to high-density liquid fuels. Global energy will increase signifi cantly over the next few decades. Even with new sources made possible by figure 1. Functionality assessment after selected stages of electrodeposition. The gradual increase in peak current density during the fi rst CV series increases dramatically during the second CV series, likely the result of continued enhancement in the oxidation state of the catalyst. The slope of the functionality curve during the second session is strongly positive, giving indication of further enhancement in oxidation state.department of chemical engineering & materials science | 43 nrecent publications H.

This has created a critical need for the sustainable production of fuels and chemicals. Solar energy is an important source for meeting global demand, because of the quantity incident on the planet. However, even if technological challenges are addressed to make solar energy a mainstream source, it will be diffi cult to meet the demand for high energy density liquid fuels. This will, instead, fall on biomass conversion and subsequent exhaustive reduction. The goal of our research is to help address this critical need. We report here on an eff ective protocol for synthesizing octadecylamine (ODA) as stabilizer, for the aqueous phase hydrogenation of the -keto site of pyruvic acid (PyA). The facile phase-transfer protocol is a reliable method to obtain stable sub-10nm Ru colloidal NPs. The ODA-stabilized Ru NPs are in situ deposition on ordered mesoporous silica (MSU-F). We used three diff erent thermal procedures to activate the supported Ru nanocatalysts, each maintaining the uniform distribution of nanoparticles on the supports. Gentle thermal oxidation enables complete ODA decomposition, but does not remove the decomposed residuals. Thermal reduction allows complete decomposition and removal of ODA, but results in some loss of Ru nanoparticles. Argon-protected calcination is the most effi cient activation method, because it removes the ODA completely while modifying the surface structure of the support, and facilitating the metal-support interaction. figure 2.

Multiphase fluids (i.e., drilling fluids, foodstuff s, pharmaceuticals, blood, liquid crystalline polymers, aerosols, fuel sprays, oil/water dispersions, solid/liquid suspensions, liquid/gas mists, and bubbly liquids) occur ubiquitously in many applications in engineering, polymer science, human medicine, and biology. Computational methods can provide signicant insights related to the behavior of these fluids in extreme conditions and in complex geometries. Examples include hydrate formation in subsea pipelines; oil/water spills in the ocean; dust storms on Earth and on Mars; circulation of large scale ocean currents; mixing of pollutants in lakes and rivers; ice formation in the atmosphere; particle deposition in the lungs; and, effluent flows from hydrocyclone separators. Flows of multiphase fluids are often unstable and involve large-scale secondary motions that can signicantly influence multiphase mixing and separation, interfacial mass and heat transfer, and multiphase reactions. Professor Petty and his colleagues are interested in the further development and experimental validation of next generation multiphase transport phenomena closure models and the further development of computational transport phenomena methods for rapid analysis and design of processes with an emphasis on safety. Turbulent fluctuations and bird navigation . The solution of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equation is the only viable means for simulating high Reynolds number flows typically encountered in engineering practice and in the troposphere. Research at MSU for the past twenty years has developed a realizable, algebraic Reynolds stress closure for rotating and nonrotating turbulent flows. The theory predicts the redistribution of turbulent kinetic energy among the three components of the velocity in simple mean shear flows (see Figure 1). The new approach is being used to analyze atmospheric scintillation of electromagnetic waves induced by the local coupling between the angular velocity of Earth and fluctuations in the turbulent velocity eld. The relationship between scintillation phenomena and bird migration may provide an explanation of a longstanding question in biology: How do birds navigate over global scales?

The CFFH concept may provide a practical means to mitigate three problems associated with current hydrocyclone clariers: 1) the loss of separation performance due to core flow reversal; 2) the loss of separation performance due to entrained particles in the sidewall boundary layer; and, 3) the loss of separation performance due to turndown. The third feature may be the most signicant inasmuch as the CFFH environment provides a self-regulating means to reduce the local ltrate flux across the sidewall lter. The CFFH concept for produced water can be extended to crude oil dehydration, to liquid/liquid separation of concentrated phases encountered in liquid/liquid extraction applications, and to downhole and subsea separation of oil and water. The objective of current research is to develop a prototype oil/water separator for eld testing. Multiphase flows. Particle-laden flows are widely encountered in the oil and gas industry. An accurate description of particle transport in turbulent flows is of great importance for predicting fouling of various equipment as well as erosion of pipe walls. As illustrated by the jet-pulsed mixer shown below (Figure 2) and flow through a bend (Figure 3), deposition of particles on the walls is influenced signicantly by streamlines curvature of the flow eld. figure 2 ( right, top ).

We are interested in materials that deliver clean energy. In the last several years, research grants from NSF, DOE, MSU, and GM allow the MSCE lab to study anode and cathode materials for lithium ion batteries, design brazing alloys for solid oxide fuel cells, and predict the role of oxides in aluminum casting. Utilizing the high performance computer center (HPCC) at MSU and both commercial and homemade software, we are specialized at designing materials from their atomic structures. We screen materials chemistry with First-Principles methods, which solve the fundamental quantum mechanical equations of matter to calculate accurately the properties that are diffi cult to measure experimentally. We simulate materials behavior that involves millions of atoms using molecular dynamics with faster and accurate atomic interactions (force fi eld). The multi-scale simulation tools we use and develop include: Density Functional Theory (DFT), Large Scale Molecular Dynamics, Reactive Force Field, Parallel computing, Phase fi eld model, Mesodyn, Coarse Graining Schemes, COMSOL, and Finite Element Method. We have successfully integrated nano-scale insights learned from atomic simulations into meso- and micro- structures, governed by continuum theories, to design materials that are important for energy effi cient and sustainable transportation industry. Central to these applications is a combination of \"top-down\" and \"bottom-up\" multi-scale modeling strategy with an associated experimental/ modeling research program. Therefore, most of our projects have strong collaboration with experimental groups and industry. Currently, ongoing projects include: Electron and ion transport in complex materials and interphases. Defect mediated diff usion greatly aff ects the power performance of battery and fuel cell devices. Using DFT informed thermodynamics formulation, we developed a systemic approach in 2015 to predict ionic conductivity as a function of voltage, pressure, temperature in single and polycrystals. In 2016, we extended our approach to include the more effi cient density functional tight binding (DFTB) method, so that the transport properties of nano-meter thick solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) sandwiched at the electrode and electrolyte interface, a system with 1000 atoms, can be predicted with quantum accuracy. Currently, these methods were used to understand and design high energy density electrode materials for Li-ion batteries; solid electrolytes coating with fast Li ion transport, and cathode catalyst with large oxygen vacancies to reduce the operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cells. Predicting chemical-mechanical degradation in Li-ion batteries. In order to computationally screen and design future battery materials for improved durability, we need to be able to predict failure starting from materials' properties and structures without using non-physical fi tting parameters. figure 1.

To better accomplish this goal, these engineers pursue the ability to design novel functions rather than rely on a catalog of \"parts\" culled from nature. Proteins, one of the main categories of parts, are wondrously complex biomolecules comprised of thousands of atoms, which fold into tertiary structures necessary for function by balancing competing inter- and intra-molecular forces. Imparting novel and specic functions into proteins is a difcult problem because protein structures are only marginally stable, protein structure-function relationships are not well understood, and many targeted small molecule substrates diff er by as little as a single hydroxyl group or a methyl bond. The net result is that eff orts to engineer or design new/improved proteins are either empirical in nature or suff er from low success rates, frustrating eff orts to rationally and reliably redesign components for cellular life. My group works to solve the problem of engineering proteins. We use and develop computational techniques to design proteins for new functions, have pioneered experimental approaches to comprehensively assess the eff ect of a protein's sequence on its desired function, and have imparted evolutionary and computational ideas to formulate efcient routes to optimize protein function. We are now interested in developing proteins for diverse applications like vaccine design and creating the next generation of biofuels. Our laboratory is funded by several State and Federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Energy. Recent highlights from the lab include: Rapid conformational epitope mapping of antibodies. Antibodies that target specic antigenic epitopes on the surfaces of viral and bacterial pathogens can neutralize infection. Conformational epitopes, which exist when an antigenic protein is properly folded, are targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies for a variety of pathogens like influenza and HIV. While obtaining the structural basis of how antibodies bind specic pathogens is key for the design of structure-based prophylactics, therapeutics, and vaccines, current methods for conformational epitope determination are low-throughput and laborious. My group has developed a fast, robust, and inexpensive method to map the conformational epitopes of antigens targeted by antibodies. This crucial missing link is being used in labs worldwide to expedite rational structure-based design of treatment and prevention options for a range of human pathogens. nrecent publications E.E.

Mark Worden Professor worden@egr.msu.edu | 517.353.9015 | international application submitted 8/30/2012, entitled \"Microbial nanowires and methods of making and using.\" \"Catalytic bioreactors and methods of using same.\" Provisional patent application, serial #61/531,304, submitted 9/6/2011; international application #PCT/US2012/053958 led 9/6/2012, entitled of Focus includes developing cost- eff ective and carbon-neutral methods to produce biofuels and chemicals from high-energy gases such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide. His group has been funded by the NSF and DOE to use microbubbles to enhance gas mass transfer. In a recent project funded by DOE's ARPA-E Electrofuels program, Dr. Worden's lab collaborated with the group of Dr. Anthony Sinskey at MIT to develop a bioprocess for continuous conversion of the gaseous reactants H 2, CO 2, and O 2 into the biofuel isobutanol (IBT). To address the three signicant bioreactor-design challenges: (1) extremely high demands for gas mass transfer; (2) safety issues resulting from the simultaneous use of by H 2 and O 2 gases, which form explosive mixtures; and (3) biocatalyst inhibition by the IBT, Dr. Worden's group developed a novel Bioreactor for Incompatible Gases (BIG). The BIG features a hollow ber module that allows the H 2 and O 2 gases to be kept on opposite sides of the membrane and transferred to the cells without forming unsafe gas mixtures. In addition, product inhibition is controlled by continuous removal of the IBT as it is formed. A prototype bench-scale BIG has been assembled in a walk-in hood, and an automatic process control system has allowed the bioreactor stably for up to 19 days. These experiments have demonstrated for the rst time continuous IBT production from H 2, CO 2, and O 2. Nanobiotechnology and biomimetic interfaces . This focus has recently been used to better understand cell toxicity caused by engineered nanomaterials (ENM). The approach uses an articial bilayer lipid membrane (BLM) to mimic a cell membrane. When ENM interact with a BLM, pores are formed in the BLM, and the resulting leakage of ions through the pores can be measured. Dr. Worden's group recently used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy provides a sensitive method to measure ENM's potency in disrupting biomembranes. One study showed that the method could discern diff erences in the potency of polystyrene nanoparticles (PNP) having diff erent in size surface charge. Negatively charged, carboxyl modied PNP 20 nm in diameter were more potent in disrupting BLM than those 100 nm PNP. However, positively charged amidine modied nanoparticles, PNP.

The project addresses the need for more high-performance, inexpensive biosensors able to detect toxic organophosphorus pesticides and nerve agents. The objectives are (1) to adapt the redox-cycling biosensor interface to nanoparticle-functionalized electrodes, (2) to develop a redox-cycling biosensor interface for alkaline-phosphatase-linked antibodies, and (3) to adapt biosensor interfaces to three commercial biosensor platforms. Conductive nanomaterials are being incorporated into the bioelectronic sensor interface and functionalized to measure activity of a organophosphate as an electric current. Additional bioelectronic sensors are also being developed that use a redox-recycling mechanism to amplify biosensor signals that measure binding of enzyme-linked antibodies to their target antigen. A portfolio of potentially commercializable prototype bioelectronic immunosensors is being developed in collaboration with an original equipment manufacturer. Dr. Worden has been active in leveraging research in these areas to develop novel educational programs that integrate multidisciplinary research with pedagogy. He has served as PI on two grants by the Department of Education's Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) program to develop graduate Ph.D. training programs entitled, \"Interdisciplinary Training Program on Bioelectronics\" (seven co-Is) and \"Multidisciplinary Graduate Training Program on Technologies for a Biobased Economy\" (seven co-Is). He also served as PI of a grant from the NSF Combined Research and Curriculum Development program to develop a novel \"Multidisciplinary Bioprocessing Laboratory\" course (ve co-PIs).

Marshall, Gill Levental. ncurrent research Our research leverages crystal growth and high temperature characterization techniques to study the relationship between atomic structure, bonding and the electronic and thermal properties of functional materials. Ultimately, we aim to apply this understanding to engineer improved functional materials for energy applications. Our recent eff orts have focused on optical fl oating zone growth of single crystals and measurements of the high-temperature sound velocity and lattice expansion in materials used for thermoelectric energy conversion. Crystal growth of anistropic materials. Our current aim is to develop improved thermoelectric materials for use in radioisotope thermoelectric generators designed and tested at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The thermoelectric materials used in this application must be semiconductors with very high melting temperatures, optimized electronic properties, and low thermal conductivity. They must also be mechanically robust over a large temperature gradient. Many candidate materials have atomic structures that are extremely anisotropic, and are therefore predicted to have more favorable electronic properties along specifi c crystal orientations, as illustrated in Figure 1 for Ca 5Al2Sb6. This anisotropy is expected to lead to improved thermoelectric properties along the high conductivity direction. One of the most signifi cant barriers, however, to understanding the intrinsic electronic and thermal properties of complex semiconductors is the scarcity of large single crystal samples. This is particularly limiting in the case of anisotropic materials, for which measurements of bulk, single crystalline samples yield only \"averaged\" properties. In our laboratory, we are utilizing several high-temperature techniques to grow single crystals of semiconducting and ceramic materials from the melt. Our main focus is optical fl oating zone growth, illustrated in Figure 2, which is a powerful method for materials with very high melting temperatures and relatively low vapor pressures. An optical fl oating zone furnace consists of several halogen lamps set in elliptical mirrors (four, in our case). The mirrors focus the light on the center of the chamber, where two polycrystalline rod-shaped samples are suspended inside of an inert gas-fi lled quartz tube. A stable figure 1. The predicted electronic properties of Ca 5Al2Sb6, a thermo- electric material with a complex crystal structure, are predicted to be highly anisotropic. Ca 5Al2Sb6 single crystals are necessary to prove this experimentally.department of chemical engineering & materials science | 55 nrecent publications O. Saneyuki, U. Aydemir, M. Amsler, J.-H.

This method can also be adapted to materials with incongruent melting behavior by employing a molten fl ux (i.e., solvent material) instead of melting the target compound. Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy. The thermal and elastic properties of materials are critical in a wide range of applications. Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) is an elegant approach to characterize the elastic constants of bulk and single crystal samples by measuring the vibrational resonant frequencies. RUS uses a drive transducer to sweep across a range of frequencies and a pick-up transducer to record the response. The resonant frequencies are a function of the elastic constants, sample geometry, and sample density. This method is also ideal for measuring the full elastic tensor of anisotropic single crystals, as the entire tensor is obtained in a single measurement. High temperature RUS measurements coupled with high temperature x-ray diff raction\u2014also available in our laboratory\u2014gives us an extremely sensitive set of tools to investigate structural changes in materials, including gradual softening of bonds, order-disorder transitions, and structural phase changes. figure 3. The resonant ultrasound method uses a piezoelectric transducer to emit acoustic waves over a range of frequencies. Certain fre quencies will resonate strongly in the sample, yielding a vibrational response that is detected by a second transducer. This method allows us to study the elastic tensor of single crystals and polycrystalline materials at room temperature and at high temperatures.Department of Chemical Engineering & Materials Science Donald Morelli, Interim Chairperson 428 S.
