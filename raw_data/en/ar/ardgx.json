Contributions from the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) Network Franca R. Jones, PhD (CDR, USN) As Chief of the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) section of the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch (AFHSB), I am pleased to introduce this month's issue of the Medical Surveillance Monthly Report (MSMR ), which contains several reports of surveillance data from GEIS partners. Although GEIS partners regularly publish in other peer-reviewed journals,1 with more than 100 publications between 2016 and 2017 alone,2 the MSMR provides a unique platform for communicating results to a targeted audience of military public health and medical professionals. This collection of MSMR articles is part of a larger effort to increase the timeliness and availability of GEIS surveillance data to Department of Defense (DoD) personnel responsi - ble for readiness and force health protec - tion (FHP) decision making, particularly the Combatant Command (CCMD) Sur - geons and their staffs. Consistent with that effort, GEIS will be actively engaging with GEIS partners to encourage additional manuscript submissions to the MSMR . This introduction provides an opportunity to summarize the variety of surveillance activities being carried out across the GEIS network. Last year marked the 20th anniversary of the GEIS program. The DoD established GEIS in 1997 to address a Presidential Decision Directive, National Science and Technology Council-7, which tasked the DoD to improve infectious disease sur - veillance, prevention, and response.3 GEIS achieves these goals through support to an interconnected global network of U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force laboratory part - ners located in the U.S., South America, Africa, Europe, and Asia with extensive field, clinical, and laboratory biosurveil - lance capabilities (Figure) . Moreover, GEIS partners have developed strong and long - standing relationships with other U.S. government agencies, international organi - zations, and partner nations in strategically relevant locations to expand the capabili - ties and reach of the network in providing regional disease surveillance support. A August 2018 Vol. 25 No. 8 MSMR Page 3 network approach ensures that GEIS part - ners are more than the sum of their parts by providing, for example, comparable data on circulating influenza virus strains for sea - sonal vaccine selection,4-6 etiologic agents of traveler's diarrhea, and antimicrobial resistance patterns7 around the world. In 2015, GEIS, as a section of AFHSB, was integrated into the Defense Health Agency's (DHA) Public Health Division. Incorporation into the DHA elevated the GEIS section's role in Combat Sup - port and highlighted the need to pro - vide more timely surveillance data to the CCMDs. In addition to peer-reviewed publications, GEIS partners now provide timely updates on outbreaks and high- impact surveillance findings, which are communicated immediately to the rele - vant CCMDs, and generate monthly data reports for all ongoing surveillance proj - ects with routine findings. These data are compiled into summary reports for each CCMD on a monthly basis, a process that provides timely and actionable surveil - lance information for FHP decision mak - ing to supplement more in-depth, but less timely, peer-reviewed publications. The articles in the August 2018 issue of the MSMR provide only a small sample of the overall GEIS network's results, with a focus on disease surveillance among U.S. military populations. As compre - hensive risk assessments require knowl - edge of emerging pathogens circulating more broadly, the GEIS network conducts disease surveillance activities in partner nation militaries, partner nation civilians, animal reservoirs, and arthropod vec - tors, in addition to U.S. military person - nel. Such work in partnership with other nations broadens the scope of information for FHP decision making while improv - ing the partner nations' understanding of their endemic infectious disease burdens and risks. These activities cover all six geographic CCMDs and address a wide diversity of militarily relevant infectious disease threats that fall under four GEIS Focus Areas: Antimicrobial-resistant infection sur- veillance projects identify circulating anti - microbial-resistant pathogens that may have an impact on our global fighting force. Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens linked to healthcare-associated infections, wound infections, and sexually transmitted infections, as well as emerging resistance patterns are analyzed to provide informa - tion for military health initiatives such as improved antibiotic stewardship and med - ical countermeasures development. An increasing number of projects at the DoD overseas laboratories have focused on advanced molecular methods, which pro - vide a more in-depth evaluation of genetic mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance on a near real-time basis. Over recent years, GEIS partner laboratories documented the emergence of carbapenem-resistant bacte - ria at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center found colistin-resistant Kleb - siella pneumoniae in Thailand,9 and char - acterized Staphylococcus aureus carriage among U.S. Navy submariners (see article by Millar et al. on page 5). Enteric infection surveillance proj - ects concentrate on the etiologic agents causing acute gastroenteritis or travelers' diarrhea, pathogens that often degrade mil - itary operational readiness. Surveillance activities cover acute gastroenteritis in U.S. military personnel (including recruit, shipboard, and forward-deployed popula - tions) and in foreign military and civilian populations, study of travelers' diarrhea in immune-naive travelers,10 and advanced characterization and antimicrobial sus - ceptibility testing of enteric pathogens. Recent studies have described the causes of acute gastroenteritis among trainees at four recruit training centers (see article by Brooks et al. on page 8), the incidence of Campylobacter concisus and C. ureolyticus in pathogen-negative stool samples from travelers' diarrhea cases and asymptomatic controls,11 resulting in the first report of these pathogens detected among travelers to Nepal and Thailand, and the epidemiol - ogy and patterns of illness among individu - als infected with fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter species and other diarrheal pathogens during a 2- to 3-week military exercise in Thailand.12 Febrile and vector-borne infection surveillance projects examine vector-borne and zoonotic pathogens associated with acute febrile illness in humans in three general areas: human infections and dis - ease (see article by Chen et al. on page 13), vector distribution and pathogen presence in vectors and reservoirs,13,14 and envi - ronmental drivers of exposure and infec - tion.15 Recently published studies have documented the transmission of scrub typhus outside of Asia,16,17 the distribution of malaria resistance to major antimalarial drugs in Southeast Asia,18 and the identifi - cation of rickettsial pathogens in mosqui - toes in the Republic of Korea.19 Respiratory infection surveillance projects address rapid detection and response to respiratory pathogens, espe - cially those with pandemic potential in humans. Surveillance includes U.S. mili - tary personnel, including recruit, ship - board, and deployed populations,20 and foreign military and civilian populations. Other specific studies address the human- animal interface (designed to develop knowledge regarding zoonotic transmis - sion of emerging respiratory pathogens), advanced characterization of viruses (designed to monitor viral drift and poten - tial shift), and vaccine effectiveness and response studies.21,22 Recent studies exam - ined clinical and laboratory predictors of influenza virus infection among individu - als with influenza-like illness,23 biomarkers of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic - ity as a broader metric than neutralizing antibodies for assessing immune response to influenza vaccination,24 and sampling strategies for detecting genetic diversity of influenza viruses (see article by Fries et al. on page 16). * * * In the 20 years since its establishment, GEIS has been a global leader in efforts to address militarily relevant infectious dis - ease threats, informing readiness and FHP decision making. Pathogens continue to emerge at an astounding rate, and GEIS partners have been on the front line in detecting and responding to these threats: from the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus pandemic,25 the emergence of MERS-CoV in Central Command,26 the Ebola epidemic in Africa Command,27,28 chikungunya29,30 and Zika virus emergence31,32 in Southern Command and Indo-Pacific Command, and the first identification of colistin-resis - tant bacteria in Northern Command.33 As Rear Admiral Colin Chinn pointed out at the recent GEIS State of the Science meeting MSMR Vol. 25 No. 8 August 2018 Page 4 in November 2017, \"Those working in the laboratories in the U.S. and overseas are at the tip of the spear so that the Combatant Commands have the healthy forces neces - sary for their missions. \"34 As mentioned, the articles in this issue represent only a small sample of what I anticipate will be many submissions to the MSMR from the GEIS network, in line with the MSMR 's goal to provide \"public health information that is directly relevant to the health, safety, and well-being of Military Health System beneficiaries or the operational fitness of military members. \"35,36 Author affiliation: Armed Forces Health Sur - veillance Branch, Silver Spring, MD.

MSMR. 1995;1(1):2.August 2018 Vol. 25 No. 8 MSMR Page 5 Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI). Military personnel in congregate set - tings (e.g., training, deployment) are at increased risk for S. aureus colonization and SSTI.1-4 In these settings, a preponderance of SSTI risk factors (e.g., crowding, infrequent handwashing/bathing, skin microabra - sions) favors the person-to-person trans - mission of S. aureus and leads to outbreaks of SSTI which, in turn, impose on the mili - tary a significant operational and healthcare burden. A significant proportion of SSTIs are caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), a strain known for its enhanced virulence.5 Shipboard deployments have been asso - ciated with SSTI outbreaks and increased prevalence of S. aureus /MRSA coloniza - tion,3,6 likely explained by the prolonged confinement of personnel in enclosed, crowded spaces.7,8 Fifty percent of crew members on a U.S. Navy vessel were colo - nized with S. aureus (3.5% with MRSA),7 whereas colonization rates of 32% (1% with MRSA) have been reported in the general U.S. population.9 Among British submari - ners, pre- and post-deployment rates of S. aureus colonization were 36.9% and 43.5%, respectively.8 Submarine deployments may represent periods of increased colonization and SSTI risk. This report describes a study of S. aureus nasal colonization and SSTI among two different crews of U.S. Navy sub - mariners who deployed on a ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) in 2016. The results are reported herein. METHODS For a 7-month period in 2016, an observational cohort study of S. aureus colonization and SSTI among U.S. Navy submariners was conducted. Submari - ners who were embarking on ballistic mis - sile submarine deployments lasting 3-4 months were targeted for enrollment. Per - sonnel from two consecutive crews who deployed on the same submarine partici - pated in the study. All active duty mili - tary members on board (150 in each of the two crews) were eligible for participation. Enrollments occurred on the submarine approximately 1 week before deployment. Because of operational security, the study team was assigned a specific area in the galley of the submarine and did not have access to other areas of the submarine for recruitment. Independent duty corpsmen, assigned to the submarine, briefed the crew about the study before the enrollment visit, and flyers were used to advertise the study. All active duty personnel were invited to participate by the independent duty corps - men using the overhead announcement system on the submarine. Personnel who were interested in the study presented to the galley during specific hours for enrollment and were enrolled by the study team. The post-deployment visit was conducted at a clinic a few miles from the port. The independent duty corpsmen attempted to contact subjects who did not show up for their follow-up visit and those who missed the follow-up visit were con - sidered lost to follow-up. Each crew was deployed on the submarine for a period of 3 months. Post-deployment nasal swabs were collected within 1 week of returning from deployment. At the pre- and post-deployment vis - its, participants had S. aureus culture swabs taken from the anterior nares using dual BBL CultureSwab Collection and Trans - port System. Swabs were immediately placed on dry ice and stored at -70\u00b0C prior to shipping to the microbiology laboratory at the Naval Medical Center in Portsmouth, V A. Culture swabs were plated onto man - nitol salt agar plates. Mannitol ferment - ing colonies were isolated and plated onto trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep's blood and incubated overnight. S. aureus isolates were identified based on colony morphol - ogy, Gram stain, latex agglutination test - ing (Staphaurex, Remel, Lenexa, KS), and slide catalase testing. All S. aureus isolates underwent identification and susceptibil - ity testing using MicroScan WalkAway-96 (Dade Behring Inc., Deerfield, IL), accord - ing to Clinical Laboratory Standards Insti - tute methods. Participant demographic characteris - tics and information on potential SSTI risk factors were collected at the time of enroll - ment using a self-administered question - naire. A post-deployment questionnaire elicited information on incident SSTIs, treatment and outcome during deploy - ment. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS/STAT\u00a9 software version 9.3 (2012, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). This study was approved by the Uniformed Services University Infectious Disease Institutional Review Board (IDCRP-088). RESULTS Study participants represent conve - nience samples of personnel from two crews deployed on a single SSBN. Of the 300 submariners (150 in each deployment) eligible for participation, 119 (39.7%) sub - mariners were enrolled (59 from group 1, 60 from group 2) and had pre-deployment swabs collected. Of these, 97 (44 from group 1, 53 from group 2) returned for the follow-up visit and had post-deployment swabs collected. The pre-deployment prevalence of S. aureus colonization was 38.9% in group Brief Report Pre- and Post-Deployment Prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus Colonization Among U.S. Navy Submariners Eugene V . Millar, PhD; Kristina MHS MSMR Vol. 25 No. 8 August 2018 Page 6 1 and 11.7% in group 2. The post-deploy - ment prevalence of S. aureus colonization was 22.7% in group 1 and 5.7% in group 2 (Table) . The pre-deployment prevalence of MRSA colonization was 1.7% in group 1 and 3.3% in group 2. The post-deployment prevalence of MRSA colonization was 2.3% in group 1 and 0% in group 2. No cases of SSTI during either deployment were identi - fied on the post-deployment surveys. EDITORIAL COMMENT This study of S. aureus nasal coloni - zation, conducted among two U.S. Navy submariner samples on 3-month training exercises, demonstrated moderate rates of overall S. aureus colonization, low rates of MRSA colonization, and a decrease in col - onization prevalence from the pre- to the post-deployment period. No cases of SSTI were reported during either deployment. Previous studies have shown that the shipboard setting is associated with SSTIs among military personnel,3 and that S. aureus colonization, an important risk factor for SSTI, is common.7,8 One cross-sectional study on a U.S. Navy vessel demonstrated a S. aureus colonization prevalence of 49% in the first 2 weeks of deployment.7 Envi - ronmental samples were not collected in that shipboard study, but contamination of common-touch surfaces on the ship may have served as an important reservoir for S. aureus , as has been suggested in a military recruit setting.10 Lower than anticipated rates of colo - nization and a decrease in prevalence from the pre- to post-deployment visit were observed in the study samples. The rea - sons for these findings are not known, but the observations may be explained in part by limitations in the study design and sam - pling strategy. Samples were limited to two crews that were deployed on a single sub - marine. Moreover, the data are based on a convenience sample, as only 40% of eligible TABLE.

It was not feasible to assess the representativeness of those who did partici - pate (i.e., compare the characteristics of par - ticipants and non-participants in the study), because study personnel did not interact with non-participants. Lastly, it is possible that two swabs over a 3-month period are insufficient to capture the dynamics of S. aureus acquisition and colonization in this setting. This study was conducted among personnel deployed on a ballistic missile submarine and it is not known whether the risk of S. aureus colonization and/or SSTI differs for personnel deployed on other classes of submarines (e.g., fast attack sub - marines), or for personnel at other subma - rine bases in the U.S. Previous studies have shown that the congregation of military personnel in ship - board settings increases the risk of outbreaks of acute respiratory infection, gastrointesti - nal infection, and SSTI.3,11,12 Military per - sonnel on submarines likely experience a number of SSTI risk factors (e.g., crowd - ing, shared equipment) that may increase their risk of S. aureus acquisition, persis - tent colonization, and infection. The find - ings from this study did not demonstrate an increased risk of S. aureus colonization or SSTI. However, these results may have been due to significant limitations in the study design and sampling strategy. Nonetheless, SSTI prevention strategies, including per - sonal hygiene optimization, proper wound care, and environmental cleaning measures among congregate military populations are warranted, as is ongoing surveillance for SSTI cases during deployment.

MSMR Vol. 25 No. 8 August 2018 Page 8 An estimated 179 million cases of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) occur each year in the U.S. and AGE is commonly reported within both training and deployed U.S. military populations. Beginning in 2011, the Operational Infectious Diseases (OID) laboratory at the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) has undertaken routine surveillance of four U.S. military training facilities to systematically track the prevalence of AGE and to establish its etiologies among U.S. military recruits. Employing both molecular and stan - dard microbiological techniques, NHRC OID routinely assays for pathogens of direct military relevance, (2011-2016), NHRC OID identified norovirus as the primary etiology of both sporadic cases and outbreaks of AGE among trainees.Surveillance for Norovirus and Enteric Bacterial Pathogens as Etiologies of Acute Gastroenteritis at U.S. Military Recruit Centers, 2011-2016 Krista M. Brooks, PhD; Reza Zeighami, BS; Christian J. Hansen, BS; Ramona L. McCaffrey, PhD; Paul C. F. Graf, PhD (LCDR, USN); Christopher A. Myers, PhD Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is defined as the rapid onset of diar - rheal disease, with or without accompanying symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, fever, or abdominal pain. Annu - ally, AGE causes 1.8 million deaths world - wide in children younger than 5 years old.1,2 In the U.S. alone, despite public health advances to improve food, water, and sani - tation, AGE remains a major cause of mor - bidity and hospitalization, accounting for more than 1.5 million outpatient visits, 200,000 hospitalizations, and 300 deaths annually.3-5 Furthermore, an estimated 179 million cases occur annually in the U.S. among people who do not seek medical attention.5 AGE is one of the most common ailments affecting travelers and military populations. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), along with other diagnostic tech - niques, have been utilized to identify both bacterial and viral causations, with norovi - rus (NoV) being identified as the primary etiologic agent.6,7Among U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) military populations and other international military units, NoV has been implicated or suspected as the causative agent in several AGE outbreaks.8,9 Results of an anonymous cross-sectional survey of U.S. military personnel deployed to South - west Asia from 2003 through 2004 found that 76.8% of personnel stationed in Iraq and 54.4% in Afghanistan had experienced at least one episode of diarrhea.6 It was found that diarrhea was most often associ - ated with time spent off the regional base and with eating local food.6 Additional studies have shown that among deployed U.S. military personnel, the bacteria Sal- monella , Shigella 6%-10% of reported cases of gastroenteri - tis, respectively.7 NoV incidence rates have been estimated to account for approxi - mately 3% of all diarrhea within the same population.10 As a result of crowding and subsequent ease of transmission, AGE due to NoV has been estimated to spike to over 70% during shipboard outbreaks.9 These studies clearly showed that bacterial and viral etiologies, with an emphasis on Salmonella , Shigella , Campylobacter , and NoV have a significant impact on the mor - bidity, medical resources, and operational effectiveness of deployed troops.11,12 Given the unpredictability and disruptive effect of infectious gastroenteritis on U.S. mili - tary training, readiness, and operational performance, AGE surveillance efforts are crucial to understanding the etiology and epidemiology of AGE within these \"at-risk\" populations. The impact of these pathogens is also recognized in DoD recruit training popula - tions. The enteric disease surveillance study implemented by the Naval Health Research Center Operational Infectious Diseases (NHRC OID) offers a unique opportunity to focus on this specific, high-risk AGE population. Recruit populations offer sev - eral advantages for studying highly com - municable infectious diseases. First, recruit trainees live within a \"crowded\" environ - ment (paramount for sustained transmis - sion dynamics for infectious diseases). Second, trainees have excellent healthcare facilities at their disposal and are required to seek care when ill. Finally, military populations have demonstrated excellent research study participation and compli - ance (within the framework of approved institutional review board [IRB] protocols), allowing the collection of enrollment and follow-up data to be almost fully complete. For etiologic identification, NHRC OID has developed and implemented a sophis - ticated enteric diseases surveillance pro - gram with the capability to identify NoV and several significant bacterial pathogens in human clinical samples.August 2018 Vol. 25 No. 8 MSMR Page 9 METHODS Study participation was strictly vol - untary for all recruits who agreed to enroll from 12 May 2011 through 30 Septem - ber 2016. Only presumptive infectious AGE patients were sought and enrolled as cases; those trainees who were deemed to have non-infectious AGE (e.g., dehydra - tion, heat- or exercise-related AGE), were excluded from enrollment after initial evaluation. The case definition of AGE was a trainee presenting for medical care after having experienced three or more episodes of diarrhea or vomiting in the preceding 24 hours, or a combination of episodes of diarrhea (two or more) or vomiting (two or more) accompanied by additional gastroin - testinal-related symptoms (two or more), such as nausea or abdominal cramps. Since 2011, the standardized surveillance net - work has included Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego, CA (initiated May 2011); Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island, SC (June 2011); Recruit Training Com - mand, Great Lakes, IL (October 2011); and U.S. Army Training Center, Fort Leonard Wood, MO (April 2012). This surveillance research was approved by the NHRC IRB in 2011. Fol - lowing consent and enrollment, all enrolled trainees with AGE were asked to provide a stool sample. Stool samples were preserved in Cary-Blair transport medium and Campy-thioglycollate medium. Recruits unable to provide a stool specimen were asked to self-administer two rectal swabs, which were preserved in universal trans - port medium (UTM) and Cary-Blair medium. All inoculated media and remain - ing unpreserved stool were stored at 4\u00b0C. Collected specimens were shipped to the NHRC OID laboratory under refrigerated conditions on a weekly basis. Each training site had a dedicated NHRC OID research assistant to conduct surveillance. Research assistants normally collected up to 10 specimens per week but could have collected up to three specimens per day during an AGE outbreak. An AGE outbreak was defined as an \"unusual\" (rela - tive to weekly averages) number of recruits with AGE symptoms clustered by both time and place. More practically, an outbreak for the purposes of surveillance was defined as two or more associated cases of diarrhea and/or vomiting within a 24-hour period. The NHRC OID laboratory is accred - ited by the College of American Pathologists and the DoD Clinical Laboratory Improve - ment Program. Additionally, NHRC OID has been certified to participate in the Cali - ciNet National Norovirus Outbreak Net - work. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched CaliciNet in 2009 to collect information on NoV strains associated with gastroenteritis outbreaks in the U.S. Participation is limited to federal, state, and local public health laboratories in the U.S. The NHRC OID laboratory is cur - rently the only DoD laboratory participat - ing in the program and has been certified to do so since 2011.13 Data Management The NHRC OID laboratory maintains a relational database containing demo - graphic and epidemiologic information collected from case report forms as well as laboratory results. Summary statistics are frequently generated on all relevant vari - ables, including demographics, symptoms, disposition, and functional outcomes. Enrollment and specimen collection may occur on a daily basis at each field site; labo - ratory testing occurs at least once per week. Laboratory Processing Detection of Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter Stool specimen swabs received in Cary-Blair transport media were streaked onto tryptic soy agar with sheep agar plates. Inoculated plates were incubated for a total of 48 hours at 37\u00b0C, with primary analysis at 24 hours. Suspected Salmonella and Shigella colonies were isolated and identified using the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (Becton Dickinson). Swabs received in Campy-thioglycol - late media were streaked onto Campy-CV A agar plates and incubated under micro - aerophilic conditions for 72 hours at 42\u00b0C. Suspected Campylobacter colonies were isolated and identified at the genus level by the following characteristics: cellular mor - phology, reaction on Gram staining, oxi - dase, and hippurate analysis. Single-swab samples received in Cary-Blair media were used to streak all of the aforementioned plates. Incubation times, temperatures, and subsequent analyses were identical to the procedure outlined above. Detection and characterization of NoV genogroups GI/II RNA was extracted from 20% saline suspensions of stool or directly from UTM using the QIAamp\u00ae Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bacterio - phage MS2 virus (ZeptoMetrix) was added to the fecal suspension prior to extraction. Eluted RNA extractions were assayed for the presence of norovirus using a multi - plex real-time RT-PCR assay developed by CDC for simultaneous detection of human NoV GI/GII, as well as an MS2 virus inter - nal amplification control.13 Strain iden - tification was performed in accordance with CDC protocols and uploaded to the CaliciNet surveillance database.13 RESULTS During the 5-year surveillance period, approximately 3% of all recruits across the four training sites were diagnosed with AGE by a clinician. Although 1,940 sub - jects provided informed consent and were enrolled, four enrollees failed to provide samples, leaving 1,936 samples collected and submitted to the NHRC OID labora - tory for analysis (Table) . Among the popula - tion experiencing AGE, rates of consent to participate in surveillance and contribution of research samples varied between sites. The highest average rate of participation among those approached to enroll was seen at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego (47%), the lowest at Fort Leonard Wood (22%), though variation was seen across years at all sites. A minor seasonal trend was observed across all sites, with the high - est participation occurring during winter months, suggestive of a positive association with AGE activity. Etiologic agents were MSMR Vol. 25 No. 8 August 2018 Page 10 identified in 491 (25%) samples. NoV GI/ II accounted for 90% of all positive testing results. Bacterial agents ( Salmonella , Shi- gella , (Table) . Self-administerd rectal swabs accounts for approximately 40% of all specimens collected during the surveillance period. Of those, only 15.6% of all swabs collected yielded a pathogen-positive result, com - pared to 32.5% of all stool samples tested (data not shown) . All four Campylobacter were isolated from stool, while 10 times as many Salmonellae were isolated from stool as from rectal swabs, and three times as many NoV were detected from stool as from rectal swabs (data not shown) . Although comparable numbers of samples (449-539) were cumulatively collected from train - ees during all seasons of the year, sporadic NoV cases and outbreaks were most preva - lent during the fall (28%) and winter (37%) versus the spring (19%) and summer (8%) months (Figure 1) . Salmonella was identi - fied at a lower, consistent rate across total enrollments, regardless of the season (Fig- ure 1) . NoV GI was most commonly iden - tified in specimens collected during 2011, while NoV GII was the predominant geno - type in circulation among all recruit train - ing sites in 2012-2015 (Figure 2) . As of 30 September 2016, a total of 18 NoV GI- and 26 NoV GII-associated out - breaks had been identified across all sites since surveillance began in 2011 (Figure 3) .EDITORIAL COMMENT The enteric disease surveillance pro - gram was established to describe the epide - miology of AGE and NoV among U.S. DoD military recruits. Historically, most AGE outbreaks have been attributed to bacte - rial pathogens. However, surveillance data spanning from 2005 to 2012 have identified viral agents as the most common etiology in AGE outbreaks in military operational settings, with NoV the most commonly identified.10 Surveillance data collected by TABLE.

In this study, the observed trends relating to NoV seasonality, outbreak trends, and preva - lence of GII circulation correspond to what has been previously described in the litera - ture.14,15 The reason for the dramatic drop in NoV burden in 2016 is unknown. Among the enrollees with AGE stud - ied in this report, etiologic agents were not identified by routine surveillance test - ing in approximately 75% of the total col - lected specimens. This pathogen recovery rate is low, compared with previous stud - ies in which causative organisms were identified in approximately 45%-50% of all symptomatic cases of AGE.16,17 The dis - similarity in NHRC OID's findings during the 2011-2016 surveillance period could be attributed to a variety of factors, including the study population, specimen type, test - ing methodologies, and pathogenic targets. The cited studies focus on long-term trav - eler and/or deployed military populations. Recruit populations are generally restricted to their respective facilities for the duration of their training and are not exposed to as many sanitation- and poverty-related AGE risk factors as the populations monitored in cited studies. Additionally, all trainees enrolled in the study met the required AGE case definition. The fact that such a high percentage were found to be pathogen-neg - ative by the current methodologies could be indicative of the need to minimize the collection of self-administered rectal swabs and focus primarily on collecting and test - ing stool samples, the need for improved recovery methods, and/or the need for more sensitive detection techniques. Finally, low pathogen recovery rates could be due to the choice of bacterial and viral agents targeted in these initial efforts. More extensive test - ing of these samples would be required to determine whether other bacterial, viral, or parasitic pathogens are more prevalent than the currently targeted organisms. Since its inception in 2011, NHRC OID's enteric disease surveillance pro - gram's initial surveillance efforts have succeeded in establishing a standardized method for tracking the incidence of, and determining common etiologies of, AGE among U.S. military recruits. Ultimately, data derived from this program have the potential to facilitate the development of FIGURE 2.

It is consid - ered to be the most widespread zoo - notic disease in the world.1 A wide range of wild and domestic animals\u2014notably cattle, pigs, dogs, rodents, and other small mam - mals\u2014are natural reservoirs.2 Infected animals excrete leptospires in their urine intermittently or regularly for months, years, or the rest of their lifetime.3 In turn, human infection results from direct or indirect exposure to the urine of carrier animals. In the Republic of Korea (ROK), human leptospirosis was first identified in 1984 as the cause of \"epidemic pulmonary hemorrhagic fever. \"4,5 There have been sev - eral more outbreaks reported between 1984 and 1999 in the ROK civilian population.6 A leptospiral vaccination program was ini - tiated in 1988 targeting high-risk groups in rural areas of the ROK and may have been responsible for the reduction of cases in the succeeding years. The program was discon - tinued in late 1997.7 According to data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, the incidence of lepto - spirosis decreased between 1990 and 1999 (average annual incidence, 0.02 per 100,000 population) but has increased since then. From 2000 through 2013, there were 1,386 reported cases, and the average annual inci - dence was 0.22 per 100,000 population.8 The presence of leptospirosis in the ROK poses a potential threat to more than 40,000 U.S. Armed Forces personnel and their family members who reside in the ROK. Data or information relevant to the risk of leptospirosis to U.S. military person - nel assigned to the ROK and their families is generally limited to case reports. The aim of the current study is to estimate the lep - tospirosis risk by measuring the frequency of acquisition of leptospiral antibodies among Army infantry soldiers assigned to the ROK. METHODS The Defense Medical Surveillance Sys - tem (DMSS), maintained by the Armed Force Health Surveillance Branch, was used to identify a cohort of U.S. Army infantry members who were assigned to the ROK for the first time for a minimum of 180 days from 1 January 2011 through 31 December 2014. Infantry soldiers were selected for study because they were more likely to work and train in field conditions that placed them at risk for leptospiro - sis infection. The Department of Defense Serum Repository was queried to identify serum specimens from infantry soldiers who had served in the ROK at any time during the years of interest. Only individu - als with serum specimens collected within the 365 days before the start date of their ROK assignment (pre-tour) and addi - tional serum specimens collected during the period 180 days after the start date to 180 days after the end date of ROK assign - ment (post-tour) were selected. If multiple qualifying pre-tour or post-tour specimens were available for an individual, then speci - mens collected closest to the ROK assign - ment start and end dates were selected. Service members born outside of the U.S. were excluded from the study. From the population of service members who met the inclusion criteria, 250 infantry soldiers were randomly selected for each year dur - ing the study period 2011-2014 to achieve the target sample size of 1,000. Because there were only 230 and 217 eligible sub - jects during 2012 and 2014, additional Brief Report Leptospirosis Seroconversion Surveillance Among U.S. Army Infantry Forces Assigned to South Korea, 2011-2014 Hua-Wei Chen, PhD; Zhiwen Zhang, MS; Tatyana Belinskaya, MS; Wei-Mei Ching, PhD subjects were randomly selected from years 2011 and 2013 to achieve the target sample size. Overall, a total of 280 and 273 subjects were included for years 2011 and 2013. Information on sex, age, year stationed in the ROK, and number of prior overseas operational deployments was available for each specimen. All 1,000 post-tour serum samples were screened at a dilution of immunoglobulin G against with ELISA absorbances >0.32 at 405 nm were considered as positive for leptospiral- specific antibodies. Pre-tour samples were tested only if the corresponding service members' post-tour samples were positive. Seroconversion was defined as a change from a negative result to a positive result at a titer of at least 100 or a 4-fold rise in titers from the pre- to post- tour samples. RESULTS The study population consisted of 1,000 males; of these, the majority were younger than 25 years old (69%) and most had had no prior operational deployments (70.6%) (Table) . The post-tour seropositivity among the infantry soldiers for antibodies against Leptospira at a titer >100 was 4.5% (45 of 1,000). Among them, 36 were also seropositive in their pre-tour specimens and only nine (0.9%) seroconverted dur - ing their assignment to ROK. Higher per - centages of seropositive were found among those aged 30-34 years (8.2%) and 35-39 years (10.0%). Because only nine soldiers seroconverted in association with their assignment to ROK, there was no apparent correlation between seroconversion and MSMR Vol. 25 No. 8 August 2018 Page 14 age or number of prior operational deploy - ments. The fact that five of the nine sero - converters were assigned to ROK during 2013 suggests an increased level of expo - sure for that year, but the small numbers overall preclude any firm conclusion about a temporal risk (Table) . EDITORIAL COMMENT Leptospirosis is likely underreported among U.S. military personnel. In Novem - ber 2014, there was a leptospirosis outbreak involving as many as 90 U.S. Marines who had been training at the Jungle Warfare Training Center, Camp Gonsalves, Oki - nawa, Japan.10 One challenge to correctly diagnosing and promptly treating leptospi - rosis is that the symptoms of leptospirosis are easily confused with other febrile illnesses, such as dengue and malaria. Many cases of acute febrile illness are clinically diagnosed as malaria or dengue without using labora - tory methods that can differentiate infec - tious pathogens including Leptospira. The lack of ready availability of laboratory sup - port to diagnose leptospirosis undoubtedly contributes to underreporting. In addition, in endemic regions the majority of infec - tions may not provoke serious symptoms and the requisite laboratory testing may never be performed. This is the first published study for risk assessment of leptospirosis among U.S. Army soldiers assigned to the ROK. The distribution of the demographic and assignment characteristics of interest in the Table is comparable to the overall infan - try population and other studies of Army infantry forces in ROK.11,12 The results sug - gest a 0.9% seroconversion to which is higher than the 0.2% seroconver - sion to scrub typhus and Japanese encepha - litis among U.S. infantry forces in ROK.11,12 The standard microscopic agglutina - tion test (MAT) is technically complex and time consuming and the culturing of live Leptospira to obtain the whole cell antigen is particularly labor intensive and requires special precautions to prevent infecting laboratory staff. In this study, ELISA was used instead of MAT because ELISA is much easier to perform and can test a large number of samples at the same time. Because the ELISA assay was about 90% sensitive as compared to MAT, it is likely there were some false negatives among the tested specimens. The 0.9% rate of seroconversion suggests a low but not zero level of risk for leptospirosis for infantry soldiers in the endemic region of the ROK. These results also indicate that some U.S. military personnel were exposed to leptospires before their assign - ment to ROK, as evidenced by the number of soldiers whose pre-tour serologic tests were positive. Currently, there is no human vaccine available for leptospirosis in the U.S. The early diagnosis of the disease is impor - tant as antibiotic therapy with doxycycline or penicillin provides the greatest benefit when initiated early in the course of ill - ness. The delay of antibiotic treatment of leptospirosis leads to higher morbidity and mortality. Soldiers who might be at an increased risk for infection should be educated on exposure risks and advised to consider preventive measures such as che - moprophylaxis; wearing protective cloth - ing, especially footwear; and covering cuts and abrasions with occlusive dressings. Limited studies have shown that a weekly regimen of doxycycline before and con - tinuing through the period of exposure can be used to prevent leptospira infec - tions in endemic areas.13-15 Military doc - tors should have heightened awareness of the possibility of leptospirosis in field set - tings worldwide and also when freshwa - ter exposure occurs during training in the U.S. Author affiliations: Naval Medical Research Center, Silver Spring, MD (Dr. Chen, Ms. Zhang, Ms. Belinskaya, Dr. Ching).

MSMR Vol. 25 No. 8 August 2018 Page 16 The Department of Defense (DoD) Global Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance Program annually monitors the genetic diversity of influenza viruses circulat - ing in DoD beneficiary populations. This program relies on a global network of partners across the DoD to submit respiratory specimens throughout the influenza season. In previous seasons, representative specimens for sequenc - ing were chosen because of cost and time restrictions associated with reli - ance on Sanger-based sequencing technology. The effect of this specimen prioritization for sequencing has not been previously examined in the respi - ratory surveillance program. Here, specimen prioritization was simulated by iteratively subsetting sequencing data sets from 1 October 2013 through 15 March 2017 to determine how prioritizing affects common metrics of genetic diversity. Prioritization of specimens did not meaningfully affect cal - culations of average influenza genetic diversity within seasons or subtypes. Because of the high genetic diversity of influenza, prioritizing resulted in fewer unique viruses and less accurate measures of geographic relationships although it still provided relevant estimates. Given the advent of cost-effective next-generation sequencing approaches, all programs should carefully con - sider how best to prioritize influenza sequencing to recover meaningful information on the evolutionary dynamics of the virus. Sampling Considerations for Detecting Genetic Diversity of Influenza Viruses in the DoD Global Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance Program Anthony C. Fries, PhD; William Gruner, MS; James Hanson, MS Genetically diverse influenza viruses represent an ever-evolving target requiring global efforts to track changes and monitor emerging strains.1 The Department of Defense (DoD) Global Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance Pro - gram is an effort that annually monitors the circulation of influenza viruses in DoD healthcare beneficiaries by utilizing a net - work of collaborative partners across the military services.2 This global network pro - vides essential data, such as vaccine efficacy and genetic sequencing data, to collabo - rators at World Health Organization Col - laborating Centers (WHO-CC) such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to assist in their selection of repre - sentative influenza strains for vaccine com - position in subsequent influenza seasons. Within the DoD program, respiratory specimens are collected at military treat - ment facilities (MTFs) and are shipped to and cultured at the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) Epi - demiology Laboratory where influenza- positive isolates are sequenced. Sequenced viruses are analyzed to examine essential aspects of virus evolution such as char - acterizing amino acid substitutions and genetic divergence measures. Phyloge - netic trees are then constructed using sta - tistical models that summarize the genetic diversity of the viruses to identify trends in viral relationships and global movement of strains in relation to current vaccine strains. Each of these analyses relies on the genetic variation that is contained within the captured data set; therefore, large data sets from broad geographic localities typi - cally provide the most accurate representa - tion of evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses.3 In previous seasons, USAFSAM has utilized Sanger-based sequencing tech - nology, which has limited the ability to sequence every influenza isolate that was cultured from submitted specimens, espe - cially during the peak period of flu sea - son. Specimens were instead prioritized for sequencing by selectively choosing speci - mens based on criteria that maximized the geographic and temporal distribution of the data as well as capturing severe or vac - cine breakthrough specimens to efficiently and cost-effectively capture representative influenza genetic diversity. Other consider - ations included selection based on patient hospitalization and history of interaction with domestic animals. However, the effect of selecting representative specimens for sequencing on measures of genetic diversity has not been previously assessed in the sur - veillance program. In this study, sequence data were examined over four surveil - lance seasons to determine how speci - men prioritization may affect surveillance efforts. Additionally, the effect of a shift to more efficient and higher-throughput next-generation sequencing methods and its potential impact on future surveillance efforts are discussed. METHODS The surveillance period exam - ined was 1 October 2013 through 15 March 2017 and represents two A(H1N1) pdm09 (2013-2014, 2015-2016) and two A(H3N2) (2014-2015, 2016-2017) pre - dominant influenza seasons. All specimens discussed in these analyses were collected by the extensive network of partners within August 2018 Vol. 25 No. 8 MSMR Page 17 the DoD Global Respiratory Pathogen Sur - veillance Program. The surveillance popu - lation for this program consists of active duty members from all services as well as other DoD beneficiaries, including depen - dents and retirees. Respiratory specimens were collected at MTFs from patients who presented with influenza-like illness (ILI), which was defined as the presence of fever (>100.5\u00b0F) and either cough or sore throat within 72 hours of symptom onset. The USAFSAM Epidemiology Laboratory tested all respiratory specimens using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (CDC Flu rRT-PCR Dx Panel) or, prior to the 2014-2015 sea - son, an in-house laboratory developed test. In addition, specimens were cultured in primary monkey kidney cells for immuno - fluorescence-based testing and isolation of influenza viruses. In certain cases, sequenc - ing was attempted on the original specimen when priority specimens tested positive by PCR but were negative for culture. Influenza viruses were sequenced for the hemagglu - tinin gene using Sanger-based sequencing chemistry on ABI 3130xL genetic analyzers per protocols developed in collaboration with the CDC. Sequences were assembled and analyzed using DNASTAR Lasergene,4 BioEdit,5 and MEGA software.6 For this study, hemagglutinin sequence data sets were compiled by influenza season (October-May): 2013-2014, 2014-2015, 2015-2016, and 2016-2017. Sequences were limited to locations inside the conti - nental U.S. (CONUS) due to sample size considerations. To replicate the impact of specimen prioritization on measures of genetic diversity, an iterative approach was used whereby random subsets of sequence data sets were taken for a given season and subtype. Within a season, each sub - type (e.g., A(H3N2)) was randomly sam - pled 50 times by varying percentages (25%, 50%, 75%) to capture a representative dis - tribution of each molecular diversity mea - sure for each percentage level. These values were then compared to the observed values in the complete data set for that subtype and season. For example, there were 695 A(H3N2) sequences in 2014-2015, so 50 data sets were replicated with 174 samples each (i.e., 25% percentage level) chosen at random from the 695 in the complete data set. Genetic metrics (discussed below) for each data set were compared to the 695 in the complete data set. Here, resampling without replacement was chosen so as to not bias estimates of the nucleotide diver - sity of influenza viruses. The diversity at both a nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) level were character - ized using two categories of metrics that represent common measures of genetic diversity,7 including metrics that represent average, summary characteristics of the entire sequence data set and metrics that represent raw counts of differences in the sequence data set. Average or summary metrics included the probability that two randomly chosen haplotypes (i.e., unique sequences) are different (Hdnt and Hdaa\u2014 \"nucleotide or amino acid haplotype diver - sity, respectively\") and the average number of nucleotide or amino acid differences per site for two randomly chosen sequences (nt and aa\u2014\"nucleotide or amino acid diversity, respectively\"). Raw/count val - ues included the number of nucleotide and amino acid haplotypes (Hnt the number of polymorphic/variable otide or amino acid sites (locint and lociaa). Of note, for a variable site to be considered real in these analyses and not an artifact of potential sequencing error, the substitution needed to occur in more than 0.5% of the sequences for that given data set. Lastly, an analysis of molecular vari - ance (AMOV A) test was used to deter - mine whether the interpretation of the geographic distribution of influenza diver - sity would change due to prioritization. The AMOV A test uses a matrix of pair - wise genetic distances among haplotypes to measure the amount of the total varia - tion that may be attributable to some geo - graphic grouping (st).8 For this test, the sequences were divided into Health and Human Services (HHS) regions as this was more statistically appropriate than either state or MTF-level groupings due to the greater variation and often low sam - ple number represented at either the state or MTF level. The significance of each st value was assessed using a permutation framework where HHS regions were ran - domly assigned to influenza sequences, and the AMOV A was then rerun. The number of times that the observed st was greater than the permuted value (n=100) repre - sented the p value. All analyses were con - ducted using R version 3.3.29 with packages poppr,10 pegas,11 and adegenet12 (code avail - able upon request). RESULTS During the 4-year study period, USAFSAM sequenced an average of approximately 43% \u00b1 5% of influenza-pos - itive specimens received each season in the surveillance program. The data set ana - lyzed here consisted of 2,497 sequences. The number of sequenced isolates (isolates per subtype per season) ranged from one A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus in 2014- 2015 to 695 A(H3N2) influenza viruses in 2014-2015. For subsequent analyses, the A(H1N1)pdm09 data for seasons 2014- 2015 and 2016-2017 were removed due to small sample sizes from CONUS senti - nel sites (less than 20 per season), which affected calculations on the 25% data sets. The 100% category (i.e., non-subset) dis - cussed below represents the observed value of the diversity metrics for the entire sequenced data set for a given season. Genetic metrics varied among sub - types with the most diverse lineage being influenza A(H3N2) (Table) . Within sub - types, the summary values of and Hd did not vary across the subsetting percentages (Table, Figure 1) . These summary metrics did not meaningfully change across sea - sons within a subtype suggesting a con - sistent amount of genetic diversity for a subtype over the surveillance period. The raw count metrics of H and loci did increase as the size of the data sets increased (Table, Figure 2) . Of particular note, these sum - mary and count metrics should be inter - preted together. For example, Hdaa can be interpreted as having a 97% probability of observing a new influenza A(H3N2) amino acid haplotype for the next surveillance specimen in the 2016-2017 season. Addi - tionally, the number of loci did not always increase when the number of specimens for a given subtype was high (e.g., A(H3N2) 2014-2015) (Table) . This is an artifact of specifying a minor substitution frequency MSMR Vol. 25 No. 8 August 2018 Page 18 TABLE.

Fur - thermore, because the representative data set is subsetted to smaller numbers, the total number of sequences needed to clas - sify a substitution at 0.5% decreases. Using the AMOV A test, the amount of pairwise genetic diversity described in each subtype and season by region (st) indicated that the distribution of sequences collected from HHS regions explained a portion of genetic variation observed in the 100% data sets (Table, Figure 3) , although it varied across subtypes. This result suggests that prioritizing for geographically diverse locations to capture more genetically diver - gent sequences is worthwhile especially if one has small numbers of specimens in any given year. However, the st values in sub - set data sets were highly variable indicating inaccurate measures at smaller subsets and an increased likelihood of misinterpreting the geographic relationships of viruses when prioritizing (Figure 3) . All st values were significant at p 0.01. EDITORIAL COMMENT This analysis showed that metrics that quantify the average diversity of a repre - sentative data set (Hd, ) are well estimated when prioritizing specimens. This is unsur - prising, as diversity should not change as a function of the number of specimens col - lected because the mutation rate of the influenza virus is typically consistent in its host environment.13,14 To this point, even in the 75% subset category, a consistently high probability of observing new nucleotide or amino acid haplotypes was identified, regardless of subtype, with every additional specimen sequenced. Considering influenza's propensity to quickly sweep across the globe, surveil - lance systems must be vigilant for new and emerging strains and mutations.15 Each new mutation represents an opportu - nity for a strain to gain a selective advan - tage. Admittedly, many unique haplotypes result from one-off mutations (i.e., a single nucleotide or amino acid change) that are potentially deleterious or never observed again16 but still may be informative. First, one or two amino acid mutations can influ - ence significant phenotypic advantages.17 Second, models that predict how influenza will evolve in future seasons or what clades may dominate in subsequent years depend on accurate estimates of the frequencies of all mutations.18 Therefore, sequencing suit - able numbers of specimens to accurately represent mutational frequencies across the globe is essential for effective public health of both military and general populations.August 2018 Vol. 25 No. 8 MSMR Page 21 The need to sequence greater numbers of specimens is often offset by the effort to minimize costs. The recent advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) meth - ods offers a cost-effective mechanism which to genotype ever-increasing num - bers of specimens.19 With NGS onboarding in many key public health laboratories, it is now possible to quickly screen genotypes allowing public health agencies to identify specimens that are deemed worthy of fur - ther antigenic or phenotypic characteriza - tion. Additionally, NGS methods typically encompass full genome sequencing efforts that provide added information such as identifying reassortment events among strains20 and/or characterizing resistance markers albeit with greater bioinformatics demands.21 Nevertheless, while the cost of sequencing will continue to drop, prioritiz - ing influenza viruses for sequencing based on useful geographical, temporal, or clini - cal characteristics appears to be an effective means to capture influenza dynamics. Several limitations exist in this study. First, this work is not directly comparable to other WHO-CC surveillance efforts in that the USAFSAM surveillance population is comprised of highly-vaccinated, active duty service members that may be inter - connected and not representative of the broader general public. Second, given the sample sizes among subtypes and regions, the analysis was limited to CONUS, and the results and interpretation may change if the data were to include an OCONUS (outside the continental U.S.) perspective, which would likely increase the effect of geography on genetic diversity. Third, the interpretation discussed in this study is related only to the hemagglutinin segment and may change considerably if compared to nonsurface segments such as the matrix protein, which represents lower diversity but would still contribute additional hap - lotypes with increased sampling.22 Lastly, this analysis did not include any interpre - tation of the effect of subsetting sequenc - ing efforts in relation to phylogenetic tree building and instead only alluded to the diversity that goes into phylogenies. Future studies would be well served in considering the impact of subsetting data sets on result - ing phylogenies.
