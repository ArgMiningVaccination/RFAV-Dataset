We understand that you don't always want to leave home without your furry friend so our hotels are pet friendly. We have a few rules, to ensure the comfort and safety of all our guests, be they human, furry, fuzzy or scaled: - Additional $25 per pet, per day - No size or weight restrictions - No limit on number of pets allowed - Pets must be on leashes or in crates while they are in any public or common places within the hotel. - Dogs must not be left unattended by their owners while in the hotel. - Dogs are allowed in designated food or beverage areas only. - If your pet creates a disturbance or becomes aggressive to any guest or other person in the hotel, the owner agrees to remove the pet promptly from the hotel upon request unless a mutually acceptable compromise can be met. - The owners agree to be present or remove their pets from the room during housekeeping service or while any hotel staff is present in the room. - As has always been our policy, service animals are admitted with their owners regardless of time or stay. - Staying with us? Please notify the front desk prior to arrival if you will be bringing a pet. "}
