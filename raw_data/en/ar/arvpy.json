Theobromine is a bitter alkaloid which has been shown to boost the immune system, lower cholesterol and blood pressure as well as leading to euphoria and deeper spiritual connection. INGREDIENTS 25-50g ceremonial grade cacao, chopped or grated 100-200ml distilled water or plant-based milk 2 teaspoons of agave or vanilla syrup A pinch of Himalayan pink salt INSTRUCTIONS Whisk raw cacao powder into cold plant-based milk with a drizzle of agave or vanilla syrup and a pinch of salt (which balances the flavors) until smooth. Whisking the cacao into the milk before heating it allows it to dissolve completely (if you add it to hot milk it can clump up). Warm the hot chocolate on the stove and serve. Drinking cacao helps to open your heart chakra and so it's recommended to set an intention before drinking. "}
