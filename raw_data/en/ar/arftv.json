There are several reasons for increased cost of care including Increase in prevalence of chronic disease at young age, Increasing cost and complexity of diagnostic systems, increasing infrastructure cost for healthcare. Higher cost of healthcare services and diagnostics have made it very difficult for most of the poor and middleclass population all over the world to access good healthcare. In poor countries and growing economies general population is not able to afford long hospital stays and procedures. Even in developed countries where government provides free healthcare the cost burden on gov. is increasing with global economy becoming more competitive they are decreasing the subsidies. Several measures have been taken by developed countries to contain the cost of care including healthcare reforms, drug price control and different pricing models but still satisfactory results have not been achieved. Most poor patients even in developed economies are not able to pay for treatment of their chronic disease and for diseases which need long term treatment patient default leading to spread of drug resistance in diseases like tuberculosis. Like in court of law \"justice delayed is justice denied\" in Medicine \"treatment unaffordable is treatment denied\" Modern Healthcare System: Modern healthcare systems globally designed is a \"sick care\" system or a system which is focused on illness rather then prevention. Even for prophylaxis (Prevention from specific disease) like malaria we use chemical repellants not knowing what will be the long term effect of those on our lungs and immune system. We are using antibiotics to save our self from infections but also at the same time producing superbugs. Modern medicine has Increase life expectancy at birth but mainly due to decrease in infant mortality there is no evidence of improvement in life quality. Data suggest that overall average life expectancy at birth in olden days may be less but life span of adults was nearly same with better life quality. Prevalence of chronic disease is increasing with early onset age. We have saved our self from communicable and infectious diseases but at the cost of chronic diseases. Now heart problems and diabetes is no more a disease of rich and old population it is more prevalent in poor and young. Although modern medicine is effective in managing acute care but for chronic diseases there are no cure with life long treatments. World Health Organization estimates that 50% of the global burden of disease is chronic illness for which modern medicine has no answer. Traditional medicine can play a mainstream role : Traditional Medicine has developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine, It refers to health practices, approaches, knowledge and beliefs incorporating plant, animal and mineral based medicines, manual techniques and exercises, applied singularly or in combination to treat, diagnose and prevent illnesses Traditional Medicine has been used in different cultures since ages, in written record, the study of herbs dates back to more than 5,000 years to the ancient Sumerians and Indians. In India Ayurveda and Yoga has been practiced since ages by \"Ayurvedacharyas\" , Chinese and Japanese medicine has long history of success. The practice of midwifery was common in all the cultures. Prior to 1800, medicine in the United States was a \"family affair.\" Women were expected to take care of illnesses within the family and only on those occasions of very serious, life threatening illnesses were doctors summoned. Only in the early 1800s, both in Europe and in the United States, physicians began to practice. Even today 25% of modern medicines are made from plants first used traditionally. Most of the countries still use Home remedies and traditional medicine for primary care as per data available In China, traditional herbal preparations account for 30%-50% of the total medicinal consumption. In Germany, 90% of the population have used a natural remedy at some point in their life. 70% of the population in Canada have used complementary medicine at least once. As there was no proper method of teaching and documenting traditional medicine and it has been passed over from generation to generation there are issues in its formula, purity and effectiveness. There is need to improve traditional medicine using multiple approaches including develop national policies on the evaluation and regulation of traditional medicine and create a stronger evidence base on the safety, efficacy and quality of its products and document them. Best of Both the worlds: There is no doubt that modern medicine has been effective in managing acute care, controlling communicable diseases and in surgical and interventional procedures but it has limitations when it comes to cure of chronic disease and prophylaxis or day to day use for prevention of diseases. Modern medicine is desperately short of new treatments because drugs take years to get through the research and development pipeline, at enormous cost. Modern Medicine doctors and resources are also short all over the world. Traditional medicine has been tried and tested over centuries and have been effective in prevention and chronic care although there has been issues with lack of evidences and research. We should integrate the medicine across boundaries and traditions taking multi-faceted approach involving clinicians, traditional medicine experts, coaches, government representatives and experts from multiple disciplines work closely to create a healthcare system which is affordable and accessible for all There are Vested interest of pharma and healthcare businesses to make healthcare more reactive for their own benefits but as consumers we should push the change. Over one-third of the population in developing countries lack access to essential medicines. The provision of safe and effective traditional medicine and therapies could become a critical tool to increase access to health care. Modern medicine can be effectively be used for acute care, Surgeries, interventions and Traditional medicine should take the main role in preventing disease by herbal prophylaxis and lifestyle changes including balance eating habits , Yoga etc. Chronic diseases can be managed with Integrated medicine approach where both traditional medicines and modern medicine can be used together to improve outcomes and lower the cost of care. As we start focusing more on prevention and proactive approach to healthcare we will be able to contain the disease incidence and prevalence ultimately decreasing cost of care and above all improving quality of life.
