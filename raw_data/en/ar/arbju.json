About Dominique Stelling I am a transformational life coach and speaker with a private practice in Zurich. I offer in-person and Skype sessions internationally, focusing on the mind-body connection, the placebo effect and energy field dynamics to improve emotional, physical and spiritual wellbeing. I educate clients about the subconscious and how their thoughts alter their body chemistry and influence how they feel. With a variety of therapeutic tools, including neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), emotional-freedom-technique (EFT) and kinesiology, I help clients activate their self-regulating abilities, empowering them to take charge of their current situation and implement steps to transform their lives. The focus of my coaching and workshops is to help people find their individual key to unlock their authentic empowerment in order to rewrite their story. I help clients uncover fears, self-sabotage and victimization that are preventing them from reaching their full potential, while supporting them in becoming congruent and aligned with the changes they would like to experience. Together we identify the required steps, accountability and commitment needed to reach their personal or business goals. The personalised one-to-one sessions serve as a key to unlock the access to new experiences and possibilities, instantly leading to a increase in self-empowerment, happiness and personal fulfillment. I developed the P.U.R.E method (Problem, Understand, Reframe, Evolve) to transform and re-frame a current mindset, and the 3-pronged coaching approach T.E.A. (Thoughts, Emotions, Actions) to assist clients in understanding their behaviour and interactions. This cognitive-emotional approach builds the foundation for healthy interpersonal relationships and positive work climates. I have supported many individuals with issues such as: depression, anxiety, relationship and family problems; as well as corporate clients with work-related stress, burnout, leadership solutions and successful business development. Bio & Certifications Over the past 29 years, I have extensively studied the mind-body connection. I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from Boston University (1993), with a minor in south-east Asian religion and philosophy. I pursued a master's degree in clinical social work at Simmons Graduate School of Social Work, while interning at Beth Israel Hospital, both in Boston, Massachusetts. After completing the eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MSRB) program with Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, I developed a special interest in chronic pain management. I then studied myofascial pain dysfunction and trigger points at the Bonnie Prudden Institute for Myotherapy, Tucson, Arizona. My interest in the mind-body connection and the influence of the subconscious led me to complete a certification as an Omega Health Coach. This program formed the basis of my coaching philosophy, and led me to further my studies in related coaching concepts and therapeutic approaches, such as M-Joy Fields of Flow (Melissa Joy Jonsson), Introduction to Somatic Experiencing (Dr. Peter Levine), meditation methods by Dr. Joe Dispenza, Non-Violent Communication according to Marshall Rosenberg at CIEL Akademie, Zurich and a diploma in Buddhist Psychology and Spiritual Coaching with Lharampa Tenzin Kalden, in Zurich. I hold certifications as a Omega Health Coach (Dr. Roy Martina), Reconnective Healing Practitioner (Dr. Eric Pearl), Theta Healing Practitioner (Vianna Stabil) and Master Myotherapist (Bonnie Prudden). I am also a Bachflower Remedy Practitioner and have attended multiple seminars in Matrix Energetics (Dr. Richard Bartlett).
