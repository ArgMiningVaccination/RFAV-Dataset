County both remain high. According to health experts, both figures are likely to increase during the coming weeks because respiratory viruses spread more easily in the fall and winter. In light of this, as well as a new [L.A. City Ordinance (PDF)](https://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2021/21-0878_ord_187219_11-08-21.pdf) and existing California and L.A. County [Health Officer Orders (PDF)](http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/docs/HOO/HOO_SaferReturnWorkCommunity.pdf), [new UCLA protocols for restaurants and other public venues (PDF)](https://ucla.app.box.com/s/0r6d4403hvkqrctcvtdai12r9jvqpgip) will go into effect on Thursday, Nov. 4. Signs have been posted outside all of the affected campus facilities, including but not limited to restaurants, gyms, fitness centers, sports venues, museums/galleries, and performing arts theaters and venues. The full list of facilities can be viewed on the [UCLA COVID-19 website](/entry-to-campus-restaurants-and-venues/). Anyone 18 and older on campus will be required to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or proof of a negative test and have an approved medical or religious exception. This includes students, faculty, staff, campus visitors and event attendees. Each venue will have designated and trained staff who will clear people according to the following guidelines: UCLA students, faculty and non-Health staff Event/venue clearance through UCLA Mobile App UCLA students, faculty and non-Health staff can conveniently view their events and venues clearance through the UCLA Mobile App. This clearance includes the user's daily [COVID-19 Symptom Survey](https://uclasurveys.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3qRLtouCYKzBbH7) results, proof of vaccine or approved vaccine exception (in compliance with the [UC COVID-19 Vaccination Program Policy (PDF)](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/5000695/SARS-CoV-2_Covid-19)), or participation in twice weekly COVID-19 testing for those with an approved exception to the UC Policy.

Distribution details for the Badge Buddies will be provided this week. UCLA students, faculty and non-Health staff may also receive clearance using the guidelines listed below. Clearance for people other than UCLA students, faculty and staff coming to [certain campus facilities](/entry-to-campus-restaurants-and-venues/) (1) Proof of vaccination and photo identification Proof of vaccination for those 18 and older must be accompanied by one of the following forms of valid identification: - Driver's license - Government-issued identification card - School or work identification card - Passport (2) Verbal attestation of exception to COVID-19 vaccination, plus negative COVID-19 test no more than 72 hours prior and photo identification People seeking to use a vaccine exception must verbally respond to the questions in [Appendix B of the protocol (PDF)](https://ucla.app.box.com/s/0r6d4403hvkqrctcvtdai12r9jvqpgip) in order to enter a UCLA venue or event. Each venue will have hard copies of the self-attestation document available to show or read to patrons. Those who are 18 and older must also present a photo ID with the self-attestation and negative test no more than 72 hours prior. Protocols for UCLA restaurants While the new protocols allow for people with vaccination exceptions to enter these [affected UCLA facilities](/entry-to-campus-restaurants-and-venues/), anyone who dines indoors at UCLA restaurants must have an events and venue clearance certificate, UCLA Health Badge Buddy, or show proof they are fully vaccinated. If there are no outdoor seating options at the restaurant, unvaccinated patrons can dine indoors with a verbal self-attestation, negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours and photo identification. Patrons without clearance may also enter the premises for limited periods of time in order to use the restroom, order, pick up or pay for to-go food or drink, or perform necessary repairs, provided that they wear a well-fitting face covering at all times, and they must take the food to eat off premises. According to the new ordinance and UCLA protocols, children under age 12 are able to enter facilities and eat indoors without clearance verification. Guests are not allowed to enter UCLA residential dining halls, which are only for on-campus residential meal plan holders and staff at this time. As a reminder, visit the [COVID-19 website](/ucla-covid-protocols/) for other protocols still in effect on campus. Promoting the health, safety and welfare of all UCLA community members and campus visitors continues to be our highest priority. The next few months may pose some challenges, and we urge everyone to do their part to help keep our communities safer and limit the spread of COVID-19. Thank you for your continued cooperation.
