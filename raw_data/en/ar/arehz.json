We drink cold lemonade in summer and hot cocoa in winter. What's the drink for spring? Tea! Of course! Tea has long been used for all manner of purposes, some for medicinal, and some for ceremonial, and also for the health of both the body and mind. In Ayurveda, tea is used to balance the three doshas: Vata, PItta and Kapha. When the seasons change, there are higher chances that one or more of our doshas will increase or decrease, causing imbalance and potentially discomfort, uneasiness, indigestion, mental instability, and also illness. A simple remedy for this is herbal tea. The right kind of tea will balance Kapha, the specific dosha that tends to increase during Spring (Kapha dosha increase is responsible for mucus formation, congestion, colds, cough, runny nose, allergies, swelling, fatigue, and weight gain.) In addition to balancing all three doshas, the common herbs used in these recipes have other wonderful benefits. Spices such as ginger, black pepper and cardamom are excellent for improving digestion, while cinnamon is known to balance blood sugar. Cloves have been used for hundreds of years as a natural pain killer, and turmeric has regained popularity as a superfood for calming inflammation and encouraging regeneration of healthy cells. Drink any of these teas by the cup daily, or (better) prepare several servings in the morning, add tea to a large thermos, take to work and sip throughout your day in place of water. Reduce the amount of ginger if the tea is too strong.
