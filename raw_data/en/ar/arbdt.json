The therapist guides the client in concentrating on a troubling memory or emotion while moving the eyes rapidly back and forth by following the therapist's fingers. It is a well-researched and highly developed way to work with people who have experienced disturbing events in their lives and for whom the bad feelings, images and memories don't just go away. What is it used for? EMDR can be used to treat disturbing memories, panic attacks, sexual and/or physical abuse, stress reduction, depression, guilt, anger and post-traumatic reactions. I offer [EMDR](https://smbcounseling.com/emdr/) (1 hour) and [EMDR Intensives](https://smbcounseling.com/emdr-intensives/) (multiple hours). Care Credit financing options are available for EMDR Intensives. Thinking about therapy is an important first step that can make you feel vulnerable, anxious yet hopeful at the same time. Therapy is a process of collaboration between you and I to develop goals, identify your strengths and natural supports to address the issues that have brought you into counseling and explore how your life experiences have impacted your relationship with yourself as well as others. I often tell my clients your mental health is just as important as your physical and spiritual health. Therapy can be hard but rewarding work. There are no guarantees in therapy but even the smallest step toward change can be a tremendous leap in the right direction.
