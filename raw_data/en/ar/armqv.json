He offers acupuncture at his Phoenix chiropractic clinic as part of his services for a more healthy life. Acupuncture is one of the oldest healing practices in the world and is based on the Traditional Chinese Medicine principal that you don't have to know the biochemical reason to treat the imbalances in the body. It may relieve symptoms where traditional medicine has failed. Many believe that major organs in the body must be in balance to be healthy. While health is perceived as harmonious interaction, disease is interpreted as a disharmony in interaction. This disharmony can be caused by Qi becoming blocked. Qi is translated as energy flow or life force. Blocked qi causes pain, illness and generally derail your health.Before we get too involved in the explanation, just know that all injuries block Qi (interrupting the flow of energy) including cuts, sprains, broken bones, bruises and scars. bad eating habits, your emotions, too much medication and your environment can also block your energy. This is where acupuncture can be helpful. Acupuncture mainly encourages the body in the self-healing process and can help cure or prevent many illnesses. It involves penetration of the skin with very fine needles to correct imbalances in the body and has been helpful in relieving back pain, neck pain, treating anxiety, sleep disturbances and depression. A recent study has shown that acupuncture provides pain relief and improves function for people with osteoarthritis of the knee and serves as an effective complement to standard care. The study was funded by NCCAM and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, both components of the National Institutes of Health.

The needles used are regulated by the The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and manufactured and labeled to specific standards. The extra-fine needles must be sterile, non-toxic and used only by licensed practitioners. Practitioners should use a new set of disposable needles taken from a sealed package for each patient. Because the needles are made of metal and are hair-thin, most patients feel no pain or only minimal pain as the needles are inserted. Some people feel energized by treatment, while others feel relaxed. It is important that the patient keep still during treatment, so that needles are not dislodged. It is actually a very simple treatment that can generate significant healing in the hands of a trained and caring practitioner. Be sure to ask Dr. Alyesmerni if acupuncture could be helpful in your condition. "}
