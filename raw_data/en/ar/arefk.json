Appreciate all the hard work of our scientists, sacrificing so much of their time. You guys are heroes! Amazing, we value your countless contributions to saving lives. Looking forward to tuning in to tomorrow's episode. Appreciate these very informative sessions. Thanks, Lisa! It is really brilliant to see that Johnson and Johnson are gearing up for production worldwide for the vaccines once approved by PHE. I love my company, worked a lot of years being an inspector. Miss not working, I'm retired now. They will find a vaccine. The Human Genome Project began with the same spirit. Well done J&J for reviving that collaborative working. "}
