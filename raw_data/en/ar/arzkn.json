Formalin inactivated oil adjuvant bacterin vaccines were prepared from Pasteurella multocida A: 1. Th ey were grown in conventional broth, capsule enhancement medium, and under biofi lm mode. Four diff erent groups of birds were vaccinated with the respective vaccines by intramuscular ro ute, and the immunopotency of the vaccines was assessed by employing passive haemagglutination (PHA) and homologous challenging with virulent organisms. Th e PHA titres obtained for the biofi lm vaccine group on day 14 postvaccination were much higher than those for the other 2 groups.

Indiscriminate use of once eff ective antibiotics has led to drug resistance, making prophylactic immunisation the exclusive alternative to preclude the disease. In India several commercial vaccines are in vogue for pasteurellosis, but none of them provide a lasting and broad immunity. It was found that organisms grown under conditions mimicking in vivo conferred better immunity than ordinary laboratory grown organisms, plausibly due to the expression of cross protection factors (1). Bacterial biofi lms are a structured community of bacterial cells enshrined in a protective covering of exopolysaccharide and are increasingly similar to in vivo growth. Th ey express many novel proteins that could be the immunodominant antigens and, if used as vaccine, may result in a better immune response (2). Many researchers have insisted on the use of a virulent form of bacteria for the preparation of inactivated vaccines (3). Capsule is an important virulence factor for avian P . multocida (4). Serum was found to enhance the capsule formation of bacteria and yeast (5), and such capsule enhanced organisms will be benefi cial for vaccine production. Th e present study was conducted to compare the immunopotency of vaccines employing P. multocida biofi lms and capsule enhanced organisms with ordinary broth grown organisms in 1-month-old ducklings by measuring the humoral immune response and the protection conferred by each vaccine during homologous challenge with virulent organisms. Materials and methods Vaccine strain: Th e Pasteurella multocida A: 1 strain Kerala, India); serotyped at IVRI, Izatnagar; and maintained in the Department of Veterinary Microbiology, College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (COV AS), Mannuthy, was used for the entire study. Pathogenicity in mice and lethal dose in ducklings Five mice 6 to 8 weeks old were inoculated with 0.3 \u00d7 10 8 organisms/0.1 mL of phosphate buff ered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) by intraperitoneal route, keeping appropriate controls. Median lethal dose (LD 50) of DP1 was determined in 1-month-old Pasteurella multocida A: 1 strain was passaged in mice to get a fully encapsulated virulent form, and the virulent organisms isolated from mice were made into serial 10 fold dilutions. Th e 1-month-old ducklings were randomly assigned to 9 groups of 6 ducklings each. Th e fi rst 8 groups were separately inoculated with the diff erent dilutions of the bacteria, with a dose of 0.1 mL per bird subcutaneously at the wing web; the ninth group served as control and was sham inoculated with 0.1 mL of sterile PBS (pH 7.4). Mortality was recorded 1 week postinoculation. All the dead ducklings were examined for specifi c gross lesions caused by P . multocida , and reisolation of the organism on blood agar from heart blood, liver, and spleen was attempted. Th e method described by Reed and Muench (6) was used for LD 50 calculation. Preparation of bacterial suspensions for vaccine preparation Th e freeze-dried stock DP1 was reconstituted with 0.5 mL of Tryptone soya broth (TSB), streaked onto dextrose starch agar (DSA), and following an incubation period of 24 h a typical colony was selected for the preparation of bacterins. Th e organisms were grown under the following 3 conditions: (a) 3% TSB for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C, conventional vaccine (CV); (b) 3% bovine serum (FBS) and 0.5% yeast extract for 12 h at 37 \u00b0C, capsule enhanced vaccine (CEV); and (c) TSB (0.32%) supplemented with 0.3% bentonite clay for 3 days at 42 \u00b0C, biofi lm vaccine (BV). Organisms grown in TSB (3%) and under capsule enhancement conditions were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 \u00d7 g for 10 min, washed 3 times in the PBS (pH 7.4), and were then resuspended in 0.5% formol saline to a concentration of 3 10 9 cells/ mL. Th e biofi lm bacterin was prepared as described by Vadakel (7). Briefl y, the bacteria were cultured in Tryptone soya broth (0.32%), supplemented with 0.3% bentonite clay powder (Merck, Mumbai), for 3 R. RAJAGOPAL, G. K. NAIR, M. MANGATTUMURUPPEL, J. LEO, S. R. MAPRANATH 369days at 42 \u00b0C. Th e attached bacterial mass was then harvested by low speed centrifugation (600 \u00d7 g for 10 min), washed several times, and separated from the bentonite clay by vigorous vortexing. All bacterial cultures thus prepared were allowed to stand at room temperature for 48 h, with occasional shaking, so that the formalin could act. Th e sterility of all the bacterins was tested on blood agar at 37 \u00b0C for 72 h under 5% carbon dioxide. Preparation of vaccinesOil adjuvanated vaccines were prepared from the above bacterins, and the stability of vaccines was assessed (8). Th e sterility of the prepared vaccines was tested individually in blood agar and Tryptic soy agar (TSA), modifi ed thioglycolate medium, and Sabouraud's dextrose agar (SDA). Th e toxicity of the vaccines was assessed by injecting the exact dose (0.5 mL) and a double dose of vaccine intramuscularly into 3 ducklings each. Th e vaccinated birds were observed for a period of 7 days for any untoward reactions or clinical manifestations. Potency testing in ducklings A total of 160 ducklings 4 weeks old purchased from a private breeder were divided into 4 groups with 40 birds each. Th e vaccination schedule was as follows: Group I: Conventional vaccine (CV)Group Group IV: fi rst 3 groups were inoculated intramuscularly in the thigh region with the respective vaccines (0.5 mL/bird). Th e control group was sham vaccinated with PBS (pH 7.4). Serological assayCollection of serum from vaccinates: Blood was collected from all 160 ducks at weekly intervals up to the 28th day postvaccination (PV) and on day 42 PV by cardiac puncture or by jugular venipuncture; serum was separated from each blood sample. Passive haemagglutination (PHA)Passive haemagglutination was performed using sheep red blood cell (SRBC) fi xed with glutaraldehyde and sensitised with sonicated antigen of P . multocida . Sonicated antigen was prepared as described by Ireland et al. (9), excepting the addition of egg white lysozyme. Passive haemagglutination was performed using the method of Sawada et al. (10). Homologous challenging of birds postvaccination: From each vaccinated group, 10 birds were subjected to homologous challenge by intramuscular route with 0.1 mL of inoculum containing 200 LD 50 and 100 LD50 of fully encapsulated virulent form of P . multocida serotype A: 1 on the 28th and 42nd day PV , respectively. Th e challenged birds were observed for a period of 2 weeks postchallenge for mortality/clinical signs. All dead birds were examined for specifi c lesions of pasteurellosis, and reisolation of the organism on blood agar from heart blood, liver, and spleen was attempted. Statistical analysis: A one-way analysis of variance (ANOV A) of the logarithm of IHA titres of sera collected from the ducks on diff erent days was done to compare the immunopotency of the vaccines. Th e signifi cance of mean diff erences between vaccine groups was tested using Bartlett's test. Results Pathogenicity and lethal dose testing in mice and ducklings Pasteurella multocida serotype A: 1 killed the mice within 8 h when injected by intraperitoneal route. Th e median lethal dose was 10 7.4/0.1 mL subcutaneous dose (Table 1). Biofi lm formation of DP1 Th e organism adhered over the inert material, bentonite clay, under nutrient restricted conditions; the biofi lm formation peaked on day 3, with a mean plate count of 1.54 \u00d7 10 6 CFU/g of bentonite clay. Preparation of vaccinesAll the prepared vaccines were homogeneous suspensions, which facilitated intramuscular administration. Th e prepared vaccines were sterile and did not cause any untoward eff ects except for a transient lameness in ducks, which subsided aft er 1 day postinoculation. Passive haemagglutination (PHA) Antibodies were detected in the postvaccination sera Immunopotency of novel oil adjuvant vaccines employing Pasteurella biofi lm and capsule enhanced organisms in ducklings 370as early as 7 days in the fi rst 3 vaccinated groups, and the titre increased during subsequent days, although the pattern diff ered on diff erent days. Th e control group, which was sham vaccinated with PBS, did not reveal many antibody titres irrespective of the day of collection. Th ere was no signifi cant diff erence in mean titres among the groups during the seventh day. At day 14 the PV biofi lm group was signifi cantly diff erent from the other 2 vaccine groups and the control. By days 21 and 28 all the vaccine groups were similar. At day 42 the biofi lm vaccine group was found to maintain the titres while the titres of groups I and II decreased, making them signifi cantly diff erent. All the vaccine groups showed a signifi cant diff erence from the control group at all stages of the study. Groups I and II had no signifi cant diff erence in the mean titre during the entire study. Notably, only the biofi lm group was able to maintain its titre up to the 42nd day. Th e mean logarithmic PHA titres of individual sera collected at days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 PV are shown in Table 2. Direct homologous challengeWhen challenged with a 200 LD 50 dose, more ducklings were dead in all groups; however, at both 100 and 200 LD 50 doses, the biofi lm group showed 10% more protection. CV and CEV revealed similar protection rates (Table 3). Th e postmortem examination of dead birds from all vaccine groups revealed gross lesions that were less severe than those in the control group.

LEO, MAPRANATH 371Discussion Th e P . multocida A: 1 strain used in this study was found to be an in vitro biofi lm former. However, it was very diffi cult to obtain enough biomass for vaccine preparation. As a result, the biofi lm mode of growth was fi rst induced, and then it was subcultured onto nutrient agar. Bacteria were found to retain the biofi lm mode of growth for a few subcultures in agar media, which was consistent with the fi ndings of Kaplan and Mulks (11) in the case of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae fi eld isolates. Th is modifi cation is useful, as it makes the process of vaccine preparation more amenable to commercial production of the vaccine. It is interesting to note that the pattern of antibody response elicited by BV simulates subunit vaccines employing outer membrane proteins (12) and live vaccines (13). Th e antibody response was unusually rapid; it peaked during the 14th day PV and also maintained a reasonable titre during the entire period of study (45 days). Th is may be attributable to the uncanny semblance of biofi lms to conditions in vivo and the better presentation of antigens. Organisms grown in vivo express the cross protective factors that make them capable of providing a broader immunity in terms of heterologous protection (14). Biofi lms exhibit many novel proteins that are conserved, and out of these many could be immunodominant (15). Most of the bacterial diseases involve biofi lm formation inside the host body, and the presentation and familiarisation of such epitopes to the host body may be a reason for the better immune response of biofi lm vaccine. To exploit the expression of novel heat shock proteins and simulate the natural body condition of the birds, biofi lm cultures in the present study were subjected to nutrient limitation and a higher temperature (42 \u00b0C) (16). Sometimes even if antibodies against a particular organism are present in the host body, they may not be capable of providing the host with suffi cient protection against biofi lm mediated infections (17). Th is highlights the importance of familiarising the host body with antigens specifi c to biofi lm, which may not be present in planktonic bacteria. Shivaraj (18) reported an exceptional 83.33% protection for a biofi lm based oral vaccine for E. coli ; the conventional vaccine could induce only 33.33% protection. Although the BV in the present study did not produce such an enormous improvement over the conventional vaccine, it did ensure 10% more protection than both CV and CEV . CV and CEV revealed similar titres and protection rates, in accordance with the fi ndings of Ramanatha (19) and Akand et al. (20). With capsule enhancement no added advantage was obtained, which was consistent with the fi ndings of Somarajana et al. (21). Conclusion In conclusion, the biofi lm vaccine was the best among the 3 vaccines examined in the present study, as it provided stronger and lasting immunity. Th e protection rates of capsule enhanced bacterin Table 3. Homogeneous challenge with 200 and 100 LD50 doses of virulent DP1 in ducklings.

Th e present study is only a preliminary investigation and provided some information on the biofi lm formation of P . multocida and the utility of its biofi lm as vaccine. Outer membrane subunit vaccines were found to be eff ective by various researchers, and they would be more eff ective if the outer membrane proteins of biofi lm cells were used.
