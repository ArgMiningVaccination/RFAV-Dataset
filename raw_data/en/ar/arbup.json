To date, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19 disease) infection has resulted in >1 million deaths nationally, including [>1,800 deaths in the state of Hawaii](https://health.hawaii.gov/coronavirusdisease2019/). COVID-19 may include mild symptoms, but may result in life-threatening disease in [high-risk individuals](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-care/underlyingconditions.html), including pregnant women, newborn infants, persons >50 years old, or those with chronic heart or lung disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer, organ transplant, or immunodeficiency. Prevent the Spread of COVID-19. If everyone were to take all [steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19](https://health.hawaii.gov/coronavirusdisease2019/what-you-can-do/how-to-prevent-the-spread-of-covid-19/). this would help to lower COVID-19 transmission in the community, among family members, friends, co-workers, students, and further limit spread at religious, social and business gatherings. Elect to wear a mask when entering healthcare or long-term care facilities to protect patients and residents. [End of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE)](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/09/fact-sheet-end-of-the-covid-19-public-health-emergency.html#:~:text=That%20means%20with%20the%20COVID,the%20expiration%20of%20the%20PHE.): Based on current COVID-19 trends, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is planning for the federal PHE for COVID-19, declared under Section 319 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, to expire at the end of the day on May 11, 2023. Since January 2021, the Biden-Harris Administration has made lifesaving treatments widely available, with more than 15 million courses administered. According to HHS, COVID-19 deaths have declined by 95% and hospitalization down nearly 91% due to the accessibility of vaccines and treatments. Access to these life-saving treatments and preventive methods remains a public health priority and therefore, access to COVID-19 vaccination and certain treatments, such as Paxlovid (ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir) and Lagevrio (molnupiravir), will generally not be affected beyond the end of the COVID-19 PHE. The Hawaii Department of Health (HDOH) will continue to work with the U.S government (USG) to distribute treatments to healthcare facilities to allow for COVID-19 treatments to remain widely available and cost-free for our community while supplies last. If you are a healthcare provider seeking to procure and distribute USG-supplied COVID-19 therapeutics, please fill out this [COVID-19 Therapeutics Provider Onboarding Form](https://forms.office.com/g/in2Y7bidrR) and our HDOH COVID-19 Therapeutics Team can assist you with the onboarding process. Preventative Options for COVID-19 Vaccination: Essential preventive steps include staying [up-to-date](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) with your COVID-19 vaccinations and getting an annual flu shot; both dramatically lower the risk of hospitalization and death. Being up-to-date also protects [elderly and other high-risk individuals](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-care/underlyingconditions.html). For answers to many COVID-19 vaccine questions and/or concerns, click [here](https://health.hawaii.gov/coronavirusdisease2019/what-you-should-know/covid-19-vaccine-frequently-asked-questions/). New Vaccines & Variants: New [bivalent COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html#%3A%7E%3Atext%3DCDC%20recommends%20that%20people%20ages%2CAn%20original%20(monovalent)%20booster) can provide protection against the circulating. These updated vaccines are safe and effective, can lower the risk of [\"long\" COVID](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html), and the risk of hospitalization and death. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis: As of January 26th, 2023, [Evusheld](https://aspr.hhs.gov/COVID-19/Therapeutics/Products/Evusheld/Pages/default.aspx) is no longer authorized by FDA for use as pre-exposure prophylaxis in the U.S. Therapeutic Management for Non-Hospitalized Patients with Mild-to-Moderate COVID-19 (Outpatient): [Outpatient Treatment of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-care/outpatient-treatment-overview.html): For adults who are at high risk of progression to severe disease, antiviral therapeutic options are available to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death. Oral [Paxlovid](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/antivirals-including-antibody-products/ritonavir-boosted-nirmatrelvir--paxlovid-/) or Intravenous [Veklury](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/antivirals-including-antibody-products/remdesivir/) are the preferred treatment options for high-risk adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 (see [Table 2a.](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/management/clinical-management-of-adults/nonhospitalized-adults--therapeutic-management/)). Alternative treatments include oral [Lagevrio](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/antivirals-including-antibody-products/molnupiravir/) if preferred treatments are not available. For additional information on COVID-19 Therapeutics, please refer to the [Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) webpage](https://aspr.hhs.gov/COVID-19/Therapeutics/Pages/default.aspx) for more resources. NIH treatment guidelines for children are found [here](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/tables/therapeutic-management-of-nonhospitalised-children/). The current therapeutics: Paxlovid, Veklury, and Lagevrio are expected to retain activity against all circulating variants based on current data. Convalescent Plasma: The use of [COVID-19 convalescent plasma](https://www.fda.gov/media/141478/download) with high of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody is for treatment in immunocompromised patients. Antibiotics and Corticosteroids Contraindicated: NIH Guidelines recommend against the use of systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 as there are higher risk of adverse events no demonstrated benefits to administering these medications in the absence of another indication. (see [Table 2a.](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/management/clinical-management-of-adults/nonhospitalized-adults--therapeutic-management/) and [CDC](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2022/han00463.asp) or [HDOH](https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/files/2022/05/Medical-Advisory-COVID19-Therapeutics-05112022.pdf) advisory). COVID-19 Therapeutic Product Expiration Dates: The U.S. FDA authorized an extension to the shelf life for certain lots of COVID-19 therapeutic products. The [Searchable COVID-19 Therapeutics Database](https://aspr.hhs.gov/COVID-19/Therapeutics/Pages/Product-Expiry.aspx) can be used to determine the extension of expiration dates for the following COVID-19 therapeutic (REGEN-COV, Bam/Ete, Sotrovimab, Bebtelovimab, and Evusheld) are routinely tested against variants.
