You have no idea how does it help me to reduce the anxiety. Also, I have sleeping problems and balance helps me to sleep better than before. Unfortunately I cannot unlock the app, but those unlocked meditations are great. Incredible app. It has really helped me manage my ADHD symptoms. Doing anything consistently is hard but if you can do anything regularly, let it be meditation. Even 5 minutes a day helps. They're sneaky with subscriptions. I planned on canceling after the free trial because I didn't use the app often enough. 3 days before the subscription was set to renew, the app changed my status to \"non-member\" despite having access to the full catalog and there was no option to resubscribe had I wanted to. I found this odd and checked through the play store- it was still set to renew at full price (I canceled). You have to cancel through the play store. The app lies. That should be illegal. This apps' idea of personalized meditation makes no sense when you can't even rate the session with stars let alone a detailed survey. Trying to get to a more relative and personalized session has left my mental health in a worse state. I feel the beginning sessions are asking for too much. \"Try to think outside those thoughts\" Um if I could do that I wouldn't have the problems I am having right now. I can't figure out how to do that without completely dissociating from reality but no explain. I don't believe this app is compatible with my Samsung Galaxy (android). The meditations were great for the first two weeks. When I started Foundations III, I became aware of disruptive \"hiccups\" in the audio, which I (also) noticed in some of the Single guided meditations. Too bad.
