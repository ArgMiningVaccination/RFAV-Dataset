Information for health care providers Visit [information for health care providers](/info-details/monkeypox-information-for-health-care-providers) for details on smallpox/mpox vaccine (JYNNEOS) administration, eligibility, and availability in Massachusetts. About the JYNNEOS vaccine When properly administered before or soon after exposure, vaccines can help protect against mpox illness. The vaccine most commonly used for preventing mpox infection is JYNNEOS (also known as Imvamune or Imvanex) which has been licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In the United States, there is now ample supply of JYNNEOS, being solely distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Massachusetts has received several allocations of JYNNEOS from the CDC since the beginning of the outbreak in 2022, and has made those doses available to provider sites across the State. On August 9, 2022, CDC and FDA released an EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) allowing an alternative dose vaccination regimen in people 18 years and over and allowing the use of the JYNNEOS vaccine in individuals younger than 18 years. The original JYNNEOS approval included the use of two 0.5 mL doses administered subcutaneously (under the skin). The alternative regimen allows the use of two lower doses, 0.1 mL of vaccine administered intradermally (into the skin). Providers administering JYNNEOS vaccine should begin utilizing this alternative dose vaccination regimen as of August 18, 2022. People who get vaccinated should continue to [protect themselves from infection](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/prevention.html) by avoiding close, skin-to-skin contact, including intimate contact, with someone who has mpox. Data on JYNNEOS can be found on the [CDC website](//www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/smallpox-monkeypox.html#smallpox-). The CDC has also made available the live replicating smallpox vaccine ACAM2000. However, this vaccine has a number of characteristics that may make it unsuitable for use in the current context, including considerably greater risk to the recipient compared with JYNNEOS. Data on ACAM2000 can be "}
