They have been used to treat a variety of ailments over several millennia, particularly in parts of Asia and India. While they're experiencing a resurgence in wellness practices today, adaptogenic herbs can only do so much. \"There's a misnomer that adaptogenic treatments are [used] instead of Western medicine,\" says Cara Feldman, the administrative director of University of Vermont Integrative Health. \"But it's not alternative medicine. We really emphasize the best of both worlds.\" Learn more about the different types of adaptogens, their benefits and how you can include them in your wellness routine safely and effectively. What Are Adaptogens? Adaptogens are plant substances (often herbs) that have been found to help our bodies manage stress and maintain balance, or homeostasis. In other words, they help us adapt to [ external stressors](https://www.forbes.com/health/mind/what-causes-stress/). By strengthening our internal systems, adaptogens can promote vitality, stabilize mood and improve performance and focus. They can be consumed as supplement capsules, teas or tinctures. Adaptogens are meant to help our bodies build resilience to stress and mitigate its further affects on the body. They are not a cure, and they may not work in extreme or immediate cases of anxiety or depression. Further, adaptogens work best in addition to a foundation of a balanced diet and adequate hydration. How Do Adaptogens Work? Researchers say adaptogenic herbs interact with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is a complex system of glands, hormones and receptors in the human body. The HPA axis is central to the body's homeostasis, stress responses and energy metabolism. When we consume adaptogens, their organic properties and compounds work with the HPA axis to help balance our systems. If there's too much of one hormone, for instance, the adaptogens help to lower it. On the flip side, if there isn't enough of a hormone, adaptogens can help replenish its levels. Studies also suggest adaptogens interact with the immune-neuro-endocrine system, which helps the body regulate its use of energy and maintain strong immune defenses. It's important to remember, though, that research on adaptogenic herbs is ongoing. Popular Adaptogenic Herbs Adaptogens are generally known for stress relief, but each herb has its own unique properties that make it useful for specific ailments. For Stress and Anxiety [Ashwagandha](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/ashwagandha-benefits/), also known as Withania somnifera and Indian ginseng, is a shrub that's often used in Ayurvedic practices (an ancient Hindu system of medicine). Several clinical studies found ashwagandha can help reduce anxiety when compared to a placebo or other treatments\u2014often significantly.

Tulsi is known to promote focus and alleviate anxiety. One clinical trial found it significantly diminished generalized anxiety disorder in patients, as well as their associated stress and depression.

For Fatigue - Rhodiola, or Rhodiola rosea, can be found in high-altitude climates in Europe, Asia and North America. In two separate preliminary studies, researchers administered Rhodiola to doctors on night duty and students during an exam period. Results suggest Rhodiola can significantly reduce fatigue when compared to placebos. However, more research is still needed.

Both species of ginseng have resulted in significantly reduced fatigue levels among participants across several clinical trials. At least one study of American ginseng also supports its use in reducing cancer-related fatigue, especially in patients receiving cancer treatments.

For Immune Health - Tulsi, in addition to its anti-stress benefits, can also give your immune system a boost by helping regulate its responses. In one study, healthy participants experienced increased production of certain hormones and types of cells central to the immune system after receiving doses of an alcoholic extract of tulsi on empty stomachs.

Their immunity-enhancing properties have been observed in several studies testing reishi's effectiveness in treating cancerous tumors. Reishi mushrooms increased the number of certain white blood cells in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy; these participants also experienced improved quality of life with this additional treatment. Experts concluded that reishi mushrooms work best in tandem with other cancer treatments and cannot be deemed effective for tumor shrinkage when used alone.

Benefits of Adaptogenic Herbs Integrative medicine, and adaptogens specifically, can help fill the gaps left by Western medical practices. Adaptogens have thousands of years of historical use to back up their use, as well as increasingly informative modern studies. \"There's no substitute [for adaptogens] in Western medicine,\" says Andrea Fossati, M.D., an integrative healthcare specialist in Vermont. \"If I talk to a patient about using an adaptogen, it might be somebody falling through the cracks.\" Adaptogens help the body's internal systems build resilience for long-term wellness rather than providing a quick fix. For example, you might react to feelings of tiredness or fatigue by reaching for sugar, coffee or other stimulants. While these might help in the short term, they may actually deplete your energy over time. On the other hand, Rhodiola and ginseng can help slowly build up your body's ability to ward off fatigue. Potential Risks and Side Effects of Adaptogenic Herbs Adaptogenic herbs are nontoxic plants with gentle effects. However, some factors should be taken into consideration before you start consuming them. They may react with other medications. If you're taking prescribed medication, integrative health experts suggest talking with your doctor or consulting a naturopath or herbalist before adding any adaptogens into your routine. Your adaptogen of choice may react with the effects of your other medications. They aren't universally applicable. Don't take an adaptogen just because your best friend took it\u2014adaptogens can react differently from person to person, so research which one(s) could work best for your health. Further, consult your doctor or a knowledgeable health care professional if you are pregnant, breastfeeding or immunocompromised and considering taking adaptogenic herbs. They are better in lower doses. Experts recommend ingesting adaptogenic herbs in small doses each day over the course of six to 12 weeks (unless you're directed otherwise by your doctor). Taking larger doses in a single sitting may result in adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness or headaches. How to Add Adaptogens to Your Diet Safely If you make most of your own meals, you can add adaptogens in their raw forms or as powders to your favorite recipes. You can also find adaptogens in the form of teas, tinctures and supplements. Whichever route you go, always do your research before buying so you know you're ingesting a safe product. Learn about each brand, such as where they source their herbs, whether they are GMP (good manufacturing practices) certified and if they use third-party testing. ConsumerLab.com can be a great resource of information for a fee, but you can also call a company directly to ask questions. Natural supplement store staff members might also provide helpful information. Start slowly and stick to one herb at a time instead of trying several all at once. This way you can determine how each one does or doesn't affect you before deciding whether to try another one. Remember, adaptogens aren't meant to be a quick antidote to anxiety or fatigue. Rather, they help your body build resilience over time. \"Adaptogens are meant to be taken consistently for several weeks at a time,\" says Dr. Fossati. \"They are also meant to be stopped for a week or so, so you can stop and reacclimate.\" Adaptogen Supplements Supplement capsules may be one of the easiest ways to integrate adaptogens into your diet. However, the dietary supplement industry is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which means the quality of what you find on shelves can vary dramatically. Some may consist of a mix of several herbs, which may not produce an optimal effect. When researching supplement companies, also be sure to check for any heavy metals in their products, which you definitely don't want to ingest. Researchers have found certain dietary supplements contaminated with heavy metals like cadmium, lead and arsenic beyond daily intake recommendations, which can accumulate in the human body to a level of toxic exposure.
