Naturopathic Doctor Dr. Ellen Ines Millard is the new naturopathic doctor resident at Wild Oak Medicine. During her time at the internationally-acclaimed naturopathy program at Bastyr University, she actively pursued hours precepting with advanced oncologists, toxicologists, homeopaths, and herbalists. During her 4th year, she completed a 9 month internship at a water fasting clinic, True North Health Center, in northern California where she witnessed chronic disease reversal in only a few weeks of healthy food, water, and juices. She also spent time advance preceptoring under Dr. Holder and Dr. Riegle, two environmental medicine specialists who opened her eyes to how toxicity plays a role as a major leading factor in how disease can manifest and how important it is to detox regularly. More about Dr. Millard: During her graduate time in Boston, she better understood how poor nutrition and lifestyle choices directly leads to the manifestation of chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes. Over 50% of Americans have a chronic disease and almost all of these illnesses are preventable if the education is available and the lifestyle choices are followed. As a result, Ellen became president of a Food Injustice group that grew and donated thousands of pounds of crops each year to food deserts around Boston. She also put on cooking demonstrations and garden tutorials to maximize healthy food access to all. Knowing she wanted to advocate for food justice as some type of physician, she was determined to become a naturopathic doctor after she studied abroad in Ecuador and spent 3 months learning from an herbal indigenous healer. She completed her thesis on Conventional Western Medicine versus Alternative Plant Medicine, comparing the diagnostic, treatment, and recovery methods of both types of medical approaches. She quickly learned that she could blend the pros of both medicines to optimize healing for her future patients. In her free time, you can find Ellen doing any type of outdoor activity from mountain biking, skiing, horseback riding, paddle boarding, etc. She values her time with her family and community organizing events around ceremony, food justice, and healthy living.Dr. Millard's Location\u2014 432 Aviation Blvd, Santa Rosa, CA 95403 M-Th 10-5 and Friday 10-4 Naturopathic Medical Assistant Bio Coming Soon!
