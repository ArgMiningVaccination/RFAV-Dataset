Presence ~ Integration ~ Intention Ritual is something deeply embedded in the nature of human experience, that we have somewhat lost in the modern age. Across the world, rites of passage & transition ceremonies have been held to honor these important moments in the timeline of life. The heart of this space is to call in support to allow you to feel resourced in your process, while also taking time for integration and intention along the path. To both honor where you've been, and turn towards that great horizon with deeper support, presence & knowing. Holding intentional ceremonial space around these moments allows for deeper presence and integration of the process within us. To pause, and acknowledge how our path has brought us to this present moment, to engage with it intentionally. To call our ancestors closer, to ask for their support in the process. And to set intentions for this next phase of our journey in this life, with whatever it may hold. To be both humbled and inspired by this Great Mystery and gift of life. ...:...:...:...:...:...:...:...:...:...:...:...:...:...:...:... Personal Ceremony can be been held around transitions such as; BIRTH Prenatal & Postnatal ~ In many cultures, it is understood that at the turn of the third trimester, the soul of the individual enters the developing body. This is a deeply auspicious time to hold ceremonial space around the birthing process, as well as after the child has entered the Earth plane. Incorporating Astrology is another beautiful option during a post-natal ceremony. Metaphorical birthing of creative vision ~ entering into a new phase of life, embodying a new facet of the Self. Traditional ceremonies around personal birthing processes involve a naming ceremony, to take a new name that calls forward the energy you're cultivating within. DEATH Grieving & Honoring ~ holding ritual space before, during, or after the death process of a beloved. This traditionally involved an honoring of their life and the beauty they brought into this world, as well as a Fire prayer to call forward the ancestors that can help the soul of the individual transition easefully after death. This can be held as personal or small group space. Metaphorical death ritual, the closing of cycles ~ when we come to the end of a phase in life, this process allows for deep integration and reverence for what has been harvested in the time spent. To honor the lessons, awareness, and wisdom that emerged \u2014 and simultaneously bring closure and integration of the cycle. This can be in regards to endings of relationships, work, home, or general life transitions. REBIRTH Ritual space held around the endings and new beginnings in the timeline of life. Significant transitions such as changes in relationships, work, home, or general life changes. Allows for both integration and intention setting, as one door closes and another door opens. A way to presence the resonance of a moment in the timeline of life, and actively acknowledge the transition that's taking place \u2014 both internally and externally. These ceremonies are uniquely attuned to you, and can incorporate various different approaches to personal ritual that would feel supportive to share. The traditional flow of these ceremonies begins with an invocation of the four directions & the healed ancestors, to invite support to the transition process. Then, an intuitive combination of practices can be incorporated to best amplify the integration & intention of the ceremony. Some elements can include; Ancestral Connection ~ invoking and consciously connecting with healthy, healed ancestors to support and resource the transition process. Fire Prayer ~ Releasing energy and offering prayers for emotional, mental, spiritual, and physical healing. Letting go of what no longer serves into the fire, and calling in that which is to be transmuted into. Hap\u00e9 & cacao ~ plant medicine to support the clarity of mind and opening of the heart. One or both of these can be incorporated in an intentional, ceremonial way. Energy Healing & Somatic Release ~ space held around releasing energies and sense impressions that may be stuck in the physical or subtle/emotional body. Healing & transforming old energy, to make space for the new. Journeying & Soul Retrieval ~ drumming to enter into a theta state and access parts of the self that may have been lost due to past experience. Accessing the supportive powers of the Earth and ancestors to guide us. Astrology & Oracle readings ~ incorporating Tarot and/or Astrology to offer greater insight as to the path ahead, to allow for clarity and orientation within the process of transition.

BIRTHING OF THE DRUM Personal Drum-Making Ceremony The birthing of the drum is a profound process, with the intention of infusing the heart of the maker into the beat of the drum. Each time you play it, the connection deepens. Beauty in form. Together, we hold ceremonial space around the process of making the drum, infusing with intention, ancestral power, and animal medicine. Any other elements that feel resonant for the maker to include are involved in the ceremony itself, unique to your magical intention. We come together in private ceremony, calling in the healed forces of creation to birth the drum. We wash the skin in a body of water, and I show you how to create the drum by weaving it together, infusing it with your heart and care. Then you take home the finished piece, allow it to dry for a day. Full birthing process. ...:...:...:...:...:... Ceremony is personal, 1-on-1 space held with Teagan. Small groups of 2-4 people are also welcome. Drum sizes range from 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 18 inches in diameter. Cost of materials increases based on size, and type of animal skin. The Ceremony itself is sliding scale $111-188. Range is negotiable based on individual needs, factoring in additional cost of materials. ...:...:...:...:...:... Part of my own ancestral lineage healing process has been about reconnecting with the blessings & burdens of lineage. I come from a long line of drum players, of many forms \u2014 the heart beat of the drum runs in my bloodstream. The process of making these pieces has awakened ancestral memory in ways much bigger than me. It has become clear that this is a gift to be shared, a special ceremony intended to carry the heart of the drum outwards into the world. Feel free to contact Teagan with any inquiries about the process or materials. It would be an honor to share this ceremony with you. PERSONAL HEALING CEREMONY with Hap\u00e9 or Cacao Medicina Reiki Energy Healing & Sound Bath Gentle, powerful, personal healing space. This ceremony is a combination of gentle plant medicines such as Hap\u00e9 or Cacao, paired with the restorative practices of energy work and sound healing. The ceremony itself is attuned to your unique intention and needs, bringing in whatever elements resonate to support you in process. We come together in ceremonial space, inviting intention and ancestral connection into the experience. Then we share either Hap\u00e9 or cacao medicine, and gently transition into a restorative reiki energy healing and sound bath. Hap\u00e9 is a medicine traditionally used to cleanse and purify the physical and subtle energy bodies. It is taken through the nose with a special applicator called a Kuripe. The medicine itself is a mixture of plants ground to an ash-like substance, taken as a snuff to cleanse the system. Teagan personally works with a hap\u00e9 mixture of tobacco and the Tsunu tree, a gentle yet powerfully centering medicine from the Yawanawa tribe in Brazil, given to her by her teacher Kenewma to share with community. This blend is particularly attuned to clearing the mind and energy field, to enter into deeply meditative and healing states. It beautifully opens the subtle energy system to receive the vibrational healing of Sound, and Reiki Energy Work. Cacao is a more activating medicine, gently opening the heart and enlivening to body to bring about the healing energy of joy and love. It is a precursor to dopamine, and so its effects can be quite bubbly and opening for the energy body. This is more of an energizing medicine to work with, and allows the sound and reiki energy work to move through the body more vividly. Cacao is a beautiful medicine for cultivating self-love, and releasing the old experiences, patterns, or ways of relating that keep the heartspace closed. Personal ceremonial space held in the comfort of Teagan's home. Sessions are 60-90 minutes, and can be held as 1:1 or a small group. Price varies based on aspects and medicine included within the ceremony, however the typical range is $111-222 for the full time together. Please reach out if you're interested in coming together in this way, and speaking more about what elements you'd like to include in your personal ceremonial container. Much love and blessings \u2014 Teagan xx "}
