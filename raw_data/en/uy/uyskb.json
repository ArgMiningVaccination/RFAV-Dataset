Yoga mats, bolsters and blankets will be provided however, please feel free to bring whatever helps you get comfortable so you can relax into the experience.*** Exchange: $55 IMMERSE IN THE EXPERIENCE: Join us for this New Moon and to relax, bliss out, and set your new moon intentions. We'll breathe together with a pranayama to relax us into the present, chant mantra to quiet the mind, and experience a guided meditation to melt us deeper into the experience. From there we'll immerse in the vibrations of a sound bath, which will help create space for deep relaxation and the release of tension, stress, and stagnant energy. When we enter this tranquil and expanded state of being, the mind, body, emotions, and spirit have the opportunity to soothe, re-calibrate, and restore to inner harmony. From this place of harmony we can build, align and connect to a greater potential. REIKI OFFERING: Participants will be offered the gentle loving energy of Reiki in our Sound Experience. Reiki is the energy of unconditional love, and when tuned into, and directed by a practitioner it can support with health, harmony and healing on a mental, emotional, physical and energetic level. ABOUT THE GEMINI NEW MOON: Gemini represents mind, communication and our dual nature. When working with the energy of Gemini we work with the energy of the left brain; the analytical, logical, reasoning, and rational mind. But deeper then that we connect to our perception, or listening and our ability to share our truth in community. We'll work with the throat Chakra and voice to activate our ability to listen, share, and connect our dreams to our audience. ABOUT THE INSTRUMENTS: We will immerse in the soothing sounds of Tibetan Singing Bowls that have been hand crafted and blessed by Monks. These bowls are made of the seven metals that represent the seven visible planets, created with the intent to bring us back into harmony and resonance with the rhythm of life. We'll tune into the sounds of droning instruments, and enter a light trance as the monotones calm the mind and bring it to quiet. We'll bath in the vibrations of the symphonic gong, which holds the sounds of the solar system, as recorded by NASA, allowing us to transcend the physical. We'll chant to tune our own instruments, our voices and bodies, and calibrate our being to sound codes that support our mental, spiritual, emotional and physical health All this will happen within a soundscape of natural percussion instruments, infused with vibrational medicine. And as we entrain to these sounds we will come into harmony with the vibrations inherent in nature, in the planets, and in the cosmos.
