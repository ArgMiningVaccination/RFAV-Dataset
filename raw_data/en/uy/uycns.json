Similar to other medications, allergic reactions can occur during vaccination. While most reactions are neither frequent nor serious, anaphylactic reactions are potentially life-threatening allergic reactions that are encountered rarely, but can cause serious complications. The allergic responses caused by vaccines can stem from activation of mast cells via Fc receptor-1 type I reaction, mediated by the interaction between immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against a particular vaccine, and occur within minutes or up to four hours. The type IV allergic reactions initiate 48 h after vaccination and demonstrate their peak between 72 and 96 h. Non-IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation via activation of the complement system and via activation of the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 can also induce allergic reactions. Reactions are more often caused by inert substances, called excipients, which are added to vaccines to improve stability and absorption, increase solubility, influence palatability, or create a distinctive appearance, and not by the active vaccine itself. Polyethylene glycol, also known as macrogol, in the currently available Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, and polysorbate 80, also known as Tween 80, in AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines, are excipients mostly incriminated for allergic reactions. This review will summarize the current state of knowledge of immediate and delayed allergic reactions in the currently available vaccines against COVID-19, together with the general and specific therapeutic considerations. These considerations include: The incidence of allergic reactions and deaths under investigation with the available vaccines, application of vaccination in patients with mast cell disease, patients who developed an allergy during the first dose, vasovagal symptoms masquerading as allergic reactions, the COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy, deaths associated with COVID-19 vaccination, and questions arising in managing of this current ordeal. Careful vaccine-safety surveillance over time, in conjunction with the elucidation of mechanisms of adverse events across different COVID-19 vaccine platforms, will contribute to the development of a safe vaccine strategy. Allergists' expertise in proper diagnosis and treatment of allergic reactions is vital for the screening of high-risk individuals.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-03-05", "cleaned_text": "Allergic Reactions to Current Available COVID-19 Vaccinations: Pathophysiology, Causality, and Therapeutic Considerations [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030221](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030221) [When In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends an immunization schedule in children to receive a total of 10 vaccines to protect against 16 diseases before the age of two years [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00221)]. According to a recent study, the risk of an allergic reaction post-vaccination is estimated to be 1.31 (95% CI, 0.90-1.84) per million vaccine doses [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00221)]. In this study, age and gender were equal factors, although a slightly higher incidence was observed in females, but mortality was not reported. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), announced that the manufacturer's Special Drug Characteristics (SPC) insert for each of the currently available US vaccines should provide an accurate description of the vaccine's manufacturing process, and the amount and purpose of each ingredient or excipient substance that is contained in the vaccine [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00221)]. 2. Pathophysiology of Vaccine-Induced Allergic Reactions [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00221-f001)): [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00221)]. This activation of mast cells via Fc receptor-1 constitutes the hallmark of classical Gell and Coombs Type I of hypersensitivity reactions [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00221)]. This type of reaction is the most important and well-understood. Especially, type I reactions are mediated by the interaction between IgE antibodies against a particular vaccine component acting as antigen and usually occur within minutes or up to 4 h of exposure to the relevant antigen [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00221)]. This mechanism is confirmed by the specific IgEs detection and the increased levels of serum tryptase [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00221)]. The contained excipients are considered as the most probable cause of IgE-mediated allergic reactions, whereas the vaccine antigen and the residual non human protein should always be regarded as the less probable cause of the allergy, referring to the currently approved COVID-19 vaccine [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00221)]. [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00221), [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00221)]. [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00221)]. Notably, in MRGPRX2 activation of mast cells, the specific IgEs may remain undetected, and tryptase levels may be normal even in so serious Kounis syndrome [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00221)]. [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00221)]. They constitute the second most common type of hypersensitivity reactions, are cell-mediated and antibody independent, are derived from overstimulation of T cells and monocytes/macrophages and release of cytokines that cause inflammation, cell death, and tissue damage. Vaccines containing anti-microbial agents and ingredients, such as thimerosal and aluminum, can be followed by delayed reactions [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00221)]. For further understanding of the reactions caused by the current COVID-19 vaccination, it is important to consider all the above mechanisms and pathways. 3. Causality of Vaccine Allergy [Figure 2](#vaccines-09-00221-f002)). Excipients, according to European Medicines Agency (EMA), are constituents of a pharmaceutical form apart from the active substance [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00221)]. Excipients constitute inert substances that are added to vaccines and other drugs in an effort to improve stability, increase solubility, improve absorption, influence palatability, or create a distinctive appearance. Excipients can cause a variety of allergic clinical manifestations ranging from skin disorders to life-threatening systemic reactions. In particular, necessary excipients added to vaccines to stimulate a stronger immune response, stabilize the potency of the vaccine during transportation and storage, or to prevent contamination by bacteria, can further trigger allergic reactions. Consequently, excipients represent major contributors to the development of specific IgE-mediated and immediate reactions, associated with vaccines [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00221)]. Other excipients, like polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polysorbate, used to improve water-solubility in drugs, may also cause allergic reactions [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00221)]. The variety of excipients contained in various medications is depicted in [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00221-t001). Polysorbate and PEG excipients are components in many vaccines and in injectable medications [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00221)]. Immunoglobulin (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) can induce complement activation-related pseudo-allergy (CARPA), which constitutes a nonspecific immune response to PEGylated nanoparticle-based medicines [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00221)]. This pathway may be responsible for reactions to medications, such as liposomal doxorubicin and other drugs in clinical trials [ [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00221)]. [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00221)]. Delayed urticaria, angioedema, and nonspecific skin rashes have been reported frequently (5% to 13%) in patients receiving such vaccines [ [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00221)]. In the above reports, however, detailed and meticulous allergic testing to confirm an immune-mediated allergic reaction was not performed. 4. Types of Current COVID-19 Vaccines Worldwide [Table 2](#vaccines-09-00221-t002)). [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00221)]. Both vaccines use a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) carrier system to prevent rapid enzymatic degradation of mRNA and facilitate in vivo delivery [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00221)]. The added PEG further stabilizes the lipid-based nanoparticle carrier system by making 2000 lipid conjugates that provide a hydrophilic layer that be the allergenic cause for several reports of allergic reactions in patients receiving vaccines, steroids, and chemotherapeutics. Polysorbate constitutes the excipient in 70% of injectable biological agents and monoclonal antibodies [ [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00221)]. Unfortunately, soon after approval, severe allergic reactions to the mRNA-based vaccines that resolved after treatment were reported [ [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00221)]. [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00221)] is a viral two-vector vaccine based on the recombinant adenovirus types 26 and 5, which are two human adenoviruses\u2014a common cold virus\u2014containing the gene that encodes the spike protein (S) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to stimulate an immune response. They were biotechnology-derived and contained the SARS-CoV-2 S protein cDNA. The vaccine is given in two doses, with the second dose after 21 days. Apart from Russia, the Sputnik V vaccine is used, so far, by other countries, including Algeria, Argentina, Belarus, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Hungary, India, Iran, Israel, Palestinian territories, Serbia, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates. [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00221)] was developed by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products and the Chinese Wuhan Institute of biological products Sinopharm promoted by China's National Pharmaceutical Sinovac Biotech. Before its double inactivation with -propiolactone, the virus is cultivated in a qualified Vero cell line for propagation.The supernatant of the infected cells constitutes material on which the inactivation is applied. The vaccine is given in two doses, with the second dose after 21 or 28 days. It has been distributed to several Asian and African countries. 5. Mode of Action of Current COVID-19 Vaccines [Figure 3](#vaccines-09-00221-f003)): [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00221)]. The inactivated viruses maintain their ability to replicate in vivo with mild or no symptoms. The viruses effectively stimulate the immune system and induce a strong and persistent immune response that prevents infection. Inactivated whole virus includes the entire disease-causing virion (a complete, infective form of a virus outside a host cell, with a core of RNA and a capsid), which is inactivated physically by heat or chemically. The ensuing immune response is directed not only against the S protein, but also against many other SARS-CoV-2 antigens. These vaccines have several advantages, including low production cost, safety, absence of genetic manipulation [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00221)]. The Chinese Wuhan Institute of biological products Sinopharm, the Beijing Institute of biological products Sinopharm, and the Chinese company Sinovac Biotech produce such types of vaccines. [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00221)]. mRNA is transported into the human cell in various ways, mostly by lipid microvesicles (liposomes). mRNA vaccines mimic the natural infection of the virus, retaining only a short synthetic viral mRNA that encodes only the required antigen. The procedures to develop the mRNA vaccine include screening of antigens, optimization of sequences, modified nucleotides screening, delivery systems optimization, evaluation safety, and immune response assessment. The mRNA vaccine is far easier to create and design, faster to produce, and stimulates cellular immunity, as well as humoral immunity. [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00221), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00221)]. Usually, the virus-based vaccine is administered via intramuscular injection, but there are many interesting projects in administering the vaccine into the nose by inhalation or via other body parts. 6. General Therapeutic Considerations [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00221)] have issued clear safety recommendations regarding receiving the vaccine for those with a history of allergic reactions. The Center presented an algorithm to assist with decision-making regarding who can safely receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Individuals with common allergies to several medications, foods, inhalants, insect stings, and latex have the same chance to develop an allergic reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine. Those with a history of a severe allergic reaction due to any cause should be monitored for a 30-min observation period if vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine. Anyone with a history of immediate allergic reaction of any severity to any component of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines or to polyethylene glycol or polysorbate should not be vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00221)]. The questions that physicians should have in mind are related to previous severe or mild allergic reactions and include the followings [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00221)]: - Mild allergic reactions, such as hives, nasal congestion, rash, scratchy throat, watery or itchy eyes to any injection, or orally and locally given substance. - Severe allergic reactions, such as angioedema, cardiovascular collapse, including Kounis syndrome, cerebral manifestations, chest tightness, flushing, hives, laryngeal edema, loss of consciousness, low blood pressure (anaphylactic shock), shortness of breath, swelling of mouth, lips, tongue, throat, or wheezing to any oral, local or injectable medication (intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous). - Severe allergic reaction to a previously injected vaccine. - Severe allergic reaction to another substance acting as an allergen (e.g., food, venom, or latex - Severe allergic reaction to PEG or polysorbate. [32](#B32-vaccines-09-00221)], denoting that these drugs block histamine and adenosine-5 diphosphate receptors situated in platelet surface and can prevent platelet aggregation and thrombosis. Both, H-1 receptor antagonist rupatadine that disposes of anti-PAF and mast cell inhibitory actions, as well as H2-receptor antagonist, famotidine have been reported to be beneficial in COVID-19 [ [33](#B33-vaccines-09-00221)]. Supplementation with vitamin D3 and liposomal luteolin could also be useful as they can further suppress allergic inflammation and have also been reported to be beneficial in COVID-19 [ [34](#B34-vaccines-09-00221)]. 7. Treatment of Severe Systemic Allergic Reactions [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00221)]. For the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 11.1 cases of allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) occurred per one million doses, and specifically, 71% of them occurred within 15 min following the first dose [ [35](#B35-vaccines-09-00221)]. Risk factors, aggravating allergic reactions include previous severe anaphylactic episodes, uncontrolled asthma, mastocytosis, and other mast cell disorders. Additional factors include recent physical exercise, alcohol consumption, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or menstruation. Medications like beta-blockers, which are often used in cardiovascular diseases, leave unopposed the action of alpha-adrenergic receptors and can exaggerate the coronary spasm in anaphylaxis. Once anaphylaxis has occurred, epinephrine is the urgent drug of choice, and there is no contraindication to this in the treatment of anaphylaxis because it saves lives. The treatment measures and the order that should be applied are shown in [Table 4](#vaccines-09-00221-t004). The patients, with anaphylactic reactions, who have responded satisfactorily to the first epinephrine injection, could be discharged after 4-8 h following full resolution of the symptoms. However, patients who have received repeated doses of epinephrine need 24-h observation in case of any cardiac arrhythmias and delayed anaphylactic reactions occur [ [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00221)]. 8. Patients with Mastocytosis and Mast Cell Disorders [36](#B36-vaccines-09-00221)]. However, certain conditions affecting the cardiovascular or bronchopulmonary system, and chemotherapy or immunosuppressive drugs may increase the risk of infected patients developing severe COVID-19 symptoms [ [37](#B37-vaccines-09-00221)]. Therefore, physicians from the medical advisory board of the Mast Cell Disease Society, including the first author (NGK), recommended that patients with mast cell disease should be pre-medicated with an H1 blocker, such as cetirizine 10 mg for adults, one hour prior to the vaccination. However, these recommendations are based on currently available information and may be changed-updated as more clinical data become available. Previous consultation with the pediatrician or allergist is also advised. Some of the physicians also recommend diphenhydramine as an alternative if the individual cannot tolerate cetirizine with the caution that it can cause drowsiness and render some patients, especially the elderly, prone to falls and fractures. In the February 2021 statement of the World Allergy Organization Anaphylaxis Committee was suggested that pretreatment with antihistamines may mask initial symptoms of a reaction [ [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00221)]. In patients suffering from mastocytosis and mast cell disorders, a discussion with the mast cell disease specialist regarding H1 blockers and the correct dose to be given one hour prior tothe COVID-19 vaccine is advised. 9. The Second Vaccine Dose in Case of Allergic Reaction to First Dose [38](#B38-vaccines-09-00221)]. Despite the latter, split dose challenges have been recommended and used in various previously administered vaccines for which the investigators had obtained more allergy experience [ [39](#B39-vaccines-09-00221)]. 10. Vasovagal Symptomatology Masquerading as Allergic Reaction [40](#B40-vaccines-09-00221)]. Whereas, reactions to vaccines are numerically rare, often they can cause substantial fear and anxiety in the general population, contributing to decreased unwillingness to receive a COVID19 vaccine. Such reactions may masquerade as allergic reactions causing confusion in proper diagnosis and treatment ( [Table 5](#vaccines-09-00221-t005)). It is known that hypotension, syncopal reactions, and other vasovagal reactions are associated with fear of injections, including vaccines, and occasionally are encountered in susceptible individuals. Flushing, tremor, shortness of breath, tachycardia, hyperkinesia, and light-headedness are associated with anxiety and panic, and constitute symptoms masquerading as allergic reactions [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00221)]. Shortness of breath, throat tightness, and inducible laryngeal obstruction, such as vocal cord dysfunction, may also masquerade as anaphylaxis. Frequent episodes of vasovagal symptoms have been described in the human papillomavirus, meningococcal conjugate vaccine, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine. 11. COVID-19 Vaccination in Pregnancy [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00221)]. Experts are still debating if vaccines should, in general, be tested in pregnant women. Inadvertently, replicating vaccines have been performed in and around pregnancy because of unknown pregnancy status. Indeed, major vaccines have not been tested during pregnancy so far because of concerns that both the pregnant person and fetus would be at risk for any complications. The vaccines related to the Ebola virus, yellow fever, and rubella have shown that that contradictory messages around the safety of live vaccines in pregnancy have critical public health costs [ [42](#B42-vaccines-09-00221)]. On the other hand, restricting the use of replicating vaccines in pregnancy may delay or deny access to the only available protection against deadly diseases. Unvaccinated pregnant people may also slow epidemic control. Finally, uncertainty and worry around the safety of live vaccines may lead to terminations of otherwise desired pregnancies after inadvertent vaccination in pregnancy. Further advice could be obtained from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which is an independent group created by the CDC, and assist on who and when such a vaccine can be performed, as well as the indications and contraindications related to this specific vaccination [ [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00221)]. 12. The FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Adverse COVID-19 Events after the First Dose of Pfizer-BioNTech and ModernaVaccines [44](#B44-vaccines-09-00221), [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00221), [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00221)]. The CDC recorded 21 cases that were submitted to and met the Brighton Collaboration case definition criteria for anaphylaxis, corresponding to an estimated rate of 11.1 cases per million doses administered\u2014well above the expected frequency of a severe allergic vaccine reaction, which is 1.31:1 million [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00221)]. Four of these patients (19%) were admitted to hospitals, and three of them were treated in the intensive care unit. Seventeen (81%) were treated in the emergency department, 20 (95%) have been discharged home or had recovered at the time of the report to VAERS. According to VAERS data, deaths from anaphylaxis were not reported. The time of symptom onset was 13 min (range, 2-150 min), 15 patients (71%) had onset within 15 min, 18 (86%) had onset within 30 min. Seventeen (81%) of 21 patients with anaphylaxis had a documented previous history of allergic reactions to drugs, medical products, foods, and insect stings; and 7 (33%) had experienced an episode of anaphylaxis in the past, including one after receipt of rabies vaccine and another after receipt of influenza A (H1N1) vaccine. During the same period, VAERS identified 83 cases of non-anaphylactic allergic reactions, a term used to describe clinically identical allergic reactions that are not immunologically mediated. The clinical diagnosis and management are, however, the same. Commonly reported symptoms in non-anaphylactic allergic reactions included mild respiratory symptoms, itchy and scratchy sensations in the throat, pruritus, and rash. [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00221)]. Nine of these individuals had a documented history of allergies or allergic reactions, five of whom mentioned a previous history of anaphylaxis. 13. Potential Mechanisms of the COVID-19 Induced Allergic Reactions [48](#B48-vaccines-09-00221)]. Almost all vaccine components can be considered potential allergic reaction triggers [ [49](#B49-vaccines-09-00221)]. These include inactivated or killed viruses, and their fragments\u2014such as capsule polysaccharides, conjugating agents, preservatives, stabilizers, antimicrobial agents, and adjuvant and culture media used in the preparation of the vaccine. The sane applies for excipients, used in the manufacturing process, and any inadvertent contaminants introduced during the handling of constituting active immunizing antigens. However, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines do not contain syringe with rubber latex vial stoppers, culture-derived proteins from eggs, yeast, or gelatin used in viral vaccines to stabilize virus viability. All four described pathophysiologic pathways can lead to allergic reactions, namely, mast cell activation and degranulation as IgE/antigen through cross-linking of FcRI on mast cells, further resulting in complement system induction, activation of MRGPRX2 and overstimulation of T cells and monocytes/macrophages releasing cytokines. Indeed, atopic individuals who have a genetic predisposition to produce significant amounts of antibodies when simultaneously exposed to several allergens can have more symptoms than mono-sensitized individuals [ [50](#B50-vaccines-09-00221)]. Furthermore, IgE antibodies with different specificities can have additive effects, and small, even sub-threshold IgE numbers can trigger the inflammatory cells to release their mediators and induce allergic reactions. A condition that frequently occurs when the patient is simultaneously exposed to the corresponding antigens [ [51](#B51-vaccines-09-00221)]. Lipid Nanoparticles used in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines to protect mRNA against degradation may contain low levels (<2 mol %) of ALC-0159, which further contributes to nanoparticle stabilization by a steric mechanism through its PEG moiety [ [52](#B52-vaccines-09-00221)]. In the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, ALC-0159 is replaced with another PEGylated lipid (1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxyPEG2000). Speculations exist on a possible role for these PEGylated lipids in triggering anaphylaxis. Indeed, such PEGylated nanomedicines have been incriminated as inducing anaphylactic reactions [ [53](#B53-vaccines-09-00221)]. 14. Are COVID-19 Vaccines Causing Deaths? [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00221)]. The medical director of the Norwegian Medicines Agency speculated that common adverse reactions of mRNA vaccines, such as fever, nausea, and diarrhea, may have contributed to fatal outcomes in some of the frail patients. Some of these individuals, apparently, experienced anaphylaxis, and concerns have been raised about the cause of such allergy and anaphylaxis [ [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00221)]. Furthermore, the Paul Ehrlich Institute in Germany is investigating 10 deaths shortly after COVID-19 vaccination [ [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00221)]. Whereas no deaths have been reported in the United Kingdom, the country's Medicines and Health care Products Regulatory Agency has expressed concern, and details of all suspected reactions reported, in association with approved COVID-19 vaccines, would be published along with its assessment of the data on a regular basis in the future. The Pfizer and BioNTech are aware of the reported deaths and are working to gather all the relevant information. [57](#B57-vaccines-09-00221)]. 15. Antihistamines, Anti-IgEs, Bronchial Asthma, and COVID-19 Vaccines Specifically, cetirizine decreases interleukin production [ [60](#B60-vaccines-09-00221)]. Antihistamines, apart from their classical action for blocking H1 and H2 receptors, have been identified, recently, as having powerful antiviral properties and inhibit the entry of certain viruses into the target cell [ [61](#B61-vaccines-09-00221), [62](#B62-vaccines-09-00221)]. In a recent report, it was shown that treatment with antihistamines, plus azithromycin in selected cases, may treat COVID-19 and prevent progression to severe disease in elderly patients [ [63](#B63-vaccines-09-00221)]. [64](#B64-vaccines-09-00221)]. It is anticipated that in severely allergic patients, massive doses of antihistamines, as well as Idelalisib, could prevent any severe reactions to the vaccines also. [65](#B65-vaccines-09-00221)]. Additionally, IgEs might be increased in acute myocardial infarction, stable and unstable angina, further correlating with plaque destabilization and severity of acute myocardial infarction [ [66](#B66-vaccines-09-00221)], while elevated IgE levels may be a risk factor for increased cardiovascular mortality [ [67](#B67-vaccines-09-00221)]. Patients may become IgE-sensitized by previous exposure to antigens [ [68](#B68-vaccines-09-00221)], therefore atopic patients could be more vulnerable in the second dose of vaccination. Experimental studies indicate that induction of the autoimmune response is dependent on the plasma concentration of IgE before vaccination. A high concentration of IgE has a negative effect on the induction of autoimmunity, most likely by inducing a B-cell tolerance in the host. Vaccinated subjects with very high IgE concentrations thereby respond poorly to the vaccine [ [69](#B69-vaccines-09-00221)]. Therefore, anti-IgE therapy with monoclonal antibodies will give a better vaccine response and could further prevent allergic reactions. [70](#B70-vaccines-09-00221), [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00221)]. 16. \"There Are More Questions Than Answers\" [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00221)], and our effort as physicians to maintain public confidence and minimize vaccine hesitancy will be crucial. We are aware that any drug, vaccine, medical device, or medical product can induce adverse or allergic reactions. Any uncommon reaction, such as the four cases of Bell's palsy reported in the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine trial group, should be thoroughly investigated, and its cause should be determined [ [68](#B68-vaccines-09-00221)]. - What is the level of immunity after one shot? - Which vaccine component is the culprit? - What happens if the second shot is delayed due to lack of availability? - How long is the immunity duration? - How long is the duration of the vaccination? - When will trials stop in order to have effective vaccines? - How long is the course of the immunity after vaccination? - If you already had COVID-19, should you still get vaccinated? - Are reactions mediated by IgEs? - Once you get vaccinated, can you transmit the virus or still get sick? - Is post-vaccination surveillance and documentation a challenge? - Will we need another vaccination if the virus mutates? - Are the deaths after COVID-19 due to anaphylactic cardiac collapse and Kounis syndrome? 17.
