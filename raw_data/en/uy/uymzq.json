We are exposed to toxins every day. In fact, our bodies produce waste toxins known as endogenous toxins simply by functioning. Our bodies also encounter external (exogenous) toxins, or chemicals made outside the body. Exposure to these toxins can overburden a system's natural ability to detoxify. Why do we need Metabolic Detoxification? Toxins can contribute to: fatigue or difficulty sleeping, indigestion and other temporary gastrointestinal upset, food cravings and weight gain, reduced mental clarity, low libido, skin issues and joint discomfort. What is Metabolic Detoxification? It's a series of natural biochemical processes responsible for clearing toxins from our bodies. In the three-phase process, the body unlocks fat-soluble toxins and converts them to a water-soluble state that is easier for our bodies to remove. We need key nutrients and phytonutrients to support each of these phases. How Do the Three Phases of Metabolic Detoxification Work? Phase I: Unlock The body transforms fat-soluble toxins to an \"unlocked\" state that is more water-soluble, and in many cases, more toxic than its original form. SP Detox Balance delivers key nutrients. Phase II: Neutralize The highly toxic substances produced in Phase I convert to non-toxic molecules and become even more water-soluble. SP Detox Balance delivers key nutrients. Phase III: Eliminate Water-soluble toxins leave cells, and the body eliminates them. SP Detox Balance delivers plant-based fiber to aid toxin elimination. Is Nutrition Important During Metabolic Detoxification? The detoxification system is highly dependent on proper nutrient support for optimal functioning. This product provides significant amounts of protein and key amino acids including those required for conjugation enzymes (phase II enzymes). It's a good source of fiber and magnesium among other vital nutrients. Fasting or poor nutritional support during a detoxification program has many adverse health effects, including decreased energy production, brain fog, mood and sleep difficulties, and a breakdown of lean tissue. Detoxification is an energy-dependent process, and maintenance of adequate energy supply is Program |Day||Servings/Day| |1||1| |2-3||2| Balance Program Guide [View](https://my.standardprocess.com/Products/Literature/SP-Detox-Balance-Program-Guide) SP Detox Balance Flyer [View](https://my.standardprocess.com/Products/Literature/SP-Detox-Balance-Flyer) SP Detox Balance Patient Presentation (Digital Only) [View](https://my.standardprocess.com/Products/Literature/SP-Detox-Patient-Presentation) SP Detox Balance Fact Sheet (Digital Only) [View](https://my.standardprocess.com/Products/Literature/SP-Detox-Balance-Fact-Sheet) Toxicity Questionnaire - online version [View](https://my.standardprocess.com/Standard-Process/Purification-Program/Toxicity) Toxicity Questionnaire - paper version [View](https://my.standardprocess.com/Products/Literature/Toxicity-Questionnaire-(50-sheetspad)) Detoxification Patient Brochure [View](https://my.standardprocess.com/Products/Literature/Detoxification-Patient-Brochure) Detoxification Recipes (Digital Only) [View](https://my.standardprocess.com/Products/Literature/Detox-Recipe) SP Detox Balance - Integrative Medicine Journal Review Article [View](https://my.standardprocess.com/Standard-Process-Document-Library/Handouts/SP-Detox-Balance-Integrative-Medicine-Journal.pdf) Suggested Use: Two heaping scoops in 10-12 ounces water, one to three servings per day, or as directed.
