Let me guess. It's probably your soul/spirit, right? That's exactly what I thought before I learned the real meaning of spiritual life and spiritual practices. Spiritual balance doesn't only encompass your soul, but also the following three things: your mind, body and soul. These three elements are interconnected and by balancing them you achieve spiritual balance. It is about being content in both your material world and spiritual world, which leads to connecting to your true self. In a nutshell, it is about BEING YOURSELF. Spiritual growth doesn't happen overnight. It requires effort, patience and determination. Being spiritual doesn't mean you need to be psychic or have special abilities. We all have a unique spiritual path and our divine mission is to create a balanced life that will help us connect to our true self. Here are some helpful tips on how to achieve spiritual and life balance and some powerful, inspirational quotes that will help you make the best out of this journey called life! 8 Tips To Help You Bring Spiritual Balance To Your Life Meditate Meditation is one of the most powerful [spiritual practices](https://herway.net/life/energy-protection-techniques-spiritual/) that helps you dive into spiritual reality. It is a mind-body practice, the purpose of which is to find peace within yourself. Implement meditation sessions into your daily life and this will bring you closer to achieving spiritual balance. Stay away from making excuses like: I don't have time for that or I don't know how to do it. You do have time for a few minutes of meditating daily and you don't need to be a pro at it (if such a thing even exists). Just sit in the most comfortable position, focus on your breathing and feel the energy circulating through your body. Meditating is about being in the moment, focusing on your five senses and getting rid of any baggage and toxicity. It's about pausing for a moment and celebrating yourself. Healthy diet They say that we are what we think. Therefore, we are what we eat as well. Taking care of your physical body is equally as important as taking care of your mind. A healthy diet directly influences our well-being and all three main elements: our body, mind and soul. Eating healthy food will lift our mood (it even rhymes) and prevent any potential diseases. Both your physical appearance and mindset will flourish because you're getting the right amount of healthy fuel (food) needed to function properly. So, choose what you consume carefully because this influences your whole being and not only the physical aspect. Exercise Just like meditation and healthy diet, exercise is also essential for both our mental and physical health. Regular exercise boosts our endorphins (happy body chemicals), reduces stress, improves sleep, boosts our self-esteem - the list goes on and on. Hit the gym, equip your personal gym (if you have the ability), or simply go out for a walk or go running instead when you don't have much time. The most important thing is that you stay active throughout the week. Constantly sitting at work and driving around in cars (even when we don't really need to) are the main ways we destroy our health and our well-being. Be the change - stay active! Love and respect everyone and everything around you Love and respect are the most powerful emotions in the universe because they are filled with positive vibes. [Share love with your loved ones](https://herway.net/love/unconditional-love-quotes/), animals, strangers, neighbours, colleagues, and so on. Because sharing is caring! Instead of holding grudges, forgive and move on. Love and respect everyone and everything around you regardless of their social status, importance and other factors. Treat everyone with the same level of respect and kindness because this means being at peace with yourself and making the world a better place.

What are [ your goals](https://herway.net/spiritual-goals/) and dreams? Do you want to find a better job, reconnect with a loved one, buy a new car, find a new apartment? Whatever it is, one surefire way of achieving all those things is through visualization. This means imagining that you already have all those things or that you will achieve them.

So, focus on all your goals and dreams and spend a few minutes daily (or whenever you can) visualizing them. You can also put some pictures on the walls to serve as an instant reminder. Connect with nature One of the biggest drawbacks of the modern era is our tendency to spend the majority of our time in the virtual world of social media. Instead of going outside to check the temperature, we do it via our smartphones. Instead of socializing in person, we do it via social networks. We live in a twisted world of toxic values and that is why it is important to connect with the physical world instead of (only) the virtual one. Connect with nature, smell beautiful flowers, breathe fresh air, get your daily dose of vitamin D from the sun and spend as much time as you can outdoors. One thing is sure: We cannot [connect with our true self](https://herway.net/life/not-every-journey-is-about-finding-love/) in the virtual world because everything about it is fake. We create perfect lives on our profiles even though the reality is completely different. We refuse to acknowledge our flaws and imperfections out of fear of being judged or alienated. But, guess what? You are beautiful and special just the way you are. So, don't be afraid to show the world your true colors. Don't be afraid to be natural and connect with nature. We live in the world where our friends turn out to be our biggest enemies and where our enemies turn out to be our friends. There is this constant toxicity in the air and it's really hard to know who your [true friends](https://herway.net/friendship/not-real-bffs-12-true-signs-friendship/) are. By building a healthy social circle, your spiritual center will be stronger because you will get rid of all the negativity and toxicity. So, choose carefully with whom you are spending your time. If their presence doesn't add any value to your life, consider re-evaluating your decision to hang out with them in the first place. Surrounding yourself with inspiring and positive people will help you find spiritual balance and become the best version of yourself. Express yourself Expressing yourself means doing what makes you happy and it can be just about anything: journaling, drawing, dancing, singing, cooking, writing etc. By doing all those things, you are expressing your passions which helps evoke a [spiritual awakening](https://herway.net/spiritual-awakenin/). You are giving a part of yourself and turning it into something palpable and meaningful. There is nothing more powerful than that. 31 Inspirational Spiritual Balance Quotes 1. \"Spiritual balance is the principle that allows the mind to be still.
