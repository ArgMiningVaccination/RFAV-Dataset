PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of peppermint essential oil on recall memory in undergraduate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students.

After participants entered the testing room, a 1 min acclimatization period was given while researchers reminded the participants of the procedures.
