Websites such as YouTube allow anyone to pose as an expert or newsmaker nowadays. It can be frustrating and confusing, particularly when you're simply looking for the facts to answer your questions. Lately, I've been hearing concerns from people about Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) and anaphylaxis, after information they have seen on the Internet, read in the paper and heard on the news. While it's good for people to have questions about H1N1 so they can make informed decisions, it's also important to be careful about what you deem as credible sources of information. Are you going to trust information from an anonymous source on the Internet, or well-documented scientific information backed by research? This column is technical, but I wanted to take this approach so I can thoroughly address the concerns I'm hearing. People need solid, credible information on potential adverse effects related to the HIN1 vaccine. It's important everyone clearly understands that the risks of remaining unimmunized far exceed any potential risks of receiving the H1N1 vaccine. First, I want to talk about Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). A link between GBS and influenza immunization has not been fully proven. Even if there is a link, the risk of contracting GBS after getting the influenza vaccine is, at most, one additional GBS case for every one million doses administered. The fact is, people are at far greater risk of developing GBS after getting the flu than after getting the vaccine. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome is a neurological condition that causes numbness or tingling in toes and fingers. These symptoms can progress over several days with weakness in the arms and legs and, in some people, the disease can further develop into paralysis of the arms and legs. Most patients fully recover from GBS with treatment. GBS is actually quite common. It can be caused by things such as Campylobacter, a common cause of food-borne illness, and certain surgeries. In addition, respiratory viruses, including influenza, can also trigger GBS. About 600 to 700 new cases of GBS are diagnosed each year in Canada -- that's 12 to 14 per week -- and about 30 cases per year in Nova Scotia. I also know people have questions about anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is an acute allergic reaction related to various medications and/or food products. It's not unique to vaccines. Anaphylaxis occurs rapidly, and can be treated successfully, if detected early. This is why we ask people to stay in the clinic for 15 minutes after immunization to be monitored for allergic reactions. Public Health nurses and other vaccine providers are trained to assess and treat cases of possible anaphylaxis. Vaccine safety is a key priority of all immunization programs. As part of the planning for H1N1, the existing monitoring system for adverse events after immunization was enhanced across the country. If an unusual or severe event, possibly related to the H1N1 vaccine, is reported to Public Health, it is thoroughly investigated at a provincial and national level. Measures are in place for appropriate and timely action if there are indications of safety concerns with the vaccine. The HINI vaccine is safe. It works. The risks of getting severely ill or dying from HINI are greater than any potential risks from the HINI vaccine. I encourage all Nova Scotians to get vaccinated, to protect themselves and their families. Staying informed about H1N1 will help keep you healthy this flu season.
