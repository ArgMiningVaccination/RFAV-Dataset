Indication (Amended: 29 January 2014)Vaccination against tuberculosis (TB) disease in adults aged 18 to 50 years, living in a TB endemic region. Rationale for the study and study designRationale for the study The burden of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) disease, particularl y when compounded by Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV)- infection and the emergence of multi- drug resistant (MDR) and extensively -drug resistant strains (XDR), is significant in TB endemic countries/regions. In 2010, approximatel y 40% of TB cases were reported in India and China, of which up to 80% were pulmonary in nature [WHO, 2011]. Africa accounted for a further 24% of cases (of which 25% were in South Africa), with most cases in young adults. Prevention of TB disease is not only preferable to treatment of the disease for public health reasons, but an effective proph ylactic TB vaccine would also lead to a considerable return in health benefits. In TB endemic settings the incidence of pulmonary TB disease is highe r in people wh o have been infected with Mtb as evidenced by a positive Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). For the present first phase II proof-of- concept trial focussing on this IGRA+ adult population maximizes the trial efficiency by increasing the event rate in th e control group. (Amended: 29 January 2014) This Phase IIb study aims at collecting initial efficacy data and gathering further safet y and immunogenicity data on the M72/AS01 Evaccine candidate in adults living in a TB endemic region. (Amended: 29 January 2014) Rationale for the study design This Phase IIb study is designed to evaluate the protective efficacy of the M72/AS01 Ecandidate TB vaccine against definite pulmonary TB disease not associated with HIV - CONFIDENTIAL 115616 (TUBERCULOSIS-018) Protocol Amendment 5 Final 680e97c95ac54ffa4525253412affca36f653fc37 29-JAN-2014CONFIDENTIA L Protocol Amendm ent 5 Final 29-JAN -2014 8infection, versus placebo, following 2 injections given one month apart. The protective efficacy will be evaluated in baseline IGRA positive adults living in a TB endemic region aged 18 -50 years, i.e. in an age range where the incidence of TB is high. (Ame nded: 29 January 2014) This study is an international, multicentre, phase IIb, double -blind, randomized, controlled trial. There will be follow -up for efficacy for up to 3 years after vaccination via regular visits or contacts to screen for possible TB. Subjects will also be asked to recognise signs and symptoms compatible with TB disease and to self -report for clinical evaluation. Subjects with clinical suspicion of pulmonary TB will be assessed with confirmatory diagnostic testing using a Acid MTB/RIF microbiological diagnosed with TB will be referred for TB treatment according to local clinical practice. (Amended: 29 January 2014) The primary objective of this study is to evaluate t he protective efficacy of two doses of the M72/AS01 E candidate vaccine against Definite pulmonary TB disease not associated with HIV- infection , as compared to placebo. To minimize the potential confounding effect of HIV infection in the study population, HIV testing will be performed at screening and only HIV negative subjects will be enrolled. Additionally , when a subject is diagnosed with TB, an HIV test (and pre -test counselling) will be performed to rule out HIV co -infection. When a subject is diagnose d with HIV at the time of TB diagnosis , additional tests will be performed to measure CD4 cell counts to assess the severit y of the infection and decide on the appropriate treatment regimen. HIV- positive subjects will be referred for HIV treatment accordin g to local clinical practice. (Amended: 29 January 2014) Participating sites will use standardised case definitions for efficacy endpoints and a structured approach to case - assessment as outlined in this study protocol will be used . An Independent Da ta Mon itoring Committee (IDMC )has been constituted for this study to perform periodic safet y reviews of the safety data .(Amended: 29 January 2014) CONFIDENTIAL 115616 (TUBERCULOSIS-018) Protocol Amendment 5 Final 680e97c95ac54ffa4525253412affca36f653fc38 29-JAN-2014CONFIDENTIA L 29-JAN -2014 9A sub -cohort of subjects will be selected for specific follow -up for safet y (solicited adverse events [AE] and selected Biochemistry and Complete Blood Count [CBC]) and immunogenicity .Unsolicited AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), potential immune -mediated diseases (pIMDs), AEs leading to withdrawal and pregnancies will be recorded for all subjects. (Am ended: 29 January 2014) Rationale for the use of placebo There is currentl y no established TB vaccine with recognised efficacy in the age range considered for this study . The use of a control group is mandatory for meeting the primary objective. The use of an active vaccine as control has been evaluated but introduces significant unblinding risks as the presentation, schedule or indications are different from the M72/AS01 Evaccine. Objectives (Amended: 29 January 2014)Primary To evaluate the protective efficacy of two doses of the M72/AS01 Ecandidate vaccine against Definite pulmonary TB disease not associated with HIV - infection, meeting the first case definition, as compared to placebo.

INTRODUCTION 1.1. Background TB is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide, leading to ab out1.3million deaths a year [WHO , 2013] . It is estimated that a third of the world's population is infected latently with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacilli. Although not more than 5-20% of infected individuals will beco me ill, the high number of infected people poses a great risk to individuals with reduced immunity who are at a higher risk for TB. The TB burden is compounded by the emergence of multi -drug resistant (MDR) and extensively -drug 8.6million cases were reported in 2012 globally . Most TB cases were in Asia (mainly India and China) andAfrica (58% and 27 % respectively ). Asia refers to the WHO Regions of South -East Asia and the Western Pacific. Of these incident cases, an estimated 1.1 million (13%) were Human Immunod eficiency Virus (HIV) positive [ WHO , 2013 ] .TB is the most common co-existing condition in people who die from Acquired Imm une Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). (Am ended: 29 January 2014 ) Prevention of TB disease is not only preferable to treatment of the disease for public health reasons, but an effective proph ylactic TB vaccine would also lead to a considerable return in health be nefits. Bacille Calmette -Guerin (BCG), the onl y existing vaccine against TB, has been widel y available for several decades. I t is easy and cheap to produce, and when given to neonates or young children it is effective in preventing severe manifestations of disease such as meningeal TB and miliary TB. BCG appears to be less effective in preventing adult -onset TB. Since it became available, more than 3 billion people have received BCG. However , studies have shown that protection against adult pulmonary TB in vaccinated individuals varies between 0 and 80% [Fine, 1995] . Indeed, protection against TB by BCG wanes over time and there is no evidence that it provides pro tection more t han 10 years after vaccination [ Sterne , 1998] . Also, BCG is contraindicated for individuals with impaired immunity including s ymptomatic HIV -infection, where the need to prevent 2004] . Currently , TB is t ypically treated with a combination of antibiotics taken daily for a long period of t ime (6- 12 months) . Compliance is often incomplete, resulting in an increasing incidence of MDR -and XDR -TB. The 'Directl y Observed Treatment S trategy ' (DOTS) programme in TB endemic countries is currently providing treatme nt based on supervised therap y. Drug resistant TB requires a multi- drug combination that is based on drug sensitivity testing results. Injectable drugs may be required and long durations o f treatment may also be needed. Taken together, the development of an efficacious prophylactic vaccine that prevents TB disease and development of active disease in individuals latently infected with Mtb may be the key element for successful control of TB in the long -term.

The candidate vaccine selected for development is M72/AS01 E. M72/AS01 Eis a recombinant fusion protein To date, M72/AS01 Ehas been evaluated in a series of Phase II studies in Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) -negative and -positive adults in South Africa, PPD -positive adults (BCG vaccinated) in The Philippines, healthy BCG vacci nated adolescents in South Africa and HIV -positive adults on Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) in Switzerland. The vaccine was shown to have a clinicall y acceptable safet y profile and was highl y immunogenic producing antigen specific humoral and cellular immun e responses in these populations. In subjects with concurrent Pulmonary TB disease receiving treatment the vaccination seemed to induced a higher incidence of grade 3 injection site reactions; this observation is under futher investigation. (Amended: 29 January 2014) Please refer to the current I nvestigator Brochure for information regarding the pre - clinical and clinical studies and the potential risks and benefits of M72/AS01 E. 1.2. Collaboration between GSK Biologicals and A eras This study isa joint collaboration between GSK Biologicals and Aeras , referred to as \"The Collaboration\" in the remainder of this document . Established in 2003, Aeras is a non -profit biotechnology organization developing new generation tuberculosis vaccines and biologics with the aim of making products that are both efficacious and affordable in order to maximize public health impact. Aeras utilizes its broad capabilities and technologies in collaboration with a global consortium of partners, and has established expertise in vaccine development -from discovery and preclinical development through manufacturing, clinical testing and global regulatory affairs. Aeras' highl y skilled staff consists of nearly 150 in its headquarters in Rockville, Mary land and an additional 16 staff in its office in Cape Town, South Africa. For this study , GSK Biologicals and Aeras are both providing financial support. GSK Biologicals will act as the regulatory sponsor while Aeras personnel are providing operational support for this study on be half of the sponsor . 1.3. Rationale for the study and study design 1.3.1. Rationale for the study The burden of Mtb disease, particularl y when compounded by HIV -infection and the emergence of MDR and XDR strains, is significant in TB endemic countries/regions. In 2010, approximately 40% of TB cases were reported in India and China, of which up to 80% were pulmonary in nature [WHO , 2013] . Africa accounted for a further 24% of cases (of which 25% were in South Africa), w ith most cases in y oung adults. Prevention of TB disease is not only preferable to treatment of the disease for public health reasons, but an effective proph ylactic TB vaccine would also lead to a CONFIDENTIAL 115616 (TUBERCULOSIS-018) Protocol Amendment 5 Final 680e97c95ac54ffa4525253412affca36f653fc335 29-JAN-2014CONFIDENTIA L Protocol Amendm ent -2014 36considerable return in health b enefits. In TB endemic settings the in cidence of clinical TB disease is highest in people who have been infected with Mtb as evidenced by a positive Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). For the present first phase II proof - of-concept trial focussing on t his IGRA+ adult population maximizes the trial efficiency by increasing the event rate in the control group. (Amended: 29 January 2014 ) This Phase IIb study aims at collecting initial efficacy data and gathering further safet y and immunogenicit y data on th e M72/AS01 Evaccine candidate in IGRA+ adults , healthy or with stable chonic medical condition(s), living in a TB endemic region. (Amended: 29 January 2014 ) All study participants may be offered to consent to participate in a second and parallel study Sponsored by AERAS which aim sto collect a supplemental set of pre-and post - vaccination blood samples to constitute a Biobank. After completion of this study this Biobank will serve for investigations into bi ological correlates of risk for TB disease and potentially correlates of protection . Please refer to this separate protocol for further information. (Amended: 29 January 2014 ) 1.3.2. Rationale for the study design This study is designed to evaluate the protective efficacy of the M72/AS01 Ecandidate TB vaccine against definite pulmonary TB disease, versus placebo, following 2 injections given one month apart. The protective efficacy will be evaluated in IGRA+ adults living ina TB endemic region aged 18 -50 years, i.e. in an age range where the incidence of TB is high ( Figure 1).(Amended: 29 January 2014 ) Figure 1 Age-related and sex -related incidence of tuberculosis Age- and gender -related incidence of TBin a hypothetical high tuberculosis incidence community with a large number of children and a low TBincidence community with a relatively small number of children [Donald , 2004] .

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the protective efficacy of two doses of the M 72/AS01 Ecandidate vaccine against definite pulmonary TB disease not associated with HIV -infection , as compared to placebo. To avoid the potential confounding effect ofHIV infection in the study population at baseline, HIV testing will be required to be negative at screening. Additionally , when a subject is diagnosed with TB, an HIV test (and pre -test counselling) will be performed to rule out HIV co -infection. When a subject is diagnosed with HIV at the time of TB diagnosis , additional tests will be perfo rmed to measure CD4 counts to assess the severity of the infection and decide on the appropriate treatment regimen. HIV -positive subjects will be referred for HIV treatment according to local clinical practice. (Amended: 29 January 2014 ) Participating site s will use standardised case definitions for efficacy endpoints and a structured approach to case- assessment as outlined in this study protocol will be used . AnIndependent Da ta Monitoring Committee (IDMC) has been constituted for this study to perform periodic safety reviews of the safety data .(Amended: 29 January 2014) A sub -cohort of subjects will be selected for specific follow -up for safety (solicited adverse e vents (AE) and selected Biochemistry and Complete Blood Count [CBC] ) and immunogenicit y. Unsolicited AEs and l arge swelling reactions, serious adverse events (SAEs), potential immune -mediated diseases (p IMDs) , AEs leading to withdrawal and pregnancies will be recorded for all subjects. (Amended: 29 January 2014) 1.3.3. Rationale for the use of placebo There is currentl y no established TB vaccine with recognised efficacy in the age range considered for this study . The use of a control group is mandatory for meeting the primary objective, i.e. evaluating the protective efficacy of the M72/AS01 Evaccine candidate against definite pulmonary TB disease not associated with HIV- infection . The use of an active vaccine as control has been evaluated but it introduces significant unblinding risks as the presentation, schedule or indications are different fo r vaccines that could have been considered such as: Havrix: 2 doses needed with a minimal 6 months interval, different appearance, and different volume per dose (1 mL) Hepatitis B: 3-dose primary schedule needed, different appearance; 1- dose booster (not registered) required Boostrix : 1-dose booster schedule, different appearance Ditanrix : 3-dose primary schedule needed or 1 -dose for booster, different appearance Cervarix :only indicated in females, different appearance Influenza: not recommended y ear round , 1-dose schedule, different appearance CONFIDENTIAL 115616 (TUBERCULOSIS-018) Protocol Amendment Final 680e97c95ac54ffa4525253412affca36f653fc337 29-JAN-2014CONFIDENTIA L 29-JAN -2014 38Typherix : 1-dose schedule, different appearance When using these vaccines as active control, an additional placebo (double- dummy placebo) would be required to match the dosing schedules of the investigational vaccine and comparator vaccine, in order to maintain the blinding. Therefore, a p lacebo will be used as control. Use of the placebo control and the double -blind, randomised study design, will allow to control for potential biases in the conduct of the study . 2.

ICFswill be submitted to the Ethics Committee for approval prior to implementation. During study visits and contacts, subjects w ill be asked if they have signs or sy mptoms of pulmonary TB. Based on clinical suspicion of TB, and guided by the World Health Organisation (WHO ) signs and sy mptoms algorithm [ WHO , 2009] , they will be required to provide three sputum samples, preferabl y taken in the morning and within one week, to be tested fo r Mtb by Xpert MTB/RIF and microbiological culture. 6.4.1.2. Passive follow -upfor efficacy Subjects will be informed about signs and s ymptoms compatible with TB at the time of Informed Consent and at each visit/contact . At an y time during the stud y, if a subject suspects that he/she has signs and s ymptoms of TB, he/she will be required to self-report to the study centre for clinical evaluation (passive follow -up) and if needed confirmatory testing using Xpert MTB/RI Fand microbiological culture will be done. 6.4.2. Diagnostic procedures for the detection of suspected pulmonary TB During the entire stud y period, when a subject presents with clinical suspicion of pulmonary TB, three respiratory sputum samples, preferabl y taken in the morning, must be collected, within a one week interval, for testing with Xpert MTB/RIF and microbiological culture. If results are negative but clinical suspicion of TB disease persists, the subject will be cared for according to local clinical practice (e.g. treated with non anti -tuberculosis antibiotics) and will be followed up approximat ely two weeks later. If clinical suspicion persists, three additional sputum samples, preferabl y taken in the morning, within a one week interval , will be collected for Xpert MTB/RIF testing and microbiological culture. If TB disease cannot confirmed wi th Xpert MTB/RIF and/or microbiological culture , the subject may be given TB treatment based on other diagnostic tests (e.g. smear microscopy )and the judgement o f the phy sician providing care. Weight of the subject must also be recorded in the subjects' eCRF at the time of TB diagnosis.

Additionally if TB is confirmed a serological test (an d pre -test counselling) for HIV - infection must be performed to rule out HIV co -infection. If the subject is HIV -positive, additional testin g must be performed to measure CD4 cell counts. Diabetes will be screened for by a Hb Ac1 test. (Amended: 29 January 2014) Results of HI V testing , including CD4 cell counts if applicable must be recorded in the subjects' eCRF .(Amended: 29 January 2014) 6.4.3. Diagnostic procedures for suspected extra -pulmonary TB During the entire stud y period, when a subject presents with clinical suspicion of extra - pulmonary TB, a diagnostic procedure must be performed according to local clinical practice and as a minimum, the most recent WHO recommendations in the \"International Standards for TB car e\" should be followed [ WHO , 2006]. The diagnostic procedures performed and their results must be recorded in the subjects' eCRF along with the final diagnosis of the attending ph ysician. Additionally , if extra -pulmonary TB is confirmed, a serological test (and pre -test& post - testcounselling) for HIV -infection must be performed to rule out HIV co -infection must be taken .If the subject is HIV -positive, additional testing must be performed to measure CD4 cell counts.

SAFETY The investigator or site staff is/are responsible for the detection, documentation and reporting of events meeting the criteria and definition of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE ) as provided in this protocol. Each subject will be instructed to contact the investigator immediatel y should they manifest an y signs or s ymptoms they perceive as serious. 9.1. Safet y definitions 9.1.1. Definition of an adverse event An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sig n (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficac y), abuse or misuse. Examples of an AE include: Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational vaccine(s)/product(s) administration even though they may have been present prior to the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either investig ational vaccine(s)/product(s) or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE/SAE). Signs, sy mptoms temporally associated with vaccine administration. Pre-or post - treatment events that occur as a result of protocol- mandated pro cedures (i.e. invasive procedures, modification of subject's previous therapeutic regimen). AEs to be recorded as endpoints (solicited AEs) are described in Section 9.1.3 . All other AEs will be recorded as UNSOLI CITED AEs. If subjects observe any large injection site reaction, they should contact the study personnel and visit the investigator's office for evaluation as soon as possible.

In case of questions or uncertainties, the subject/subject's parent(s)/guardian(s) should contact the investigator by phone and the investigator will determine whether or not a visit should be arranged. The investigator will record detailed information describing the AE on a specific large injection site reaction screen in the eCRF. An SAE report should also be completed if the large injection site reaction meets the def inition of SAE. (Amended: 29 January 2014) Examples of an AE DO NOT include: Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. endoscop y, appendectom y); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE/SAE. Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. social and/or convenience admission to a hospital, admission for routine examination). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or s ymptoms present in a subject prior to the first study vaccination. These events will be recorded in the medical history section of the eCRF . 9.1.2. Definition of a serious adverse event A serious adverse event is any untoward medica l occurrence that: a.Results The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which h ypotheti cally might have caused death, had it been more severe. c.Requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, Note: I n general, hospitalisation signifies that the subject has been admitted at the hospital or emergency ward for observation a nd/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician's office or in an out -patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalisation are also considered AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalisation or fulfils any other serious cr iteria, the event will also be considered CONFIDENTIAL 115616 (TUBERCULOSIS-018) Protocol Amendment 5 Final 680e97c95ac54ffa4525253412affca36f653fc374 29-JAN-2014CONFIDENTIA L Protocol Amendm ent 5 Final 29-JAN -2014 75serious. When in doubt as to whether 'hospitalisation' occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition (known or diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is NOT considered an AE. d.Results in disability /incapacity , OR Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent every day life func tions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e.Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject . Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as im portant medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. Th ese should also be considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation. 9.1.3. Solicited adverse events The following local (injection site) and general AEs will be solicited: Table 20 Solicited adverse events (Amended: 29 January 2014 ) Solicited local (injection site) AEs Solicited general AEs Pain at injection site Fatigue Redness at injection site * Fever Swelling at injection site Respiratory Symptoms Headache Malaise Myalgia *In case the principal investigator or designate is unable to determine the extent of redness on darkly pigmented skin, it will be reported as non -interpretable in the eCRF and Diary Card. Respiratory symptoms include cough, blood in sputum, purulent sputum, shortness of breath or difficulties breathing , chestwall pain Note: Temperature will be recorded in the evening.

Clinical laboratory parameters and other abnormal assessments qualify ing as adverse events or serious adverse events In absence of diagnosis, abnormal laboratory findings (e.g. clinical chemistry , haematology , urinal ysis) or other abnormal assessments that are judged b y the investigator to be clinically significant will be recorded as AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE (refer to Section s9.1.1 and 9.1.2). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are present at baseline and significan tly worsen following the start of the study will a lso be reported as AEs or SAEs.

Time period for detecting and recording adverse events, serious adverse events and pregnancies All AEs starting within 30 day s following administration of each dose of study vaccine/placebo must be recorded into the appropriate section of the eCRF , irrespective of intensity or whether or not they are considered vaccination- related. The time period for collecting and recording SAEs will begin at the first receipt of study vaccine/placebo and will end 180 day sfollowing administration of the last dose of study vaccine/placebo for each subject. See Section 9.3 for instructions on reporting of SAEs. All AEs/SAEs leading to withdrawal from the study will be collected and recorded from the time of the first receipt of study vaccine/placebo. SAEs that are related to the investigational vaccine/product will be collected and recorded from the time of the first receipt of study vaccine/placebo until the subject is discharged from the study . In addition to the above -mentioned reporting requirements and in order to fulfil international reporting obligations, SAEs t hat are related to study participation (i.e. protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, a change from existing therapy ) or are related to a concurrent GSK medication/vaccine will be collected and recorded from the time the subject consents to participat e in the study until she/he is discharged from the study .

Post -Study adverse events and serious adverse events A post -study AE/SAE is defined as any event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE reporting period defined in Table 23. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former stud y participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonabl y related to the investigational vaccine/product, the investigator will promptly notify the Study Contact for Reporting SAEs. 9.2.3. Evaluation of adverse events and serious adverse events 9.2.3.1. Active questioning to detect adverse events and serious adverse events As a consistent method of collecting AEs, the subject should be asked a non -leading question such as: \"Have you felt different in any way since receiving the vaccine or since the previous visit? \" When an AE/ SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory and diagnostics reports) relative to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE in the eCRF . The investigator is not allowed to send photocopies of the subject's medical records to GSK Biologicals instead of appropriatel y completing the eCRF . However, there may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by GSK Biologicals. In this instance, all subject identifiers will be blinded on the copies of the medical records prior to submission to GSK Biologicals. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on signs, s ymptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms. CONFIDENTIAL 115616 (TUBERCULOSIS-018) Amendment Protocol Amendm ent 29-JAN -2014 849.2.3.2.

The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be axillary. The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the stud y. The assessment will be based on the investigator's clinical judgement. CONFIDENTIAL 115616 (TUBERCULOSIS-018) Protocol Amendment 5 Final 680e97c95ac54ffa4525253412affca36f653fc384 29-JAN-2014CONFIDENTIA L Protocol Amendm ent 29-JAN -2014 85The intensity should be a ssigned to one of the following categories: 1 (mild) =An AE which is easil y tolerated b y the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. 2 (moderate) =An AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal every day activities. 3 (severe) =An AE which prevents normal, every day activities In adults, such an AE would, for example, prevent attendance at work and would necessitate the admini stration of corrective therapy . An AE that is assessed as Grad e 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 3 is a category used for rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as 'serious' when it meets one of the pre - defined outcomes as described in Section 9.1.2. 9.2.3.2.2. Assessment of causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational vaccine/ product and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgement to determine the relationship. Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history of the underly ing diseases, concomitant therapy , other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the investigational vaccine/product will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the IB to determine his/her assessment. There may be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal informatio n to include in the initial report to GSK Biologicals. However, it is very important that the investigator alway s makes an assessment of causality for every event prior to submission of the SAE report to GSK Biologicals. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and update the SAE information accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. In case of concomitant administration of multiple vaccines, it may not be possible to determine the causal relationship of general AEs to the individual vaccines administered. The investigator should, therefore, assess whether the AE could be causall y related to vaccination rather than to the individual vaccines . All solicited local (injection site) reactions will be considered causall y related to vaccination. Causality of all other AEs should be assessed by the investigator using the following question: \"Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may h ave been caused by the investigational vaccine/product? \" YES :There is a reasonable possibility that the va ccine(s) contributed to the AE. NO: There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally related to the administration of the study vaccine(s) . There are other, more likel y causes and administration of the study vaccine(s) is not suspected to have contributed to the AE.

Possible contributing factors include: Medical histor y. Other medication. Protocol required procedure. Other procedure not required by the protocol. Lack of efficacy of the vaccine s, if applicable. Erroneous administration. Other cause (specify ). 9.2.3.3. Assessment of outcomes The investigator will assess the outcome of all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the study as: Recovered/resolved. Recovering/resolving. Not Fatal (SAEs onl y). 9.2.3.4. Medically attended visits For each solici ted and unsolicited sy mptom the subject experiences, the subject will be asked if he/she received medical attention defined as hospitalisation, or an otherwise unscheduled visit to or from medical personnel for an y reason, including emergency room visits. This information will be recorded in the eCRF . 9.3. Reporting of serious adverse events, pregnancies, and other events 9.3.1.

Completion and transmission of SAE reports to GSK Biologicals Once an investigator becomes aware that a SAE has occurred in a study subject, the investigator (or designate) must complete the information in the electronic SAE report WITHIN 24 HOURS. The SAE report will always be completed as thoroughly as possible with all available details of the event. Even if the investigator does not have all information regarding a SAE, the report should still be completed within 24 hours. Once additional relevant information is received, the report should be updated WITHIN 24 HOURS. The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial report. 9.3.3.1. Back-up system in case the electronic SAE reporting system does not work If the electronic SAE reporting system does not work, the investigator (or designate) must complete, then date and sign a paper SAE report and fax it to the GSK Biologicals Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance department within 24 hours. This back-up system should only be used if the electronic SAE reporting system is not working and NOT if the system is slow. As soon as the electronic SAE reporting system is working again, the investigator (or designate) must complete the electronic SAE report within 24 hours. The final valid information for regulatory reporting will be the information reported through the electronic SAE reporting system. \u0003 CONFIDENTIAL 115616 (TUBERCULOSIS-018) Protocol Amendment 5 Final 29-JAN -2014 889.3.4. Completion and transmission of pregnancy reports to GSK Biologicals Once the investigator becomes aware that a subject is pregnant, the investigator (or designate) must complete the required information onto the electronic pregnancy report WITHIN 2 WEEKS. Note: Conventionally , the estimated gestational age (EGA) of a pregnancy is dated from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) of the cy cle in which a woman conceives. If the LMP is uncertain or unknown, dating of EGA and the estimated date of delivery (EDD) should be estimated by ultrasound examination and recorded in the pregnancy report. 9.3.5. Reporting of pIMDs to GSK Biologicals Once onset of a new p IMD or exacerbation of a pre -existing pIMD is diagnosed (serious or non- serious) in a stud y subject, the investigator (or designate) must complete the information in the electronic SAE repor t WITHIN 24 HOURS after he/she becomes aware of the diagnosis. A field on the SAE report allows to specify that the event is a pIMD and whether it is serious or non serious. The SAE report will alway s be completed as thoroughl y as possible with all availab le details of the event, in accordance with the pIMD standard questionnaire provided. Even if the investigator does not have all information regarding a pI MD, the report should still be completed within 24 hours. Once additional relevant information is rec eived, the report should be updated WI THIN 24 HOURS. The investigator will alway s provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial report. Refer to Section 9.3.3.1 for back-up s ystem in case the electronic SAE reporting s ystem does not work. 9.3.6. Updating of SA E, pregnancy , and pIMD information after freezing of the subject's eCRF When additional SAE, pregnancy , or p IMD information is receive d after freezing of the subject's eCRF , new or updated information should be recorded on a paper report, with all changes signed and dated by the investigator. The updated report should be faxed to the GSK Biologicals Clinical Safet y and Pharmacovigilance department or to the Study Contact for Reporting SAEs (refer to the Sponsor I nformation Sheet) within the designated reporting time frames specified in Table 25. 9.3.7. Regulatory reporting requirements for serious adverse events The investigator will promptly report all SAEs to GSK in accordance with the procedures detail ed in Section 9.3.1. GSK Biologicals has a legal responsibility to promptly notify , as appropriate, both the local regulatory authorit y and other r egulatory agencies about the safet y of a product under clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by the investigator to the Stud y Contact for Reporting SAEs is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y ofother subjects are met.

Follow -up of adverse events, serious adverse events, and pregnancies 9.4.1. Follow -up of adverse events and serious adverse events 9.4.1.1. Follo w-up during the study After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each subject and provide additional relevant information on the subject's condition to GSK Biologicals (within 24 hours for SAEs; refer to Table 25). All SAEs and pI MDs (serious or non -serious ) documented at a previous visit/contact and designated as not recovered/not resolved or recove ring/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until the end of the study. All AEs documented at a previous visit/contact and designated as not recovered/not resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts unt il 30 days after the last vaccination. 9.4.1.2. Follo w-up after the subject is discharged from the study The investigator will follow subjects: with SAEs, pI MDs (serious or non -serious ), or subjects withdrawn from the study as a result of an AE, until the event has resolved, subsided, stabilised, disappeared, or until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow- up. If the investigator receives additional relevant information on a previousl y reported SAE, he/she will provide this information to GSK Biologicals using a paper SAE and/or pregnancy report as applicable. GSK Biologicals may request that the investigator performs or arranges the conduct of additional clinical examinations/tests and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obliged to assist.

Generally , the follow -up period doesn't need to be longer than six to eight weeks after the estimated date of delivery . Regardless of the reporting period for SAEs for this study , if the pregnancy outcome is a SAE, it should alway s be reported as SAE. 9.5. Treatment of adverse events Treatment of an y AE is at the sole discretion of the investigator and according to current good medical practice. Any medication administered for t he treatment of an AE should be recorded in the subject's eCRF (refer to Section 7.6). 9.6. Unblinding GSK Biologicals' policy (which incorporates ICH E2A guidance, EU Clinical Trial Directive and US Federal Regulations) is to unblind the report of an y SAE which is unexpected and attributable/suspected to be attributable to the investigational vaccine/produ ct, prior to regulatory reporting. The GSK Biologicals' Central Safet y Physician is responsible for unblinding the treatment assignment in accordance with the specified timeframes for expedited reporting of SAEs (refer to Section 9.3.1 ). 9.7. Emergency unblinding Unblinding of a subject's individual treatment code should occur onl y in the case of a medical emergency , or in the event of a serious medical c ondition, when knowledge of the study treatment is essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject, as judged b y the investigator. The emergency unblinding process consists of the automated sy stem SBIR that allows the investigator to have u nrestricted, immediate and direct access to the subject's individual study treatment. The investigator has the option of contacting a GSK Biologicals' On -call Central Safet y Physician (or Backup) if he/she needs medical advice or needs the support of GSK to perform the unblinding (i.e. he/she cannot access the au tomated Internet -based sy stem). Any emergency unblinding must be full y documented by using the Emergency Unblinding Documentation Form, which must be appropriatel y completed by the investigator and sent within 24 hours to GSK Biologicals.

Subject w ithdrawal Withdrawals will not be replaced. 10.2.1. Subject w ithdrawal from the study From an anal ysis perspective, a 'withdrawa l' from the study refers to any subject who did not come back for the concluding visit/was not available for the concluding cont act foreseen in the protocol. All data collected until the date of withdrawal/last contact of the subject will be used for the a nalysis. A subject is considered a 'withdrawal' from the study when no study procedure has occurred, no follow -up has been performed and no further information has been collected for this subject from the date of withdrawal/last contact. Investigators will make an attempt to contact those subjects who do not return for scheduled visits or follow -up by means of phone calls and/or home visits by field workers. Information relative to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF .The investigator will document whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the stud y was made b y the subject himself/herself, or b y the investigator, as well as which of the following possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal: Serious adverse event. Non-serious adverse event. Protocol violation (specify ). Consent withdrawal, not due to an adverse event*. Moved from the stud y area. Lost to follow -up. Other (specify ). *In case a subject is withdrawn from the study because he/she has withdrawn consent, the investigator will document the reason for withdrawal of consent, if specified by the subject, in eCRF .

Investigators will follow subjec ts who are withdrawn from the study as result of a SAE/AE until resolution of the event (see Section 9.4.1.2). 10.2.2. Subject w ithdrawal from investigation al vaccine A 'withdrawal' from the investigational vaccine refers to any subject who does not receive the complete treatment, i.e. when no further planned dose is administered from the date of withdrawal. A subject withdrawn from the investigational vaccin emay not necessarily be withdrawn from the study as further study procedures or follow -up may be performed (safet y or immunogenicit y) if planned in the study protocol. Information relative to premature discontinuation of the investigational vaccine will be documented on the Vaccine Administration screen of the eCRF . The investigator will document whether the decision to discontinue further vaccination/treatment was made b y the subject himself/herself, or by the investigator, as well as which of the f ollowing possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal: Serious adverse event. Non-serious adverse event. Other (specify ). 10.3. Extension study At the end of the stud y (study conclusion visit/contact), the investigator will ask each subject if they are intere sted to participate in a long -term study . If a subject is not interested in participating in the long -term study the reason for refusal will be documented in the subject's eCRF . 10.4. Screen and baseline failures Upon completion of all screening procedures (Ref er to Table 7 ), the investigator, or designee, will review the inclusion/exclusion criteria for each subject. Subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will be schedule d to come for their baseline (Day 0) visit. Their screening information will be recorded on the appropriate screen of eCRF . If the investigator believes there is a reasonable reason to do so, screening procedures (including, but not limited to, the QTF sc reening in the case of an intermediate result) may only be repeated once, either individually or in their entirety.

Determination of sample size The primary objective is to demonstrate that the lower limit of the 90 % CI of vaccine efficacy (VE), obtained from the Cox proportional hazards regression model (VE=1 - estimated hazard ratio) associated to the M72/AS01 Evaccine in preventing first episode s of definite pulmonary TBdisease meeting the first case definition is >0 .(Am ended: 29 January 2014) Using a logrank test with 80% power for a true VE of 70% (hazard ratio of 30% )and a two-sided 10% significance level, the number of cases requir ed for a fixed sample design is21cases , based on the assumption that the hazard rates are proportional .(Am ende d:29 January 2014) To obtain these 21cases in total at final efficacy analy sis, assuming a mean y early attack rate of 0.55% in the control group, 2 years of follow - up for each subject and a rate of loss tofollow -up of 15% due to drop out over the 2 years period, 3506 subjects need to be enrolled based on the logrank test and parameters described above. A planned follow -up time of 3 years for each subject allows to mitigate any lower than expected incidence rate and alternative to achieve a higher precision of the VE estimate at the final analysis.

La boratory reference values will be maintained by the Investigator in the study file and made available to GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals' Global Study Manager prior to study start. Serum preparation Serum for antibody determination will be collected at indicat ed time points. Blood for analysis of antibody responses will be obtained from each volunteer and allowed to clot for 30 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature, and serum will be separated and frozen at - 70C (+/ - 5C) or below until tested. All blood samples will be labelled with the study number and date obtained. Whole blood (by capillary or venous route) should be collected observing appropriate aseptic conditions. I t is recommended that Vacutainer tubes Corvac Sherwood Medical) be used so as to minimize the risk of haemol ysis and to avoid blood cell contamination of the serum when transferring to standard serum tubes. Serology (Antibody responses) Immunogenicit y (antibody le vels) will be determined by evaluating antibody (IgG) responses to M72 as measured using standard ELISA. The enzy me-linked immunoassay (ELISA) utilises antibody and antigen interactions to test for either the presence of specific antibodies or antigens in an unknown sample. The antigens are chosen from the evaluated vaccine based on what is likely to be an immunogenic component. Briefl y, partially purified M72 antigen is pre -coated onto a 96 -well plate. Serum samples are added directly to the plate followed by a secondary anti- human antibody conjugated with an enzy me. The addition of substrate provides a means of detecting the serum antibody that is specific for the antigens in question. Positive control, calibrators are run on each plate in order to assess the relative titre of each test sample. Negative controls are also run on each plate to ensure specificity . The cut -off of the anti -M72 ELISA is defined as 2.8 EU/ mL. The laboratory designated by GSK uses standard and validated techniques and maintains a quality assurance log that outlines the performance of this particular assay over time. Cell-mediated immune response s Stimulation of whole blood After collection, whole blood samples will be stimulated at 37\u00b0C with pool(s) of overlapping peptides coverin g the M72 antigen sequence and with the stimulation controls for 2 hours in the presence of anti- CD28 and anti -CD49d antibodies. Then, cytokine secretion inhibitor (Brefeldin A) will be added for an additional overnight incubation. The day after, red blood cells will be lysed and white blood cells will be washed and fixed prior to cryopreservation and kept in storage for subsequent cy tometry analysis.

Thawed c ells will be stained for surface markers (e.g. CD4+ or CD8+ for T cells) and then fixed. Fixed cells will then be made permeable and stained with labelled cytokine -specific antibody . Cells will then be washed, re -suspended in PBS and anal ysed by the GeneXpert instrument consists of a single -use multi - chambered plastic cartridge preloaded with liquid buffers and ly ophilized reagent beads necessary for sa mple processing, DNA extraction, and hemi- nested real -time PCR. Clinical sputum samples are treated with aNaOH and isopropanol -containing sample reagent (SR). The SR is added at a 2:1 ratio to the sputum sample or sputum pellet and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The treated sample is transferred into the cartridge, the cartridge is loaded into the GeneXpert instrument, and an automatic process completes the remaining assay steps. The assay cartridge also contains l yophilized Bacillus globigii spores which serve as an internal sample processing and PCR control. The spores are automatically resuspende d and processed during the sample processing step, and the resulting B. globigii DNA is amplified during the PCR step. The standard user interface indicates the presence or absence of M. tuberculosis, the presence or absence of RIF resistance, and a semi quantitative estimate of M. tuberculosis concentration (high, medium, low, and very low). Assay s that are negative for M. tuberculosis and also negative for the B. globigii internal control are reported as invalid. The PCR assay amplifies a 192- bp segment o f the M. tuberculosis rpoB gene in a heminested real -time PCR. The internal control heminested B. is multiplexed with the M. tuberculosis assay . M. tuberculosis is detected using five overlapping molecular beacon probes (probes A to E) that are complementary to the entire 81- bp RIF resistance -determining \"core\" region of the wild -type rpoB gene (5, 7, 14). Mutations in the rpoB gene target inhibit hy bridization of one or more of the rpoB - specific molecular beacons, reducing or eliminating the signal from the corresponding probes. M. tuberculosis is identified when at least two of the five rpoB -specific molecular beacons give a positive signal with cy cle threshold (CT) values that are 38 and that differ b y no more than two cy cles. B. globigii DNA is detected when the single B. globigii molecular beacon produces a CT of < 38 cy cles (adapted TB Gold assay For evaluation of Mtb complex infection, whether tuberculosis disease, latent TB infection or past TB infection, the QuantiFERON\u00ae TB Gold In-Tube is an in vitro diagnostic test using peptide cocktails simulating ESAT -6,CFP-10 and TB7.7 proteins to stimulate cells in heparinised whole blood.

At screening, onl y Xpert MTB/RIF testing will be performed if the subject presents with clinical suspicion of pulmonary TB, to rule out definite pulmonary TB disease. If needed, induction of sputum through pertonic 6.6.15. Recording of AEs, SAEs, pregnancies and pIMDs At each vaccination visit, diary cards will be provided to the subjects. A ny unsolicited A Es (i.e. on the day of vaccination and during the next 29 day s) occurring after vaccination will be recorded b y all subjects. The subject s included in the safet y and immune sub- cohort will also record body (axillary ) temperature and any solicited local/general A Es (i.e. on the day of vaccinat ion and during the next 6 days). In case of illiterate subjects, a design ated person (such as a family member or a field worker) may provide assistance to complete the diary cards . The subject will be instructed to return the completed diary card to the investigator at a later visit . In case a di ary card is lost by the subject or he/she is unable to complete the diary card, the safety information should be captured retrospectively using a descriptive interview. This process will be documented by an Internal Operational Procedure (IOP). Please refer to the SPM for further details . 6.7.1. Use of specified study materials When materials are provided by GSK Biologicals \"The Collaboration \", it is MANDATORY that all clinical samples (including serum samples) be collected and stored exclusively using those materials in the appropriate manner. The use of other materials could result in the exclusion of the subject from the ATP anal ysis (See Section 11.5 for the definition of study cohorts/ data sets to be anal ysed). The investigator must ensure that his/her personnel and the laboratory (ies) under his/her supervision comply with this requirement. However, when GSK Biologicals \"The Collaboration \"does not provide material for collecting and storing clinical samples, appropriate materials from the investigator's site must be used.

If the percentage of enrolled subjects excluded from the ATP cohort for anal ysis of efficacy is more than 5%, a second anal ysis base d on the TVC will be performed to complement the primary anal ysis. As a primary anal ysis, vaccine efficacy will be estimated using a frequentist approach. In this analysis, vaccine efficacy is defined as 1- RR where RR is the Poisson rate ratio. The rate in the vaccine group is equal to the number of cases in the vaccine group divided by the follow- up time. The rate in the control group is defined the same way . CIs and p - values will be calculated using the exact method implemented in the Poisson procedure ofthe StatXact package provided b y Cytel.

However, to increase the feasibility and reduce the logistical burden and complexity, the study was re-evaluated to include multiple countries in Africa only. As the incidence rate in Africa (overall incidence rate: 262 per 100.000 population 1) is significantly higher as compared to India (incidence rate: 181 per 100.000 population), a significantly lower number of subjects (4500 versus 7000) will be needed to evaluate the vaccine efficacy (VE). The sample size was recalculated based on the logrank test for comparison of time to first diagnosis of definite pulmonary TB disease: assuming 80% power for a true VE of 70% and a two-sided 5% significance level, 27 cases of definite pulmonary TB disease, meeting the first case definition would be required instead of 28, as previously determined using the Poisson rate ratio. To obtain these 27 cases, using updated estimated yearly attack rates in the control group (Africa only: 0.35% instead of Africa and India combined: 0.29%), a follow-up of 3 years and a loss of follow-up time of 12% due to drop out, 4500 enrolled subjects will be needed. The vaccine efficacy defined as 1-estimated hazard ratio and associated 95% CIs and Wald p value will be derived using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Initially, the number of subjects in the safety and immune sub-cohort was set at 500, equally distributed between India and Africa in order to bridge the immune responses between these populations. As India will no longer be included in the study and the total number of subjects has decreased from 7000 to 4500, the number of subjects to be included in the safety and immune sub-cohort decreased from 500 to 450 subjects (225 subjects in each treatment group).

Assuming a standard deviation of log10(GMT or GM frequency of CD4 T cells expressing at least 2 immune markers) of 0.40, as observed in previous studies, a precision for the 95 % CI for log10(GMT or median frequency of CD4 T cells expressing at least 2 immune markers) of 0.052 or 0.092 will be obtained for a total samples size of 225 subjects vaccinated with M72/AS01 Eor 75 subjects vaccinated with M72/AS01 E/country respectivel y. Cell-mediated immune responses will be evaluated in whole blood samples instead of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), excluding the need for PBMC separation at the investigator's laboratory or central laboratory and decreasing the volume of blood to be collected while obtaining the sa me results . In addition, this study offers the opportunity to evaluate whether the M72/AS01 E candidate vaccine might also provide protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Mtb complex infection, whether tuberculosis disease, latent TB infection or past TB infection, can be detected b y interferon- gamma release assay s (IGRAs), such as (Cellestis), by measuring IFN -release y memory cells in response to Mtb antigens. The QuantiFERON\u00ae TB Gold In Tub e method uses peptide cocktails covering the early secretory antigen target- 7.7 protein sequences to stimulate T cell lymphocy tes. As these proteins are absent from all BCG strains, the test is not confounded b y previous BCG vaccination nor is it confounded b y exposure to most environmental my cobacteria. Although yearly QFTG testing is planned for all subjects included in the safety and immune sub -cohort (N=450) to estimate the exposure to TB during th e study , QFTG testing will also be performed at baseline for all subjects ,at the end of the study (Year 3) for all subjects QFTG -negative at baseline to evaluate the protective efficacy of the candidate vaccine against Mtb infection, as measured by QFTG c onversion. In addition QFTG testing will be performed whenever a subject is diagnosed with TB disease. To avoid trial progression with a vaccine candidate with very low efficacy , an interim efficacy analysis for futility is planned after approximately 10 Xpert MTB/Rif positive pulmonary TB cases in confirmed HIV-negative subjects (approximately 40% of the target events) have accumulated in the modified Total Vaccinated Cohort (TVC)for interim efficacy analysisat least 1 month post dose two. The modified TVC for interim efficacy will include all subjects who received two vaccine doses according to protocol and did not present with TB disease, according to any case definition, before completion of the vaccination phase (up to 1 month post dose 2) without ra ndomisation failure and without wrong replacement. The interim analysis for futility will be performed by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC ) statistician and stopping rules for futility will be defined in the statistical analy sis plan for interim analysis. If the study is stopped for futility , all subjects will be followed up until completion of the safet y follow -up (up to 6 months post dose 2).An interim analysis after accrual of half of the total number of cases i s therefore no longer fores een.

Statistical analy sis during the course of this study will include an interim analy sis (IA) for advanced Phase III preparations and a final efficacy anal ysis futility, i.e. if a too low vaccine e fficacy is observed at the time of the interim analysis, the trial will be stopped for futility. Therefore, no alpha adjustment is needed . Null hy pothesis (H0): Vaccine efficacy in prevention of definite pulmonary TB disease 0% ( interim and final analy sis). Alternative h ypothesis (Ha): Vaccine efficacy in prevention of definite pulmonary TB disease > 0% (interim and final anal ysis). Procedures to maintain the overall t ype I error for the primary objective to 0.05 (two - sided): The two sided Ty pe I error alpha is divided as 0.001 and 0.049 at interim and final analysis, respectively . The study will onl y be fully anal ysed and unblinded earl y if extremely high efficacy is observed at the interim analy sis. Therefore a very small alpha is used for the IA. Using a one-proportion test (Ha: p<0.5) logrank test with 80% power for a true VE of 70% (hazard ratio of 0.3) and a two- sided 5% significance level, the number of cases required for a fixed sample design is 2827 cases, based on t he assumption that the hazard rates are proportional. These results are obtained by the program PASS 2005. To obtain these 2827cases in total at final efficacy anal ysis, using assuming a mean yearly attack rate of 0.29 0.35 % in the control group, 3 y ears of follow -up for each subject and a rate of loss of follow -up time of 1312 % due to drop out over the 3 y ears period, 7000 4500 subjects need to be enrolled based on the logrank test and parameters described above . Sample size considerations for the safety and immune sub- cohort: Approximately 450 subjects will be enrolled in the safety and immune sub -cohort (225 subjects in each treatment group) with up to 150 subjects/contributing country (75 subjects in each treatment group). Assuming a standard dev iation of log10(value*) of 0.40**, as observed in previous studies, a precision for the 95 % CI for log10(value*) of 0.052 or 0.092 will be obtained for a total samples size of 225 subjects vaccinated with M72/AS01 Eor 150 subjects vaccinated with M72/AS01 E/country respectively. Precision of the log10(value*) is equal to half of the with of the 95% CI for log10(value*).

Section 11.8 Analysis of efficacy Vaccine efficacy will be estimated from a Cox proportional hazard regression model (VE=1-hazard ratio) and 95% CIs and Wald p -value will be derived. The primary analysis will be unadjusted but secondary analyses will evaluate the effect of potential covari ates. As a primary anal ysis, vaccine efficacy will be estimated using a frequentist approach. In this anal ysis, vaccine efficacy is defined as 1- RR where RR is the Poisson rate ratio . The rate in the vaccine group is equal to the number of cases in the vaccine group divided by the follow- up time. The rate in the control group is defined the same way . CIs and p- values will be calculated using the exact method implemented in the Poisson procedure of the StatXact package provided b y Cytel. This method is also available in proc genmod when using the exact option. At interim analy sis, the success criterion for the primary objective is the following: The lower limit of the 99.9 % two -sided confidence interval for the VE against first occurrence of definite pulmon ary TB disease, meeting the first case definition, is above 0% (this corresponds to a two- sided alpha of 0.1%). The interim anal ysis for advanced Phase III preparation will be performed after approximately half of the total number of definite pulmonary TB cases, meeting the first case definition, have accumulated in the ATP cohort for efficacy based on data that are as clean as possible. At final efficacy anal ysis, the success criterion for the primary objective is the following: The lower limit of the 95.1 % two -sided confidence interval for the VE against first occurrence of definite pulmonary TB disease, meeting the first case definition is above 0% (this corresponds to a two -sided alpha of 4.9%) . As a secondary anal ysis, the rate ratio will be calculated taking into account country , gender and other co -variables as strata. Kaplan -Meier survival curves for the vaccine and control groups will be pre sented together with p- values f rom the logrank test. If the primary objective is met, the confirmatory secondary objective will be evaluated with the following success criterion: The lower limit of the 95.1 % two -sided confidence interval (CI) for the VE against first occurrence of Definite Xpert MTB/Rif positive pulmonary TB disease not associated with HIV-infection, meeting the second case definition, is above 0%.

The magnitude of the vaccine efficacy will be estimated using C ox regression. For the tertiary efficacy analysis, the analysis will be based on the ATP cohort for analysis of Mtb infection. The vaccine efficacy will be estimated as 1 - the Rate Ratio (RR) where the rate is defined as the number of subjects QFTG -positi ve(converters) at study end divided by the number of subjects QFTG - negative at baseline, in each group. These two proportions will be compared using the Fisher exact test. Section 11.10 The number of subjects with grade 2 Clinical laboratory observati ons abnormalities will be described tabulated . Section 11.12.1 Sequence of analyses An interim efficacy analy sis for futility will be performed after approximately half of the total number of approximately 10 definite Xpert MTB/Rif positive pulmonary TB cases (approximately 40% of the target events) in confirmed HIV -negative subjects , meeting the first case definition, have accumulated in the ATP cohort modified TVC forinterim efficacy analysis , during the efficacy surveillance period starting 1 month post dose 2 (Day 60). If the study is stopped for futility, subjects will continue to be followed -up for safety up to 6 months post dose 2 and a study conclusion visit will be scheduled at the earliest convenient time point. All data (efficacy, safety and immunogenicity) collected up to last subject last visit ( LSLV ) will be cleaned, unblinded and analysed. Analy sis of efficacy will be performed when 2827cases of definite pulmonary TB disease, mee ting the first case definition, have accumulated in the ATP cohort for efficacy , during the efficacy surveillance period starting 1 month post dose 2 (Day 60) or at the latest when all subjects have completed the Month 36 visit. Section 11.12.2 Statistical considerations for interim analyses To start advanced phase III preparations In order to avoid trial progression with a candidate vaccine with very low efficacy, an interim efficacy anal ysis for futility is planned, i.e. if a too low vaccine efficacy is o bserved at the time of the interim analysis, the trial will be stopped for futility. Therefore, no alpha adjustment is needed . ... Stopping rules for futility will be defined in the statistical analysis plan for interim analysis .

QuantiFERON\u00ae TB Gold assay Amended 21 March 2013) For evaluation of Mtb complex infection, whether tuberculosis disease, latent TB infection or past TB infection,, the QuantiFERON\u00ae- TB -Tube be used. QuantiFERON\u00ae -TB Gold In -Tube is an in vitro diagnostic test using peptide cocktails simulating ESAT -6, CFP -10 and TB7.7 proteins to stimulate cells in heparinised whole blood. These proteins are absent from all BCG strains and from most non -tuberculosis mycobacteria with the exception of M. kansarii, M. szulgai and M. marinum. The assay will be performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, blood is collected directly into QuantiFERON\u00ae -TB Gold collection tubes including a Nil Control tube, TB antigen tube and Mitogen Control tube. The tubes should be incubated for 16- 24 hours at 37\u00b0C prior to harvesting plasma. IFN -concentrations in plasma are determined using the QuantiFERON\u00ae- TB Gold ELISA kit.

Investigator Agreement Page Detailed Title A phase IIb, double -blind, randomised, placebo - controlled study to evaluate the efficacy , safety and immunogenicit y of GSK Biologicals' candidate tuberculosis (TB) vaccine GSK 692342 against TB disease, in health y adults aged 18 -50 years, living in a TB endemic region. Synopsis Rationale for the study and study design Rationale for the study In TB endemic settings the incidence of pulmonary TB disease is higher in people who have been infected with Mtb as evidenced by a positive Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). For the present first phase II proof -of-concept trial focussing on this IGRA+ adult population maximizes the trial efficiency by increasing the event rate in the control group. This Phase IIb study aims at collecting initial efficacy data and gathering further safet y and immunogenicit y data on the M72/AS01 Evaccine candidate in health y adults living in a TB endemic region. Rationale for the study design This Phase IIb study is designed to evaluate the protective efficacy of the M72/AS01 E candidate TBvaccine against definite pulmonary TB disease not associated with HIV - infection, versus placebo, following 2 injections given one month apart. The protective efficacy will be evaluated in baseline IGRA positive adults living in a TB endemic reg ion aged 18 -50 years, i.e. in an age range where the incidence of TB is high. This study is an international, multicentre, phase IIb, double -blind, randomized, controlled trial. There will be follow -up for efficacy for approximately up to 3 years after vaccination via regular visits or contacts to screen for possible TB.

It is estimated that a third of the world's population is infected latently with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacilli. Although not more than 105-20% of infected individuals will become ill, the high number of infected people poses a great risk to individuals with reduced immunity who are at a higher risk for TB. The TB burden is compounded by the emergence of multi -drug resistant (MDR) and extensivel y-drug resistant (XDR) TB. Approximately cases TB were reported in 20102012 globall y. Most TB cases were in the South -East Asia region (mainly India and China ),)andAfrica ( 58% and 27 % respectively ). Asia refers to the WHO Regions of South -East Asia and the Western Pacific regions (40%, 24% and 19% respectivel y).Of these incident cases, an estimated 1.1 million (13%) were Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive [ WHO , 20112013]. TB is the most common co - existing condition in people who die from Acquired I mmune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In subjects with concurrent Pulmonary TB disease receiving treatment the vaccination seemed to induced a higher incidence of grade 3 injection site reactions; this observation is under futher investigation. 1.3. Rationale for the study and study design 1.3.1. Rationale for the study The burden of Mtb disease, particularl y when compounded by HIV -infection and the emergence of MDR and XDR strains, is significant in TB endemic countries/regions. In 2010, approximately 40% of TB cases were reported in India and China, of which up to 80% were pulmonary in nature [ WHO,20112013]. In TB endemic settings the incidence of clinical TB disease is highest in people who have been infected with Mtb as evidenced by a positive Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). For the present first phase II proof -of-concept trial focussing on this IGRA+ adult population maximizes the trial efficiency by increasing the event rate in the control group. This Phase IIb study aims at collecting initial efficacy data and gathering further safet y and immunogenicit y data on the M72/AS01E vaccine candidate in IGRA+ healthy adults, or with stable chonic medical condition(s) , living in a TB endemic region. All study participants may be offered to consent to participate in a second and parallel study Sponsored by AERAS which aims to collect a supplemental set of pre -and post - vaccination blood samples to constitute a Biobank. After completion of this study this Biobank will serve for investigations into biological correlates of risk for TB disease and potentially correlates of protection .

Rationale for the study design The protective efficacy will be evaluated in IGRA+ adults living in a TB endemic region aged 18 -50 years, i.e. in an age range where the incidence of tuberculosisTB is high (Figure 1). The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the protective efficacy of two doses of the M72/AS01 Ecandidate vaccine against definite pulmonary TB disease not associated with HIV -infection , as compared to placebo. To minimize avoid the potential confounding effect of HIV prevalence infection in the study population at baseline, HIV testing will be performed required to be negative at screening in regions with a high HIV prevalence (>1%) . An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be has been constituted for this study to perform periodic safet y reviews of the safety data and evaluate the interim efficacy anal ysis. A sub -cohort of subjects will be selected for specific follow- up for safety (solicited adverse events (AE) a nd selected Biochemistry and Complete Blood Count [CBC]) and immunogenicit y. Unsolicited AEs and large swelling reactions , serious adverse events (SAEs), potential immune -mediated diseases (p IMDs), AEs leading to withdrawal and pregnancies will be recorded for all subjects. An IFN -positive T cell response induced by past or present Mtb infection, as measured by the QuantiFERON\u00ae TB Gold (QFTG) assay (Cellestis), will be evaluated at baseline for all subjects, at stud y end (Year 3) for all subjects QFTG -negative at baseline and yearly in safety and immune the sub -cohort. In addition, a QFTG assay will be performed whenever a subject is diagnosed with TB disease. 2. OBJECTIVES 2.1. Primary objective The lower limit of the 95 90% two -sided confidence interval (CI) for the VE (using a Cox regression model) against first occurrence of Definite pulmonary TB disease not associated with HIV-infection, meeting the first case definition, is above 0% 2.2. Secondary objective Efficacy: The lower limit of the 95 90% two -sided confidence interval ( CI) for the VE (using a Cox regression model) against first occurrence of Definite pulmonary TB disease not associated with HIV- infection, meeting the firstsecond case definition, is above 0%. To evaluate the protective efficacy of two doses of the M72/AS01 Ecandidate vaccine against Definite Microbiological pulmonary TB disease meeting the fourth case definition, as compared to placebo.

The primary analysis will be unadjusted but secondary anal yses will evaluate the effect of potential covariates. The lower limit of the 95 90% two -sided confidence interval (CI) for the VE (using a Cox regression model) against first occurrence of Definite pulmonary TB disease not associated with HIV-infection, meeting the first case definition, is above 0% If the primary objective is met, the confirmatory secondary objective will be evaluated with the following success criterion: The lower limit of the 95 90% two -sided confidence interval ( CI) for the VE (using a Cox regression model) against first occurrence of Definite pulmonary TB disease not associated with HIV- infection, meeting the firstsecond case definition, is above 0%.

RNA expression profiling In order to attempt to establish a correlate of risk for acquisition of infection, a sy stems biology approach will be used (refer to Section 6.7.4.2 ). As exploratory , a comprehensive anal ysis of selected subjects' immune responses following vaccination wil l be performed by RNA expression profiling using microarray analysis on whole blood samples . Microarray data will be anal ysed using bioinformatics approaches. The expected outcome of this anal ysis is to arrive at a RNA expression profile signature as a cor relate of risk that could describe non -protective immune responses. Additional outcomes will shed further light on the immune responses induced by the vaccine. Sample selection for microarray anal ysis could be based on the following comparisons: Comparison of profiles of 'Breakthrough' cases, i.e. M72/AS01 Evaccinated subjects with confirmed pulmonary TB meeting the first, second, third or fourth case definition with comparable group of M72/AS01 Evaccinated subjects with no pulmonary TB.

Therefore, no alpha adjustment is needed. The anal ysis will be performed by a statistician external to the investigator group and \"The Collabo ration\" (i.e. from a contract research organisation).

The GSK statistician (and other personnel directly involved in the conduct of the trial) will not have access to the randomisation list and serology data. The efficacy results at interim anal ysis will be looked at by the IDMC in closed session (with prohi bited attendance b y any member of GSK and Aeras and b y any person involved in the conduct of the study ). Stopping rules for futility will be defined in the statistical analy sis plan for interim analysis. 12.1. Remote Data Entry eCRF instructions Remote Data Entry (RDE),Inform , a validated computer application, will be used as the method for data collection. 12.2. Study Monitoring by \"The Collaboration\" GSK and its partners in \"The Collaboration\" will monitor the study to verify that, amongst others, the: Data are authentic, accurate, and complete. Safety and rights of subjects are being protected. Study is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol, any other study agreements, GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements. Direct acce ss to all study -site related and source data is mandatory for the purpose of monitoring review. The monitor will perform a RDEa n eCRF review and a Source Document Verification (SDV). By SDV we understand verifying RDE eCRF entries by comparing them with the source data that will be made available b y the investigator for this purpose . The Source Documentation Agreement Form describes the source data for the different data in the RDE eCRF . This document should be completed and signed b y the site monitor and investigator and should be filed in the monitor's and investigator's study file. Any data item for which the RDE eCRF will serve as the source must be identified, agreed and documented in the source documentation agreement form. For RDE eCRF , the monitor will mark completed and approved screens at each visit. 14. REFERENCES World Health Organisation [WHO], 2011.
