It has been used for thousands of years to treat illnesses as well as for preventative care. From a Western medical perspective, acupuncture can assist the body to heal itself by affecting certain physiologic changes, such as increased blood circulation, decreased inflammation, stimulation of nerves, and release of pain-relieving hormones. Is Acupuncture Painful? The insertion of acupuncture needles by a trained veterinarian is virtually painless. Very fine, small needles are used, and often, once the needles are in place, patients will rest comfortably, sometimes even becoming sleepy! Needles will remain in place for 5-15 minutes, depending on the condition being treated. For dogs, occasionally electroacupuncture may be offered. Electroacupuncture is a form of acupuncture by which a small electric current is passed between two needles, particularly helpful for treating underlying pain, such as arthritis and hip dysplasia. This form of acupuncture is not painful either, but it does require a patient to be able to lie relatively still for 15-20 minutes. Most dogs will take a nap while we do this! Owners are encouraged to be present for their pet's acupuncture session, though not required. What conditions is Acupuncture Indicated for my Dog?
